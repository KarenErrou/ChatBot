	schema:reviewBody "The Taviani Brothers evoke the mystery drama and stark beauty of Sicily in this wondrous threehour film with its four earthy stories and sublime epilogue.  In The Other Son a demented Sicilian mother Margarita Lozano longs to hear from her sons who have emigrated to American and forgotten her. Memories of a traumatic rape experience as a young woman prevent her from being able to accept the love of her only devoted son who follows her around with his cows. Moon Sickness tells about a young bride who discovers that her husband likes to howl at the full moon. She is not without an erotic moonsickness of her own which makes her crave sex wit her cousin when the husband is unable to perform his marital duties. The Jar features comedians Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia in a classic comic narrative about a mean  landowner's large broken olive jar and the jarmender who gets trapped inside and their ensuing battle of wits. Requiem deals with rural shepherds who want to have a graveyard to bury thir dead.  In the epilogue Conversation with Mother we see playwrightstoryteller Luigi Pirandello returning to his native Sicilian town after years of success on the mainland.  He encounters the spirit of his mother who recounts a fabulous fairytale journey taken when she had been a child. It is a stunning twentyminute sequence that must surely rank with the best moments in the history of Italian cinema. The images of the children rolling down the mountain of pumice on the Pumice Island are of a poetic lyric intensity. The shot of Pirandello sitting silently in the chair that no longer contains the mother he had been speaking to is also utterly moving. Nicola Piovani's passionate and transporting musical score he would later do the music for LIFE IS BEAUTIFULadds immeasurably to the the experience of this powerful work of art.".

But I don't think there is a clear explanation or important message in any of the stories either in contrast with Kobayashi's Kwaidan 1964 which consists clearly of four stories about ghosts.  Kaos seems to deal with family or legacy in general.  There are five fairytales from Luigi Pirandello about ordinary people and the curious small worlds or illusions they find themselves in.  I'm not going to reveal exactly what happens in the stories.  It's just fantastic and a little nostalgic to watch the strange events and behaviour of different people for three hours without fancy special FX.  Credit to cinematographer Giuseppe Lanci Nostalghia 1983 and composer Nicola Piovani of course who did a surpassing job.  The performances of the actors are great and never overdone.  That wouldn't be appropriate for such a sober work of cinema that could have taken place 200 years ago.  It may be not an important film but it IS unforgettable timeless and will become one of your personal favourites.10 points out of 10 ".

The first one L'Altro Figlio is the strongest one emotionally but it's also quite predictable after a point you will guess why the mother has denounced her other son before it is revealed. The second Mal Di Luna has an intriguing premise but goes pretty much nowhere with it when it's over we're back to where we started. The third La Giara is surprisingly my favorite it's too slowly paced to work as a comedy but it works better as an allegory and it builds to an exhilarating musical sequence that is better seen than described. Besides it's fascinating to watch the famous Italian comic duo Franco and Ciccio both noticeably older acting more mature than you may have ever seen them before! The fourth tale Requiem is frankly tedious and the weakest of the five. The epilogue Colloquio Con La Madre is the part I was most looking forward to mainly because of Pauline Kael's description of it as a fullblown epiphany that sends you out dazed and happy. It takes quite some time to reach to that point but yes the way this story captures a lifedefining moment of sheer happiness will stay in my mind for a long time.

I think it transgresses the boundaries of the art of film and confronts the viewer with the essential void and the chaos of the world. And does that from the place from which the human civilization entered the world but which is almost deserted and alone in front of the great blue abyss. That place is isolated and cruel but also full of uniquely intense life and nostalgic beauty. The music is perfect and the light is as it should be sharp and devastating. Don't miss this one if you have the opportunity to see it! One of the movies which change your view on the world.".

The first one L'otro Figlio or The Other Son was a sad story but I really liked it.  The main character for this segment Mariagracia gave a riveting performance.The second story Mal di Luna or Moon Sickness is a werewolf story.  This is where the movie starts to get a bit bizarre.  Newlyweds Sidora and Bata live in the sicilian countryside and every full moon Bata is enchanted by the moon and it rules him.  He howls and barks like a wolf and it causes him great pain.  Sidora totally freaks out and doesn't stand by him at all...The third story La Giara or The Jar is extremely bizarre but I found it entertaining.  This guy named Don Lollo who looks like what Mick Jagger would look like if he were an Italian man acquires this huge clay jar that the town will put olive oil in.  One night they come out and it's broken into 2 pieces.  As a result Don Lollo hires this eccentric potter to come fix this jar with his magic glue  After a long series of events the mad potter gets stuck inside the jar.  It ends up being pretty funny...All in all I liked it.  I think the editing between stories could've used a little work but overall I thought the settings seemed very realistic.  I really like the creative shots that the movie had.  Most of the people seem like real sicilian people not just random actors.I will rate it 8 out of 10   ".

This is not by any means a bad movie but it does have some shortcomings that marred the overall impression for me.Among the movie's strengths are its high production values as evidenced by the gorgeous photography including wonderful aerial shots of mountainous crags and deep valleys meticulously assembled locations invoking the poverty of the region so perfectly that they must have cost a lot of money and the lovely music that punctuates and provides transitions among the various stories. It's obvious that this is a team that spared no expense or effort to create the best film they could.The movie's primary weakness and it is not a small one is that the stories are neither particularly engrossing nor are they told in a way that creates any real suspense for the viewer including the viewer who has read not one word of Pirandello. The script blends humor and pathos in an interesting way but somehow there isn't much depth to the performances all of which are competent if not electrifying.Joined to the weakness of the stories one must also note the bloated length of the movie. There are doubtless many ways that this film could have been edited down into something less unwieldy but none of them seem to have been given any real consideration in the design or execution of Kaos. Thus we are left with an endurance test of sorts  one which dilutes rather than strengthening the overall impact of the movie.People who have been ordered by their physicians to avoid stress at all costs will find this gentle and attractive movie easy to watch those who yearn for stronger tighter and more challenging stuff on their screens will not be overly impressed by Kaos.".

	schema:reviewBody "Four Pirandello stories and an original epilogue form a portrait of Sicily linked by the flight of a raven  bird of ill omen  over the landscape with a tinkling bell around its neck. The filmmaking is perfect in its calm effortlessness and quiet simplicity always finding the essence of a situation. Often the camera makes small revealing horizontal pans then pans back and reveals again as the first subject has changed.Every episode is infused with a sympathy for whatever simple inescapable sorrow everyone is afflicted with  peasants grandees men in uniform  which often seems to seep into them from the land. Even the happiest character in the film  a lawyer  is in bed recovering from an operation. Each story has layers of meaning and a melancholy twist  even the comedic episode finishes on a note of tragedy.The first story opens as the country is being drained of its men  they're off the America  leaving the parched landscape to the sullen women. An interesting moral dilemma is raised how if a woman is raped by her husband's murderer and has a child which grows up to look exactly like its father? The bitter irreconcilability stands for the rift between the old land and the new.In the second story possibly the finest a newly married woman discovers that her husband goes berserk wolfman like every full moon. She uses the occasion as an excuse to bring her former lover to her room while her husband rages outside. There's a step forward in the moral arc of the film  reconciliation is possible when you come to understand someone else's suffering.The Jar is remarkable not so much for the diabolic overtones of the hunchback who gets trapped inside the giant olive jar he has just mended as for the surprising bitterness of the landlord whose success is made mockery of by thoughts of death.Death itself is the subject of the fourth story in which an old man sits over his grave and literally waits for it to come in order to lay claim to the land he will be buried in. Since the land on which generations become established becomes in effect composed of the dead there is a subtle moral question of a man's rights here suffused with ghostly mysticism  an issue we have lost sight of in the modern world.The Epilogue is almost too sublime to describe. It may be the most perfect most meaningful 20 minutes ever put on film. In it Pirandello himself weary now of life travels to his childhood home in Sicily drawn by the spirit of his mother. She tells him again the story of the journey into exile by boat when she was a girl only this time filling in some crucial forgotten detail. The span of time held in our mind here is breathtaking  backwards from an old woman long dead who is reflecting on the memory of an intense childhood experience forwards to her son now old himself and aware of his own impending death trying to capture some meaning in it all that is the spark of life knowing that this spark itself will soon go out. The climax to his mother's story  cascading down a white cliff of powdery white pumice into an azure sea is an image so beautiful so mixed of elation and despair that no more words in the film are possible nor necessary.".

He breaks into being the crazed Williams of talk shows only twice and briefly during this film. Otherwise he is convincing as a middleaged car salesman with complicated relationships and the absence of a longterm plan. His excellence at sales isn't limited to cars he can talk many women into bed and that's his downfall.Robbins is also good as a stupid jealous husband with a gun.What's not as good the supporting characters at the car dealership were underwritten. The Chinese restaurant and police captain stuff was awful. I can't stand Fran Drescher and I can't stand her here. If you like her you'll like her here. The dog she's carrying was used too much and I realize the yappiness was supposed to heighten the tension but mostly it made me want to look for my own gun or consider shutting off the DVD. I never did see that his sacrifice during the hostagetaking was fully motivated. Seems drastic to be willing to die just to avoid a stressful day. I did like the character of the exwife and that of the wannabe awful clothes designer girlfriend 2 played well by Lori Petty. Also I liked the bizarre opening scene which is in the middle of a funeral procession. There's a howto writing book I once read that said bring all your characters on stage with their attributes flying. This opening scene did just that so kudos to Ken Friedman.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is funny insightful and alarming all at the same time. This is a synopsis of mostly Italian American life in working class burroughs of NY Queens Long Island whatever. Joey Robin Williams is juggling two neurotic girlfriends and an exwife while struggling to keep his job as a smooth talking car salesman. The movie starts off with a shot of a cemetery in Queens the biggest damn cemetery I have ever seen. It gives you the feeling of crowdedness that even in death people are crowded and are probably still arguing over elbow room. Joey is desperate and even tries to sell a car to a widow as she is burying her husband. Eventually a distraught and somewhat deranged husband of the car dealer's secretary takes over the dealership with a machine gun convinced that somebody there is screwing with his sexy wife which is true. It isn't Joey but he takes the rap and tries to talk the guy down doing a pretty good job. Car salesman becomes psychologist and he does an amazingly good job along with help from a phone call from both his wife and his mother to the distraught man. This is the best part of the movie. You see Joey and Larry Robbins play out this scene with both humor and fright. Larry is trying to prove his manhood to his wife. You understand his plight and feel his pain and at the same time you see the mans compassion especially with the phone calls from Joey's exwife and mother. There is something very real about this scene and I would think that someone who has to talk down a hostage situation might gain something from watching how Joey makes connections with Larry on a personal level. Eventually Larry sees what a mess Joey's life is and starts to see that actually his situation isn't that bad. This movie is as much about the alienation and frustration of modern life as anything else. The movie is loud and frantic and might put you off in that respect but hang with it.".

Knowing Williams' ability to talk he was good for this role. The women in his life are driving him loony too. Some of them aren't much better than him.Tim Robbins plays a similar lowlife who starts the take over the film when he fully loaded with explosives crashes into a car dealership showroom and holds people including his wife hostage. Robbins as in normal for him plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. I guess these nutcase roles come easily to these two actors. Gee I wonder why.There is so much yelling and screaming in this the movie that it will give you a headache. Combine those two screamers with the nasal voice of Fran Drescher and you really have an annoying overthetop cast. This is like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hourand ahalf. This is comedy? No this is lame. In fact for a Robin Williams film to only have a dozen reviews posted here tells you something. It's a far cry from his best movie.".

Though not always funny with Williams carrying it you're guaranteed a good time. In another splendid performance Williams plays a womanizing car salesman who at the start tries to sell an old woman a car who's present one has broken down. Emphasis on broken down here as she was on way with her padres to a funeral so her mood like the others isn't one that brightens. Williams is sort of a sleazebag on the side never missing an opportunity. I really found this movie hugely entertaining where the second half intensifies as Robin's infidelity finally catches up with him as Robbins in a great performance as a nutso comes crashing through his place of work on his motorcycle. Here we really lose the laughs as things quickly become dramatic. Williams has supposedly been doing Robbin's girlfriend Sciorra so a hostage situation develops. Williams has some great lines and again we see a bit of his own dialogue input. I loved the woman at the Chinese restaurant where Williams and his co workers frequent and where the police negotiator and his men set up base oh On the condition they eat. Although people have found this disappointing I really love this film William's character too Joey having ties in with the mafia. The casting is great. Every actor delivers but truthfully Robbins is the acting force here out performing Williams. Robbins is so riveting to watch you don't know what he'll do next. Cadillac Man is definitely worth a view even if it runs low in the laugh expectation ratio but Robbins and Williams are great to watch.".

I felt the film should have focused far more on Williams' and Robbins' characters instead of jumping back and fourth to a bunch of characters in the dealership who I cared far less about. I would have loved a far larger focus on their characters it could have been a two hander the other characters were unnecessary. Great concept poor delivery.

The opening scene where Robin Williams as the car salesman Joey tries to sell a car to woman who is about to bury her husband cracks me up every time I see it. Its clever writing or is Robin ad libbing? and scene setting.For whatever reason Robin is perfectly suited as a car salesman. As another reviewer noted there are not many times when a car salesman gets to be a hero and Robin is terrific. He exudes the I love to sell line despite his nutty life as a quick witted womanizing salesman. He has two girlfriends owes money to a Mafia character and is about to lose his job. All this gets fixed by Tim Robbins Larry taking hostages inside the car dealership where Joey works. But the story itself is secondary to the fun the cast seems to have with the creation of the whole movie. The chemistry between Pamela Reed who plays Robin's ex wife and Robin make for some sizzlingly if that's a word funny interactions. Its almost as though there are little bits of truth hidden inside the lines. Another funny moment comes when the Chinese restaurant staff who serve the SWAT team thats situated across the street from the dealership insist that the police can only use the restaurant if they're going to order food. I've seen this movie many times and I never tire of it!".

He exudes the I love to sell line despite his nutty life as a quick witted womanizing salesman. He has two girlfriends owes money to a Mafia character and is about to lose his job. All this gets fixed by Tim Robbins Larry taking hostages inside the car dealership where Joey works. But the story itself is secondary to the fun the cast seems to have with the creation of the whole movie. The chemistry between Pamela Reed who plays Robin's ex wife and Robin make for some sizzlingly if that's a word funny interactions. Its almost as though there are little bits of truth hidden inside the lines. Another funny moment comes when the Chinese restaurant staff who serve the SWAT team thats situated across the street from the dealership insist that the police can only use the restaurant if they're going to order food. I've seen this movie many times and I never tire of it!";

Who'd have thought that being involved in a hostage situation would be the best thing that ever happened to the guy? It allowed him to prove his worth to those he'd wronged in his life as well as take stock of himself to be a better person. Aaarrr! Usually I would have rolled my eyes at such a notion but I guess I needed SOME kind of reassurance right now that the world isn't a totally crappy place. Even if my catharsis did come from an entirely fictitious sequence of events that could never happen in real life...Whatever that's all the opening up I'll be doing today.

Basically Joey 'Joe' O'Brien Robin Williams  who talks to the audience a little  is a sleazy car salesman trying to sell a car in almost any situation he can find even something like a funeral will do. He is having troubles his exwife Tina Bean's Pamela Reed is demanding cash for maintenance his daughter is missing and he has married Joy Munchack Fran Drescher and single Lila Lori Petty as two mistresses wanting him. But he also has work problems he has two days left to sell twelve cars or lose his job oh and apparently there's a Mob boss he owes or he'll lose his life but I didn't hear that mentioned much. On the day of Joe's deadline a big dealership car sale the dealership is crashed into and off the motorbike comes Larry The Shawshank Redemption's Tim Robbins with an AK47 and some bad marital issues. Larry believes his wife Donna Annabella Sciorra is having an affair and Joe manages to convince him that he is the one doing it and not to harm any of the other hostages. Then the police show up outside guns pointing and Larry being a pretty petrified assailant has no idea of what to say or do to get out of this situation he has put himself in. Joe however is reluctant to help him get him out of it possibly for his own sake as well but never mind he is managing to keep Captain Mason Anthony Powers and the cops calm. Joe is starting to bond with Larry knowing he was pressured himself by so many problems and slowly his persuasion gets the other hostages let out. Eventually all the hostages are out of the dealership until just Joe and Larry are left but the police believe the gun Larry has is still loaded and they mistakenly wound him. In the end Larry is fine and on his way to hospital and Joe reunites with his wife and daughter and drives away as the hero of the day job intact and passing his business card to Captain Mason. Also starring Zack Norman as Harry Munchack Paul Guilfoyle as Little Jack Turgeon Bill Nelson as Big Jack Turgeon Eddie Jones as Benny Mimi Cecchini as Ma Tristine Skyler as Lisa and Judith Hoag as Molly. Williams with his comedic and acting skills manages to make his somewhat sly character very appealing in the situation he is placed Robbins is also very good at being the inexperienced gunman while this isn't hilarious it's certainly a film with some good giggles.

Three doctors stationed for humanitarian help in Kosovo take a detour and get lost Yawn! and then captured by what at first appears to be militia but then turn out to be some evil thugs harvesting organs for a living. Pretty Hostel and Severance but way too serious and uninspired. From the wannabe opening scene introducing a childhood trauma of the female lead to the following arm wrestling scene in a pub you know everything that is coming up and its unfolding in most clichd ways. Like in nearly all latest french horror movies the heroine saves the day and kicks some ass. Anyway... asskicking is not the point here. Most of the movie tries to create a threatening atmosphere of the isolation of the captives in their cells. The evil doc is not missing checking their heartbeat regularly and caring for their wounds but every thug is of course most evil just waiting for a call to cut out organs grotesquely starting with they eyes and make some cash. For two thirds of the movie nearly nothing is happening. You are just watching the captives in their cells growing desperate and plotting botched escapes. Anyway... then you get what you have been waiting for in most uninspired ways except for one creative kill and a nice hide and seek in a corn field. Movie over. I see no character development in this movie I see no creativity in this movie I see no plot in this movie and I see just too little atmosphere and thrill in it to carry it to the end. For the serious tone of the movie its pretty annoying to have the characters act out in most dumb horror clichs by making noise and forgetting to keep the weapons lying around everywhere... At least there was no cellphone without signal here! All in all a big let down amongst all the great horror movies from France in the last years. Just as big a letdown as Vertige last year which at least had some stunning mountain shots and suspenseful mountain climbing scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "So Caged might not fit up there with the other French greats quite so much due to its unoriginal setup which we've all seen before. However this has a twist because it's French! The French tend to do everything right what the Americans do wrong. Caged undeniably has the similar setup and themes to mediocre films like Turistas or Hostel although Hostel is better than Turistas but it manages to keep things incredibly tense and have characters that you can care for so that you actually care about the film itself.Right from the opening you know that Caged is going to be a superior horror as it features a childhood flashback of the main character. American slashertype horror films probably wouldn't bother doing this but it really does help us to get more indepth into the character so we can care about her more. Furthermore it helps that the victims aren't annoyingstupid teenagers or twentysomethings. They're mature adults who you can respect and it's a feature that a lot of slasher films forget to do. I liked all of the main victims and I was sad to see them go because it was clear that they had a strong bond with each other.I also liked how Caged didn't take an awful long time to get into the action. We have just the right time to build up the characters and then we can just sit on the edge of our seat for the rest of it as we see them become crushed! I don't mean that in a vindictive way nasty vindictive and rude rude rude! just in the slasher formula way. In case you don't know the characters get kidnapped by foreigners and are taken to a Martyrslike prison though less hightech where they await there turn to the operating table. There's a great claustrophobic atmosphere as we're not allowed to see the light of day just like they aren't. There's a sense of entrapment and you can't help but root for them to break free.You might think that watching a film where people are caged for the majority would be boring but it's not. The directing and acting are lively enough to keep you focused and become involved with the characters. The film's secondhalf I don't want to spoil anything is also a complete thrill ride! It's highly suspenseful and incredibly tense. I was shouting at my TV and found myself becoming very involved in the narrative even if it does seem familiar! There's also a fair amount of gore to enhance the entertainment value and of course some nasty scenes are put in place which heightens our knowledge of how ballsy French films are.I also really liked the cinematography in Caged too. There were some great long shots of the corridor of cages and the film also had a great look to it which made it feel dirty and raw which is what you want in a horror film. I also really liked the suspenseful directing which keeps you on your toes the whole way through especially the second half. All in all Caged is an unfairly overlooked horror film which oozes style and tension. It's far better than American offerings that generate more profit than this does unfairly I might add! Yes Caged might not be the most original horror film but it's certainly one of the best of its kind and I can't urge you enough to go and seek out this solid tiny gem!".

It is justified how much she loves and cares about children so when she tries to rescue Ana the little girl she is not a super hero but that's what she does. She is a doctor so she knows how to use surgery knives in a very precise way and it is not pure good luck that she does what she does later on in the movie with a surgery knife. Besides that the movie doesn't give anything new. Organ traffickers innocent people being killed and of course only one character the main one and the weakestCarole and a little girl survive. Why can't they ever work together to kill the bad guys and so all of the good ones or most of them survive? It is a good movie if you just wanna jump on your chair a couple of times and get a little bit uncomfortable due to the organs and scared but yet not much.

Yet paradoxically many are very much gentlemen cordial. I liked seeing this in Tareq's character as he put Juliette on a pedestal which you really come to feel she deserves.I also liked how the love story was actually quite innocent and told a story of pure love and appreciation for a fellow human being. It felt like it portrayed exactly those moments of stillness and deep feeling that we only share with select few in our lifetimes. Experiences that we recall with our eyes closed...like secret subtle moments the heart remembers and cherishes.".

Ruba Nadda takes us on a tour of Cairo which flows so well because it appears complete even down to such minute details such as showing street children selling bobby pins a wild motorcycle driver nearly hitting the film's heroine and Egyptian hit songs playing on a taxi's radio. In contrast with the high energy scenes of Cairo's bustling city life are dreamy beautifully composed shots of the city's classical architecture the Egyptian pyramids and The White Desert all which give the impression that they are frozen in time. But the time in Cairo Time is hardly stagnant. The film's stunning images rich music and moving love story about a bored workaholic Canadian married woman whose passion for love and life is awoken by her relationship with a Egyptian man interplay so beautifully that the film appears seamless. Patricia Clarkson Juliette and Alexander Siddig Tareq convincingly play a couple whose professional relationship transforms into a love relationship over time. Both actors show off their fine acting skills by expressing the characters' love for each other through their subtle uses of body language and eye contact. Each views the other as a kind of forbidden fruit yet neither one can hide their desire for the other. The quiet intensity of their passion is almost deafening. Cairo Time works because it does so well what many other contemporary films don't do. It takes you to another place and time one of the main reasons we go to the movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've known Alexander Siddig from playing Dr. Bashir on Star Trek Deep Space Nine. I've seen Patricia Clarkson in Jumanji and Vicky Christina Barcelona. Both these two actors unite to give us a very touching love story set in the background of Cairo.Egypt is a timeless land that has had history's touch upon it even as it enters the new millennium. People's lives are bound to the countryside as well as the old cities modernized with technology. Ruba Nadda a young Canadian film maker has set her newest story in the city of Cairo. It concerns the clash of two very different cultures and how the past and present collide to form such a layered city as Cairo. As well as showing us wonderful scenes within the city we are given exceptional cinematography of the surrounding countryside. The White Desert and the Pyramids stand out etched out in the land seemingly by giants who preceded modern civilization.The film follows Juliette a middleaged woman arriving in Egypt. She would have been with her husband but he is away on a mission for the UN. Her two children have grown up and have moved into adult phases of their lives. She is left to see the city by herself aided by an old friend of her husband's the middleaged Egyptian Tariq a retired policeman who now owns a coffee shop in Cairo. He helps Juliette out of his friendship to the absent Mark and Juliette is intrigued by this softspoken man. Their feelings inevitably grow into affection but the gradual steps taken to that stage is what makes the movie so tender and well made. Juliette's explorations of Cairo and the people that live within its shadow give us a view into the foreign culture that lies waiting to be discovered.If Juliette must carry the movie she is supported by some wellmade characters. Tariq is clearly the prominent of these but there is also Yasmeen the former love interest of Tariq who wants to rekindle the relationship and Kathryn a kindly woman who leads Juliette on a trip in the White Desert outside of the city. And of course there is the ever absent Mark who is continually held away from his wife. To say that this is a sentimental piece that tugs on heartstrings is redundant. However it has a life of its own beyond the stereotypes of the genre brought about by the fantastic chemistry between Patricia Clarkson and Alexander Siddig. The two of them are professional actors and give us a love story that rivals the epic romance Out of Africa or the lowkey Lost in Translation. Ruba Nadda also provides us with a wellwritten script that feels natural to the actors' tongues and the audience's ears. The mood of the film seems whimsical and lighthearted especially during the scenes between the two leads but there is a serious undertone played into the film. Questions are silently presented aimed against such themes as love fidelity culture and loneliness. Both characters are certainly lonely Tariq has isolated himself from those that loved him withdrawing into a kind of politeness that seems to discourage intimacy while Juliette is isolated from her friends her work children and her husband. Both need human contact even as both must come to terms with their lives and what has come out of it all.This small Canadian production has received a number of positive reviews and has also won the Best Canadian Feature Award at the Toronto Film Festival. While I have certainly not seen all the Canadian films this year I can definitely say that this was worthy of such an award. English Canadian cinema is so overshadowed by Hollywood that one wonders if such cinema exists when compared to Quebec's film industry. However once in a while one can find such gems as this production and be content to know that being Canadian means laying claim to truly great films such as this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cairo Time could be the solution to the date movie so subtle and full of empathy it has no time for anything that might embarrass the person you are with and you'll have something to talk about later. I saw it alone for logistical reasons but from the middle of the second row it was quite emersive. I'm no Cairofile all I know is that the place has pyramids and a funny word for the water pipes they smoke. Those things are touched upon but the movie avoids becoming a travelogue. Patricia Clarkson The Green Mile arrives for a vacation with her United Nations honcho husband Mark only to find he isn't there. He'll be busy in Gaza for a while which is never played for a joke although we get the idea that settling things in Gaza could take a while. Alexander Siddig Dr. Bashir from Star Trek Deep Space Nine a former coworker of Mark meets her instead and acts as a guide where he can. He would show her the pyramids right away but she has promised her husband to see them for the first time with him. We might be able to guess where this is heading but the surprise is that scenes that might not read as 2009 ADD generation content is actually loaded and engaging. We are waiting for tea to steep and not getting bored. Clarkson takes on more of a glow as the movie goes on but in the early scenes it is her character Juliette's vulnerability that has our focus. A bunch of random flirtations from guys on the street might be a minor irritant in the USA or Toronto's Annex neighbourhood but here there is a growing sense of jeopardy which reinforces the bubble of trust Siddig's character creates. For another character to burst that bubble by violating the camera frame with a sudden lunge from the teaming masses would be a shame an intrusion of reality. And yet the film is very realistic as to the unexpressed aspect of life that can turn a bland setting into a postcard perfect image depending who you are with. The director Ruba Nadda spoke after the Varsity cinema screening I attended and it is remarkable that amid the strategies needed to pull off this movie she managed to maintain such a subtle focus. It is nice that also Christine Vachon's brand is there as a producer to suggest how subtlety in a movie might even be considered quirky. But it definitely has the patience and quiet faith in detail that mark Ruba Nadda's previous movie Sabah. I would love to read a diary publication about the making of Cairo Time. From content to execution it is apparently a film only Ruba could have made  it has both ethnic trappings with gravitas and an accessible romantic dramatic structure of entertainment.".

He'll be busy in Gaza for a while which is never played for a joke although we get the idea that settling things in Gaza could take a while. Alexander Siddig Dr. Bashir from Star Trek Deep Space Nine a former coworker of Mark meets her instead and acts as a guide where he can. He would show her the pyramids right away but she has promised her husband to see them for the first time with him. We might be able to guess where this is heading but the surprise is that scenes that might not read as 2009 ADD generation content is actually loaded and engaging. We are waiting for tea to steep and not getting bored. Clarkson takes on more of a glow as the movie goes on but in the early scenes it is her character Juliette's vulnerability that has our focus. A bunch of random flirtations from guys on the street might be a minor irritant in the USA or Toronto's Annex neighbourhood but here there is a growing sense of jeopardy which reinforces the bubble of trust Siddig's character creates. For another character to burst that bubble by violating the camera frame with a sudden lunge from the teaming masses would be a shame an intrusion of reality. And yet the film is very realistic as to the unexpressed aspect of life that can turn a bland setting into a postcard perfect image depending who you are with. The director Ruba Nadda spoke after the Varsity cinema screening I attended and it is remarkable that amid the strategies needed to pull off this movie she managed to maintain such a subtle focus. It is nice that also Christine Vachon's brand is there as a producer to suggest how subtlety in a movie might even be considered quirky. But it definitely has the patience and quiet faith in detail that mark Ruba Nadda's previous movie Sabah. I would love to read a diary publication about the making of Cairo Time. From content to execution it is apparently a film only Ruba could have made  it has both ethnic trappings with gravitas and an accessible romantic dramatic structure of entertainment.";

	schema:reviewBody "Qubcois writer and director Ruba Nadda favors stories that deal with love between Muslim and nonMuslim and her latest film CAIRO TIME follows that path  to an extent. According to Nadda she views this film as a 'luscious serene languid romance' a story that crosses two unlikely and emotionally unavailable people who approach momentary bliss in the beauty of Cairo. It is a slow film the type of movie that encourages the viewer to sit back and enjoy an adult romance. Juliette Grant Patricia Clarkson arrives in Cairo for a vacation with her UN employee husband Mark Tom McCamus only to discover that Mark is in Gaza on 'business' she discovers the information from a retired exassistant to Mark Tareq Khalifa Alexander Siddig who offers her honest companionship until Mark returns. Tareq now owns a coffee house and spends his days playing chess. Juliette meets Kathryn Elena Anaya another associate of Mark who offers her company but Juliette prefers to be alone. The magic of Cairo  the smells the muezzin calls to worship the street shops the sunsets  all begin to work on Juliette's lonely mood and she wanders into the city fends off young men's attentions and encounters Tareq in his coffee house a men only club. Tareq offers to show her Cairo especially the pyramids but Juliette says she promised Mark to share those with him. A trip down the Nile and walks in the fascinating city draw Juliette and Tareq together and when the two encounter Yasmeen Amina Annabi a friend and exlover of Tareq the two are invited to Yasmeen's daughter's wedding in Alexandria. Telephone calls from and to Mark reveal that Mark will be delayed in Gaza and after Juliette makes an attempt to travel to Gaza to see Mark and is prevented by the military she returns to Cairo determined to make the best of her extended stay there. She goes to Alexandria with Tareq they enjoy the wedding and when they return to Cairo they mutually decide to visit the pyramids. The magic is there and the longing between them is palpable but as soon as they return Mark appears at the hotel. The Cairo time is over and the viewer is left guessing how the emotions generated by the time and place will play out. Among the many lovely details of this film are views about the gender barriers in the Middle East and the customs of a city that while modern is still a culture of men. As Juliette and Tareq wander the streets of Cairo we recognize subtleties that exist subtleties that director Nadda never forces. The gorgeous cinematography is by Luc Montpellier and the musical score is by Niall Byrne. This film is more a poem than a story a welcome change from the usual youngsteroriented love stories and more of a mature episode of ageless flirtation. Grady Harp August 10".

Unfortunately writerdirector Ruba Nadda provides much more of the latter than the former.This is supposed to be an intimate tale of charm and love in the mesmerizing city of Cairo. Instead it's a torturously slow moving train to nowhere. The two lead characters Tareq and Juliette are well played by Alexander Siddig and Patricia Clarkson. They are not supported by a worthy script. Where was the connection between these two? She makes no effort to contact him until she needs him after being accosted on the street ... where Caucasian women just don't walk alone.I was amazed at how this magazine journalist was so clueless on the way of life in a city she was to visit for 3 weeks. Tareq was more of a tour guide who also happened to be a lonely heart  whether for Juliette or the love of his life who reappears.The driving force seems to be Ms. Nadda's obsession with romance between a Muslim and nonMuslim. If that's the case the film desperately needed more insight into the cultural and religious differences. Instead what we get is a woman who on one hand is willing to risk a dangerous trip to find her missing husband and on the other willing to toss him aside for a new found tour guide.I found little of this believable or rewarding. More substance was needed in the story and the relationship between these two. I enjoy nuanced romance very much when it makes sense see The Remains of the Day. I also enjoy political thrillers where a wife refuses to give up her search for her husband see Missing. What I don't enjoy are movies that think they have earned the right to be important just because they start with an interesting premise.".

If anybody watching this movie doesn't know exactly what's going to happen within a few minutes then they've fallen asleep. And if they've fallen asleep they probably probably had a dream in which people said interesting things to each other and some of the things that took place came as a surprise.On the other hand those of us not lucky enough to fall asleep at least get this much At the end we are rewarded with exactly the ending we expected five minutes in.Yes it's beautiful to look at. If you want to look at pretty shots of Cairo and the pyramids for 90 minutes you might do better to pick up a few postcards and while away the hours looking at them. It would be silly to waste your time doing that of course but it would probably be a better waste of your time than sitting through this tired old movie.Patricia Clarkson may be a very good actress. But she is not a particularly interesting actress at least not in this movie. And she certainly isn't playing a very interesting or compelling person in this movie. She is not helped much by a limpid script or by an uninspired director. There are hundreds of shots in Cairo Time of Patricia Clarkson doing pretty much nothing. Here she is lying in bed. Here she is staring out a window. Here she is walking down a street. She looks blank all the time. It's a profound statement about loneliness in a strange city. It must be awful to be alone in Cairo. But it's probably better to be alone in Cairo than it is to be with Patricia Clarkson in Cairo.There are many long takes of Patricia Clarkson and Alexander Siddig looking at each other. I don't know what they're thinking. I know what I was thinking. I was thinking could we please look at something else now? How about some more pretty shots of the Nile?During much of this movie I found myself wondering how Cairo could be so quiet and sparsely populated. This is not what I'd heard about Cairo. Then it occurred to me that the making of this movie probably sent people running in the other direction. I began to wonder about the poor crew that had to work on this movie. It's bad enough to sit through the long boring scenes in this movie as a viewer. Imagine how excruciating it must have been for the crew who had to endure several takes of some of these dreadfully boring episodes. I feel for anybody who had to endure any scene in this movie more than once.If you want to see a movie about a middle aged woman who unexpectedly falls in love with a man she is ill suited for in a beautiful location then I would suggest summertime starring Katherine Hepburn and Rosanno Brazzi and directed by David Lean and set in Venice. Katherine Hepburn though frequently annoying is a much more interesting and inventive actress. Brazzi was a far more suitable foreigner to fall in love with. David Lean was a director who seemed to be engaged in what he was directing. And Venice is a better actor than Cairo.".

Another subtle scene is the expression on Clarkson's face when she touches the necklace Siddiq gave her. Those who are used to the spitswapping naked buttocks and grunting that pass for romance in most modern films will probably not like Cairo Time. The soundbite generation that probably never read a book written before 1900 and few if any books at all will probably not like the slow pace of this great film.The cinematography is equally wonderful. The glimpse of Cairo portray the seething city as much more beautiful than most would imagine. Lastly pay attention to the music. Juliette's theme the piano music adds so so much to this film and the Arabic music also adds a great dimension.This is not just a chic flick it is a wonderful romance it is great cinema I urge you to curl up with someone special and see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lovely modest turnofthecentury musical featuring Dan Dailey as one of those medicine show con men that seemed to be everywhere in the cinematic wild west with Scatman Crothers as his pal Chet Allen as the little boy he adopts. Douglas Sirk directs this films with a real feel for the period and seems literally to be taking his cues on how to direct this film from Dan Dailey's acting style. Dailey was a conundrum. He never made the top cut of musical stars yet he could sing and dance with the best of them and was a better actor than most. There was a cynicism to everything he did that made him perfect for con man and shifty character roles yet he never found the right one that would enable him to break through especially in his postmusical career. Here he is in very much in his element as he plays the character of Doc Tilbee as both a scamp and a decent guy. That the little boy idolizes him and regards him as a larger than life hero taking Doc's tall tales for the real thing gives a poignancy to the story. Since Doc is himself somewhat of a child he understands the boy instinctively and this helps him grow up a little too.There are some nice songs along the way and real heartbreak as well and both complement the story rather than detract from it and so the movie is all of a piece. This is a perfect film for a lazy summer afternoon or evening. It brings back sweet memories of childhood and when it's over it's hard to believe that the story maybe didn't happen to you that it's part of your life and that you just happened to have forgotten about it. There aren't too many movies you can this this about. The Wizard Of Oz comes to mind. Meet Me At the Fair is in its way almost as memorable.".

	schema:headline " The REAL Porter Farragut and Pirate War.";
	schema:reviewBody "Yankee Buccaneer is based on a historically fictional screenplay hurriedly put together when Errol Flynn hurt himself during the filming of Against All Flags' at Universal and it became apparent that the actor would need considerable time to recuperate. It was decided to utilize the standing sets and personnel and turn out this B picture programmer depicting two of the most famous figures in American Naval history David Porter and David Farragut.As portrayed by Jeff Chandler Porter is a martinet and stickler for regulations who is particularly hard on his first officer David Farragut. As portrayed by Scott Brady Farragut is brash and prone to be insubordinate In real life although both men served in the 1821  1825 War against the Caribbean pirates they did not serve on the same ship and the screenplay about Porter's going undercover as a privateer never happened.Too bad the Tinseltown writers didn't follow real history which would have made a much more interesting story. Farragut born 1801 was actually the adopted son of Porter born 1780 and that's a story in itself. Porter's father David Porter Sr. a Revolutionary War veteran met and befriended another naval veteran Spanishborn Jordi Farragut a former Spanish merchant captain. Suffering from tuberculosis and sunstroke Porter Sr. died as a guest in the Farragut home. In a tragic coincidence Farragut's ScotsIrish wife Elizabeth passed away from yellow fever the very same day.Porter Jr. visited the Farragut family to express his thanks for their care of his father and sympathy for the death of its matriarch. Despite having ten surviving children of his own including six sons Porter Jr. offered to adopt Jordi's seven year old son James Glasgow Farragut. Out of gratitude the young Farragut changed his name to David Farragut. David Porter was already a veteran of the Undeclared War against France the Barbary Pirate War and was first to capture a British ship in the War of 1812. Young Farragut enlisted in the Navy in 1810 at the tender age of nine and was very active during the War of 1812 including being wounded and captured by the British in 1814 off the coast of Chile. The real Porter had the reputation of being a hard drinker and often caroused with friends including renowned writer Washington Irving. In the film however the drinking is left to his chief petty officer played by George Matthews as Porter conveniently looks the other way.After the War of 1812 was over pirate activity literally exploded in the Caribbean. Between 18151823 there were over 3000 documented acts of piracy in the region. Spanish gold was no longer the prime target and commercial goods like sugar rum dyes and coffee were plundered by the corsairs whose chief centers of operation were Puerto Rico Hispaniola and especially Cuba. The pirates some of whom were Americans were a bloodthirsty lot who were not above butchering the passengers as well as the crews of the victim ships. This interruption of the free market affected the American economy to such a point that President Monroe authorized the creation of a West Indian squadron of ships in 1821 to eradicate the problem.Farragut served as a lieutenant during the conflict beginning in 1821 and Porter gave up an influential post to be the Commander of Operations in the Caribbean in 1822. Eradicating the pirates was very difficult because many operated out of coastal swamps and rivers which were too shallow for Porter's bigger ships to navigate. His fleet included sixteen large vessels several of which were financed and outfitted personally by him and five Mosquito ships which he used to pursue the buccaneers into inland waterways. Farragut commanded one of these smaller Mosquito Fleet boats and did not serve on the same boat as Porter as the film depicts.Things did not turn out happily for Porter. American policy dictated that captured pirates not be brought to the U.S. for trial but be turned over to the local government. This frustrated Porter because it was routine for the pirates to bribe their way out of the charges and return to plundering. Even the hero of the Battle of New Orleans Jean Lafitte returned to the Jolly Roger and was released after his capture after paying off a local official. Ironically he was killed on the high seas shortly after by one of his fellow buccaneers.When one of his officers was imprisoned by the local government in the Spanish town of Fajardo Puerto Rico an enraged Porter invaded the town. As Spain was an American ally at the time this was an unsanctioned action and Porter was courtmartialed and suspended.

	onyx:emotionText "Yankee Buccaneer is based on a historically fictional screenplay hurriedly put together when Errol Flynn hurt himself during the filming of Against All Flags' at Universal and it became apparent that the actor would need considerable time to recuperate. It was decided to utilize the standing sets and personnel and turn out this B picture programmer depicting two of the most famous figures in American Naval history David Porter and David Farragut.As portrayed by Jeff Chandler Porter is a martinet and stickler for regulations who is particularly hard on his first officer David Farragut. As portrayed by Scott Brady Farragut is brash and prone to be insubordinate In real life although both men served in the 1821  1825 War against the Caribbean pirates they did not serve on the same ship and the screenplay about Porter's going undercover as a privateer never happened.Too bad the Tinseltown writers didn't follow real history which would have made a much more interesting story. Farragut born 1801 was actually the adopted son of Porter born 1780 and that's a story in itself. Porter's father David Porter Sr. a Revolutionary War veteran met and befriended another naval veteran Spanishborn Jordi Farragut a former Spanish merchant captain. Suffering from tuberculosis and sunstroke Porter Sr. died as a guest in the Farragut home. In a tragic coincidence Farragut's ScotsIrish wife Elizabeth passed away from yellow fever the very same day.Porter Jr. visited the Farragut family to express his thanks for their care of his father and sympathy for the death of its matriarch. Despite having ten surviving children of his own including six sons Porter Jr. offered to adopt Jordi's seven year old son James Glasgow Farragut. Out of gratitude the young Farragut changed his name to David Farragut. David Porter was already a veteran of the Undeclared War against France the Barbary Pirate War and was first to capture a British ship in the War of 1812. Young Farragut enlisted in the Navy in 1810 at the tender age of nine and was very active during the War of 1812 including being wounded and captured by the British in 1814 off the coast of Chile. The real Porter had the reputation of being a hard drinker and often caroused with friends including renowned writer Washington Irving. In the film however the drinking is left to his chief petty officer played by George Matthews as Porter conveniently looks the other way.After the War of 1812 was over pirate activity literally exploded in the Caribbean. Between 18151823 there were over 3000 documented acts of piracy in the region. Spanish gold was no longer the prime target and commercial goods like sugar rum dyes and coffee were plundered by the corsairs whose chief centers of operation were Puerto Rico Hispaniola and especially Cuba. The pirates some of whom were Americans were a bloodthirsty lot who were not above butchering the passengers as well as the crews of the victim ships. This interruption of the free market affected the American economy to such a point that President Monroe authorized the creation of a West Indian squadron of ships in 1821 to eradicate the problem.Farragut served as a lieutenant during the conflict beginning in 1821 and Porter gave up an influential post to be the Commander of Operations in the Caribbean in 1822. Eradicating the pirates was very difficult because many operated out of coastal swamps and rivers which were too shallow for Porter's bigger ships to navigate. His fleet included sixteen large vessels several of which were financed and outfitted personally by him and five Mosquito ships which he used to pursue the buccaneers into inland waterways. Farragut commanded one of these smaller Mosquito Fleet boats and did not serve on the same boat as Porter as the film depicts.Things did not turn out happily for Porter. American policy dictated that captured pirates not be brought to the U.S. for trial but be turned over to the local government. This frustrated Porter because it was routine for the pirates to bribe their way out of the charges and return to plundering. Even the hero of the Battle of New Orleans Jean Lafitte returned to the Jolly Roger and was released after his capture after paying off a local official. Ironically he was killed on the high seas shortly after by one of his fellow buccaneers.When one of his officers was imprisoned by the local government in the Spanish town of Fajardo Puerto Rico an enraged Porter invaded the town. As Spain was an American ally at the time this was an unsanctioned action and Porter was courtmartialed and suspended. In the film Porter forces a duplicitous Spanish envoy to walk the plank in order to get evidence of his collusion with the pirates and the film ends with his anticipation of being courtmartialed for these actions not the invasion of Fajardo.A disgruntled Porter resigned to become commanderinchief of the Mexican Navy 18261829 but subsequently repatriated himself upon his return to the States and was appointed Minister of the Barbary States. He died in 1843 aged 63 while serving as Ambassador to Turkey.David Farragut his adopted son and namesake served honorably during the Mexican War and was the North's greatest naval hero of the Civil War.

Not only is the story filled with a ton of plot holes deeper than the Atlantic itself it never gets past old pirate movie clichs and a sense of confusion that even with a few tense moments only makes me say Huh?. It has an opportunity to take off a bit when they land on a Caribbean island filled with deadly natives but it's only a brief plot twist to bring on the unnecessary character played by Susan Bal. The characterizations played by the leads never quite ring true and as handsome as Chandler is he's never allowed to express any real emotion or have any humor.

Del Prado then requests that he be taken ashore and released. Porter says OK but not until they reach Chalreston S.C.! This is a sampling of the outrageous historical and political license assumed in screen writing this hurriedly concocted yarn while waiting for Flynn's broken ankle to heal so that another pirate yarn could be finished. As others have pointed out David Porter and David Farragut two very famous 19th century US naval officers were very connected personally but not in the manner dramatized in this film.A Portuguese man o' war in the Caribbean which lacked any Portuguese colonies allied with the Spanish governor and Spanish pirates?? I don't think so! True Portugal had been in a state of political turmoil since the French invasion and had moved it's empire capital from Lisbon to Rio during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Brazil had recently declared its independence just after the royal family moved back to Lisbon but they were not at war with each other. A beautiful young Brazilian countessSuzan Ball marooned by the Spanish governor on a small island well occupied by Native Americans off the Mosquitoe coast of Central America?? I don't think so! She should have been dead of malaria or yellow fever etc by then!This is one of those films where the dramatic leading man and the romantic leading man are not the same. In this case the exceptionally tall Jeff Chandler as the older Captain Porter is the dramatic lead while the younger Scott Brady as the recent midshipman graduate Lt. David Farragut is the romantic lead. The prematurely graying Chandler gave it a shot but evidently was considered too old by Margarita. Ball and Brady had a previous romantic relationship resulting from being cast in another film. Neither Chandler nor Brady come across to me as being especially charismatic action actors. Of the 4 Universal pirate films included in their current DVD offering this is certainly my least favoriteand the only loser for several reasons this being one. Suzan Ball cousin of Lucille Ball whose new TV sitcom was a big hit when this film was being made certainly came across as a believable beautiful Portuguese princess. As in War Arrow her character was quite adamant in demanding respect from the men. However she wasn't as much fun as Yvonne de Carlo in Buccaneer's Girl nor Maureen O'Hara  in Against all Flags. Unfortunately she would succumb to cancer at age 21 but not before playing Chief Crazy Horse's wifeShe mostly played ethnics Although she was married at the time her real love seems to have been the married Anthony Quinn with whom she had a previous affair.This is a pirate yarn in which we never encounter a real classic pirate or pirate ship! Such are only talked about. The only near naval battle is between Captain Porter's ship and the Portugues Man o' War. All the other several skirmishes take place on land. This includes the capture of Farragut by the Native American friends of Countess Margarita the capture of Farragut's landing party by Del Prado's soldiers near the governor's palacefort in Havanna and the subsequent sword fight between the Porterled rescue party and Del Prado's soldiers. In this last action we have US navy personnel impersonating pirates capture a bunch of Del Predo's sentries then don their uniforms and impersonate them at the changing of the guard in order to gain easy entry through the gates into the governor's palace.Like Suzan Ball Joseph Calleia who plays Del Prado started his entertainment career as a singer but was transformed by Hollywood into a typecast heavy often a mobster. He was a native of Malta a small island near Sicily.George Mathews plays chief Petty Officer Link whose role is rather similar to that of the first mate in many pirate films. Link usually accompanied Farragut in his several landing parties. A running gag is his often frustrated fondness for alcoholic drinks. At one pointit's reported that scurvy is breaking out among the crew. Lacking any vegetable sources of vitamin C Porter orders the crew to imbibe some rum as a 'tonic'. This was a popular but quite ineffective remedy for centuries. The Chinese typically took green tea on their long voyages which was effective and also had a good shelf life. The limes that the British eventually adopted were effective but the acidity was hard on the sailor's teeth which they needed to chew the hardtack given them.".

The Braganza family was exiled to Brazil during the Napoleonic Wars which is a whole film in itself but not terribly germane to the plot here. Anyway Joseph Calleia is a Spanish governor of one of the few islands in the Caribbean left to Spain.

A Technicolor production with the Music scored by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Russell Metty.In 1872 the long bitter war fought between the United States Cavalry troops and Apache bands led by Cochise came to an end. The peace treaty signed by Cochise and General Howard brought peace to the Arizona Territory. But three years later the mighty leader of the Chiricahua Apaches grew ill and come to the end of his days........the torch was passed to his first born son Taza who wants to follows his father's ideals and peace brokering ways. His second born son Naiche however has different ideas as does the mighty Geronimo.....Douglas Sirk's only venture into the Western realm was originally shot in 3D around the gorgeous Arches National Monument Park. Following the proIndian theme that was becoming a feature of 1950s Westerns it's a film that suffers primarily because of the casting of none Native Americans in the important character roles. Which is a shame because it's a gorgeous production that features action scenes full of vim and vigour. Story isn't out of the ordinary and the dialogue is often clunky as the Indian chatter is of the Hollywoodisation kind. Yet picture is never dull the interest is always held as Taza attempts to hold on to peace for his people whilst simultaneously he's trying to court the hand of Oona Rush against the wishes of her father the war mongering Grey Eagle Ankrum.Hudson badly cast as he is can't be faulted for commitment in the title role. He clearly feels at ease working for Sirk it was a coupling that would work together on a total of 9 movies and at least he has the physicality for such a character. Unlike Ian MacDonald as Geronimo who looks too old is too staid and sticks out like a sore thumb. Russell Metty's photography is top draw both in capturing gorgeous frames of the locale and in choice of colour lenses. Skinner provides a breezy if standard Indian tinted Western musical score and Sirk's direction is simple and effective with only minimal 3D moments part of the action. It's hardly an essential picture in the pantheon of proIndian Westerns but it's better than it has a right to be and with Pegasus' DVD release providing a lovely print this is worth seeking out if only for Russell Metty's fine work. 6.510".

The apaches seem to actually be in typical apache wickiups an in the Arizona desert. He knows that the whites must be Accomodated and his people must accept the changes coming whether they want them or not. there is a lot of action including a terrific apache vs. cavalry massacre led by taza so he's no wimp an just as much a warrior as his father. An investment for a long nonstock footage fight showed that heyday of the western included plenty of shooting and a massacre not hinted at but shown. The bad apaches kill some settlers an here is a typical 3d arrow coming out of the screen effect. eventually taza becomes a respected and accepted Indian chief  an foils the bad Indians who won't bend with the winds of change. It was very sympathetic to the Indians but had a large scale Indians vs. cavalry scene for the action and danger of the westshowing Indians were a power to be reckoned with. I am part Shawnee and have to set this as one of several 50's films that was sympathetic to the Indians and the their situations plus lotsa shooting an whooping cause the Indians fought as well as negotiated. not quite in the john ford category or near the movie experience of the Searchers but well worth the price of admission in the 50's and will entertain today. Rock was learning his craft an carried the movie well as a nonIndian acting in a good part.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is wellfamed and Rock Hudson looked great  as he always did even to nongay men. The long hair and darkened skin make him an awesome looking Indian. His Features are White but this was more often the case in Hollywood movies about Indians than roles of Indians played by real Indians. It is Ironic that Taza's son became an actor and acted in early westerns.. I learned this fact by IMDb. I shall use it in my future writing.No It took 45 yrs to force Geronimo to Surrender and his legend is founded largely on the fact that he was never caught but due to many of his own warriors becoming scouts he was forced to surrender. It is sad but in a very harsh wayjust punishment that these scouts were stripped of their roles as Scouts and sent to the same prison where Geronimo was. They served much longer sentences than what they were given. This is yet another unfairness done to the APACHE and to Geronimo. Who died in his mideighties from alcoholism and from falling from his horse on the way home from a saloon. HE wound up in a irrigation ditch all night and caught pneumonia as a result and died shortly after. Not a fitting end for a man that could raise the back of the hair on many a settler and many a cavalry soldier who had to think about his chances of surviving a battle with him. He almost beat the US armybut alcoholism is a disease that killed far more Indians than cavalry soldiers ever did. The Native American had NO time in their history to develop a resistance to the effects of alcoholboth the immediate effects and the longterm effects shortened the lives of most Native Americans who drank it. In the much later movie GERONIMO starring Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall the camera takes us on the long train ride to Florida in the end of the movie. Some Apaches who did not become traitors to Geronimo were being chastised by loyal warriors and Geronimo reminds them that they are so few that it would be good for them to learn to get a long he reminds them that all they have is each other.Geronimo was a name that leaps off of the pages even now but in his lifetime anything written about him was read immediately because it was usually news about his ongoing exploits. It is very sad that they allow the mistake of saying that he was captured to be stated as truth among his own people. Because the fact that he was not captured or killed even though the forces used to find and arrest or kill him were massive is a testimonial to the skill of the Apache and to Geronimo himself. I believe the final number that surrendered was under 100. However I would not want to be a settler and live anywhere Near where that 100 Apache were running free. They were intelligent skilled warriors and Geronimo has been called a tactical genius. Since he was NEVER captured that must be true.I must clarify I do not believe that Geronimo Was EVER actually Captured He did surrender twice and after the second surrender he was sent to prison in Florida. He was treated with respect by white soldiers with high level rank and other Apache though that respect from White Generals did deteriorate he was NEVER just dismissed by his peers. This movie shows that happening again and again. This is tragic for the Apache was never really conquered and to say that he was cheats him of the truth. Entire Armies were sent against them but they were NOT actually beaten in the common sense of the word. IF I was an Apache I would want that fact to remain clear and would be angered by a sloppy screenplay from Hollywood that disputes the truth of the Apache's wartime accomplishments. They have never been equalled. Warren E.Justice".

	schema:reviewBody "When all is said and done the picture is pretty much an all out cowboys and Indians story though the cowboys are replaced by the U.S. Cavalry. As in the majority of these Westerns of the Fifties Native American characters are portrayed by white actors an issue I don't particularly have a problem with like a lot of folks seem to. At the time Rock Hudson would not have been such a well known personality so his casting here seemed OK. However with the hindsight of over sixty years since the film was made his celebrity was a bit of a distraction for this viewer.I'll say this though even though Hudson was cast for his physique and manly good looks you can't deny one aspect of his role as Taza Son of Cochise. Twice in the picture he mounted his horse by virtually high jumping onto the animal's back from a standing position. The first was right after burying his father Cochise Jeff Chandler the second time was while preparing to lead his warriors against the Cavalry. The move is actually pretty cool watch for it.Speaking of Chandler's Cochise in his death scene he didn't appear to be much older than his sons Taza and Naiche Rex Reason. So much so that I had to check at the time of filming Chandler would have been about seven years older than Hudson and ten years older than Reason. Not a big deal since he wasn't on screen that long but it was noticeable nevertheless.As far as the story goes Taza plans to follow his father's dying wish that he keep the peace with the White Man but events and a reluctant brother thwart his efforts to reign in Mogolan Apache Chief Geronimo Ian MacDonald and his prospective fatherinlaw Grey Eagle Morris Ankrum. Moving his tribe to the San Carlos Indian Reservation Taza eventually sides with his native brothers to oppose the Army after General George Crook Robert Burton refuses to authorize reservation police to pursue and deal with Geronimo.There's a fairly exciting battle between the Apaches and the Cavalry to close out the story but if you keep a close eye on things you'll note a couple of filming errors. Captain Burnett Gregg Palmer shoots an Apache at the top of a cliff who clutches his chest but when the Indian's hands fall away there's no hint of a bullet wound or blood. The same thing occurs when Burnett shoots Grey eagle shortly after. That's probably something you'd call an unforced error or saving a few bucks on makeup.".

Moving his tribe to the San Carlos Indian Reservation Taza eventually sides with his native brothers to oppose the Army after General George Crook Robert Burton refuses to authorize reservation police to pursue and deal with Geronimo.There's a fairly exciting battle between the Apaches and the Cavalry to close out the story but if you keep a close eye on things you'll note a couple of filming errors. Captain Burnett Gregg Palmer shoots an Apache at the top of a cliff who clutches his chest but when the Indian's hands fall away there's no hint of a bullet wound or blood. The same thing occurs when Burnett shoots Grey eagle shortly after. That's probably something you'd call an unforced error or saving a few bucks on makeup.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rock Hudson Jeff Chandler Rex Reason Ian MacDonald Barbara Rush...all not exactly AmericanIndian sounding names! Yet all these folks are all painted up in Taza Son of Cochise to play just such roleswhich represents the single biggest problem with this movie. Not only aren't they Indians they hardly look like them and give the film a certain silliness you can't get past. And even if the actors had done great jobs in their parts which they hadn't this isn't enough to overcome this problem. However for me this is EXACTLY why I watched the filmbecause it was so unbelievably cast! Yes folks I AM a glutton for punishment. And is there something worth watching here? The film begins with Chief Cochise's death. His son Taza Hudson vows to keep the peacewhereas his hotheaded son Naiche Reason is determined to destroy the white folks. However after their big showdown in which Taza kicks the snot out of him some other renegades sneak in and set Naiche free. So it's up to our hero Taza to find his wicked brother and maintain the peace. But even when he does it might be too late for him and his peopleespecially when Geronimo is sent to live on Taza's reservation.As for the rest of the film it's a real mixed bag. On one hand the film is gorgeouswith a fantastic location shoot in Utah as well as terrific music. So the film clearly had a nice budget and it's obvious the studio gave director Douglas Sirk the go ahead to make a quality film. However the film also suffers from some downright awful dialogdialog that often makes the 'Indians' sound like idiots. The worst of this often occurred with love sceneswhich were among the least romantic in film history. Overall the film is watchable but sillyand certainly not among the best or worst of the genre.By the way I wonder if this film was originally planned as a 3D movie. This is because often punches spears giant rocks and whips are tossed directly AT the cameralike you'd see in a 3D picture. Considering it came out in 1954 this is awfully likely. Also historically speaking the movie is a mishmash of facts and pure bunk.".

Mainly to see a very young Piper Laurie and Tony Curtis in another early role after the superior though that wasn't perfect either 'The Prince Who Was a Thief' and how they would fare individually and as a partnership. Also because the story on paper seemed intriguing if silly.Saw 'Son of Ali Baba' with the mindset of not expecting a masterpiece and some escapist entertainment without expecting too much or everything to be of superb quality. 'Son of Ali Baba' is variable in achieving this goal. It may not blow the mind and it may not be one of Curtis's best films or contain one of his best performances. Enough is done right however and it entertains throughout its slightly too brief length.The story sure is pure nonsense and the silliness occasionally goes overboard complete with some overfamiliarity. The costumes are somewhat unlikely and don't look as appealing in colour and style as the rest of the production values.Curtis is athletic and can be likeable enough if a bit stiff while the script can fall into overlycamp and awkwardness the pace sometimes has lapses in momentum and the film generally lacks magic. Lovely Piper Laurie is hammy at times but has charm factor and is equally spirited. Some of their chemistry is warm and playful. Victor Jory sinks his teeth to the hilt as the villain. The direction has an efficiency that suits the adventurous element of the story perfectly.It is very difficult to dislike the story completely. For all its ridiculousness and predictability it can go at a breezy pace with a clear idea at what it was trying to be and appeal to without trying to do more. The characters are archetypes but reasonably likeable ones. The actionoriented parts especially towards the end excite and the music is rousing. 'Son of Ali Baba' costumes aside is shot with vibrant colour and the setting exoticlooking if perhaps not evocative.In conclusion not bad but not much special even when taking it for what it is. Likeable enough cast and fun and colourful in spots but can be too much on the camp side and lacks magic. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This is your typical lazy kiddie fare that puts a bunch of animals on screen and makes them do people stuff. That's really not enough by itself to make something funny. This goes beyond being forgettable by further assuming you can engage in rampant stereotyping simply by making the characters dogs. I don't enjoy this depiction of Mexican culture created by white people for a white audience. It's really on the nose that the fancy lady chihuahua is a white chihuahua. The movie makes it like Papi is some kind of hero for booking a mariachi band instead of a DJ or a reggaeton act. But it's just him doing another Mexican thing in a Mexican way and it all gets very tiresome. Meanwhile the human Hispanic man has this pointless subplot about trying to impress the big boss with his landscaping and his hard work ethic. Sigh. Another criticism is that it depicts Papi as the only character whose decisions carry consequences. He gets to be the big hero. He dotes on but also dictates to his daughter. Somehow this incredibly retrograde view of fatherhood gets a pass because again the characters are dogs.The problem I see with these huge stereotypes is that it's aimed at kids who in turn will back up problematic racial and gender stereotypes. The only character I found really amusing was the pug who despite still being rather stereotypical himself at least had some charm and talked in a vaguely sensible way about things that were going on. He was an oasis of wit and sense in a movie fully of corny lines and nonsense. It's not completely without redeeming features. The plot tired as it is is probably enough for young viewers resolves efficiently. The comedyoferrors side plots similarly get us from point A to point B without much fuss.My kids watch this movie over and over again. I guess it's fairly entertaining for them. But as a parent I strongly dislike it. It's empty candy that leans on creaky old stereotypes for humor value. Don't let your kids watch this. Please just don't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite a lot of complaints that nonTurks would not find this funny I did. I have seen it twice now. I do quite enjoy it and find much of it funny with some parts extremely funny. Granted a few things were not especially original or were pretty tired or crude without being humorous to me but these were minor problems and films like this always have some jokes that don't appeal to everyone. I cannot say I don't like a movie simply because I personally don't like some of the jokes or gags. Overall the film was quite welldone and most of the jokes or spoofs of culture and films worked quite well.One fun thing is to see this sort of film made from a Turkish perspective rather than American. It puts a new twist on some things even jokes that we've seen before or which would have been in an American or other film.In part I am sure my enjoyment of the film is helped by the fact that while hardly being fluent in Turkish I do know some Turkish and am quite familiar with the country. Therefore while there are a number of very Turkeyspecific jokes I was able to enjoy at least some of them. I would therefore agree that a decent understanding of at least Turkish culture and recent history if not the language will enhance one's enjoyment of the film.Other humour in the film seems pretty universal. As a result there are quite a lot of jokes and spoofs that I know many Americans and Western Europeans would get. Again while some are tired or crude many are really quite funny and pulled off quite well.I think that my biggest complaint is that some themes were not taken far enough. For example more could have been done with the carpet salesman thing since that part was really quite funny and had more potential than the film exploited.In the end this is a pretty wellmade funny and entertaining film. It could have been better but it works well and should provide quite a few laughs especially if one knows much about Turkey. It's rather silly but that is pretty much the point and the silliness here is mostly quite entertaining.Although not really relevant for my discussion I shall add that this film is also a milestone for Turkish cinema in terms of the special effects and production values for a film of this sort. I think it's important to recognize this even though I was primarily concerned with giving my opinion of the film's content etc. Thus while one may be able to criticize some visuals compared to some bigbudget Hollywood films the production valuesspecial effects are pretty good especially considering the context.".

Cem Yilmaz realised his vision of Turks in space and made his work well. His love for details is average.To understand everything in that film first you gotta be Turkish since a big part of the humor is based on the street language that Cem Yilmaz is using perfectly.

It's the first time I saw a Turkish film with so many special effects that is great. The only bad sides are that it makes just to many jokes about homosexuals which becomes boring and the hero saves the planet just to easy. But it's a comedy not the filming of a book so that is understandable.

He is really funny and perfect as in his other advertisement movies and old movies";

Then he gets abducted by aliens from the GORA planet. After all there is no rule that says aliens can only abduct people from the USA. Nor is there a rule that says that only Americans can make contact with extraterrestrial life forms. So what happens if aliens abduct a Turkish carpet seller ?Basically GORA is a good piss take of the more popular scifi movies such as Starwars and Matrix. And that's fine with me because I believe both Starwars feel the Farce and Matrix I know Kung Fu are extremely overrated movies. The sense of humour in GORA is Turkish. That is neither a praise nor an insult. It is just Turkish. The subtitles don't help either. For some reason Turkish movie producers hire awful translators who sometimes even mix German with English. Translation between languages that are as different from each other as Turkish and English requires slightly more than a wordbyword correspondence. I hereby offer my services free of charge. Just ask. Had the subtitles been any better the movie could have achieved some international recognition as a comedy movie. Turkish speakers should definitely watch this movie. They'll have a good laugh. NonTurks should give it a try.".

I believe that viewers who have reviewed the film in a light of this have done it justice... and come on if there are so many 'Arif's out there how can we still question whether or not there are extra terrestrial life forms out there too! This is a highly successful and thoroughly hilarious film. When I walked out of the cinema it didn't even cross my mind to analyze the film in the way I usually would.. I mean why should I? I really don't believe the writer or director even thought of doing this themselves. it's not 'persona' or anything. I experienced two hours of solid laughter.

Yes they were surprisingly fantastic very 'Hollywood' but this didn't add or take away from the film in any way. Put it this way if a song is beautifully written then it will sound great even if you were to just serenade it. But if the song is crap badly written then even the London Philharmonic Orchestra can't do much with it believe me!In short this film must not be missed!

As a TurkishAmerican I have a slightly different view of Turkish films than most people who live in Turkey. I have liked some Turkish films like Baalayka and Polizei more neither of which are popular films but I have been slightly less impressed with domestic box office hits like Ucurtmayanlari YurmasinlarDon't Let Them Shoot the Kites 1989. I think there are some major problems with GORA as the last message poster from Ankara pointed out. The film is way too long and there are far too many bathroom jokes. And though the film has better production values Cem Yilmaz is not quite the exceptional talent that the late Turkish comic actor Kemal Sunal was. Sunal was in Polizei and was to star in Baalayka before dying of a heart attack preparing for a flight to work on the film! But GORA does illustrate Turkey's dilemma of trying to find a place in the world. The aliens in this scificomedy seem to show how Turkish people see the outside world. And there are some funny moments such as when Yilmaz pretends to be a sensitive man to woo an attractive alien woman. It is also funny to see people from outer space speaking fluent Turkish! Yes I'm still laughing over that one! Unfortunately I don't think the film's humor would carry over to viewers outside Turkey who are unfamiliar with the complicated cultural traits of the country. It is for this reason that Sunal is deservedly an icon in Turkey but not a familiar figure in other nations. When it comes to Turkish humor the rest of the world will sadly never get it.".

It was a real surprise that this movie was even better than Cem Yilmaz's comedy acting in Bir Tat bir doku...!But there are some negative points for the foreignmovie visitors The humor is all around Turkishlifestyle so they maybe don't understand most of the funny lines and acting. Further the subtitling was really bad! Most of the movie was inside the G.O.R.A. prison and so it was not able to read the white subtitles on white background. A slight shadow under the text would helped a lot.Sure this movie doesn't has the emotional deepness of for example Vizontele but it's a funny movie and far better than some German pendants like Traumschiff Surprise.I don't want to loose much words about the plot itself because other users did this already very well but I can say that almost EVERY minute in this movie had jokes that were so awesome that you were not able to NOT jump out of your seat  Especially the scene where arif and ceku where creating some kind of romantic atmosphere and bob marley faruk farted while he was sleeping right next to them. I know it sound very childish but the overall acting and the reactions from cem yilmaz were so unbelievable funny I was not able to hold my tears from laughing. In fact I hate fartjokes and crappy fartmovies like Nutty Professor II The Klumps and others...Although most of the environments were done very well sometimes you were able to see not so well done background images and some scenes were used twice... But nothing that would distract you from the main aspect of the movie Making you laugh ".

A slight shadow under the text would helped a lot.Sure this movie doesn't has the emotional deepness of for example Vizontele but it's a funny movie and far better than some German pendants like Traumschiff Surprise.I don't want to loose much words about the plot itself because other users did this already very well but I can say that almost EVERY minute in this movie had jokes that were so awesome that you were not able to NOT jump out of your seat  Especially the scene where arif and ceku where creating some kind of romantic atmosphere and bob marley faruk farted while he was sleeping right next to them. I know it sound very childish but the overall acting and the reactions from cem yilmaz were so unbelievable funny I was not able to hold my tears from laughing. In fact I hate fartjokes and crappy fartmovies like Nutty Professor II The Klumps and others...Although most of the environments were done very well sometimes you were able to see not so well done background images and some scenes were used twice... But nothing that would distract you from the main aspect of the movie Making you laugh ";

As one of the best comedians of Turkey Cem Ylmaz has a great success in plotting the outline and a very successful characterization of the two main and opposite characters of the movie  the evil commander Logar and the funny practical thinking carpet salesman Arif. The supporting cast is also well chosen helping the audience feel the overwhelming presence of the lifestyle and characters of an alien planet.Special effects flashing costumes and extremely sophisticated makeup increases the value of the movie as a whole making GORA one of the best produced space adventures of all times. The balance of action and comedy Turkish humor and its international perception is well applied and the general rules of making a quality cinema production are strictly followed. As a faithful movie fan I would suggest GORA to every audience who want to go to a movie have hours of fun and laugh and leave the theater with a happy smile on the face. Just a humble reminder do not believe all of what they told you on other space movies. There is at least a planet out there whose inhabitants are funny incompetent and less evil than the evil trade federation the sith the goa'uld the wraith and the cylons".

The references to other films are far from being smart even I could hardly grasp what was funny in some references. On the other hand the cast was quite successful. Only zge zberk as Ceku somewhat reveals her lack of experience but her charming look in several beautiful dresses compensate this. I also liked the costumes. Picturing was OK despite the focusing seemed odd to me in some scenes.Cem Yilmaz displays a good performance and I believe that the film would be unbearable without him.

I think you get what I mean. The movie has no big surprises after all.But if this kind of movie is well done it can still merit a rating of eight points. I only give six point five and for this site seven points because of the mediocre camera work that was shaking and irritating at some points of the movie.The rest of the film is quite decent. The locations are interesting and the movie takes place in Cape Town in South Africa and not in Europe or North America. The fighting and action scenes are very well done and with the visual and sound effects in cinema it's a pleasant entertainment to watch this movie for sure. It's a good flick to change your mind to relax and to take a break from your everyday life for sure. The acting is also rather good with two strong lead actors that are a very cool Denzel Washington and a sympathetic and determined Ryan Reynolds.The only little flaw is that I would have liked to know more about both characters especially about their past and what really led them to do what they actually do in the movie.The movie simply has not the greatest script to stand out among many other similar flicks but it's still a good film. I would suggest you to rather watch the movies I talked about in my introduction or classics like I As In Icarus but if you have seen and liked them all you will surely appreciate this work too.".

The greatest success of this movie is the usage of modern film techniques. Too often the bulging budget and ability to edit in effects makes actionthriller movies extremely unrealistic. Safe House does the opposite. It takes all of these techniques and uses them to make the movie raw and real.The actors were handpicked perfectly for their roles. Ryan Reynolds is the actor you have to use when you want to put a likable relatable family man in a difficult situation. As a CIA operative caught up in something far outside his experience he fits in perfectly. As for Denzel Washington there is little that he can't do. For the unique character of Tobin Frost there is no better man to fill the role. Together they form a storyline that merely needs to be able to stand on its own two feet. The storyline does stand on its own. That being said it is the weakest part of the movie. The twists have all been seen before. This movie doesn't offer new plot points to the old conspiracy theory movie. It merely adds new characters. The new characters are great but it is not enough. In order for the movie to be great it needed to give something new to the story.I must say that the end was beautiful. Without giving anything away it was gracefully preformed. It wrapped up the loose ends that too many other movies simply leave hanging. It adds a whole other dimension to Ryan Reynolds' character. It will without a doubt leave you wanting more but somehow completely satisfied.Safe House is worth a trip to the theatre. With thrillers such as this one the action is better on the big screen. Between the action and the actors you will not be disappointed. Next to Liam Neeson's The Grey this is one of the best action movies so far this year. The thing is it could have been even better.

Ryan was fantastic even better then I could've imagined a nice showing of his acting skills after Green Lantern and ChangeUp and Denzel what to say that hasn't been already said about that man's acting.

	schema:headline " Predictable but Entertaining Excellent Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm of the opinion that out of all the movie stars and wouldbe movie  stars in Hollywood Denzel Washington is one of if not THE safest  bet. I say this because I don't think I've ever met a person who  dislikes the man. In a culture that is built upon strong opinions and  holding to said opinions fiercely this is the backbone of the industry  in many ways it is a remarkable feat to put together a 20 year  career like Denzel has without drawing the ire of someone or some  group. Age race and gender seem to matter not when it comes to  Denzel whose films almost always find a way to exceed expectations  whether they are magnificent Training Day American Gangster or  wholly lackluster John Q Unstoppable. There is an overriding sense  among a high percentage of moviegoers that if Denzel is in so are  they. Safe House a solid if uninspired action thriller has proved  this theory to be true.   Instead of the undercover investigations and shoot outs he expected  when he joined the CIA Matt Weston Ryan Reynolds has been relegated  to manning a safe house in Cape Town South Africa. He is bored and he  wants some action a desire that is all too well fulfilled at the  outset of the film when former CIA agentturnedtraitor Tobin Frost  Washington is brought to his house for interrogation. Soon after his  arrival a militant force arrives to take possession of Frost killing  the highlytrained team that brought Frost into the house. With no  other option Weston grabs Frost and makes a bolt for it barely  escaping the unknown villains who killed his comrades. With no other  teams in the area Weston's superior David Barlow Brendan Gleeson  tasks him with keeping Frost alive and in custody until he can be  collected a proposition which turns out to be much more difficult and  complex than Weston would have ever imagined. With the assailants hot  on their trail and Frost crawling deeper and deeper in Weston's head  the young agent must think fast and learn on the run before he becomes  another casualty of a dirty battle that Frost has sucked him into.  There are a few departures from the main storyline at work within Safe  House but these distractions are only there to lengthen the film and  add some uninteresting depth. This film lives and dies on the  performances of Reynolds and Washington both of whom come through  beautifully. It's been a rough year for Reynolds whose star status has  been thrown into serious question with the failures of Green Lantern  and The ChangeUp. This role however is a better fit for him  allowing him to share the load with an established genre veteran  instead of being relied upon to carry a major film on his own. I was  pleasantly surprised at his ability to give Weston more depth than what  you usually get with this sort of film and I thought he hit the right  balance between being a half terrified inexperienced field agent and  being that hardened see this thing through to the bitter end  character that Safe House had to have.

I can't say that this is  one of Washington's best portrayals and it's certainly a safer choice  than I'd like to see an actor of his caliber make but it is  nonetheless a reminder of exactly why just about everybody digs what  this guy has been selling for two decades.   Every other element of Safe House plays second fiddle to the work done  by the two leads. The action is intense and somewhat gritty when a  shot is fired you feel it as much as hear it a characteristic I quite  like in a serious action film.

Better choices could certainly be  made the major twist could be seen from a mile away and the  conclusion was unsatisfactory for me. But given director Daniel  Espinosa's relative inexperience behind the camera and the sheer power  of Washington's star appeal these are issues I found easy to overlook  as the film progressed. It's nothing new and it's not a film I want to  watch a dozen times over but for what it is Safe House provides an  entertaining and appealing experience.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm of the opinion that out of all the movie stars and wouldbe movie  stars in Hollywood Denzel Washington is one of if not THE safest  bet. I say this because I don't think I've ever met a person who  dislikes the man. In a culture that is built upon strong opinions and  holding to said opinions fiercely this is the backbone of the industry  in many ways it is a remarkable feat to put together a 20 year  career like Denzel has without drawing the ire of someone or some  group. Age race and gender seem to matter not when it comes to  Denzel whose films almost always find a way to exceed expectations  whether they are magnificent Training Day American Gangster or  wholly lackluster John Q Unstoppable. There is an overriding sense  among a high percentage of moviegoers that if Denzel is in so are  they. Safe House a solid if uninspired action thriller has proved  this theory to be true.   Instead of the undercover investigations and shoot outs he expected  when he joined the CIA Matt Weston Ryan Reynolds has been relegated  to manning a safe house in Cape Town South Africa. He is bored and he  wants some action a desire that is all too well fulfilled at the  outset of the film when former CIA agentturnedtraitor Tobin Frost  Washington is brought to his house for interrogation. Soon after his  arrival a militant force arrives to take possession of Frost killing  the highlytrained team that brought Frost into the house. With no  other option Weston grabs Frost and makes a bolt for it barely  escaping the unknown villains who killed his comrades. With no other  teams in the area Weston's superior David Barlow Brendan Gleeson  tasks him with keeping Frost alive and in custody until he can be  collected a proposition which turns out to be much more difficult and  complex than Weston would have ever imagined. With the assailants hot  on their trail and Frost crawling deeper and deeper in Weston's head  the young agent must think fast and learn on the run before he becomes  another casualty of a dirty battle that Frost has sucked him into.  There are a few departures from the main storyline at work within Safe  House but these distractions are only there to lengthen the film and  add some uninteresting depth. This film lives and dies on the  performances of Reynolds and Washington both of whom come through  beautifully. It's been a rough year for Reynolds whose star status has  been thrown into serious question with the failures of Green Lantern  and The ChangeUp. This role however is a better fit for him  allowing him to share the load with an established genre veteran  instead of being relied upon to carry a major film on his own. I was  pleasantly surprised at his ability to give Weston more depth than what  you usually get with this sort of film and I thought he hit the right  balance between being a half terrified inexperienced field agent and  being that hardened see this thing through to the bitter end  character that Safe House had to have. Washington meanwhile is a tour  de force exuding both charisma and menace in just the right amounts.  Always a commanding presence on the screen no matter what his role  Washington is at his best when delivering his lines in that quiet  calm measured manner which he has become famous for and this is a role  that calls upon that ability several times. I can't say that this is  one of Washington's best portrayals and it's certainly a safer choice  than I'd like to see an actor of his caliber make but it is  nonetheless a reminder of exactly why just about everybody digs what  this guy has been selling for two decades.

	schema:reviewBody "Safe House is a movie that fulfils its popcorn intentions but metaphorically brings to mind the image of a bobblehead  a bloated brain supported by little else springing uncontrollably in different directions. When the action ramps up Safe House is at its best providing ample energy a plethora or gunplay and a number of gritty combat sequences. When pausing to forward the plot spew exposition or focus on perfunctory romances it grinds to a halt. Safe House would be better viewed with a remote equipped with a fast forward button nearby.Thankfully for Safe House the sequences with action outnumber those without so it comes out on top on a percentage basis alone. What makes it slip just out of the realm of solid praise is that it really fails as a tense psychological duel of wits. I mean c'mon you have the one of the coolest actors working today Denzel Washington of course trying to escape his confines with only a lowly safe house guard Ryan Reynolds in his way  use it! The trailers and radio ads prominently feature the line I'm already in your head but the movie itself offers little in the way of subtle manipulation or mind games. All we get are a few scenes where Washington's Tobin Frost intimidates the crap out of the inexperienced operative and forebodingly warns that the CIA will screw him one day. Now that I've kicked this movie while it's down let me tell you what it does very well bloodshed. I already mentioned the ample highoctane set pieces but of course volume of action does not always translate directly to a solid film Transformers springs to mind it has to bring something to the table. Safe House earns its Rrating in many an instance with sometimes uncomfortably realistic shootouts brutal interrogations and wonderfully choreographed but winceinducing hand tohand combat sequences. If you think that John McClane looks rough at the end of a Die Hard flick wait until you see how Reynolds looks when the credits roll. Refreshingly this is not the kind of movie where a character is shot grits his teeth a little bit holds his wound and then ten minutes later they have apparently forgotten about it. You feel every punch and when somebody gets stabbed they writhe on the floor in pain and when somebody gets shot they are likely not getting back up. There are also a handful of lengthy chase sequences through the streets of Cape Town a soccer stadium and the slums of Langa and in all instances deliver. They are easy to follow highenergy and far more realworld than we're normally accustomed when talking about a Hollywood car chase. In all of these sequences automotive or otherwise we have Reynolds front and center. Safe House is really a Ryan Reynolds movie masquerading as a Denzel Washington film though that is not to say Washington is relegated to a just supporting role it is simply more focused on our inwayoverhishead rookie than the lethal pro. Reynolds is the surprise here not only holding his own against the veteran but delivering his best mainstream performance to date there is not a hint of his wisecracking The Green Lantern or Deadpool characters to be found here. Curiously there were very few oneliners delivered by Washington and though he oozed charisma through his presence alone I would have liked to see a little more sizzle one more duty that lands on the script which just offers nothing in the way of interesting dialogue insights into the mind of a killer or even a brisk pace for that matter. As a movie to pop in the DVD player with some buds however one that you can tune out the downtimes between action set pieces it delivers absolutely and does offer one of the rarer instances for Washington to do his bad guy thing  a welcome sight.Rating 6.510".

SAFE HOUSE is very formulaic it only makes you think like it's smart and if it weren't for the intense unforgiving gunfights one of the most exciting I've seen in cinema Tombstone's gunfight still takes top honor SAFE HOUSE probably wouldn't have much going to help me recommend it to you Training Day Unstoppable and now SAFE HOUSE you'd pair up Denzel as a seasoned experienced character with a rookie or a newbie who eventually steps up to the plate.

Don't get me wrong the concept is fantastic a CIA house being breached and you don't know who's responsible and who else may be on it the line between bad guys and good guys get blurred those are necessary elements for a pulse pounding thriller. But those of us hardcore fans of thrillers may it be political or whodunit crime would easily notice that all that Guggenheim did was put all the CIA smart vocabularies and slang into Tobin Frost's lips Denzel and then have the CIA repeats the same thing in their own little playroom and then Guggenheim would throw a series of massive chaos in between. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the bad guy either because you'd always go with the one who seems to be the most supportive the one who wants to see the protagonists find safety just so that they may get to them in time and retrieve whatever it is that they withhold so SAFE HOUSE is exciting but it's hardly smart and it's certainly nothing new.  www.Ramascreen.com ".

SAFE HOUSE is very formulaic it only makes you think like it's smart and if it weren't for the intense unforgiving gunfights one of the most exciting I've seen in cinema Tombstone's gunfight still takes top honor SAFE HOUSE probably wouldn't have much going to help me recommend it to you Training Day Unstoppable and now SAFE HOUSE you'd pair up Denzel as a seasoned experienced character with a rookie or a newbie who eventually steps up to the plate.

However upon viewing Safe House my expectations were met and a little more. Safe House is fairly predictable and doesn't contain the best story but the film has a certain charm that is lead by its lead actors Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Right from the start Safe House wheels you in and it becomes a great thrill ride.Safe House was far grittier than expected and more so than the typical Hollywood fares nowadays. It fits its R rating appropriately as it doesn't shy away from the violence. The stunts are also well performed. Washington and Reynolds is what specifically makes the film great as they made a great duo and made their roles believable as ever.The film really picks its pace once we see the first encounter between Washington and Reynolds. We then see how they communicate as it is clear they do not like one another then as the film progress they become closer which is expected. Including some great action scenes such as a very thrilling car chase scene where Reynolds kidnaps and takes Washington with him realizing they are being chased by folks of the mafia government. The film really hits at the scene where Reynolds takes Washington to the sporting event about 50 minutes in and we witness the havoc commencing. It follows by Washington escaping under the loose and Reynolds being taken by the police. From there on out is where I think the film picks up.The ending could be seen as a cop out and is fairly predictable where they could have went another direction as the rating lowers for myself. However it was understood why it all happened. Safe House is what is advertised.".

Rogue agent escapes and is later recaptured by silly agent.08. Silly agent is attacked by another CIA agent.09. Silly agent learns CIA is corrupt.10. Rogue agent dies and silly agent goes rogue.So in other words the CIA attacks the CIA to try to prevent the CIA from learning that the CIA has dirt of the CIA. Yeah that makes sense!In addition to all this garbage the CIA strike team kills a boatload of innocent civilians does millions of dollars of property damage gets two of their top people killed and then just lets the guy with the damaging intel just walk away at the end. So what was the point of the whole movie?Also if the CIA knew where rogue agent Denzel Washington was at the beginning of the movie why didn't they just kill him up front and be done with it?Duh!The only saving grace this movie has is Denzel Washington who as always is a fine actor who conveys depth empathy and strong acting. Ryan Reynolds' acting however is pretty awful. Throughout the whole movie he looks constipated and is entirely unbelievable.The subplot if you want to call it that with his girlfriend is completely pointless and adds nothing to the film. This film had a 85 M budget. That money could have been better used teaching bullfrogs how to play the ukulele.".

I love Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds is good enough not to be typecasted while still holding onto his own style.Unfortunately nothing works here.This movie is incredibly simple to summarize due to it's simplicity. Ryan Reynolds plays a caretaker of a Safe House. He's a CIA agent trying to prove himself and that chance comes when Tobin Frost Denzel Washington and the only character who's name I can even remember is caught through some suspiciously specific circumstances comes his way.Sounds cool right? It's not.Specifically? It's nothing we haven't seen. Corrupt government predictable plot points and you'll figure out who the bad guy is halfway through the movie which takes away some of it's sting. It predictably tried to make us think the womanagent I don't even know their names was working against the office but it wasn't because the movie pressed to much into her hardass attitude. It wasn't believable.The biggest disappointment was the whole plot point the MOVIE'S TITLE was barely utilized. I went in expecting a psychological thriller maybe 6075 of the movie taking place in the Safe House as Tobin Frost messes with the minds of everyone around him. That's what the trailers implied anyway. I got no such thing.Instead the Safe House is broken into within minutes of Frost entering the building. There's a second safe house later in the movie and it too serves little point except the placeholder of the climax. All in all? I doubt we get 10 minutes worth of what is supposed to be the movie's title. Frankly the movie should have been renamed.Let's not forget that Frost barely proves his reputation which we get in a quick scene of exposition as it explains that he rewrote interrogation protocol or something. At most he says about four mindscrewing lines to Reynolds' character and not much happens with it.It just felt everything this movie was supposed to be was abandoned.That's what I didn't like. The fight scenes were fine the actors were fine even some of the writing was fine. But when I left I found it difficult to like this movie.".

Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington do the best they can but ultimately the director hits the wrong tone and the cinematography is at times distractingly bad.Here's what the previews led me to believe Reynolds is young and driven but inexperienced as the keeper of a safe house Washington is an old professional rogue agent who will offer him advice. None of that advice was ever really shared I thought a certain bond would be formed between Washington and Reynolds or at least a hesitant mutual respect but none of that took shape.I kept waiting for that point where one character proves to be more than what we were led to believe early on that they were but no. Washington and Reynold's characters of Weston and Tobin stay the same throughout the whole movie Weston is none the wiser because of Tobin and thats all there is to it.Still there's enough basic action and minimal suspense to keep you entertained during a matine showing so on that level I can't knock the film. The problem is there were several moments where I was left wondering why not a little more exploration into these characters or the story.Also while watching the movie I just assumed it was PG13 I never pay attention to the ratings but none of the violent fight scenes were that particularly violent so I told myself oh it must be because they needed to maintain the PG13 but no this movie is an R and yet they still avoided showing brutal fight scenes. All of the violence was so rapidly edited together and shot from such obscure angles that you can barely even tell what is going on.I give credit to Washington and Reynolds for doing the best they could to overcome weak direction editing cinematography and screen writing.".

The plot is utterly muddled and horribly boring and just downright uninteresting. The action scenes are just kinda take it or leave it nothing new at all to bring to the table. There isn't anything new exciting or even mildly entertaining here. This movie is just bad at engaging the audience making the audience actually give a crap what happens. I sure didn't care that happened. How could I??? I was too busy checking the time on my phone LOL. Skip this one save your heartache. Don't say i didn't warn you. 110.".

But that was just few minutes into the movie and he keeps making this lazy mistakes for a character who is supposed to be this legendary agent. If he at least kept his character most of the way through it would have been a more watchable more to some degree. The theater was packed for this movies release date but none of the audience seemed excited of enjoying there time while watching this dull and generic movie that is predictable all the way through. Some even left in the middle of this lazy movie. Even two good actors couldn't save this movie from being a utter unoriginal boring movie. I give it a 3.410 cause I seen worse.3.410".

	schema:reviewBody "First thing about watching Safe House in the theaters do not I repeat DO NOT sit in the front half of the cinema I would suggest sitting in the back row unless you want to get nauseated and dizzy. Why? The shaky cam is really bad on this movie. Even in the nonaction scenes the camera is never still and constantly moving. During action scenes the camera all over the place creating headache inducing jerkiness and bobbling that can only be described by comparing it to symptoms of deadly diseases. The constant camera movement in the nonaction scenes is also so bad that during each and every conversation in the movie it's slowly rocking side to side for absolutely no reason giving seasickness.Add to the shaky cam that half the movie is a close up of a close up. The faces take up most of the screen and go beyond even the field of vision. On top of that add the way too much frequent cuts. It's a real eyeball and brain buster.However if you're one of these people who are immune to shaky cam the next topic is of course Denzel. Denzel gives his greatest hits the Denzelagainsttheworld Denzel the TrainingDay Denzel and the drama Denzel. Denzel is supposed to be playing a character Tobin Frost but it's like we are watching Denzel Washington do his thing rather than Tobin Frost.Safe House borrows heavily from the Bourne movies not just the shaky cam but the large screened command centers at the Pentagon and the mannerisms of the staff there. Another Bournesque element is the fights between trained agents however in this movie they just seem to be of lower quality with slower labored movements and the scenes reduced to a frantic blur. The singular car chase scene despite being the highlight of the action sequences is also unsatisfying.The real oddity of the movie is how philosophical it wants to be about lives of CIA employees. The movie gives us these long sullen monologues on relationships pasts and futures innocent victims etc. These musings would probably have some gravity if any of the characters were more than half dimensional and possessed some sort of personality. What we end up in the movie are a bunch of really big talking heads sprouting lots of hollow dialog and adding to that headache.Other minor things the waterboarding scene that the trailer alludes to completely flubbed. It is as exciting as watching someone water their lawn.Speaking of product placements Safe House has been commandeered as a product placement vehicle for a certain brand of car that only makes boxy SUVs. Each and every car in the movie is of this brand I mean every government car every bad guy car all 34 cars jacked along the way is a boxy SUV. This way too silly and distractingly sticks out.In summary Safe House would have been a mediocre but watchable movie without the shaky cam. With the shaky cam it's just a big headache inducing mess. Devout Denzel followers might get something out of it but for most action fans I would suggest waiting for the DVD version which it is more suited for.".

In the first movie directing was obviously bad but Recep vedik character saved the day. In this sequel we surprisingly see that the director has shown no improvement since the first movie and even got worse. This is not good news for his career I think it would be good for him to try his chances in other fields before it is too late.If you can handle the swearing without a story and have excess money you can watch this movie on cinema otherwise it is a Cgrade movie which at most deserves being watched on video.".

In the first movie directing was obviously bad but Recep vedik character saved the day. In this sequel we surprisingly see that the director has shown no improvement since the first movie and even got worse. This is not good news for his career I think it would be good for him to try his chances in other fields before it is too late.If you can handle the swearing without a story and have excess money you can watch this movie on cinema otherwise it is a Cgrade movie which at most deserves being watched on video.";

He could have easily made a film about any other character he played in his show. His story seems very similar to Ali G's in that respect. Ali G only made Borat because it was the best loved character in The Ali G Show.Let's get one thing straight most people watched Recep Ivedik 1  2 because they already had seen the sketch on TV and liked it thus they knew exactly what to expect from the movie just like I did.Most the people who did not enjoy the movie probably never watched his sketch on TV beforehand thus the disappointment.I can agree that the movie is not a straight forward comedy movie and different to anything I have seen before but it still entertaining.The movie may have a stupid story line or no story line as some say but it cleverly delivers a message. The movie isn't just plain stupid like Ali G in fact there are so many scenes in this movie that show Recep is opposite of stupid.Recep is very rude and sometimes disgusting in the movie but I found this funny again not everyone will.I think people who did not enjoy the movie missed on of the main points in the movie The MessageAlong side being ignorant rude and disgusting he was educating people. Examples such asEkinler bas vermeden kor buzagi topalmazmis is a very nice message and makes sense.He is not just a Kiro as we hear him talk about many things most people watching the movie don't even know about things like Photoshop.He looks after his Grandmother In Turkey old people are never looked after and often put in old peoples homes instead and also send the message across that we should do anything it takes to earn a living in this current situation.He is very open with people and speaks his mind. When he meets Yakuza at the Chinese restaurant he openly tells her what he thinks some may think he is horrible but I think he is doing the right thing.To round it up I believe the movie was excellent although some of the jokes were over the top he redeemed himself with the good message he was putting across. People need to realise now that Comedy is not what it use to be there are different types of comedy and everything has changed Turkish comedy movies are what they are right now lots of swearing. The Kemal Sunal days are over and now we have a new era.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a nice change of pace for a Clint Eastwood Western. While in some ways Clint's character isn't that much different from some of his previous cowboys he's great with a gun and is motivated by greed....until the end...just like in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE the chemistry of adding Shirley MacLaine really changes the film. Together they create an engaging though not exactly believable pair. However despite being tough to believe the film is so much fun and written and acted so well that you really don't mind.The film itself was made in Mexico with many Mexican actors. This combined with a somewhat restrained score by Ennio Morricone make this movie look in many ways like a Spaghetti Western though it was financed and directed by Americans. For these reasons the film is like a bridge from Eastwood's earlier westerns to his more recent ones.About the only negative about the film other than how difficult it was to believe the plot at times was that the secret about MacLaine's character didn't seem like that big of a surprise...yet the supremely smart and savvy Eastwood had no idea! THIS was the hardest part to believe! However the film is still great fun and well worth seeing. My wife who hates westerns actually watched it with me and enjoyed it so I guess this cowboy pic might have a wider audience than some westerns.By the way which mules exactly were they referring to?! This confusing title had me thinking that I must have missed something!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure he's in the shadow here of his more famous Leone westerns but this vehicle amiably directed by Don Siegel and aided by a quirky Ennio Morricone score is an entertaining little spaghetti western knockoff shot on location in Mexico. Storywise it's an old west Heaven Knows Mr. Allison with a comic twist and with an offbeat nemesis in the French Army. The humorous chemistry between Eastwood's Hogan and MacLaine's Sara at times clicks so well it's hard to believe they reportedly didn't get along very well during production. Though when it comes to Shirley MacLaine nothing really surprises me.As far as Eastwood's post Spaghetti movies he's rarely been in better form than this. Essentially continuing his man with no name persona he gets far more dialogue this time around which fleshes out his character and makes him a little more three dimensional. It's a nice change of pace from the Leone westerns to hear Clint spout a few humorous lines and have the odd hilarious facial expression in between his trademark squinting and snarling and cigar chomping.Disciples of Leone's trilogy may never warm up to an admittedly hammier Clint in this but as Clint's Hollywood westerns go this is a fun and well made duster. Shouldn't be missed.".

'Two Mules' is a western that was released at a time that the public wanted something else. What they wanted was Clint Eastwood 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' style and that was what he kept doing for the next years. 'Two Mules' was considered a failure specially because of Shirley MacLaine that did not fit into the standard Eastwood pattern. Nowadays the story is different the film is worth seeing specially because of MacLaine. Most of the time they are together and it works very well Eastwood is less serious than usual and it is very funny how he tries to understand how a nun thinks. The music by Morriconne has a comic touch and together with the wild creatures that are shown on the screen like a scorpion a rattlesnake a mountain lion gives a great beginning. The final part does not keep the same level but those two great actors and their funny relationship are quite enough to make this a very good film. The script of the film was originally written by Budd Boetticher while he was filming Aruzza in Mexico. He needed money very badly to complete Aruzza so he sold the script and got very upset later on when they did not make the film the way he wanted.".

Eastwood who is cool as always and the lovable MacLaine match perfectly and the plot has some nice twists although it should be said that some of the 'twists' are not really too surprising.After gunsling Hogan Eastwood saves a nun named Sara MacLaine from a bunch of guys who wanted to rape her in the middle of the desert by shooting them he now has to take care of her which annoys him. It's a time of revolution against the French in Mexico and while Hogan who is interested in quick money will fight for whichever side pays well which happens to be the revolutionaries his new traveling companion Sara is very obviously an idealistic supporter of the revolutionary Juaristas...As mentioned above Two Mules For Sister Sara can in no way come up to the brilliance of Eastwood movies such as Leone's Dollar Trilogy few movies can or Eastwood's very own High Plains Drifter of 1973. Nevertheless it is a good little western with a lot of charm and wit which provides an exciting story action and great entertainment as well as many good laughs. Clint Eastwood has always been the epitome of coolness especially in his Westerns and MacLaine is great in her role of the feisty sister Sara.

	schema:reviewBody "Well crafted Western with interesting and engaging screenplay written by Albert Maltz from a story by Bud Boetticher . It deals with a nun called Sara Shirley MacLaine and two mules second mule was actually a burro  as she is attacked by three outlaws  being rescued by a drifter named Hogan Clint Eastwood  who is on his way across Mexican desert and becoming wary of her religious nature . Gringo Hogan arrives in Mexico do some reconnaissance for a next mission to capture a French fort  so he decides to help her in return for information about the defences . Inevitably both of them become good friends but Sara has a twisted secret . At the end takes place a needlessly violent slaughter against Maximiliano army . Hogan is the deadliest man alive  he takes on a whole army with two guns and a fistful of dynamite! .This classic as well as diverting Western results to be a good fun that contains thrills  humor  slow and deliberating filming  elaborate shootouts  and portentous battles with bloodbaths included . It's a special following to original Dollars trilogy with Eastwood as Man with no name  as this new role as Hogan bears remarkable resemblance . Clint returns his classic character of The man with no name and MacLaine is an unlikely nun in this amusing comedy Western . Shirley MacLaine did not get along during the shoot with director Don Siegel  with whom she openly fought . While in Austria filming When eagles dare Clint Eastwood was approached with the script by Elizabeth Taylor Richard Burton's wife at the time with the notion of starring together in the film  however Universal Pictures was unwilling to pay Taylor's high salary . Being a MexicoUSA coproduction in the picture appears numerous Mexican secondary actors such as Manuel Fabregas  Enrique Lucero  Armando Silvestre  among others . Maestro Ennio Morricone composes a groundbreaking and streaking soundtrack  including some comic touches . Colorful and evocative cinematography in Panavision by excellent Mexican cameraman Gabriel Figueroa and uncredited Robert Surtees  being filmed in Cuatla Morelos Jantetelco Tlayacapan Mexico .The motion picture was rightly produced by Martin Rackin and well directed by Donald Siegel . His first feature as a director was 1946's The Verdict 1946. He made his reputation in the early and mid'50s with a series of tightly made expertly crafted tough but intelligent B pictures  among them  The Lineup 1958 Riot in Cell Block 11 1954 Invasion of the body snatchers 1956 then graduated to major A films in the 1960s and early 1970s. He made several side trips to television mostly as a producer . Siegel directed what is generally considered to be Elvis Presley's best picture Flamingo Star 1960. All of Eastwood's later Western and his Dirty Harry movies owe a considerable debt to Sergio Leone and Donald Siegel . As Donald directed Eastwood in various films  such as  Coogan's bluff  The beguiled  Dirty Harry  Escape from Alcatraz and  of course  this  Two mules and sister Sara. He had a long professional relationship and personal friendship with Clint Eastwood who has often said that everything he knows about filmmaking he learned from Don Siegel . Two mules and sister Sara is an enjoyable film for Clint Eastwood and Donald Siegel enthusiasts  including their usual trademarks  it's full of which made their films so memorable others might find it a bit long but no one can deny its sense of style what achieved a great burst of worldwide popularity .".

He had a long professional relationship and personal friendship with Clint Eastwood who has often said that everything he knows about filmmaking he learned from Don Siegel . Two mules and sister Sara is an enjoyable film for Clint Eastwood and Donald Siegel enthusiasts  including their usual trademarks  it's full of which made their films so memorable others might find it a bit long but no one can deny its sense of style what achieved a great burst of worldwide popularity .";

	schema:reviewBody "Invasion of the Body Snatchers director Don Siegel and blacklisted Hollywood scenarist Albert Maltz appropriated an old Budd Boetticher scrip and turned it into a lively little shoot'em up called Two Mules for Sister Sara. Earlier Eastwood and Siegel had collaborated as star and director on Coogan's Bluff and this film set against the French Revolution marked their second collaboration. Wearing a stylist leather hat Clint appears as gritty and unshaven as he did in his Sergio Leone Spaghetti oaters. Now however he plays a swiftshooting soldieroffortune named Hogan. This bloodsplattered but amusing western comedydrama teams Eastwood's gimleteyed mercenary up with an impious Catholic nun Sister Sara Shirley MacLaine of Sweet Charityin Mexico during the late 1860s when the Mexicans were throwing off the yoke of French oppression. In the original Boetticher script the setting was the Mexican Revolution rather than the French Revolution Boetticher's nun character was entirely different. Incidentally sources say Boetticher hated the film. Indeed Two Mules contains a surprise ending and the constant bickering between Hogan and Sara generates many hilarious moments. Eastwood and MacLaine are charismatic throughout. The film is visually splendid to gaze at thanks to Oscar nominee Gabriel Figueroa's cinematography. Consider the way he skewers his setups sometimes for a interesting effect. The encounter with the Indians boasts some memorable camera angles especially when Clint topples from the saddle.Hogan Clint Eastwood of Coogan's Bluff is leading a supply horse loaded with dynamite on his way though the dangerous Mexican wilderness when he stumbles accidentally onto three drunks and a naked woman in the middle of nowhere. The gunmen offer to share the lady but then open fire in return. Hogan guns down two of them but the third seizes the woman as a shield. Hogan fires up a stick of TNT and slings it at them. The third man fires at Hogan and flees. Hogan drops him with three shots. Afterward Hogan discovers the naked lady is a Catholic nun! He helps her bury her assailants and then blows his cool when he sees Sara sprinkling his canteen on their graves. He snatches his canteen and suggests that she bless them without water since they are in the middle of an arid region. Things turn even weirder when a column of French cavalry show up and Sara goes berserk. The French cannot capture her she explains rapidly to Hogan because she is working in league with the revolutionaries. Hogan unearths the dead killers and sends them off at a gallop on the backs of their ponies for the French to pursue. Hogan and Sara slip away.Hogan has come to Mexico to help destroy a French prison on Bastille Day and he winds up escorting Sara to the prison town. Before he reaches the prison Hogan gets really drunk after the Yaquis shoot an arrow into his shoulder. Sister Sara uses the reflection off her cross to drive the superstitious Indians away. The scene where she has to remove the arrow from Hogan's shoulder is pretty gritty stuff. Hogan gets himself lickered up to tolerate the pain while Sara digs around the shaft of the arrow and carves a groove in it so he can put gunpowder on it fire it up and push it out the back of his shoulder. This scene can be rough on the squeamish. Anyway since he is tanked enough up to withstand the pain of the arrow removal Hogan has a difficult time with a train that he is supposed to destroy. He cannot climb the trestle to lash sticks of TNT to the pylons so he convinces Sarawho has a fear of heightsto climb up it and attach the explosives. It is ironic that a nun would hate to ascend and this plays into the big revelation at fadeout. Here comes the train and Hogan misses every shot until Sara hauls off and decks him. He recovers and nails one stick of dynamite and the entire structure collapses under the train.The big finale finds Hogan and Sara along with some revolutionaries staging an attack on a French garrison. Siegel turns this scene into a massive combat sequence with Hogan demonstrating that he is an excellent shot with either hand. There are a couple of bloody shots in this battle sequence. As usual Clint remains as cool as a glacier. The big surprisewhich I won't revealconcerns the way that Hogan's relationship with Sara concludes. Two Mules for Sister Sara is part shoot' em western and part romance and together a very amusing adventure opus.".

The film is beautifully shot superbly acted and contains one of Morricone's most haunting scores. Like His man with no name character from the dollars trilogy Eastwood's Hogan is trite with convictions and complex. When he first rescues Sara by murdering her wouldbe rapists She comments about how he is a good man. As they travel together tension mounts as Hogan becomes attracted to Sara because of her beauty and her beautiful character as he puts it. Hogan explains that he has never been married because he does not want to be tied down and enjoys living freely with no one to answer to or tie him down. While drunk Hogan confesses that he keeps wishing that Sara were not a nun. Later in the film when it is revealed that Sara is in fact no nun but actually a prostitute Hogan is overjoyed. He is relieved that the woman who he thought a woman of overbearing virtue is actually one of lesser morals. At the end of the film we see Hogan and Sara riding off together Sara dressed up in her true colors and hogan tied down with all of her regalia and luggage. I may be alone in this opinion but I was slightly disappointed when Sara's character turned out to be something other than a nun. The rebel nun aiding and abetting the juaristas was much more intriguing to me than a hooker sexing information out of french officers. Mata Haris are a dime a dozen but a guerrilla nun is something else! Oh well in my mind maybe an alternate ending could be Hogan and Sara parting ways as he drops her off with her mule at the convent. He pulls out her silver cross from his pocket revealing that he in fact didn't sell it for booze like she requested she holds it for a second dusts it off and hands it back to him. He takes it tips his hat squints into the sunset in true Eastwood style and says so long sister.".

The action goes from entertaining to more entertaining. Clint is simply wonderful this was one of his best movies I thought. The chemistry between them is great. I like how the romance develops replete with some twists that you may or may not see coming. Don Siegel is such a talented director he always seems to make movies that not only movie right along but manages to get good performances from everyone involved. We need more directors like Siegel in this day and age. The music was trademark Ennio Morricone cowboy music he is always spot on. This is the kind of movie that they just don't make anymore perfect entertainment for a weekend on the couch. Catch it if you can.".

Then I came home and watched it and I LOVED IT! The scenes are both funny and somewhat heartwarming at the same time if you consider Sober up! You better sober up you bd or I'm going to kill you! heartwarming. Clint Eastwood was terrific as the no good Atheist drunk cowbody and Shirley MacLaine was even better as the nun gone wrong. I highly recommend this movie to those who want to laugh and admire the romance. A perfect 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood plays another wandering loner in Don Siegel's Two Mules For Sister Sara. Here he's a mercenary who has been hired by Mexican soldiers to rob a French garrison. On his way there he meets a nun Shirley MacLaine who claims to know the layout of the fortress. Recognising that her inside information may prove useful the duo strike up a deal mount their mules and head off on a little adventure.Much of the film's delights are had by simply observing the interactions between Clint and MacLaine. Unlike your typical nun she's a vulgar oaf who surprises Clint with her crude behaviour. The film tries to tackle some light themes  the nun's religious devotion contrasted with Clint's mercenary selfcentredness Clint's selfcontrol he wants to make love to her but can't because he respects her faith contrasted with the nun's immorality she's not a nun but a whore in disguise  but mostly it plays things for easy jokes and comic book violence. Which is fine. Clint looks cool doing anything.The tobacco chewing poncho wearing superstar spends most of the second half of the film vomiting oneliners lighting dynamite with his cigar and gunning down French soldiers with the kind of supercool casualness that made him famous. Unfazed and nonchalant he's in total control. Guy's love this toughloner archetype of course it's the reason everyone from Keanue Reeves to Arnold Swarzenegger has a career. But with his permanent frown gravely voice and quiet intelligence Clint is more nextgeneration Bogart than macho action hero.Beyond all this Don Siegel's direction is excellent. An attack on a huge fort is especially thrilling and the film's final shot is hilarious. Rounding things off is Ennio Morricone's score which is every bit as precious as his more well known tracks.810  Siegel made a cluster of excellent films. Charley Varrick Escape from Alcatraz Telefon Hell is for Heroes Riot in Cell Block 11 Two Mules For Sister Sara The Shootist The Killers Coogans Bluff and The Verdict have all aged surprisingly well though few of his films reach the heights of The Beguiled.Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two Mules for Sister Sara is actually a pretty cool sounding name for the story cooler I suppose than 'Disabled Mule and Replacement Burro for Sister Sara' would have been. Western movie titles as late as the 1950's often had nothing to do with the story but this one at least came fairly close. Close also in identifying the character of Sister Sara Shirley MacLaine I don't think Hooker Sara would have cut it.All in all though this one's a fairly entertaining Western made so by the banter between the good sister and Clint Eastwood's character Hogan. I lost some interest toward the end of the film when attention turned to the hostilities between the Mexican Army and the French Cavalry probably because of unfamiliarity with that piece of history. By that time and with the revelation of Sara's real identity I started questioning why she went to all the trouble of those intricate masquerades in honoring religious custom like praying at the shrine when Hogan would have been none the wiser. It made for good filler but the question for a pretender like Sara would have been  why bother?For his part Eastwood tones down the Man With No Name menace effectively to pull off the relationship with MacLaine. I thought the dialog between them relating to sexual awareness by religious was handled rather maturely with neither character having to resort to clich or embarrassment. Still I can't quite picture MacLaine as a prostitute for the story's twist she just doesn't have the face for it. Let's picture Jane Fonda in the role shall we.If you're on the fence about watching the flick the opening Ennio Morricone score might just be the grabber with the electronic donkey bray calling to mind that ersatz holiday jingle Dominic The Christmas Donkey. It resurfaces from time to time again in just the right spots. That along with Sister Sara's colorful riding technique gives me a pretty good idea why Don Siegel's name appears on a headstone in High Plains Drifter.Hey now can you REALLY do that with a dead rattlesnake's tail?".

Clint plays his usual laconic drifter this isn't a bad thing though as it is a character type he was clearly born to play. He is teamed up with Shirley MacClain who plays the eponymous Sister Sara a nun hiding from the French army who were occupying Mexico at the time.The film opens with Hogan Eastwood rescuing Sara from a group of murderous rapists in the Mexican desert it isn't until she puts her clothes back on that he realises that she is in fact a nun. Initially he intends to leave her to continue on her journey as he is heading in the opposite direction but is persuaded to help her when he learns she is wanted by the French for helping the Mexican rebels. Later he learns that they share the same goal to help the rebels attack a French garrison the only difference is that Hogan is doing it for the contents of the strongbox and Sara is doing it to help free Mexico.Along the way the meet several obstacles including French troops and a group of Indians who put an arrow through Hogan's shoulder which requires a painful looking procedure to remove. At the climax of the film the rebels attack the garrison in a scene not all that dissimilar to the ending of The Wild Bunch. We also learn something about Sister Sara that I won't spoil here.The acting from the two stars is great Clint is ideal as the drifter only interested in money and MacClaine really shines as the somewhat unconventional nun... as well as helping the rebels we see her having a puff on a cigar and drinking whiskey. The music composed by Ennio Morricone must also be mentioned as like his music for the Dollar Trilogy adds a lot to the feel of this film. As with many other Clint Eastwood westerns this contains plenty of amusing moments and not too much graphic violence although one scene might be a little gruesome for younger viewers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found 'Still Crazy' to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s early '70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD don't worry it's only been three times and she loves it too.It is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits hisher notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drugdamaged rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.I live in Sherman Oaks California and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of an Americanoriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why mess with the original?My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience.".

My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD don't worry it's only been three times and she loves it too.It is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits hisher notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention.

However one afternoon I was channel surfing on a satellite dish and came across this AMAZING film about a 1970's rock  roll band who comes back together twenty years after their disasterous final concert. For keyboard player Tony Stephen Rea guitar playerbackup singer Les Jimmy Nail lead singer Ray Bill Nighy drummer Beano Timothy Spall road dog Hughie Billy Connolly and manager Karen Juliet Aubrey a second chance is a God send.  Unfortunately they are lacking two players Keith who died of a drug overdose two years before the Strange Fruit's final concert and Brian his brother a stunning guitar player who was the genious and the glue of the band. Still Crazy is a fabulous mixture of British comedy damn fine music and superb performances especially by Bill Nighy as the pathetically egotistical Ray Simms.  Helena Bergstrom is also hilarious as Ray's overprotective wife Astrid.  Watch especially for a couple of poignant scenes between Juliet Aubrey and Bruce Robinson who appears in a touching cameo. Out of 10 stars I give this hilarious and sweet rock  roll resurrection film a good solid 10!".

Then I wanted the DVD because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to lay my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several film posters and the film script. Right now it has become that worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and Still Crazy parties. How could that happen? What drove me into addiction? OK it's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the British can produce. Alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like ''This Is Spinal Tap'' because of the characters that aren't childish or ultra cool but real. This is a story about men getting older too. A story about men getting along with each other. Or don't. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy who puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in a film.Good the soundtrack is unbelievable. Foreigner's Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail who plays bassman Les Wickes and Bill Nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms are really singing. We know that about Jimmy Nail but if you've only heard Bill Nighy's singing in Love Actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is. Well you'll fever for every scene to come for the xth time especially those concert scenes. You'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing All Over The World singing on the top of your lungs. You long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit at Wisbech's festival stage. It's hard but... I'm addicted to this film. I'm addicted to Strange Fruit. If there's a world where this band really exists I'd like to move there. Got Still Crazy... anyone?".

With tremendous potential and a huge following the band is torn apart by the tragedic death of their lead singer Keith by drugs. Two years on they've got themselves a new lead singer Ray whose glamorous largerthanlife rockstar lifestyle and ambitions clash with the quieter broodier more ballardloving songwriting base guitarist Les. With Keith's brother lead guitarist Brian the acknowledged heart soul and genius of the band set to follow Keith to the great rehab in the sky the band exits the limelight in an ignoble lightning explosion that mirrors the flames that engulf the band from within.Simmering with anger and bitterness the band complete with its two faithful roadies Hughie and Brian's girlfriend Karen seperate and go their seperate ways never to contact each other again... ... Until 20 years later the son of the promoter of their last ever gig approaches Tony the keyboard player whose life has deteriorated into refilling condom machines in resort bathrooms and asks Strange Fruit to reunite for an anniversary gig of their last infamous festival. Tracking down Karen now a frustrated hotel clerk with a divorce behind her and sulky teenage daughter looking over her shoulder he convinces her to climb on board. Together they begin the long hard process of tracking down the rest of the band members in the hopes of reforming Strange Fruit for one last gig to prove to the world they really did have what it took to be great.But their unresolved grudges threaten to tear them apart before they can even begin and when they finally track down the last missing member Brian to a single impersonal fax stating he died 5 years beforehand and bequeathed his Royalties to a cancer foundation in America the band are left with no option but to recruit young and naive guitarist Luke as a replacement. With time running out the heart of their group dead and old wounds festering like sores as they career from one disastrous gig to another can the band really bury the past before the past buries them?All the way through you can see exactly why the band fell apart and the issues that prevented them from ever jelling as the team they needed to be in order to achieve the heights they all knew they were capable of reaching. But slowly as the film progresses you begin to see what brought them together as a band as well. As they struggle to learn how to recapture the glory they gradually begin to understand what it is they've really lost. You can empathise with all the characters. Bill Nighy produces the best comic performance but Stephen Rea Juliet Aubrey and Bruce Robinson reveal the emotional core that shows how these people were so inescapably bound together regardless of whether they loved or hated each other.This is an excellent film. Worth watching at least once and in my opinion worth watching multiple times.".

The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came. Beano the drummer played by Timothy Spall who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker.

Brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hired to replace him.Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try. Abandoning their day jobs they begin to rehearse and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums. But he wants them to start touring again first. And so they hit the club circuit around Europe. The club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old rockers.It is on tour that the film really starts to develop. All of the old conflicts rearise with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering throughout. They all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier. And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable.Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members. While it is still a very funny movie it is the evolving characters struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work.".

Still Crazy is funny fastpaced and heartwarming and backed with some of the finest actors the UK has to offer it's a fantastic piece of entertainment and one that's fun returning to over and over again. It's a bit slow in its first half but by the ending it's irresistibly fun thanks to the wonderful characters every member of the band was welldeveloped as a believable and likable character and the contagious soundtrack.

When Karen calls Tony Brian as he attempts to kiss her it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black it's too funny for words.And the music it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room to All Over the World. Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him.

Former loving groupie turned patient understanding longsuffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an illadvised largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe.

Scraggly zonkedout roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy troubleplagued but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride.Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ringing flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of bighearted charm and tireless verve. The astute sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spoton dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow.

Washedup 70's rockers have another chance at stardom. The secret is in the amazing actors and the fabulous music. There isn't a bad performance in this film. Bill Nighy is amazing and Timothy Spall steals several scenes. Bruce Campbell only appears briefly but it was enough to renew the crush I'd had on him at 13 after seeing Romeo  Juliet. My only real complaint is that whoever did the casting felt that 29year old Juliet Aubrey is a contemporary of the actors portraying the band members who were in their 40's and 50's. Watch for Frances Barber in a brilliant but small role. The music is equally wonderful. I realize it was a bad time for music but I'm amazed these songs didn't get radio airplay. I love the music so much I picked up a copy used from Amazon. It's not a great film it's not a serious film but it's a film of which you will not tire.".

The plot revolves around a 60's70's band called Strange Fruit whose members decide to reunite in the late 90's.  Their lives are in shambles and they all seem to miss rock stardom so the reunion seems natural but before they know it they are reminded why the band broke up in the first place.  The squabbling bandmates are played by a great group of actors.  Their attempts to recapture their old magic are at first pathetic and hilarious but by the end of the second act you'll be rooting for these guys.  Billy Connolly plays the band's 'road dog' and he lights up the screen whenever he's on it. The direction Brian Gibson directed WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT and THE JOSEPHINE BAKER STORY and script are first rate as well.".

The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family  the parents have been separated for decades and Royal Gene Hackman is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house in an unnamed city of course. The children all geniuses and overachievers in their own way are then raised by Etheline Angelica Houston an archeologist. Chas Ben Stiller is a financial wizard Margot Gwyneth Paltrow is adopted and was a published playwright at 11 and Richie Luke Wilson is a tennis prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a financial wizard but having lost his wife in a plane accident is now the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St. Clair Bill Murray who is basically Anderson's muse is depressed and hasn't written in years and Richie after having a nervous breakdown on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by boat. Still hanging around is Eli Owen Wilson a longtime family friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant Henry Danny Glover and when Royal gets wind of this he embarks on a bid to win his family back after not speaking with them for years.Wes Anderson has an unusual style of filmmaking that has been static throughout his career. Highly theatrical almost in the style of a play he presents the story of the Tenenbaums to us as if it were taken directly from a book so much so that if you were to read the few sentences that are visible in the book that accompanies the beginning of each 'chapter' you would see that the written narrative follows the action to the letter. Anderson favors primary colors and characters that are identifiable by very distinct appearances. Chas and his sons have their red track suits they always wear Margot wears the clip in her hair Izod dresses from the 80's and dark eyeliner surrounding her eyes Richie wears the sweatband around his head Eli is in cowboy gear and Raleigh looks like a Freud knockoff. One of the results is that there are varying degrees of recognition for the actor in 'real life'. When seeing Raleigh it's easy to forget that it is Bill Murray and Margot for that matter is so different from how we are used to seeing Paltrow. Certainly this is Anderson's intent. Anderson also favors point of view shots characters looking directly at or addressing the camera and is also one of the few modern masters in the use of music. The soundtrack to 'The Royal Tenenbaums' features some classic songs Ruby Tuesday Hey Jude but also has some obscure tracks that are bizarre and fit into the scene beautifully.'The Royal Tenenbaums' has a phenomenal cast and all of the actors are excellent in the film. I get the strong impression that since Anderson isn't a mainstream film director Alist actors sign up to work for him because of his alternative vision and his obvious talent. When I watched this film recently I asked the two friends I saw it with what they thought and they both said 'It was quirky'. Since they are both film lovers I was a little disappointed in this narrow and obvious assessment of the film at first. Upon further reflection however I realized that they both come from households that have parents who are still together. Coming from a 'broken home' I can relate to the high dysfunction of the Tenenbaums as an adult and embrace the story beyond the presentation despite its highly stylized format. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is a brilliant film that is both emotional and eyecatching and truly cements Wes Anderson as an exciting and talented filmmaker. 910Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film they have to have a certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed by the Royal Tenenbaums I left with a certain kind of joy that only a great film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite it's that hard of a buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater I heard this couple talking about how stupid the movie was and how they are going to ask for a refund. I suddenly smiled because I hoped that they would get one. I think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside the frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a understanding for the material that they didn't.  What is so good about the Royal Tenenbaums?  The great detail in every frame from the costumes and they really are costumesto the design of Chas Margot and Richie rooms and the house. This is brilliant film on every level a delight for the senses and for the mind. This movie makes you think and without giving too much away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and their past.  High kudos go to Luke Wilson I loved his performance as the suffering Richie.  If you loved Rushmore there is no doubt that you will love this film because it is at par with it except that its a bit darker in tone.   I think its funny that way that people look at film we each love or hate a film based on our own perceptionand mind there are people who just watch film for entertainment. So if you have a complicated mind and you enjoy watching a challenging film then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As for me I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it. Thank you Wes Anderson so much. You made laugh you made me smile and I cried. A thousand times thank you!".

We can pity them.Those that enjoy Wes Anderson's films can be put into two categories. There are those that simply find them to be quirky joyrides and laugh them off as such.

It is epic filled with pageantry. Though categorized as a comedy at times it seems darker then typical black comedies  a drama or even a triumphant tragedy of life's unrealized outcasts.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film on TV and have never seen a director quite like Wes Anderson displaying his outlook on life so expertly. He and Owen Wilson have created a family beyond dysfunctional. Their underplayed script of various oddballs all with their own tale of despair is as leftfield as you'll find with each character and I stress this as pathetic as the next.Gene Hackman plays the lead role of Royal with huge confidence while Paltrow Margot Stiller Chaz and Owen and Luke Wilson Eli and Richie develop into fully fledged actors in their brilliant wellrounded performances. Anjelica Huston plays the strong matriarchal head of the family and gives the biggest whiff of normalcy from the film with Kumar Pallana the knife happy friendbutlercolleague at the opposite end of the spectrum. Along with Pallana's inspired creation comes Anderson's strongest hand  background players. Like the Coens he truly adores every character and you feel background with each one. Whether it be Danny Glover's sombre turn as Huston's love interest Royal's colleague and partner in deception or Buckley the dog. They carry the film and keep it fresh.The script is as above mentioned slowburning letting its characters develop with ease and no constraints. This sits perfectly with Anderson's patient camera and eye to present the story in a skittype basis which it very well may be with its spoton throw away oneliners. When pestered about the nature of his suicide note Richie replies wryly Of course it's dark It's a suicide note.Its along with these the acting and Andersons direction that Tenenbaums is promoted from simply a cult or indie classic into something so much more. The slow moments perfectly sober the funnier and give room for rest and perspective. It is also where the film delivers its most touching and poignant moments. The wedding scene is totally destroying and will levels the viewer flat. As with Richie's graphic suicide attempt and Royals ultimate demise in the company of his previously absent son.I cannot praise this film enough but I have tried.".

Gene Hackman is the father Angelica Huston the mother and the wacko kids  and other assorted strange characters  are played by Ben Stiller Owen and Luke Wilson Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Stiller Bill Murray and Danny Glover. This is mostly dry dark humor with some funny lines delivered in deadpan style. Nobody is particularly likable but  with the possible exception of Paltrow's character  are not really unlikeable either. They are just strange.I enjoyed viewing the house with all its colors.

	schema:reviewBody "They're creepy and they're kooky mysterious and spooky they're altogether ooky... Oops that's the wrong family isn't it? Oh well no matter. The Royal Tenenbaums could very well be considered the First Family of Fright for the new millennium. Their utterly twisted and often hilarious exploits bring to mind memories of that other lovably weird clan. But in terms of the little matter of family harmony the difference is like oil and water. Neat? Sweet? Petite? The Tenenbaums? No way. Director Wes Anderson's oddball showpiece opens in 1979. Royal Tenenbaum Gene Hackman in a performance that is nothing short of amazing a mustachioed chain smoker like Gomez Addams but nowhere near as attentive a father is separated from his levelheaded wife Ethel Anjelica Huston who ironically played the alwayscool Morticia in the two Addams films. They have three kids Chas Richie and adopted daughter Margot. Royal's blatant lack of interest in his children is the cause of the separation and he makes no bones about it either. He purposely shoots Chas in the hand with a BB gun and openly criticizes Margot's play among other things. And his reasoning for the separation? Well we made certain sacrifices by having children. Priceless. After his departure Ethel takes the children under her wing and they evolve into underage prodigies. Chas is a wealthy banker Margot a successful playwright and Richie a tennis pro sporting the nickname The Baumer. Disbarred and suddenly kicked out of a hotel room he's occupied for years Royal accompanied constantly by his Lurchlike Middle Eastern manservant Pagoda Kumar Pallana decides he wants to make amends for his actions by attempting to reunite with his estranged brood...even if it means faking a terminal illness. And that's when this delight of a movie really takes off. However things have changed during the 17 years Royal was separated from his family. The children have reached adulthood and are shadows of their former selves. Chas Ben Stiller constantly bedecked in red jogging suits  and black for funerals  is a widower with two young boys. Margot Gwyneth Paltrow complete with a Wednesday Addamsstyle blank glare is married to a much older man human study author Raleigh St. Clair Bill Murray and she spends six hours a day locked in her bathroom staring listlessly at the TV. Due to a childhood accident she now has nine and a half fingers. Richie Luke Wilson following a humiliating burnout during a televised match has become a recluse travelling the world by ship and communicating only through telegrams. Meanwhile Ethel is engaged to accountant Henry Sherman Danny Glover a Teddy bear in a blue suit. Oh and Richie just happens to be infatuated with his sister Margot. The wellpaced screenplay by Anderson and Owen Wilson who also has a supporting role as drugaddicted selfabsorbed Western author Eli Cash does a great job of fleshing out each of the main characters and as a result viewers will empathize with some of them no matter their motives. Although it's not an outright kneeslapping laugh fest one of Tenenbaums' best selling points is its aspect of physical comedy which actually provides more laughs than the spoken variety and adds to scenes instead of bogging them down as opposed to random pointless acts of slapstick that do nothing to advance the plot. The outrageous is turned into  the subtle and the results are hysterical moments such as Cash unexpectedly  walking off the set of a talk show Royal attempting to inject a little delinquency into Chas' straightarrow boys plus the funniest moment in the film Richie's embarrassing swan song on the tennis court. Just imagine say Pete Sampras helplessly flinging his racket at his opponent's serve or removing his shoes and socks and sitting forlornly on the ground. Then there's also a tour of Cash's quarters complete with a handy stash of marijuana plants a multitude of adult videos bearing colorful titles such as Dark and Dirty and a collection of large horrid paintings that even Salvador Dali would have considered repulsive. Throughout the film nutty covers of books scribed by family members over time randomly pop up and cover the entire screen like wallpaper. In fact the entire movie is played out much like a book complete with occasional chapter introductions preceding cuts to different scenes. The opening credits are shown in an impossibletoignore bold font that nearly usurps the screen. Although the aforementioned physical comedy is a hoot the verbal is definitely no slouch. The snappy dialogue is full of witty oneliners such as Royal's innovative use of adverbs when he describes Chas' late wife as a terribly attractive woman. When Margot informs Ethel that she's been a smoker for 22 years Ethel calmly replies I think you should quit. It's a nobrainer to say that the acting is through the roof. For such a large cast there is a striking chemistry among the actors as they become so immersed in their onscreen personalities. In turn the script is effective at balancing these roles out. Although Hackman is undoubtedly the star of the show the other family members are given their time in the spotlight and they are just as memorable as a result. The execution of the diverse soundtrack helps set the mood for both humorous and  foreboding moments from the Rolling Stones' Ruby Tuesday to film composer Mark Mothersbaugh's inspirational cover of the Beatles' Hey Jude. Royal's mischievous outing with Chas' sons is set to Paul Simon's classic Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard while Elliott Smith's dark Needle In The Hay is used effectively in a very disturbing scene. There's also plenty of classical mixed in with the classic rock including Vince Guaraldi's Christmas Time Is Here despite the fact that the movie takes place nowhere near Christmas and my alltime favorite piece Erik Satie's Gymnopedie No. 1. What took some points off the board was the fact that Hackman and Paltrow light up constantly. I despise smoking in movies but here it's barely significant in the grand scheme of things. The Royal Tenenbaums is a terrific film that is easily recommended for those who enjoy quirky offbeat yet intellectual humor or for those simply in need of a good laugh...heck it's great viewing for any warmblooded human being for that matter. Not since the Family Addams has household dysfunction been so much fun. Snap snap. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I still remember the first time I saw The Royal Tenenbaums. Principally it was the box art that drew me in  Ben Stiller dressed in a red tracksuit with two sons wearing the same clothing? Gene Hackman raising an alcoholic drink with a cheeky smile plastered across his face? Bill Murray? Both the Wilson brothers at the same time? Surely this would be one of the funniest films of all time with a cast like that how could it fail? Well I have to hand it to the art designers and the hype machine because they fooled me completely as The Royal Tenenbaums turned out to be one of those comedies that is offbeat dark and intelligent but forgets to be funny. Still I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment some times so I sat through the entire film and was rewarded for my perseverance with over two hours of utter tedium. Worse it is so depressing that by the time the credits started rolling I'd found myself suffering crippling emotional pains from a vast range of personal demons that up until that moment I wasn't aware I had.The story consists of Royal Tenenbaum Gene Hackman patriarch of his clan trying to reunite the family after years of mistrust and infighting. He brings them all together by feigning illness and sets about trying to rekindle family loyalty while the rest of them try to overcome their particular neuroses. Consequently pretty much the whole film consists of uninteresting selfobsessed New Yorkers moping around feeling sorry for themselves. Gwyneth Paltrow's character Margot for instance is depressed because...well because she is basically. Nigh on every character has but a single facial expression for the entire duration and can you guess what that expression is? It's despair. Agonising gutwrenching despair.In short this is just about the most overhyped selfindulgent piece of hipster rubbish I've ever seen. Hackman possesses his usual charisma but even he is not enough to save this train wreck of a comedy. The first time I saw it I thought it was more depressing than being stuck in a room with a recentlydumped teenage Goth reading poetry aloud. This week I stuck it on again just to see if I was mistaken in that judgement but nope I was right. If anything it's got more grim with age. Comedies are meant to be funny people!".

The previews made the picture out to be a comedy.After seeing 'The Royal Tenenbaums' I can't help thinking to myself 'why is this movie receiving any positive reviews at all?  Is it me?  Am I missing something?'I would not even recommend to people that they wait for the video to see this movie.  My only recommendation would be not to see it at all.The only humour in this movie takes place in the preview.Bill Murray is wasted as Ms. Paltrow's husband.  I couldn't help thinking from his and Gwyneth's expressions that a funeral was about to break out around them.  Ben Stiller has never been unfunnier I know unfunnier' is not really a word.  He seems shorter in this movie can't blame the director for that I suppose.  The recurring Dalmatian mouse gag is annoying unfunny and too obvious. When the movie focused on the relationship between Danny Glover and Anjelica Huston it was even more boring than the other boring parts in the movie.Rushmore' and Bottle Rocket' were clever and witty.  'The Royal Tenenbaums' is neither.  Are peculiar characters alone funny?  Anderson and Wilson seem to think so.By the end of the movie you really don't care what happens to the characters you just want to get out of theatre and start warning people not to see this movie.I know people will disagree with my views regarding this movie and so be it.  But if you read this and go see the movie you can't say Johnny Chill didn't try to warn you.".

My only recommendation would be not to see it at all.The only humour in this movie takes place in the preview.Bill Murray is wasted as Ms. Paltrow's husband.  I couldn't help thinking from his and Gwyneth's expressions that a funeral was about to break out around them.  Ben Stiller has never been unfunnier I know unfunnier' is not really a word.  He seems shorter in this movie can't blame the director for that I suppose.  The recurring Dalmatian mouse gag is annoying unfunny and too obvious. When the movie focused on the relationship between Danny Glover and Anjelica Huston it was even more boring than the other boring parts in the movie.Rushmore' and Bottle Rocket' were clever and witty.  'The Royal Tenenbaums' is neither.  Are peculiar characters alone funny?  Anderson and Wilson seem to think so.By the end of the movie you really don't care what happens to the characters you just want to get out of theatre and start warning people not to see this movie.I know people will disagree with my views regarding this movie and so be it.  But if you read this and go see the movie you can't say Johnny Chill didn't try to warn you.";

Make that pretentious lint In truth Anderson may be a great director he certainly hasn't created anything that would put him into my handful of choices yet and Owen Wilson may be a great actor ditto handful of great actors despite his recent career trajectory. But neither of them are accomplished enough writers to pull this comedy of dysfunction off and it shows all too obviously here.So is it fair to blame Wilson and Anderson for not being say Charlie Kaufman here? Yeah I think sothey just can't write their way out of this messthey write into it instead if you get my drift without really exploring anything new or interesting.So while all of the surface marks of literacy are shown again and again in the filmand played up alltooostentatiously they all remain on the surface.And even a surface comedy or satire would be OK if the film was all farce or signaled its own problems. In the end though it asks us to believe that its own meanness is somehow insightfulnot parody at all.

That said I can only state that as black comedies go this isn't even beige. Did anyone tell Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson their screenplay was just plain boring? Mr. Anderson perhaps had something else in mind when he thought about this project. The idea of a dysfunctional family sounds great but in the treatment of the material on screen it doesn't materialize. It's about one of the dullest films of the year in spite of the overblown praise from all critics toward this movie which does not come up to Mr. Anderson's previous directing efforts.It's a shame because of all the talent amassed in this picture. The best thing in it is Gene Hackman. He is an actor that's always interesting to watch. His Royal Tenenbaum is not a fully formed character but I would pay to see Mr. Hackman read from the Yellow Pages any time rather than to see him in a misguided attempt at comedy.Gwyneth Paltrow character is boring. And so are the brothers Wilson and Ben Stiller. Angelica Houston is very dignified in her role but you don't believe for a nanosecond that after what she went through with Royal she would walk to the altar ever again. Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman who were so incredible in Rushmore don't have anything to do here. The narrative device is sophomoric at best. So the best advice to all the fans is to wait until it comes out in DVD. Who knows it might even play better....".

	schema:headline " Hilariously tragic is a great way to describe this outstanding quirky comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "In spite of what you may have heard The Royal Tenenbaums is a comedy. Most people you may have heard it from were probably expecting another Meet the Parents which I can assure you it is not. It is among the quirkiest movies you're likely to see. What other word other than quirky can accurately describe a movie that finds bizarre humor in the lives of a complete failure of a family?The plot is always fascinating and consistently entertaining. The three Tenenbaum children Richie Luke Wilson Margot Gweneth Paltrow and Chas Ben Stiller were geniuses growing up who each accomplished more in their childhood than most people do in their entire lives. Richie became a champion tennis player by age 17 Margot wrote plays and won a Pulitzer prize in 9th grade and Chas a financial expert started a real estate company in his early teens. Unfortunately they lacked support from their obnoxious father Royal Gene Hackman and when their glory ended the family became estranged from one another and each of the three kids became a neurotic mess of an adult with Margot being unhappily married to a neurologist Raleigh St. Clair Bill Murray Chas being an overprotective father to his two sons after a family tragedy and Richie spending all his time at sea. When Royal finds out that his exwife Etheline Anjelica Huston is contemplating marrying Henry Sherman Danny Glover he fakes a terminal illness hoping to find redemption and acceptance from his estranged family. Meanwhile a family friend Eli Cash Owen Wilson is struggling with a drug problem.It's a story full of tragedy and sadness and yet the movie manages to be hilarious. It usually seems as if the movie isn't even trying to be funny as the tone is always kept rather dark and often gloomy. The extremely subtle humor is all based around sadness. Each joke ends in tragedy and each tragedy ends in a joke. Of course ignorant viewers won't find the film funny and be highly disappointed. After repeated viewings gradually becoming one of my favorite movies this movie makes me laugh out loud frequently. But once again despite the presence of various comedic talents Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Luke Wilson Bill Murray this film is NOT like most films they're famous for and people expecting slapstick and toilet humor will hate the film. But if you appreciate it for the strange quirk fest that it is you'll find a lot to enjoy here.The production design is truly brilliant and the locations are fun to look at. The props in the film are abundant and wonderfully strange pointless to the average moviegoer.

	onyx:emotionText "In spite of what you may have heard The Royal Tenenbaums is a comedy. Most people you may have heard it from were probably expecting another Meet the Parents which I can assure you it is not. It is among the quirkiest movies you're likely to see. What other word other than quirky can accurately describe a movie that finds bizarre humor in the lives of a complete failure of a family?The plot is always fascinating and consistently entertaining. The three Tenenbaum children Richie Luke Wilson Margot Gweneth Paltrow and Chas Ben Stiller were geniuses growing up who each accomplished more in their childhood than most people do in their entire lives. Richie became a champion tennis player by age 17 Margot wrote plays and won a Pulitzer prize in 9th grade and Chas a financial expert started a real estate company in his early teens. Unfortunately they lacked support from their obnoxious father Royal Gene Hackman and when their glory ended the family became estranged from one another and each of the three kids became a neurotic mess of an adult with Margot being unhappily married to a neurologist Raleigh St. Clair Bill Murray Chas being an overprotective father to his two sons after a family tragedy and Richie spending all his time at sea. When Royal finds out that his exwife Etheline Anjelica Huston is contemplating marrying Henry Sherman Danny Glover he fakes a terminal illness hoping to find redemption and acceptance from his estranged family. Meanwhile a family friend Eli Cash Owen Wilson is struggling with a drug problem.It's a story full of tragedy and sadness and yet the movie manages to be hilarious. It usually seems as if the movie isn't even trying to be funny as the tone is always kept rather dark and often gloomy. The extremely subtle humor is all based around sadness. Each joke ends in tragedy and each tragedy ends in a joke. Of course ignorant viewers won't find the film funny and be highly disappointed. After repeated viewings gradually becoming one of my favorite movies this movie makes me laugh out loud frequently. But once again despite the presence of various comedic talents Ben Stiller Owen Wilson Luke Wilson Bill Murray this film is NOT like most films they're famous for and people expecting slapstick and toilet humor will hate the film. But if you appreciate it for the strange quirk fest that it is you'll find a lot to enjoy here.The production design is truly brilliant and the locations are fun to look at. The props in the film are abundant and wonderfully strange pointless to the average moviegoer. Wes Anderson dedicates himself to making every detail of the family's weirdness fully evident and the family's house particularly the kid's bedrooms is full of stuff you'd be likely to find at most European art shows and Sky Mall magazines.

I was recently at a French Film festival where I had the privilege of seeing this masterpiece and I loved it! It shows therapy in a positive light as less of a last resort and rather as a way to prevent problems before they start by seeking within yourself for solutions. It reveals many bad habits of blame and self pity we have and how they we can unintentionally hurt our relations with others. It also carries a positive message of the ability of an individual to take their lives into their own hands and turn it in their favor. Don't get me wrong oui mais.. isn't just about life lessons. It's an enthralling beautiful film that is also insightful. In today's commercial hollywood a film this good and this meaningful is a rare find. The protagonist Egalantine is a highschool girl who is at a important point in her life. She faces sexual pressure from her boyfriend responsibility and guilt from her mother who is in an unhappy marriage as well as selfinduced stress. The movie is about her quest for balance and meaning in her life as she enters adulthood and Yves Lavandier does an excellent job! By the end Egalantine has gained selfesteem has experienced sex as a beautiful precious experience and has washed her hands of her mother's personal problems. It was a very satisfying ending as the audience felt as if they had been tackling the obstacles with Egalantine. I definitely came out of the movie feeling victorious. Overall an excellent film! Go see it if you are able! And if any American film people are reading this please consider bringing oui mais... to the american market. I know my friends will love it just as much as I did!".

In short how to become a mature grown up not being totally fed up. Interesting  entertaining. Universal  particular. What do you look for in movies? Me? certainly nothing more than that! A nice moment that lasts more in my mind than the time one hour and a half that I have been spending in the theater! ";

It's a story about love and freedom trust and sex. It put a lot of emphasis on respect how not for the girl to become a simple mean of satisfaction. The teenagers characters and the psychiatrist are profound. The parents may appear like a cartoon. Maybe it was necessary in order to focus more on the three heroes. I enjoyed very much this movie light and profound. There is a good rhythm no endless and windy dialogs like we can find in numerous french movies. The humor is frequent in light touches.".

In fact the therapist plays the part of the expert narrator of the film as well as playing one of the main characters in an unusual dramatic construction which the director Yves Lavandier uses very skillfully. The narrator describes in documentary style the variety of games people play against each other in their unhealthy relationships while showing brief scenes to illustrate the unhealthy and selfdestructive nature of these games. The characters portrayed in these scenes turn out to be principle characters in the narrative part of the film and Director Lavandier weaves the narrative in and out of the documentary and narrative modes of storytelling without breaking the flow and the dramatic momentum. The teenage girl Eglantine is a delightful if slightly confused character who is under pressure from her mother and from her boyfriend and engages in telling halftruths and white lies to cover for both of them which puts her in some difficult positions. The narrator who becomes her therapist guides her skillfully in a way no therapist I have ever met can do. Perhaps France has better psychotherapy practitioners than we do in the US. Clearly the director of this film understands psychotherapy and human relationships and has made a film which is both delightful and educational. Truly a joy to watch and learn from.".

Both the villains are effective Warner Anderson as the unscrupulous what else?womanizing businessman and Michael Pate as the sinister gloved gunman Lewis seems to have a thing about gunman wearing gloves. Anderson's line deliveries are extremely flat and matter of fact which just makes him that much more detestable somehow. He's like a greed machine no heart no emotion whatsoever.At first glance this may seem like no more than just another passable western but it's got some meat on its bones.

They've finally settled on Pate who does beat Scott to the draw and folks think he's been killed. Warner Anderson is a particularly smarmy villain. He's got designs on Angela Lansbury who's a touring musical performer in town for a few performances. He's also been romancing the wife of the biggest rancher in the area played by Jean Parker and he says openly that it was only for his own amusement. That remark costs him dear in the movie later on.Scott has a particularly brutal fight scene with Don Megowan who's the brother of a man Scott kills in the first 15 minutes of the film.

Someone beats Matt Dillon to the draw and Doc Adams pretends he's dead and in the meantime works furiously to save his life. Here that role is taken by town doctor Wallace Ford. Both Randolph Scott and James Arness live to best the villain but the story is how in both cases and I won't say more.A good cast of veteran Hollywood performers makes A Lawless Street a pleasure to watch.

So it's not unsurprising to find that A Lawless Street is some way short of the quality of the BoetticherScott movies. In fact Scott may not just be in character for the film he looks genuinely tired which is in keeping with the very tired feel of it all.It has proved to be a pretty divisive film amongst Western purists the routine story not helped by the fact it has been done to perfection before in other more notable genre pieces. While the script also lacks vim and vigour and Scott is surrounded by very average actors. The ending fizzles out after the promise of so much more and in fact it's ponderously drawn out. Yet the first half of the film saves it from being a stinker Lewis' camerawork is fluid and fist fight fans are served up a treat. And we even get Lansbury flexing her tonsils for a delightful little ditty.So it's very much a film of two differing halves one that sadly doesn't make for a satisfying whole. Much like Switzerland I'm staying neutral with it a 510 rating is given on proviso that it's noted that where Scott and Lewis are concerned I'm unashamedly biased.".

It just lies there and snarls waiting for a chance to pounce on you. Be careful Calem is Molly's helpful advice. A Lawless Street is the story of Calem Ware Randolph Scott and his determination to bring law and order to Medicine Bend. Unknown to Ware there is a faction in town determined to run things wide open. Money  big money  is involved. This means Ware has to be taken care of. A hired killer with a draw as fast as Calem's might be the answer. Complicating matters for Ware is the arrival of Tally Dickerson Angela Lansbury a music hall singer engaged to play with her troupe at the town's new opera house. Nine years ago the two were man and wife then Tally left him. They're still married. I didn't know what it was like for a man to make his living with his gun Tally tells Caleb when they meet again walking the streets a living target. I died a little more each day and I died more at night. Even Lansbury can't do much with lines like that. The movie is packed with such poor writing that we don't believe a minute of it. The script is full of characters who tell each who they are and what motivates them instead of demonstrating this. At frequent intervals an outofbreath minor character rushes up to Caleb to announce another crisis is at hand. Thank goodness we have Scott's steadfastness to believe in and the smiling sleaziness of John Emery playing one of the bad guys to enjoy. The writing is so poor it makes even a fine actress like Angela Lansbury sound like someone from a daytime soap opera. We have Lansbury singing and dancing once but I'd swear her singing was dubbed a strange decision. Although I thought the movie might be interesting with the odd duo of a 57yearold Randolph Scott with the 30yearold Angela Lansbury the pairing seemed uncomfortable and unlikely. The film's modest pleasures come from a handful of longtime character actors such as Wallace Ford who died a memorable death in a steam room in Blood on the Sun Ruth Donnelly always good in many movies as the often irascible but goodhearted motherly type and of course Emery. I always admired the way he tried to put the moves on Ingrid Bergman in Spellbound.".

It just lies there and snarls waiting for a chance to pounce on you. Be careful Calem is Molly's helpful advice. A Lawless Street is the story of Calem Ware Randolph Scott and his determination to bring law and order to Medicine Bend. Unknown to Ware there is a faction in town determined to run things wide open. Money  big money  is involved. This means Ware has to be taken care of. A hired killer with a draw as fast as Calem's might be the answer. Complicating matters for Ware is the arrival of Tally Dickerson Angela Lansbury a music hall singer engaged to play with her troupe at the town's new opera house. Nine years ago the two were man and wife then Tally left him. They're still married. I didn't know what it was like for a man to make his living with his gun Tally tells Caleb when they meet again walking the streets a living target. I died a little more each day and I died more at night. Even Lansbury can't do much with lines like that. The movie is packed with such poor writing that we don't believe a minute of it.

	schema:reviewBody "Randolph Scott made a ton of Westerns and you could almost always rely on them to be wellacted intelligently written and a bit better than the genre. While this film certainly doesn't stand out among these many films it certainly is good and worthwhileparticularly if you've become a Randolph Scott fan like me.I liked how this film didn't deny that Scott was getting older. He plays a sheriff with a fast gun who realizes that he's made a lot of enemies by enforcing the law over the yearsand his reflexes aren't exactly as good as they used to be. I loved how he took a nap by locking himself in one of his back jail cellsso that no one could sneak up on him! Scott deals with a couple angry jerks looking to take him down near the beginning of the film. I particularly loved the barber's chair sceneI wasn't too surprised by it but it was handled well. However now he has something different to deal witha greedy and amoral gambler who is determined to get rid of the sheriff once and for all. So he brings in a hired gun who soon shoots Scott. Now this is the only real problem with the film. It expects us to believe that a gunman who hates Scott shoots him from about fifteen feet and the bullet somehow glances off Scott's head! Even I could have made this shot and I'm no gunslinger! So you are expected to believe this and not question this plot line for the rest of the film to work. However I was able to temporarily suspend disbelief and liked what happened next.The acting and writing are fine and Scott is helped by having some excellent support in the film. It's a good old fashioned story about one man defying the oddssomewhat like HIGH NOON or RIO BRAVO. I especially liked how it all ended.Memorable and worth seeing though look for the Scott films directed by Budd Boetticher to see his best film or his final film that was directed by Sam Peckinpah.".

It's a familiar story one made famous by High Noon this time with marshal Randolph Scott having a legendary reputation that makes dishonest men seek revenge and the women who love him leave him rather than watch him increase the notches on his gun.Somebody is out to get him obviously putting a hit on him through an old enemy who ends up dead himself . The arrival of stage actress Angela Lansbury stirs the pot even more with her engagement to ruthless Warner Anderson who has his own plans for Scott. A ton of veteran actors support Scott and Lansbury including the salty Ruth Donnelly hysterically funny as a restaurant proprietor who flirts with Scott while looking out for him like a mother Wallace Ford as the town doctor Frank Ferguson as the loyal saloon owner and Jean Parker as an aging glamor girl who seems to have mixed dealings. Jeanette Nolan is featured as the widow of the man Scott killed in self defense while Don Megowan is excellent as her brother inlaw who hates guns and knew his brother deserved what he got yet can't help but seek revenge. His performance reminded me of Lon Chaney Jr. in Of Mice and Men.Lansbury is a stronger female lead than Grace Kelly in High Noon getting to perform a musical number from the very first American musical The Black Crook. While I couldn't confirm it she did sound like it was her singing although it's far less brassier than how she sounded in  Mame. Scott is excellent although he lacks the emotional conflict of Gary Cooper. Still there are enough sides in his character to make him very complex. This isn't a classic western by any means but it has enough tension to keep your interest.".

This is for me in some respects an outstanding western. I would like to explain why. American western movies are often not very realistic . I give you some examples 1. heroic main characters are often good looking handsome which is not really what disturbs me and know how to use a gun or knife 2. the characters are mostly simple straightforward there is the good and there is the evil 3. the movies make us believe that the wild west bustled with a few reasonable and righteous people and astonishingly out of 200 adult inhabitants of a town 190 are cowards or villains or lynchers and of course miserable people or everything altogether which one could find in the gutter of humankind outside town the rate is a little more favourable something I cannot believebecause I do not want to believe that we Europeans only sent the sludge of our civilization over the ocean. 4.as for shooting! Shootings in American western movies! A world in itself. I wonder whether writers directors are aware that this is always the most unrealistic part in their films. In every western movie you see somebody shooting with an old muzzle loader 5 miles and kick the rider from the horse in every movie you see cowboys shooting from the hip without aiming on a silver dollar thrown into the air you guess they hit not to speak that villains do not get their opponents although they fire from close distance let us say 20 centimeters hundreds of broadsides while the sheriff is shooting back with one single shot between the eyes of the five bandits. This reminds me to war films where the American guys are outnumbered by their enemies who have a tremendous arsenal of weapons which turn out to be completely useless whereas the American guy swiftly and heroically kills with his Colt a whole batallion. What is this nonsense for? Life is not like High Noon. But sometimes it is good to believe it right? I stop the list here to come to the man like a devil. What an incredible scene! The sheriff has a shootout with the villain and what happens? I could hardly believe my eyes. The sheriff is felled  although not deadly. The gangster prevails! When it comes to the second shooting the sheriff is clever enough not to risk a fair duel.Right so! That is something I can take. Can You remember the scene where Rob Roy desperately holds the sabre of the opponent who is going to kill him in the next moment with his bare hand?! The big man has no chance in the fair fight against the small but capable adversary but he has a helping idea. That is how you have to go against the rat pack of this world which is often more powerful more skilled. This western movie has some astonishing aspects and therefore I honour him with 8 asterics. By the way Randolph Scott is in his western movies always already a senior. It is the same in true life. Do not expect too much from the youngstersusually they wet their trousers in difficult situations!".

It doesn't help that Scott was sixty eight at the time of filming with Lansbury looking quite lovely at thirty years of age. My image of Lansbury was formed during her Murder She Wrote days so catching her as a saloon gal singing 'Mother Says I Mustn't' is just a bit too far removed for me to process. Although I have seen her in other early pictures she made so I guess I shouldn't be surprised when she shows up looking glam any more.Though it was relevant to the story of an aging town marshal attempting to wait out the transition from lawlessness to civilized society I don't think I've seen another Western where so many of a town's citizens were looking for the lawman to retire. With a pretty good record of keeping the peace you'd think they'd want him to hang around some more. That angle probably could have been written somewhat better it kept distracting me every time Molly Ruth Donnelly or Doc Wynn Wallace Ford tried to convince Calem Ware Scott to retire.One scene I had trouble with was the showdown between gunslinger Harley Baskam Michael Pate and the marshal. It didn't even look like Ware went for his gun almost as if he was accepting the forced retirement some of the folks of Medicine Bend were recommending. Talk about a tough way to go. I've been watching Hugh O'Brian in his Wyatt Earp TV series and he made it a regular practice to crease bad guys in the head but I have this nagging suspicion that it wouldn't have been all that easy to do. Here it looked like Ware was a goner even if the shot by Baskam went astray I'm sure he was aiming for the body.But as usual in these Fifties oaters the formula brings Calem back around to face his enemies another day and less than twenty four hours or so since he got plugged. Using the old 'under the swinging door' trick Ware takes out Baskam who already had his gun drawn in what would have been an unfair shootout. If you've been in enough westerns like Scott I guess you knew how to make things work out.".

I looked forward to finding a better than average vehicle for Mr Scott in 'A Lawless Street' and for the first 20mins was almost convinced it might be delivered. There were good one liners and some depthy observations about the character of pending evil. It even featured some very strong cinematography where it was obvious the D.O.P and director were working very well together. Some well staged action scenes also gave it a little more class. Then sadly it all came to gruelling stop  the tired ole clichs were trolled out and dialog sounded like it was being lifted from a dozen subpar TV westerns. It was as if the filmmakers had been told they were over budget and the film's release date had been moved forward. As for Scott's leading lady a surprisingly good looking Angela Lansbury  who did a saucy saloon number in a revealing costume  also seemed above average for this movie. But here again the script left her fumbling to convince and she was simply far too young for the aging marshal. Some other better than average costars performed believably but overall the cardboard characters and banal script  left it all in the lower B western category. Pity I had hoped for a better outcome. Still maybe one day I'll find a decent copy of Westbound  another Scott western with quality costars and some reasonable writing that fared better than most but is rarely found available in any form of 'Studio Quality' DVD. Warner Archives anyone?".

	schema:headline " Another Version of High Noon";
	schema:reviewBody "Anybody who knows anything about Hollywood westerns from the 1950s knows that John Wayne loathed Fred Zinnemann's High Noon because Gary Cooper's sheriff sought help from the cowardly townspeople and nobody other than his Quaker wife can to his aid. Red River director Howard Hawks and Wayne waited seven years later and made Rio Bravo as a corrective to High Noon. Clearly neither Wayne nor Hawks saw Gun Crazy director Joseph H. Lewis' town taming oater A Lawless Street 1955 with rugged squarejawed Randolph Scott who plays a town marshal under similar circumstances. The big difference here is Scott doesn't go searching for help from the townspeople. As it turns out the townspeople realize by fadeout that they had let their town marshal shouldered too much of the burden while they refused to behave responsibly and share the burden of maintaining safety with the town. Early in the action one of the villains observes that half of the people in Medicine Bend are too yellow to fight back and the other half are in the pocket of the villainous businessmen. Indeed the town marshal surrenders both his star and his sixgun after he has cleaned up the town and departs in a buggy with his wife Angela Lansbury of Murder She Wrote after a lengthy separation between them because she could not tolerate the anxiety as a lawman's spouse.The town of Medicine Bend is about to take on renewed life as a mining boom town because the captains of industry are going to do the smelting in town instead of shipping the ore hundreds of miles out of town. The economic forces behind this move are unscrupulous businessman Hamer Thorne Warner Anderson of The Caine Mutiny and saloon entrepreneur Cody Clark John Emery of Spellbound and they mean to get things underway by hiring a professional gunslinger Harley Baskam Michael Pate of Hondo to liquidate the star packer Caleb Ware Randolph Scott of The Tall T and Baskam beats Caleb on the draw in Cody's saloon. The catch is that Baskam's bullet puts a part in Caleb's skull and Dr. Amos Wynn Wallace Ford of Freaks conceals this vital information from everybody. While the villains are living high wide and handsome Wynn has managed to stash Caleb in his own jail to recuperate. Thorne and Clark are either buying out everybody else in Medicine Bend who supported Caleb or killing them. One irate saloon owner Abe Deland Frank Ferguson of Johnny Guitar refuses to sell out. He grabs a gun behind his bar but the gimleteyed Baskam drills him. Meantime Thorne and Clark ride out to the sprawling ranch of Asaph Dean James Bell of Blood on the Sun who initially empowered Caleb to pin on the star three years earlier. A professional town tamer Caleb has survived many attempts on his life and two from killers hired by the sleazy Cody. In the first instance our stalwart hero is relaxing in a barber's chair getting a shave when a thirdrate gunman Dingo Brion Frank Hagney of Fighting Caravans enters glimpses the marshal's gun and gun belt hanging up nearby out of reach and brandishes his own sixshooter to make short order of him. Caleb surprises his adversary and plugs him twice with a derringer concealed beneath the sheet covering him. Scenes with heroes surviving shootouts in barber shops in westerns are numerous such as in Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter and Tonino Valerii's My Name Is Nobody. The second instance involves a mustached Hispanic with a knife Juan Tobrez Don Carlos of Wyoming Renegades who throws and misses Caleb. Under the circumstances Hispanics could clamor about racial stereotyping because a Mexican wielded a knife. Appropriately Cody comes to Caleb's aid and guns down the Mexican largely because he hired the knifeslinger! Ultimately Caleb meets his match in Baskam and they duel in the traditional western sense in Cody's saloon. Caleb receives a serious head wound but he doesn't die. When Baskam steps forward to deliver a coup de grace Dr. Wynn pulls a gun on the gunslinger and explains that Caleb is dead. Meantime a subplot that smolders on a back burner involves performing artist and vocalist Tally Dickenson Angela Lansbury who turns out to be Caleb's estranged wife. When he was the lawman in Apache Wells he was constantly in jeopardy and she couldn't handle it so she abandoned him. Thorne has imported her into Medicine Bend but he doesn't know that she is estranged from Caleb. Some days pass and Caleb emerges from his enforced confinement and tangles with Baskam again but he doesn't give him a fair chance. In this respect Caleb's action predate John Wayne's action against sharpshooting gunslinger Christopher George in El Dorado. Altogether A Lawless Street qualifies as an intelligent aboveaverage horse opera with Randolph Scott that doesn't wear out its welcome at 78minutes.".

Were the murdered men victims or villains? Or pawns in something larger? Are we looking for a mad scientist or an urban legend brought to life? Is the political unrest in Paris related to the case or just a backdrop for it? It borrows elements from both science fiction and fantasy as well as being rooted in the detective genre.Now I probably have a higher than average liking for twisted fantastic genrebending movies that make one's brain hurt but even so there were some serious holes in the plot or at least things that never really were well explained.

In this film legendary reallife convictturneddetective Franois Vidocq Grard Depardieu lives again in 1830 Paris.  The pacing and story are both amazing.  Pitof and Grang have done such a wonderful job of creating and establishing this horrifying plot and whipping it up into a frenzy that it is impossible to not get swept away by it.  The cast is also amazing with everyone turning in fantastic performances.  A truly great film!This is one of the first major motion pictures worldwide to employ a fully digital process in its making including digital cameras.  This adaptation has proven to be a lovely proving ground for this new process.  Many of the exterior and interior sets and decorations were constructed by computer and add a sense of detail and accuracy of time and history to 1830 Paris that would otherwise be impossible.The special effects and fight sequences are fantastic with many surreal nightmarish visions that will haunt your for weeks.  There are so many amazing things about this film!  For example I've never heard pitiful mewling til I saw 'Vidocq'.  Once you see this film you'll know what I mean and it will disturb you to your core.  It's a film that is at once beautiful and repulsive.  There's lots of intrigue conspiracy horror suspense mystery romance of a sort everything you could want from a film. See Vidocq!".

When an action movie has an empty plot evcerybody complains when it has a good plot everybody says it should have been better and not waste its potential. Are you critics nuts ?!! Some attack this movie claiming that its nothing like french a Matrix wannabe. Well i wish Matrix had been such a good movie and had such a good story as VIDOCQ has. And if this is just an imitation i want a sequel ! As for the Sony Camera style well it was filmed with one what do you expect ?! Is that a bad thing ?! It made me want to go out and buy one just to try and make a movie like this. And those closeups look great and realy show how the personalities of some of the characters are distorted and nuts. Brilliant editing also.I loved the story the actors and graphicaly is one of the most inovative movies ive seen in recent years. It was not an expensive production but looks better than most of Hollyood Blockbusters of the last 20 years at least. The genius of this movie is in actualy making us believe that much more money was spent on it than what actualy was. This is the proof you dont need a big budget to make a big film. All it takes is imagination.Visualy it couldnt have been better. The settings are amazing the computer graphics blend in and add to the visual feel and the atmosphere is incredible. Great action sequences great mistery and great characters. Above all an original concept wich is something that Hollywood cant say that it has nowadays.Ive loved this movie so much that i bought it from the French Amazon store just a couple of hours ago and i only saw it at the theater last night. Its a double dvd edition and it has plenty of extra material and i cant wait to get my hands on it.One of the best European fantasy movies since La Cite des Enfants Perdus and another great french movie. French cinema nowadays has been a great alternative from Hollywood crap. Merci French guys !  After seeing such crap as the latest Arnie Shwarzenneger movie its great to have a REAL GOOD movie to watch and see how real cinema should be. Hollywood take notes. No realy. Take notes this is how you make a very interesting action movie with style but also with substance.VIDOCQ is a true masterpiece. More please !".

Depardieu stars his 116th film! in a striking tale of 1830's supernatural murder set in Paris which would make an excellent double bill with From Hell. Vidocq was a real historical personage and a genuine founder of modern French criminology  though this is a highly fictionalised part of a part of his life inspired by the 'orrible crimes of contemporary penny dreadfuls and the likes of Spring Heeled Jack than by any real facts. The film is shot entirely on high quality video and so visually it is completely different to a regular film. The sometimes disconcerting loss of depth of field brought by the format is compensated for by an immediacy and high impact in close ups as well as an amazing and presumably inexpensive flexibility in shots and special effects. Watching it I was reminded of what a BBC costume drama would be like on acid and could also see indebtedness to Phantom of the Opera Sherlock Holmes and perhaps Blade... All in all I thought this the best French fantasy I have seen since Brotherhood of the Wolf  admittedly a small field especially if one draws a veil over the dismal Belphagor Phantom of the Louvre. Worth seeing if you like your fantasy dark Gallic and hectic. A notable credit in the art department on Vidocq is Marc Caro another Jeunet collaborator who creates a convincing and claustrophobic world of political upheaval crowded streets menacing glass works and a range of grotesques. Some great scenes EG the two men set on fire by lightning bolts set to the elegant music of Vivaldi while the three or four main fight scenes are handled excitingly. Vidocq is such a strong character that this film cries out for a sequel. But Pitof is now apparently working on Catwoman and going by this his is a stylish if rather in your face talent. The HK DVD is excellent although there are occasional glitches in the subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spectacular supernatural thriller set in Paris in the year 1830. The movie looks and feels like Se7en meets The City of Lost Children. The film stars wellknown French actor Gerard Depardieu as Eugne Vidocq a former criminal turned detective. Vidocq really existed and may well have invented the private eye business as we know it. While the man was real this story however is fictional involving a series of bizarre murders and a mysterious character who wears a mask that reflects like a mirror.The movie is reportedly the first film recorded with a digital camera the same equipment used in Star Wars Ep. II reportedly resulting in crystalclear images. Not only that but many of the scenes were digitally enhanced giving the movie a surreal feel not dissimilar to some other oddball French movies like the aforementioned City of Lost Children at least some of the same people were involved in the production design of both so that may not be surprising.Some of the action scenes are quite spectacular in a few scenes we see Vidocq take on the maskedcloaked villain and comparisons to both both The Matrix and SW Ep. I suddenly seem inevitable. This is not to say this movie is a ripoff  no far from it. It's a joy to behold. Also the movie has a good soundtrack dark  heavy fitting the movie's subject matter and reminding me of the soundtracks of movies like Batman  Bram Stoker's Dracula.This is one movie well worth checking out. Highly recommended.".

Not only that but many of the scenes were digitally enhanced giving the movie a surreal feel not dissimilar to some other oddball French movies like the aforementioned City of Lost Children at least some of the same people were involved in the production design of both so that may not be surprising.Some of the action scenes are quite spectacular in a few scenes we see Vidocq take on the maskedcloaked villain and comparisons to both both The Matrix and SW Ep. I suddenly seem inevitable. This is not to say this movie is a ripoff  no far from it. It's a joy to behold. Also the movie has a good soundtrack dark  heavy fitting the movie's subject matter and reminding me of the soundtracks of movies like Batman  Bram Stoker's Dracula.This is one movie well worth checking out. Highly recommended.";

I did not find the special FX better than in other big budget movies but different finally something original kind of an nightmarish apocalyptic surrounding... The storyline had some nice parts to it but we could have had more. Depardieu was pretty good Dussollier as well as opposed to a dreadful Guillaume Canet...Overall an interesting movie with pluses and minuses I was glad to see it but I won't buy the DVD.... 610".

But being a French movie is a real plus here. The story took place in 1830 France. The country was in disarray after repeated changes in government. The setting is dark and depressing. Everywhere you can see people are suffering. It's in their attitudes their clothes their environment. This is not something you will see in other movies of this period. Characters' movement are splendid especially the ChineseFrench woman whose name I forgot. Her movement makes this movie looks like art. I know that this movie is a horror film but it's an artful horror. The plus side of being French is that it doesn't stick to the Hollywoodstyle horror. Its emphasis on emotions and audiences' feelings make this movie outstanding comparing to Hollywood's. Summay This movie is definitely R violence nudity I guess. So it your are over 18 give it a try. You'll find it enjoyable even if you're not horror fan. However if you dislike the genre this one may not be powerful enough to change your mind.".

I found the story very confusing and even worse most story lines are not worked out properly which is a basic requirement for a good movie.I have made similar comments about other movies here at IMDB. A good story properly worked out is essential to me. In this case the movie still gets a 4 out of 10 because of some good photography and the high quality of the digital images. Another strong point of criticism is that not only the story but also the characters are not worked out as they should. Psychology and motives for the crimes remain as obscure as the atmosphere in which the story is set. I read that Vidocq really existed. Well I would be highly interested to learn something about him. This movie failed to do so. There are some good effects but there is nothing special about these any more. We can see them in almost every movie nowadays. For me the reasons for the commercial flop are obvious.".

	schema:headline " a remarkable insight into gender discrimination prevailing in our society......";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though we feel we have entered a new age still gender discrimination is seen our family and society. A man can have affairs outside the home but when the woman commits the same mistake the things don't hold the same despite the numerous sacrifices she would have made for her family. The film very remarkably raises this issue. I won't say the film heads for a very concrete answer by the end but still the drama scorches the screen through its issue. Tabbu and Sachin Kedekar are remarkable in their roles. Through the portrayal of the modern society the film depicts the situations haven't changed in course of time. The film reminded me of Akhir Kyon released in 1985 in which Smita Patil played the role of a women who makes her way after her husband abandons her. The film very effectively portrayed the strength passion and patience of womanhood which comes in Astitva too. Only the small disappointments were its slow pace lack of twists and the inadequate answers it goes for.Rating 2 stars out of 4".

A man can have affairs outside the home but when the woman commits the same mistake the things don't hold the same despite the numerous sacrifices she would have made for her family. The film very remarkably raises this issue. I won't say the film heads for a very concrete answer by the end but still the drama scorches the screen through its issue. Tabbu and Sachin Kedekar are remarkable in their roles. Through the portrayal of the modern society the film depicts the situations haven't changed in course of time.

	schema:reviewBody "When Astitva was released in India it struck a chord with the country's stayathome wives and mothers. In Aditi these women saw themselves being brave enough to demand equality in marital relations owning up to and even being proud of their needs and desires. Astitva is an important movie for its subject matter if nothing else.Fortunately director Mahesh Manjrekar handles his material with a masterful touch neither understating key aspects of the story which are so little discussed in Indian society that they deserve to be shouted out loud nor letting it slide into obvious melodrama. The cast is perfect Tabu in particular is excellent as Aditi and Sachin Khedekar comes into his own as Shreekant Pandit.The plot is simple Aditi is a neglected housewife her new husband travels out of town a LOT who begins to take music lessons to keep herself busy. A mutual attraction springs up between the lonely Aditi and the attractive young teacher Malhar Kamath and their relationship becomes an intimate one. Soon Aditi conceives a child that she strongly suspects is Malhar's and not her husband's but she says nothing. Aditi and her husband leave their secluded rural home and head for the city to raise their son.The child grows up and is about to be married. As both sets of parents prepare for the wedding Aditi receives a letter from a lawyer telling her that Malhar Kamath has died and left her his estate. Malhar's actions raise questions in Shreekant's mind. He checks his journals from three decades ago figures out that his son is not his own and has a meltdown.Shreekant's easy rejection of their thirtyyear marriage wakes Aditi up to all the injustices she has suffered from Shreekant. In an emotional climax she accuses Shreekant of neglecting her sexual needs while fulfilling his own  often against her wishes  all through the marriage. In the end she leaves him to finally begin making herself a priority in her life as opposed to spending the rest of her life serving his needs.The movie crossed the line into triteness once or twice especially when Shreekant was revealed to have had many affairs during their marriage and also when Aditi's son rejects her as his mother huh???. One star off for that. Otherwise the movie is excellent as close to perfect as you can get in a Bollywood movie handling an issue as sensitive as this.".

Sophia Loren does a fantastic job of portraying a vibrant headstrong passionate woman on a mission.

Alan Ladd as Dr. Caulder of the museum in Athens is the low point for me as I never found him to be a particularly good actor. He does okay in this movie but doesn't really fill the screen with great charisma. The soundtrack and the title song are fabulous  at times lilting haunting and fun.

	schema:reviewBody "Some films are set in very gritty surroundings such as docks or decayed warehouses others have period settings or need to support a scifi storyline. But when it is possible most films will increase their appeal if they can provide attractive screen images to help tide viewers over occasional dull spots. Such eye candy may be land or marine scenery architecture or people. Used at the right time any of then can provide additional viewer enjoyment. Boy on a Dolphin based on a novel by David Divine is one of many films among them Venus Summer Lovers and Aphrodite which have used the magnificent scenery of the Greek Islands for this purpose. It was made by the Fox studios on location on Hydra Island in Greece and is an adventure film about an impoverished Greek scuba diver very vigorously played by a young Sophia Loren who discovers a valuable classical statue she wants to see accepted as a national treasure rather than simply sold on the open market. It was filmed in colour and provides some delightful images of the scenery in this lovely part of the world but although there was an extremely vigorous and fiery performance by Sophia Loren the acting of the North American cast members unfortunately left much to be desired and the overall impression after watching this film is somewhat patchy. This is sometimes blamed on the height disparity between the rather short Alan Ladd who plays the curator of one of the museums of antiquity in Athens and the unusually tall Sophia Loren. It has been suggested that Robert Mitchum who was originally considered for the role of the museum curator might have helped create a film which would wear better. I do not think this is fair to Director Jean Negulesco who as I remember it very adequately coped with any problems this difference created and also did a wonderful job of exploiting the scenic attractions which did so much for this film. His main failure was in melding the contributions of the various cast members into a coherent story with enough sparkle and life for it to become a classic. However it was one of the top earning films at the time it was released and was also nominated for an Oscar so it seems probable that both Fox and those involved in making the film would have classed it as very successful.I am a visual person and perhaps appreciate the value of eye candy more than many filmgoers but I would not give this film an IMDb Users rating of more than seven today. I would however quickly buy myself a new DVD copy if it was available. The VHS tape is no longer listed and I do feel very strongly that as a remastered DVD the delightful scenery combined with the important theme about national treasures being preserved for the enjoyment of posterity and the great performance by Sophia Loren would be enough to ensure better sales for it than for many of the other DVD revivals which are being created in great quantities today. This is my principal reason for adding these further User Comments now.".

He's adequate.Ladd was taller than Robinson Cagney and numerous others. Paul Newman was often unfairly called short. Ingrid Bergman was an inch taller than Bogart yet who taunts Bogart about Casablanca? Here are the 2 real issues 1 Sophia is a tall woman taller than her own husband Carlo Ponti and she towers over many male actors in most of her movies. She is a half inch taller than was Humphrey Bogart she never made a movie with him so we don't know if he would have stood on a box. 2 Sophia was half Ladd's age! The problem in this film is mostly the tremendous age difference between an older declining leading man and a vigorous very young beginner actress. Taunts of Ladd's height then and now are missing the point I believe that the veteran and savvy Ladd probably was rather disinterested as he realized something was awkward here but not height. He was wondering what am I doing here in these scenes with this young chick half my age? The following year Ladd made a film with 41year old leading lady Olivia DeHavilland and it worked.So these are my theories but please keep them in perspective. Boy on a Dolphin is all about Sophia and all this other stuff is really only minor details.".

Soon two Americansan archaeologist and a wealthy art collectorare vying for the prize and Loren finds herself playing both sides one man for the money the other man for love.

While the Greek scenery is lovely it's obvious that the biggest reason they chose Ms. Loren for the film was because of her ample breasts. Throughout the film but particularly in the first diving scene they are featured very prominently and it's a very risqu piece of film work for the 1950s sort of like the movie THE DEEP in the 1970s. And unfortunately she is given a role that is very inconsistent and not particularly likable. Much of the movie concerns her wanting to help steal a valuable ancient statue she accidentally discovered while sponge diving. She is through much of the film amoral and selfcentered. And not very convincingly at the end she falls for Ladd and does the right thing with the statue! Predictable but also a bit ridiculous.Now to make things worse some boob had the bright idea of pairing Loren with Alan Laddone of the shortest leading men of all time and about four inches shorter than her. This meant they had to do some interesting camerawork so she wouldn't tower above him. In addition their chemistry is at best tenuous despite this being a love story. There just doesn't seem to be any spark between them. As for Ladd his role is pretty mellow and subdued. Apart from some scuba diving he just doesn't do all that much in the film. The bottom line for Ladd Loren and the rest of the characters is that the parts just weren't written all that well and the people aside from her little brother in the film weren't very interesting or compelling. A dull timepasser and certainly no indication of the acting ability of either of its stars.".

It has one of the most beautiful music scores for a film ever. It also has Clifton Webb who like George Sanders could lift any movie he was in. And then it has 22yearold Sophia Loren also doing justice to the Cinemascope process in a wet figureclinging dress  diving into the sea swimming under the sea and climbing out of the sea  the Production Code people back in Hollywood must have been on holidays when that footage came up for review. It stars Alan Ladd. This was toward the end of his career but we saw a lot of him in the 1950's. He has an easy assurance here although it's sad watching him knowing that he was gone a few years later aged only 50. Sophia Loren plays Phaedra who dives for sponges off her loser boyfriend's boat. When she discovers an ancient statue she tries to change their fortunes by selling it to a ruthless collector of antiquities Victor Parmelee Clifton Webb. However an honest American archaeologist Dr. James Calder Alan Ladd steps between Phaedra and Parmelee and also between Phaedra and her boyfriend.This was Sophia's first movie in English and she plays the whole thing in a fairly shrill manner she is much better when she is diving into swimming under or climbing out of the sea etc. However it's hard to take your eyes off her. I first saw this film back in 1957 at age 10 an era when the thought of sex education made everyone feel uncomfortable but I'm sure Sophia in this film helped set my gender preferences for the future. The music was by Hugo Friedhofer and orchestral colour was his forte he had orchestrated for Steiner and Korngold. He was brilliant at incorporating folk music and instruments into his symphonic scores. Here he infused his score with Greek music and gave the whole thing an ethereal quality  just listen to the music that accompanies Parmelee on the road to the Metoria Monastery.Watching Boy on a Dolphin is always a happy experience for me nostalgia plays a part of course but then again what's not to like?".

	schema:headline " Clifton Webb's Last and Luckiest Bad Guy";
	schema:reviewBody "An average adventure film it is easy to say what is good about BOY ON A DOLPHIN the scenery of Greece is wonderful the music and dance numbers interesting the first Greek dances I suspect in a major production film prior to NEVER ON Sunday and the pleasures of looking at the young vibrant Sophia Loren. They are sufficient to make the film a 5 out of 10. Dragging it down a bit is casting Alan Ladd as the hero archaeologist  he speaks his lines okay but he was beginning to look a little puffy in the face it is not the Ladd of THIS GUN FOR HIRE or TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST or THE BLUE DAHLIA. But pushing it up to a 7 is Clifton Webb. More about that later.Sophia is a sponge diver and has accidentally located the wreckage of a 2000 year old wreck which entered myth because it had a the statue of a boy made out of solid gold on top of a bronze dolphin. Ladd is approached by Sophia about showing him the treasure for possible financial reward. But Ladd's resources are small he works for various antiquities organizations and national governments and worked after World War II returning antiquities looted by the Nazis. He arranges to have lunch with her but she arrives first. She is told they cannot serve her alone so she plops herself down next to the next available person. It's Webb who turns out to find her more interesting than initially when she mentions knowing Ladd and awaiting him. Webb cleverly spirits her out of the restaurant onto his yacht. There keeping her a well treated prisoner he does a little research on his own and catches up with Ladd in a Monastic Library. He returns to the yacht. He explains the situation  he will pay much more money for the statue of the boy on the dolphin than Ladd will. Loren agrees to help him.So the situation is set up with Loren working to delay and defeat Ladd's urge to find the statue and once he goes she'll lead Webb to it. But due to unforeseen side issues Ladd becomes friendly with Loren's kid brother Piero Giagnoni he learns that she visits the yacht and soon is aware he cannot depend on her anymore. But Loren is also finding she is falling for Ladd and this is beginning to worry not only Webb but Loren's old boyfriend Jorge Mistral. Switching to relying on Mistral Webb prepares to snatch the prize while Ladd is preoccupied. And there I will leave the plot.After LAURA and THE DARK CORNER with the possible exception of his ridiculous social snob Eliot Templeton in THE RAZOR'S EDGE Clifton Webb played good guys. Usually they were acerbic like his Lynn Belvedere but usually had his heart in the right place. His Richard Sturgis in TITANIC is confronting his wife Barbara Stanwyck but is in for a severe emotional drubbing from her regarding his son's parentage before he pulls himself together and shows he is heroic at the conclusion. Most of his films were comedies though TITANIC and CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN end with his death. However it is not until he made BOY ON A DOLPHIN that Webb returned to his special brand of sybaritic style villainy. His Mr. Victor Parmelee as noted on this thread Webb's real last name was Parmelee is a wealthy aesthete who collects art objects and doesn't care how he gets them.

	onyx:emotionText "An average adventure film it is easy to say what is good about BOY ON A DOLPHIN the scenery of Greece is wonderful the music and dance numbers interesting the first Greek dances I suspect in a major production film prior to NEVER ON Sunday and the pleasures of looking at the young vibrant Sophia Loren. They are sufficient to make the film a 5 out of 10. Dragging it down a bit is casting Alan Ladd as the hero archaeologist  he speaks his lines okay but he was beginning to look a little puffy in the face it is not the Ladd of THIS GUN FOR HIRE or TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST or THE BLUE DAHLIA. But pushing it up to a 7 is Clifton Webb. More about that later.Sophia is a sponge diver and has accidentally located the wreckage of a 2000 year old wreck which entered myth because it had a the statue of a boy made out of solid gold on top of a bronze dolphin. Ladd is approached by Sophia about showing him the treasure for possible financial reward. But Ladd's resources are small he works for various antiquities organizations and national governments and worked after World War II returning antiquities looted by the Nazis. He arranges to have lunch with her but she arrives first. She is told they cannot serve her alone so she plops herself down next to the next available person. It's Webb who turns out to find her more interesting than initially when she mentions knowing Ladd and awaiting him. Webb cleverly spirits her out of the restaurant onto his yacht. There keeping her a well treated prisoner he does a little research on his own and catches up with Ladd in a Monastic Library. He returns to the yacht. He explains the situation  he will pay much more money for the statue of the boy on the dolphin than Ladd will. Loren agrees to help him.So the situation is set up with Loren working to delay and defeat Ladd's urge to find the statue and once he goes she'll lead Webb to it. But due to unforeseen side issues Ladd becomes friendly with Loren's kid brother Piero Giagnoni he learns that she visits the yacht and soon is aware he cannot depend on her anymore. But Loren is also finding she is falling for Ladd and this is beginning to worry not only Webb but Loren's old boyfriend Jorge Mistral. Switching to relying on Mistral Webb prepares to snatch the prize while Ladd is preoccupied. And there I will leave the plot.After LAURA and THE DARK CORNER with the possible exception of his ridiculous social snob Eliot Templeton in THE RAZOR'S EDGE Clifton Webb played good guys. Usually they were acerbic like his Lynn Belvedere but usually had his heart in the right place. His Richard Sturgis in TITANIC is confronting his wife Barbara Stanwyck but is in for a severe emotional drubbing from her regarding his son's parentage before he pulls himself together and shows he is heroic at the conclusion. Most of his films were comedies though TITANIC and CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN end with his death. However it is not until he made BOY ON A DOLPHIN that Webb returned to his special brand of sybaritic style villainy. His Mr. Victor Parmelee as noted on this thread Webb's real last name was Parmelee is a wealthy aesthete who collects art objects and doesn't care how he gets them. He would have been the sort who would have dealt with Mr. Cathcart in THE DARK CORNER and read Waldo Lydecker's columns in the newspapers. Webb has the aesthete down pat and in the end you admire his thorough planning and sticktoitness in seeking to circumvent Ladd. But he has one thing going in this film not found in the earlier two melodramas. Nobody is killed in BOY ON A DOLPHIN although one suspects that the jealous Mistral would love to do in Ladd. So at the end Mr. Parmalee shrugs his shoulders and orders his yacht to Monte Carlo...ho hum...an occasional failure is to be expected.

Jack is now a reclusive nightclub owner and his daughter is Jean Arthur a newspaperwoman who figures out who he is. In order to protect her mother who has remarried from public scandal Holt has to disappear again.The rest of the movie is about the complications surrounding the latter events and Jack Holt gives a better performance than I have ever seen him give enormously underplayed by his usual standards. Jean Arthur has to contend with some lines that have not aged well as does juvenile Donald Cook.Nonetheless throughout all this the performances as as good as they can get under old hand Roy William Neill. Like many silent directors Neill had retreated to the Bs  although this is definitely an A picture from Columbia. Even so Neill always worked well and carefully and this is a fine effort the visuals perfect under a crack team of three cinematographers and half a dozen camera operators that included Joe August and Ben Kline.In short while the dialogue may occasionally make you roll your eyes everything else about this movie will keep you intensely interested.".

Still Jean's in full blossom here and well on her way to her glory days. Either way this is a remarkably entertaining little movie told in a brisk energetic entertaining style that seems to have been practically unique in some ways to the Hollywood of the early to mid30's. Jack Holt stars as an excon who is reunited by chance with his daughter Arthur after a 20year stint in prison He's high up in the underworld she's a newspaper reporter. The plot machinations come fast and furious and contrived though they may be they are only so in the best waythe way Hollywood could pull this kind of thing off in the 30's. Good performances all the way around but Holtoften looking very much like Brando's Don Corleone in The Godfatherand Arthur carry the show. Another Godfather mention Donald Cook who plays Arthur's boyfriend Bob looks quite a lot like Al Pacino! Holt in fact really carries this picture bringing to his Buck RankinDuke Sheldon a very sympathetic mix of nononsense tough guy and heart and the relationship between him and Arthur is thoroughly convincing. I have to say that the opening credits had me worried The whirlpool seems to be nothing more than water spinning down a sink! But this is mostly the exception There's even one montage of father and daughter that's remarkably welldone almost even poetic in its images and editing. Overall I wouldn't call this a classic but if you like Jean Arthur or the movies of the 30's in general this is a better bet than you might have guessed.".

	schema:reviewBody "This will be of interest to classic movie fans interested not only in Jean Arthur but in seeing the transformation of her career from those fragile Paramount heroines to a few feisty young women in low budget RKO films of varying personalities. This started the most memorable stage of Arthur's film career playing a series of career girls usually reporters who had motivations they didn't always reveal to the men they were using for various reasons. In this case she's a reporter who goes to interview a powerful businessman Jack Holt after seeing his picture in the paper and wanting to find out his true identity. He's involved in criminal activities having risen to the top of the rackets and she believes he's an honest businessman. Of course there's a back story and that is the old Enoch Arden theme of back from the dead.This starts off with the back story of Holt's marriage to the pretty Lila Lee and his subsequent incarceration for manslaughter. Lee is horrified to find out that he supposedly died in a prison escape attempt but Holt arranged it so she'd be able to go on with her life and not wait for him. Twenty years pass and Lee is now remarried ironically to the judge who sentenced Holt. He is overjoyed to find out he has a grown daughter and they begin to spend precious time together much to the chagrin of Donald Cook Arthur's longtime beau. Of course it's all innocent but cosy lunches between the two spotted by Cook have him believing otherwise. Holt's enemies find out the truth and threaten to spill the beans. Not wanting to break his wife's heart a second time Holt makes drastic decisions bringing his whirlpool of a life full circle.Having seen a few films with Jack Holt over the years I mainly recalled him from a few film stills which make him look pretty hard not at all the typical leading man. He makes a crack here in regards to that telling Arthur that he's not really photogenic. Lee however is very photogenic and when Arthur surprises him with a picture of how his wife looks now Holt is touched by her beauty. Other than the opening however Lee has only a few scenes with Arthur towards the end the film changing its structure several times as it tells its familiar but well crafted tale. Allen Jenkins offers a lot of amusement as Holt's driver especially as he reaccounts the traffic tickets he got from various policemen while waiting for Holt to finish his lunch with Arthur.A delightfully obscure film thankfully released on DVD with some other obscure Jean Arthur films I have been searching for over many years Whirlpool is combination carnycrimeprisonparental lovesoap opera. Columbia other than its Grace Moore operettas and of course the Frank Capra films was lesser known among Hollywood studios and did turn out some little gems along the way. While this may not be an outstanding entry in their early 30's catalog it is slightly better than average with some interesting performances some sparkling dialog of precode nature and a glimpse of the magic Arthur would soon achieve when she took on gangster Edward G. Robinson in that comedy gem The Whole Town's Talking and Gary Cooper in the brilliant Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.".

	onyx:emotionText "This will be of interest to classic movie fans interested not only in Jean Arthur but in seeing the transformation of her career from those fragile Paramount heroines to a few feisty young women in low budget RKO films of varying personalities. This started the most memorable stage of Arthur's film career playing a series of career girls usually reporters who had motivations they didn't always reveal to the men they were using for various reasons. In this case she's a reporter who goes to interview a powerful businessman Jack Holt after seeing his picture in the paper and wanting to find out his true identity. He's involved in criminal activities having risen to the top of the rackets and she believes he's an honest businessman. Of course there's a back story and that is the old Enoch Arden theme of back from the dead.This starts off with the back story of Holt's marriage to the pretty Lila Lee and his subsequent incarceration for manslaughter. Lee is horrified to find out that he supposedly died in a prison escape attempt but Holt arranged it so she'd be able to go on with her life and not wait for him. Twenty years pass and Lee is now remarried ironically to the judge who sentenced Holt. He is overjoyed to find out he has a grown daughter and they begin to spend precious time together much to the chagrin of Donald Cook Arthur's longtime beau. Of course it's all innocent but cosy lunches between the two spotted by Cook have him believing otherwise. Holt's enemies find out the truth and threaten to spill the beans. Not wanting to break his wife's heart a second time Holt makes drastic decisions bringing his whirlpool of a life full circle.Having seen a few films with Jack Holt over the years I mainly recalled him from a few film stills which make him look pretty hard not at all the typical leading man. He makes a crack here in regards to that telling Arthur that he's not really photogenic. Lee however is very photogenic and when Arthur surprises him with a picture of how his wife looks now Holt is touched by her beauty. Other than the opening however Lee has only a few scenes with Arthur towards the end the film changing its structure several times as it tells its familiar but well crafted tale. Allen Jenkins offers a lot of amusement as Holt's driver especially as he reaccounts the traffic tickets he got from various policemen while waiting for Holt to finish his lunch with Arthur.A delightfully obscure film thankfully released on DVD with some other obscure Jean Arthur films I have been searching for over many years Whirlpool is combination carnycrimeprisonparental lovesoap opera. Columbia other than its Grace Moore operettas and of course the Frank Capra films was lesser known among Hollywood studios and did turn out some little gems along the way. While this may not be an outstanding entry in their early 30's catalog it is slightly better than average with some interesting performances some sparkling dialog of precode nature and a glimpse of the magic Arthur would soon achieve when she took on gangster Edward G. Robinson in that comedy gem The Whole Town's Talking and Gary Cooper in the brilliant Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.";

She plays Helen starry eyed wife of carnival manager Buck Rankin Jack Holt whose honeymoon is over before it begins when he is sentenced to 20 years for killing a man in a side show brawl.Jack Holt was Columbia's most bankable male star and by the early 30s seemed to be in every other movie  usually playing in adventurous thrillers but this one was a hearts and flowers tearjerker that still left room for some action. Desperate for Helen to get on with her life he forges a letter from the prison governor in which he announces his own death  jumping into the whirlpool of water that no prisoner has ever survived all the while serving out his sentence.Twenty years after shows him now free and with the help of his buddy Allan Jenkins has him going from strength to strength as a racketeer. He is all set to give evidence at a trial of one of his associates when Sandy enters the scene. Sandy is an eager reporter but also Rankin's daughter who recognizes him at once due to his picture always being prominent on her mother's dressing table. Although remarried she has never forgotten her first love!! Jean Arthur is just splendid as Sandy never cloying or sentimental or full of recriminations for the past  she is just eager to spend as much time as she can with her dad. There is also a young man played by the moody Don Cook who of course jumps to the wrong conclusion when he sees them together!!Having started in movies back in 1923 by 1932 Jean Arthur realized she would need to go to Broadway if she wanted to be anything more than just an ingnue. She did and came back to Hollywood with a Columbia contract. As well as going blonde she had emerged as a better actress and as Sandy she lights up the screen and along with Lila Lee the real reason Whirlpool is such a success!!Very Recommended.".

The first sequence happened in a garden party of some sort by the sea that is interrupted by a storm the other happens some time later in a castle.

	schema:reviewBody "The Snow Queen in my mind is one of Hans Christian Andersen's best stories. Anybody who loves the story and as long as they don't mind the omissions and the changes will love this film. As far as 1960s Russian film adaptations of fairy tales go The Snow Queen is not quite as good as The Tale of Tsar Sultan and Snow Maiden but it still shares many of the qualities that made those two films as good as they were. It is a goodlooking film though some of the special effects do look as though they were made on a limited budget with handsome photography and costumes and sets that give a real magical feel. The film genuinely feels like a fairytale but at the same time there is something endearingly Russian about which I loved. The music score is beautiful haunting and dramatic and while the story is not entirely faithful to the original fairy tale it still has its charm and magic and told swiftly and coherently. The image of the Snow Queen watching through the window is still one that haunts me and the silhouette of the Narrator is very striking and makes you want to keep on watching it to the end. The acting fits very well within the story Elena Proklova is a moving Gerda and one that allows her character to grow. But the best performances come from Evgeni Leonov's King and especially Natalya Kilmova's chilling Snow Queen.All in all very well done indeed. 910 Bethany Cox".

Anybody who loves the story and as long as they don't mind the omissions and the changes will love this film. As far as 1960s Russian film adaptations of fairy tales go The Snow Queen is not quite as good as The Tale of Tsar Sultan and Snow Maiden but it still shares many of the qualities that made those two films as good as they were. It is a goodlooking film though some of the special effects do look as though they were made on a limited budget with handsome photography and costumes and sets that give a real magical feel. The film genuinely feels like a fairytale but at the same time there is something endearingly Russian about which I loved. The music score is beautiful haunting and dramatic and while the story is not entirely faithful to the original fairy tale it still has its charm and magic and told swiftly and coherently. The image of the Snow Queen watching through the window is still one that haunts me and the silhouette of the Narrator is very striking and makes you want to keep on watching it to the end. The acting fits very well within the story Elena Proklova is a moving Gerda and one that allows her character to grow. But the best performances come from Evgeni Leonov's King and especially Natalya Kilmova's chilling Snow Queen.All in all very well done indeed. 910 Bethany Cox";

After I got it with SuperIllu magazine two days ago I watched it twice and enjoyed the second time around even more.One might say this is a story about strong women. Starting from Grandmother who runs the household well Gerda who sets out heroically to rescue her little brother Kai the princess who clearly dominates her husband as well as her father the King the impressive robber queen and her very independent daughter.. up to the titular Snow Queen of course  they all command the scenes they are in while men appear in weaker sometimes clownish roles my favorite was the Hitler caricature who lost all his clothes and boots in gambling. I could see no communist propaganda in this charming film. But if it contributed to more selfconsciousness of girls and women in its time I can only applaud  as a 53yo man who watched this 43 years after it came out. I enjoyed it and recommend it if you like Russian fantasy movies or are just curious about films from elsewhere than Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two Russian adaptations of this fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen made within less than ten years the animated version of 1957 and this liveaction movie of 1966. The first version is nearer to the original tale most of the time. In the second version some chapters have been left out. In the fourth chapter much has been changed and much was added that is not in the tale. This version is apparently based on an adaptation for the stage by Yevgeni Shvarts or Yevgheny Schwartz which probably explains the higher number of changes.In both versions a narrator has been added in this version the fairy story teller Andersen played by Valeri Nikitenko in the older version a character from another tale by Hans Christian Andersen Ole LukOie. The end has also been changed more or less in both adaptations and both leave out those parts of the story that directly have to do with Christianity for example Gerda's prayer and the song lines Roses bloom and cease to be  But we shall the Christchild see. This is probably due to the fact that Russia was a communist country back then. But the core and the basic message of the story are there in both versions Kay is robbed of his feelings and abducted by the Snow Queen to her palace in the far north. But without feelings a human being isn't really human any more. Gerda misses her best friend Kay and has to try to get to the Queen's palace and make his heart of ice become warm again. At this point the liveaction version is nearer to the original than the animated version which leaves out the Snow Queen's promise to Kay if in the icy game of reason he manages to form the word eternity out of some pieces of ice you shall be your own master and I will give you the whole world and a new pair of skates. The outcome of this game is probably an important part of the message of the story  it probably means that pure reason cold logic can not lead to eternity  only love can.The adaptation for the screen makes a good impression overall for example the actors' performances and the music by Nadezhda Simonyan. The special effects though are not very good for example they inserted animated shots which were not taken from the '57 version in some sequences that would have been difficult to do as liveaction.There are lots of adaptations of this story animated and liveaction filmed stage adaptations episodes from fairy tale series. I have seen one when I was a child but which one was it? This one or perhaps another one? It's too long ago to remember. But I remember that the story really impressed me. The Snow Queen gave me a proper scare. A woman who can turn a small boy's heart into a lump of ice. How easily one can become immersed in the imaginary world of a movie as a child. Everything seems to be practically as real as reality. Even if the special effects are bad. As an adult one is not  unfortunately? luckily?  as easily impressed by a movie. But the Snow Queen in this adaptation played by Natalya Klimova is I think aweinspiring enough for today's children also to be able to have an exciting time watching this movie. As to this I think the scene in which the Snow Queen is looking at Kay and Gerda through the window is particularly well done. Her white oversized face makes her look like a menacing giant and her appearing is accompanied by dramatic music.Conclusion I think it wouldn't have been a bad idea to stay closer to the original tale and as I've mentioned before the special effects could have been better. And the robber girl's cute animated rabbits in the '57 version which I haven't mentioned before are of course missing from this version there's only a female robber chief who looks like Brezhnev. Still I think that it is an all in all good adaptation of the fairy tale that will probably be fun to watch for children and that grown up fans of fairy tale movies will probably also like. Fans of animated movies will probably prefer the '57 version. I think it is about as good as the liveaction version 7 out of 10 points for each. But the later version also includes the Snow Queen's promise to Kay see above and I liked the music better so I think it's slightly preferable. Dosvidanye.".

Although he makes a lot of trouble for the main character  a girl on the quest to save her brother who has a cold heart after he kissed the snow queen Nyzzzz! and is now in her hands  he eventually lacks the courage the willpower and the strength to ever finish anything he started because he comes to a halt as soon as he is confronted with an obstacle that he can't move out of the way by throwing money at it figuratively speaking...I suppose one has to make that clear when talking about a fairy tale movie. In one scene he negotiates with a group of thieves and when the head of the thieves asks if they can trust him he puts himself on the same level as thieves by saying Nonsense! We are both businesspeople. The message is clear capitalists are criminals.The movie starts off with a teller of fairy tales walking the streets who through voiceover explains that he will not only tell but even show us a fairy tale in which he puts himself in. Although not one of the most prominent characters in the tale he secretly makes himself the hero because his character repeatedly saves the day. The good guys win their battles almost effortlessly and eventually it is VERY easy for the girl to bring her brother back home and to warm his cold heart again which takes her two minutes of chitchat with him.Visually it isn't too spectacular except for the titular Snow Queen whose appearance is dashing while her persona is positively icy and her impressive ice palace which you only get to see for one scene towards the end doesn't need to shy away from a comparison with Supermans Krypton sets.".

	schema:reviewBody "When people nowadays think of Chucky the living doll they think of the foul mouthed psycho doll complete with body modifications and a punky bride in a movie filled with funny one liners and black humor. However when Chucky came to life almost 20 years ago he was a real thrill that redefined the horror genre of the late 80s and spawned a series of imitators some better than others.Director Tom Holland crafts this very original tale written by Don Mancini where a dying sociopath Brad Douriff uses voodoo to transplant his soul to an inanimate toy. Catherine Hicks plays Karen Barclay a single mother who gets the possessed toy for her little son Andy Alex Vincent not knowing what is hidden deep inside the doll.Despite its apparent cheesiness Holland truly creates a haunting atmosphere filled with suspense by following the trick Steven Spielberg used in Jaws. While we know from the very beginning that the toy is haunted we never get a glimpse of what he can do and neither does the characters only the young Andy knows the truth but nobody believes him.Unlike its current MTVinspired incarnations Child's Play starts a bit slow but suddenly it turns into a suspensefilled rollercoaster with enough thrills to keep you at the edge of the seat. Holland directions truly makes the difference between a cheap Bmovie and the classy film this one has become.Brad Dourif makes a superb job and this movie started his nowlegendary career in the genre. Catherine Hicks is a very good lead character surprisingly realistic thanks in part to the very wellwritten dialog. Chris Sarandon completes the cast as the detective investigating the mysterious murders surrounding Chucky and Andy.The movie moves at a very good pace despite its slow start it has that 80s feeling and it is surprisingly violent for its time it was released when rules were turning a bit stricter. It has great special effects and a very creepy atmosphere inside it's urban landscape.While many reviewers consider a flaw the fact that Chucky's possession is not a mystery I believe that a lot of the suspense is in the fact that we know that but the characters don't. It is a very well constructed film in the end and definitely better than its current sequels. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Child's Play is built upon a pretty laughable premise  some hardened criminal finds himself wounded and cornered by the police so he chants some mystical words lightning clouds form in the sky and he transports his soul into the body of a kid's doll of the My Buddy variety. But the movie is so well made that it is able to remain effective despite its questionable premise kind of like Darkman another movie with something of a goofy plot but that still manages to come off as a great action horror film.Some of the best moments in the film come early on before anyone but Andy realizes that Chucky is alive. Kind of like what Steven Spielberg did in Jaws director Tom Holland leaves Chucky as a lifeless doll for a good portion of the beginning of the film. As is to be expected it's much more difficult to show a living running stabbing screaming doll than it is to show a regular doll which itself manages to stare blankly in such a way that you know there's something going on in its head.There's nothing worse than hearing someone criticize the acting skills of a little kid but I have to admit that I found Alex Vincent's performance as Andy a little trying at times. Granted the kid deserves a lot of credit for performing reasonably well in a horror film at the age of 7 which is certainly more than I could have done at that age but for every time that he effectively portrayed a scared little kid which happened often there were at least as many times when he spoke with the wooden monotone generally associated with reading a cue card.That being said the effects in the movie are very impressive. There are a few goofs in there but you have to look pretty hard to find them and the doll itself was very well done. Brad Dourif makes one of his earlier appearances showing up in Child's Play just long enough to get shot and then transfer his body into the doll and then spend the rest of what is now a total of five movies trying to get out of it which may have something to do with the fact that his voice is more famous than his face. He was mostly known as the timid Billy Bibbit from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest before he did Child's Play and the success of this movie clearly had a significant impact on the rest of his career since so many of his later performances were in decidedly dark roles.Note watch for the only funny scene in the movie which my itself is so funny that any other comic relief isn't even necessary. As Chucky ascends in an elevator and elderly woman notices him but her husband tells her to just leave it whoever forgot it is bound to come back for it. When she exits the elevator she looks back with a grimace and says 'Ugly doll' Chucky's response is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a horror film.".

However he performs a chant right before he dies. Karen Barclay Catherine Hicks is a single mother who works in a jewelry department in a department store. She lives in an apartment with her sixyearold son Andy Alex Vincent who is like any normal sixyearold. He loves the television show Good Guys' and they have lots of toys and dolls that you can buy. When his birthday comes around he doesn't get a 100 Good Guy but Karen buys one from a peddler off the street for 30. However that doll whose name is Chucky is actually filled with the spirit of Ray who tries to kill everyone.At times this can be pretty effective even scary even when they add to it with predictable cheap scares. When Maggie Dinah Manoff who overacts throughout the entire movie is slowly walking through the kitchen with no music with the phone in plain sight do you think it's going to ring? Thankfully there aren't too many of them. The entire plot is pretty clever not just a Craven' or De Palma' theme. Also the puppetry of Chucky was pretty good for it being 15 years ago. The cinematography was good with many first person shots which were effective.Dourif who played a gentle man in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was very good especially in the beginning when we actually saw him. Why he isn't a big name now is beyond me. Hicks was good for what she was required to be panicky and caring to Andy. Sarandon didn't do anything for me as the obligatory police officer. Vincent talked like stereotypical movie children did enunciating every syllable.The music really helped with it booming to prove its point of being a horror movie. It could have had some humor like other horror movies do to help it out some. Since it's less than 90 minutes and a horror films they didn't worry about anything like plot holes or continuity errors. A few I noticed how DID he go into Chucky besides the chant why would the Chucky doll be burned up the dates continuously change. That scene with voodoo was very cool. That's about all I can say so I won't say any more.My rating 710Rated R for language and violent situations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Child's Play was billed as a horror movie but it's hard to categorize it as such. Especially by 1980s standards. There's no brainless teenage cattle no gratuitous nudity and no ridiculously high body count. If anything Child's Play runs like an episode of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. It's creepy but ultimately not shocking. This is no coincidence. An episode of The Twilight Zone called Living Doll used a similar premise.Child's Play is done very well considering it's about a serial killer who uses voodoo magic to transfer his soul into a doll. The acting is way above average for a horror movie and the momentum builds nicely. The viewer is forced to wait quite awhile before they actually see Chucky kill anyone. If anyone has seen VH1's I Love the 80s then you've probably seen Dee Snider mock the movie It's a doll! Step on it! It's over!. If Chucky tried to go on a killing rampage this would work. But he doesn't. He uses stealth and cunning to make up for the failings of his diminutive body. He reveals his true self only to young Andy the boy who gets him as a birthday present. He kills all his hapless victims without much trouble. After all who would suspect an innocent little doll could kill you when you're not looking?Perhaps the biggest problem with Child's Play is that it was billed as an evil doll movie. Chucky was on all the posters and commercials knife in hand. It would have worked much better as a suspense thriller where you suspect that little Andy Barclay is the murderer.Despite it's failings as a horror movie Child's Play is still a great movie because it paints a dismal and accurate picture of the 80s the frustration of single parenthood the dark dangerous inner cities and trying to get your kid that overpriced toy that they just have to have. Child's Play also came at a time when dolls were really popular Teddy Ruxpin Cabbage Patch Kids My Buddy and Kid Sister were all hot items. Little kids loved these things but there's something inherently sinister about dolls. Those glassy eyes and permasmiles seem insincere.Overall Child's Play is a movie that probably succeeded because it was in the right place at the right time. Nonetheless it's worth at least a few viewings. Chucky is easily one of the top 3 horror movie villains of the 1980s along with Freddie Krueger and the Gremlins.Rating 4 out of 5 stars".

A CREEPY looking doll a CREEPY voice eerie music because it's not even music its like chimes and a combination of creepy sounds suspense and of course barely any comedy just pure horror. Out of all the horror movies I've seen the scariest movies would have to be the following Child's Play Pet Semetary The Exorcist 3 Evil Dead is pretty creepy at times The Others Saw  not a quite scary just a damn good movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre original April Fool's Day is kinda creepy Sleepaway camp  music and that ENDING  there are a few more but i cant quite think however the tops are Child's Play and Pet Semetary. Oh and High Tension is a VERY good horrorsuspense. So if u wanna wanna be creeped out go home turn off the light put the TV on loud or surround sound if u have it and watch by yourself. It's a scary movie well at least to me it is. I'm not scared of the movie now at the age of 25 but it is one the only ones that no matter how many times i watch it still creep me out a bit.".

After that it starts to get slow and generic even with the killer doll with things not making much sense and I am not talking about the Chucky doll thing either. But when Chucky starts his sinister cacklying and cursing that he is known for the movie does pick up. The build up to that point isn't that bad though and I can understand why they had to go in that direction at first. It does add a sense of mystery even if the audiences does know what is going on from the start. The trademark Chucky voice really does add flavor to this slasher. As a matter of fact I wouldn't be shocked if Heath Ledger was inspired by Chucky for his role in The Dark Knight now that I think about it. It's cool to see Chucky not going on that unstoppable killer slasher direction he uses stealth and pulls tricks to kill someone. Plus whenever found he could just act like a regular doll. Which actually does adds to making him quite a dangerous and sinister killer. This does not have a lot of blood and gore nor does it have a lot of body count but it does have entertainment value for a horror slasher movie. Overall this is a slasher movie that had a lot of cool and new elements to work with when it came to the direction at the time. And it's understandable how Chucky became one of the most memorable killer villain from the 80's. Thanks to Brad Dourif signature voice as Chucky.810".

I didn't watch it until I was much older but simply seeing the trailer on TV was enough to make me petrified of the notion that an otherwise innocent amalgam of plastic and synthetic fiber lurked on the other side of my bedroom closet door while I slept.Fast forward to 2010. I'm nearing age 30 yikes and I've just given the tale about a murdering psychopath who transfers his soul into the body of a toy via some sort of intangible voodoo another chance. Even though the exposition for this one is amazingly idiotic it's clear that screenwriter Don Mancini was onto something. In the most superficial sense there is something eerie about dolls. Their fixed expressions when viewed in the right context can make our blood run cold. As irrational as this notion is it nevertheless has some merit and this is what makes Child's Play the unlikely success that it is.What's even more disturbing about the movie is that it has our six year old protagonistAndyexploring the seedy underbelly of Chicago in an effort to aid his newly acquired companion. Despite his initial naivety the kid eventually wises up and realizes the danger he's in. What follows is a comically grotesque battle that sees Chucky take on a police officer a psychiatrist a witchdoctor and a babysitter among others.What's especially great about Child's Play is the final act where our indestructible villain is shot torched and dismembered. He's basically the terminator of dolls as soon as he seems to be vanquished he reappears oozing pus and stuffing ready to slice and dice anyone who interrupts his perpetual mission of spiritual transferal.As one would hope no one involved with Child's Play takes things too seriously it would have been an utter disaster had this not been the case. Because of the lighthearted nature of the movie and how downright silly it is there's no reason not to call it a boxfull of harebrained fun.It's also the quintessential killer doll movie.

	schema:headline " Every horror fan should play with Chucky at least once";
	schema:reviewBody "If you can get past the charmingly silly proposition of a serial killer transferring his soul into a doll to perpetuate his murderous ways Tom Holland's Child's Play offers up a tremendously entertaining mix of humor and horror and puts a novel twist on the relatively uncrowded toys gone bad subgenre.The events in the film revolve around six yearold Andy Barclay whose mom gives him a coveted animatronic Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unfortunately for him his new prize is possessed by the spirit of infamous mass strangler Charles Lee Ray and when the repackaged slayer gets up to his old tricks again no one believes Andy's insistent claims that Chucky did it. The most effective aspect of Holland's execution of the material is how he's able to wring some genuine scares out of a premise that automatically lends itself to unintentional comedy. Though the film wisely acknowledges its own goofiness by peppering the slasher elements with some keenly rendered zingers the story itself is played fairly straight and the overtly sadistic nature of Chucky's homicidal rampage ensures that the tone remains as dark as the circumstances will allow. We pretty much know going in what this flick will have in store but the excellently crafted pace generates an admirable amount of tension and the way each propulsive layer of the plot unfolds makes for an engrossingly taut experience which belies the basic fact that our villain here is a four foot tall plastic plaything.Holland certainly deserves credit for much of the film's impact but his accomplishments are handily eclipsed by FX whiz Kevin Yagher who created the chillingly cherubic Chucky doll and brought him to life. Yagher's orchestration of the mechanical effects that allow Chucky to switch from beaming best friend to snarling psychopath remain captivating even in the modern CGI era and the level of realism presented with this decidedly unreal character is startling and magical. Though later installments of the Child's Play franchise would replace Yagher's puppetry with whatever technological trickery was available at the time the Chucky icon would never again be this frightening and primally savage or look nearly as impressive.The limited capabilities of the the era actually augment the illusion rather than hindering it and since the focus of the film is a plastic creation with limited jointing instead of a human being with full articulation the doll's somewhat stiff and mechanical movements are more fitting than the sort of fluid animated motions you'll see in say Seed Of Chucky. The scenes of our bladewielding antagonist methodically stalking down the hallway of the apartment where much of the action takes place are fearsome and indelible and the sudden expletiveladen shift which occurs the first time Chucky reveals himself to the disbelieving mother of his friend till the end still packs a whopper of a jolt no matter how many times I've seen it. Despite Holland's surehanded direction this flick simply wouldn't work as well as it does without the efficiency of Chucky's menacing mien and even if the notion of a killer doll strikes you as silly there's no denying how powerfully that device is brought to fruition here.Our nonrobotic cast does an excellent job as well particularly the always welcome Chris Sarandon who portrays skeptical homicide detectiveturnedintervening hero Mike Norris. Young Alex Vincent is a bit over his head tackling the wide range of emotions his role as Andy requires but he does a great job considering his age and the final bitter punchline he delivers to Chucky is a true gem. Brad Dourif seems to relish the excesses he's allowed to indulge as the voice of Chucky and his witty mirthfully malicious banter adds as much nuance and actual character to the doll he inhabits as Kevin Yagher's machinery does.There isn't a ton of gore to be had here but that dearth is actually pretty crucial to the plot since the initial killings are staged to look like accidents. Things get slightly more gruesome as the film proceeds but the emphasis here is decidedly on suspense rather than splatter so bloodthirsty viewers should probably be aware of that before they start imagining what nasty uses Chucky will concoct for the butcher knife he's grasping in most of Child's Play's promotional art.Some slippery mythology hampers the storyline a bit and while the introduction of an inner city voodoo shaman responsible for teaching Chucky his Dambala trick is essential to our understanding of the film's rules the wisdom he dispenses ends up being the lone befuddling portion of this caper. You see the impetus for Chucky's climactic pursuit of Andy is the necessity of shifting his essence into the body of the first person he revealed himself to otherwise he'll be trapped forever in the doll vessel he occupies throughout the film. I get that and I suppose it makes some sort of sense in the realm of Child's Play but the fact that Chucky's black magic mentor even knows this does not. I'm not intimately familiar with sorcery but it strikes me as odd that the transference of human souls into talking toys apparently happens with enough frequency for there to be an established course of conduct when that occurs.This is ultimately a minor complaint and taken as a whole Child's Play is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. Though the rest of the extended franchise with the lone exception of the surprisingly sharp Bride Of Chucky is essentially useless this inaugural outing has enough strong moments to make it readily apparent why subsequent filmmakers were eager to get more mileage out of the concept sadly the foreboding finale suggested by the exit frame here was never explored. Even if the sequels have left a sour taste in your mouth do the original the justice of giving it another look. Hideho ha ha ha.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you can get past the charmingly silly proposition of a serial killer transferring his soul into a doll to perpetuate his murderous ways Tom Holland's Child's Play offers up a tremendously entertaining mix of humor and horror and puts a novel twist on the relatively uncrowded toys gone bad subgenre.The events in the film revolve around six yearold Andy Barclay whose mom gives him a coveted animatronic Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unfortunately for him his new prize is possessed by the spirit of infamous mass strangler Charles Lee Ray and when the repackaged slayer gets up to his old tricks again no one believes Andy's insistent claims that Chucky did it.

Also For what it's worth it's a pretty good horror movie considering the subject matter. If any story about a doll killing people is going to have a chance to be believable or scary it's the story of Child's Play the first installment in the Chucky series. The reason for this is the surprisingly well written back story and origin of Chucky. I won't give spoilers but I was actually interested in how Chucky came to be an evil doll that murdered people. I mean they atleast attempted to give a valid reason of how this could possibly exist which was fun. Chucky does a decent job being menacing and almost believable until he begins to really speak. There are some freaky scenes of short dialog that really get you going but when he speaks too much it becomes kind of hokey and laughable as you would imagine it's a doll. I enjoyed Brad Dourif in the beginning of the film but as Chucky's voice I would rather have everything said in that creepy doll voice than the voice that actually comes from the doll. The less human the doll was the creepier it was. I felt they kind of lost that as the film moved along. Also there are a few death scenes that were shot poorly and completely unbelievable. That being said to pull of ANY believable and creepy scenes at all using a doll as the murdering villain is impressive and they made a handful of scenes really well. Ultimately it's a pretty creepy and fun movie when it works.Mike Holtz We Watched a Movie Check out some funny video reviews and movie news at our youtube channel here httpwww.youtube.comwewatchedamovie".

A kid's doll gets possessed by a serial killer and the doll terrorizes his family and others while trying to get into the boy's body through voodoo magic.I remember an old Twilight Zone episode with the Talking Tina doll that was fairly similar. It was good because we never actually saw the doll DO anything except talk and threaten. 'Child's Play' does the same for a good chunk of the movie. The suspense is excellent and Chucky is terrifying even when not active! We start to see Chucky move and talk and curse and chase people but it does not ruin the movie. The effects are pretty good and as a child this movie is traumatizing. Of course now at 21 I laugh at this movie as do most critics but I remember renting it when it first came out on video years ago and it changed my sleeping habits. Chucky gave me nightmares well into high school i'll admit!. I could barely look at my sister's dolls alone in the dark. The sequels are silly and unnessecary but the original Chuck is worth a friday night alone when you have nothing else to do. As a horror film fan this ranks in my top 5 as a movie fan in general is won't even crack my top 50. But like I said keep it away from offbeat dreamy children. This is the end...friend.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is as one user previously commented a bad movie done well. For example when the batteries fall out of the box we can see the wheels start turning in Karen's head and everything starting to fall into place. It's not a bad little scene but it could have been better. Apparently the original script called for a period of time in which the audience would be unsure whether Andy or Chuckie were committing the murders and the battery scene would have been the first real evidence that Chuckie was actually alive and a killer. That would have been a wiser move and made for a better movie. Another example of Child's Play as badmoviedonewell is the car scene in which Chuckie tries to kill Mike this thing goes from patently ridiculous he had a chance to stop the car in the time between getting out of Chuckie's chokehold and when Chuckie pushes the accelerator to genuinely scary when Chuckie is scrambling around outside the car while Mike is trapped inside. That's good stuff.But it's just sad that all of the human actorsincluding Chris Sarandonget upstaged by a foulmouthed doll. The sardonic and sharptongued best friend Maggie is a tired stereotype even in 1988. By the time the 9 o'clock news rolls around I didn't really care if she survived or not which is not a good thing. And Alex Vincent the kid who plays Andy is not good at all. His lines are often delivered with what I can only call bewildermentas if he has no idea what's going on in the scene or in the story. That's not surprising since he was about six years old at the time so he can't be faulted for it. The movie however can and should be. In the end there are a lot of horror movies I'd rather watch than this one but I'd rather watch this than Jaws 3D or Hellraiser Bloodlines.".

Rent that instead.I should mention I find one of the sequels Bride of Chucky a lot of fun but the rest are pretty terrible. Personally I can only give this a 4.";

I love how stealth and quick Chucky is and how creepy they made him. this movie was also leaning towards being a comedy also. Many people don't even think its a horror movie because of the comments Chucky has to say.even though there isn't much to say about this movie in my point of view i definitely recommend it because it is very entertaining.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so here is my review for yet another slasher series Child's Play. While I can safely say it was better than Friday The 13th I just found myself laughing at this movie more than I was feeling creeped out or scared. Now to be fair I can see where some people were scared by this movie it's just that it is either intentionally or not goofy.The premise is that Charles Lee Ray is a serial killer that one night gets shot by the cops and as he's dying and they're searching he recites a voodoo incantation that transfers his soul into that of a children's toy. The next day a kid named Andy has a birthday coming up and his mother does a very last minute shop for a toy that was recently added to the market that he wants. Then the talking toy that calls himself Chucky and Andy begin to attach immediately and soon the bodies start piling up.Okay first of all I am going to elaborate how I can see people being scared by this. The directing for some of the scenes are actually suspenseful in places and the argument can be made that when something inanimate is trying to kill a character of course nobody is going to believe them and therefore nobody will help them. So when this movie is looked at from that point of view it's not a bad idea.Okay onto why I think this movie is more goofy than scary. Some of the line deliveries are just hilarious. I mean the way Brad Dourif says Oh god I'm dying as if it's a minor annoyance then only a nanosecond later he says in the most cartoonishly overthetop way YOU LISTEN HERE YOU SON OF A BITCH I'M GONNA GET YOU AND I'M GONNA GET EDDIE NO MATTER WHAT! with line deliveries like that and... It's a killer doll among other things I can't help but raise a few chuckles at this movie.Other than that it's pretty much generic slasher. The acting either ranges from overacting to underacting the killer survives being burnt decapitated arm and leg wiped clean off only to then die by getting shot in the heart Which is a complaint that the scene goes on for too long at least in my opinion. I'd say check it out either for it's goofiness which doesn't come around often but when it does  it's worth it! or in some cases the actual suspense. For me however it's just too goofy to take as a legit horror movie.".

It doesn't quite help that the poetry is a little on the high school side. Michael Moore does a better job of being one sided while seeming to be righteous.The documentary simply suffers from having too many subjects. Every revolution shown was just skimming the surface. The producers knew that too which is why the Palestine conflict had just less than 10 minutes of screen time. With a more narrow focus and some balanced reporting this could have been good.It would be better to just watch Fahrenheit 911 or some Noam Chomsky documentary  power and terror  is good.".

It doesn't quite help that the poetry is a little on the high school side. Michael Moore does a better job of being one sided while seeming to be righteous.The documentary simply suffers from having too many subjects. Every revolution shown was just skimming the surface. The producers knew that too which is why the Palestine conflict had just less than 10 minutes of screen time. With a more narrow focus and some balanced reporting this could have been good.It would be better to just watch Fahrenheit 911 or some Noam Chomsky documentary  power and terror  is good.";

	schema:reviewBody "First off I wanted to point out that it was very hard to follow this movie for many reasons. The version I watched did not have subtitles or overdubbing yet basically all of the talking except the intermittent narrator was done in other languages. If you are going to make a onesided movie to tell one side of a conflict at least tell let us hear about it. I found myself looking at pictures for 2minute intervals between a 10 second narration or two quick lines of text. Maybe it was just the copy I saw but it didn't really help it's case.Second off the movie was incredibly onesided. I know I know it's a propaganda film so it will be but this was very over the top. I didn't see any Arabs cutting off heads or detonating suicide bombs at markets and schools or gassing thousands of Kurds.What many people fail to realize is that Israel wasn't just created out of nothing. Much of the original area that was granted to Israel in 1947 And previously in 1917 had been bought by the Jews from the Ottoman empire which ruled the area for hundreds of years. During the first World War the Jews and Arabs were somewhat of allies against the Turks due to being discriminated against.The Arabs tried to force the Jews out of the lands they had paid for when the Ottoman empire collapsed. The Arabs are the ones who refused to live with the Jews. The day after Israel declared independence the armies of five Arab countries invaded Iraq Syria Egypt Jordan and Lebanon. During this time Jews were discriminated against in Arab countries having property stolen and denied citizenship.In the mid50s Egypt closed the Suez canal to Israeli shipping until Israel attacked the Sinai Peninsula. Israel withdrew after Egypt agreed to lift the antiJewish ban.Again in 1967 the allied Arab states sought to destroy Israel expelling UN peacekeepers and initiating a sixday war that left Israel in control of Gaza the West Bank the Sinai Peninsula the Golan Heights and east Jerusalem. Even after giving control of the Gaza Strip back the Arabs launched attacks killed and kidnapped Israeli soldiers and have done everything in their power to cause violence.As is often the case there are two sides to every story and this film does a very poor job of telling either side of any of the conflicts it portrays.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so Lesbian Vampire Killers huh? Yes I know it sounds ludicrous atrocious gimmicky and gauchebut you know what? I enjoyed it. In fact I really enjoyed it and please bear in mind that a few readers would have you believe me to be a pompous twit. Nevermind however because Lesbian Vampire Killers is a hoot if you're willing to simply sit back and be tickled in special areas for ninety minutes. Sure it's crude utterly pointless and relies mostly on the humour of men drooling over breasts whilst decapitating lots of pretty strippersbut that's the point of the feature and it's downright hilarious fun and engaging if you're open to such stupidity. Of course I often slam movies for being braindead and moronic but that's only if they fail to make me giggle after the hundredth pitiful attempt at doing so. No rather than come across as a lame Movie hybrid Phil Claydon here manages to create a wonderfully dark comedy parody akin more to the classic Evil Dead movies spliced with a touch of Braindead and Shaun of the Dead. It's audacious rude blasphemous and somewhat morbidly eroticand yet I couldn't have been more pleased with such a piece of popcorntrashcinema.The movie takes place largely within a small rural area of Norfolk which has a history involving an ancient curse that creates lesbian vampires out of all the town's females as soon as they turn eighteen. Off on an unsuspecting break from their dreary lives which are shamefully going nowhere best friends Fletch James Corden and Jimmy Mathew Horne soon end up in the middle of a group of scantily clad tantalising lesbians who take a special interest in Jimmy because of his supposed lineage dating back to their hybrid queen who wants to rule the world again. Sound hammy? Well yes it is. Yet rather than simply avoid that fact writers Paul Hupfield and Stewart Williams acknowledge the clich intangible nature of the plot consistently toying and poking at its pretentiousness at every chance through either a quip from one of the characters or many of the devices used to further it along The Sword of Dialdo for example. Not only does help to solidify the movie's satirical edge towards fooling noone to take all this seriously but it offers plenty of brilliant oneliners and character humour too resulting in a light almost carefree experience that entertains more than disgruntles.With that being said however it should also be noted that Lesbian Vampire Killers isn't all dumb and sophomoric in fact there's plenty of intelligence going on behind the scenes and it isn't hard to see. The most potent example of this comes in the form of the characters themselves who although never straying far from the horror movie clichs of unknowing and coy hero with his bumbling comic relief buddy nevertheless work very well on screen to counteract the movie's tendency to off on extremely surreal tangents. Working with fastpaced edgy dialogue that always feels timely and natural the actors come off as having a ton of fun here and this playful nature complements the distinctly farcical side of the feature's story. Of course a large majority of that very same dialogue gets most of its laughs from the odd curse here or there but it's all so well timed and perfectly played out that you don't care if it's cheap and rudimentaryLesbian Vampire Killers isn't necessarily out to impress through any other means and it's refreshing to be treated to such a movie that stays true to that ideal without succumbing to tired derivative writing.Furthermore it has to be said that while the feature comes from an ensemble of largely unknowns within the business you would never be able to tell. Everything from the set design and performances to the fantastic score penned by Debbie Wiseman and the beautifully complementary photography of David Higgs accentuates the movie's greatest parts resulting in a coherent engaging whole that echoes the script's exploitationflick direction. So much like those feisty lesbian vampires themselves Lesbian Vampire Killers does well to keep things edgy morbid and bloody but most of allattractive fun and alluring. Not everyone will appreciate what Claydon and company achieve here in fact most will be sure to brush it off as nothing but juvenile penis jokes but those looking for downright hilarious horror done with passion and conviction need look no further than this which has everything from dildohandled swords inflicting stylized gore with foulmouthed priests who just happen to destroy lesbianism go figure to well lesbian vampires. It's the perfect Friday night popcorn muncher so sit back with some friends and enjoy it for the sharptoothed braindead fun that it is.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

Yet rather than simply avoid that fact writers Paul Hupfield and Stewart Williams acknowledge the clich intangible nature of the plot consistently toying and poking at its pretentiousness at every chance through either a quip from one of the characters or many of the devices used to further it along The Sword of Dialdo for example. Not only does help to solidify the movie's satirical edge towards fooling noone to take all this seriously but it offers plenty of brilliant oneliners and character humour too resulting in a light almost carefree experience that entertains more than disgruntles.With that being said however it should also be noted that Lesbian Vampire Killers isn't all dumb and sophomoric in fact there's plenty of intelligence going on behind the scenes and it isn't hard to see. The most potent example of this comes in the form of the characters themselves who although never straying far from the horror movie clichs of unknowing and coy hero with his bumbling comic relief buddy nevertheless work very well on screen to counteract the movie's tendency to off on extremely surreal tangents. Working with fastpaced edgy dialogue that always feels timely and natural the actors come off as having a ton of fun here and this playful nature complements the distinctly farcical side of the feature's story. Of course a large majority of that very same dialogue gets most of its laughs from the odd curse here or there but it's all so well timed and perfectly played out that you don't care if it's cheap and rudimentaryLesbian Vampire Killers isn't necessarily out to impress through any other means and it's refreshing to be treated to such a movie that stays true to that ideal without succumbing to tired derivative writing.Furthermore it has to be said that while the feature comes from an ensemble of largely unknowns within the business you would never be able to tell. Everything from the set design and performances to the fantastic score penned by Debbie Wiseman and the beautifully complementary photography of David Higgs accentuates the movie's greatest parts resulting in a coherent engaging whole that echoes the script's exploitationflick direction. So much like those feisty lesbian vampires themselves Lesbian Vampire Killers does well to keep things edgy morbid and bloody but most of allattractive fun and alluring. Not everyone will appreciate what Claydon and company achieve here in fact most will be sure to brush it off as nothing but juvenile penis jokes but those looking for downright hilarious horror done with passion and conviction need look no further than this which has everything from dildohandled swords inflicting stylized gore with foulmouthed priests who just happen to destroy lesbianism go figure to well lesbian vampires. It's the perfect Friday night popcorn muncher so sit back with some friends and enjoy it for the sharptoothed braindead fun that it is.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net";

But it was as funny as other good comedies it kept me entertained from start to finish mostly because of the lesbians but that's neither here nor there and although the plot was simple it was a nice idea. Essentially unless you like lesbians vampires and killings and unless you one of those people who sees Matthew Horne throwing a sword at the bad guy who is in the middle of his two friends and think 'that doesn't make any sense he could have missed and hit James Corden why didn't he just stab the sword' instead of thinking 'wow that was kick ass' then don't go and see this movie because you won't enjoy it.".

Based on a lot of reviews from IMDb critics and other sites it seems many who watched this film expected something quite different. To me it's a modern day comic masterpiece Cordon as Fletch and McGann as the Vicar were my favorite characters. The beautiful lead vampires played by Silvia and Vera were amazing and right there as well.

	schema:reviewBody "The film is a continuous quote Dracula American Werewolf in London Withnail and I Ed Wood's films Roger Corman's horror movies with Vincent Price Paul McGann's excellent vicar's tone is very reminiscent of Price's in Corman's interpretations of Poe and all the Hammer horrors with lesbian undertones. More than just a spoof the film is in a genre of its own being a spoofofaspoof like few others before. This can make it difficult to understand just what the film sets out to do if one is expecting a horror it certainly is not a horror or an action movie. The comparisons to Shaun of the Dead are also a big red herring and not very helpful as this is a much more PostModern citation exercise with references far wider and in many more genres it's not simply a case of an attempt in emulating for vampires what the Romero zombie movies did for Shaun of the Dead but altogether a much more varied and inclusive exercise. L.V.K also takes itself less seriously to a degree than one would not believe in a feature length film but it manages to do so in a way that is very entertaining if one is prepared to forego most of the expectations of what a film should be about. The writing could have been polished up further it could have done with a final rewrite to tie it all together and this is the film's main weakness but there is enough comedy in it to laugh every few minutes if one is prepared to embark on this journey of quotation spotting. Some of the lines are so outrageously camp that with different actors it certainly would not have worked but the film has been brilliantly cast and even the most improbable lines are recited and acted with just the right level of irony. The sound effects are one of the strongest elements together with the lesbian vampires' epic hairdos which are highly imaginative and an exercise in quotations in itself a strong effort by the art directors in what is a lowbudget movie that makes no apologies for it. Phil Claydon's directing is full of enjoyment he is constantly joking with the cameras and choices of shots that are commentaries on a commentary further spoofing Hitchcock in the shower sequence for example. This is a film might require a specific understanding of the PostModern culture we are living in to be appreciated or it can simply be enjoyed for what it is. It is neither violent nor scary but this is not necessarily a bad thing and it might be here that lies its charm those who will let go of politically correct preoccupations of what a film or a title of a film should be about will inevitably enjoy this light hearted comedy as it has plenty of opportunities to laugh out loud if you are not too worried what the person next to you or the eminent critics will think of you and you just join in the fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the obviously ridiculous title this little British bmovie is quite above the norm. It's first and foremost a comedy with some horror elements. It has been compared to Shaun of the Dead because it's a British horror comedy yet also a buddy movie. Although Lesbian Vampire Killers LBK is not as good clever or critical of society it remains quite entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised and had a very good time watching it. LBK seems to mix in a Zack Snyder 300 Watchmen style of directing alternating sped up fragments of actions and slowmotion with Heroeslike captions and comic book like transitions. I found this quite dynamic and visually appealing. You don't usually notice lighting but in this one I did and found it very well done atmospheric and at times inspired. Same thing for the musical score where it was even appropriately epic sometimes. I'm difficult yet found the script and situations more amusing than not.The director knows his genre trappings. Sometimes he revels in the clichs funny though sometimes he subverts them. The dialogue although not the cleverest out there was fine and did the job. I was disappointed that the very well introduced country girls vanished so quickly from the movie except one yet their respective exits were surprising and funny. I liked the hapless buddiesreluctant heroes especially the big guy who was juvenileminded yet comically egotistical and selfconscious. His performance seemed a bit forced sometimes though witness his laugh in the grave. The standout for me though was the vicar who had the required gravitas perfect diction and an impressive presence. Of course one should not forget the lesbian vampires who looked and acted the part although none were really developed psychologically... A few french kisses a couple of breasts in the flashbacks mostly lots of diaphanous dresses but nothing extreme or even softcore fortunately or not depending on your tastes . As for gore it's mostly white goop instead of red blood and played for slightly disgusting comical effect. LBK is the perfect bmovie to rent and watch with a couple of likeminded friends. It delivers everything the title promises and more. The production values and directing are also better than you might expect from such a lowbudget film.Rating 7.5 out of 10 Very good".

On the present days the clumsy and naive cuckold Jimmy Mathew Horne is dumped again by his girlfriend Judy Lucy Gaskell and misses her. His best friend Fletch James Corden is fired in his job of clown after hitting an annoying boy. The two friends are broken and decide to camp in the countryside to forget their problems and Jimmy throws a dart in a map in a pub to decide where they should go.

They introduce themselves as students of folklore and they are researching the Vampire Queen Carmilla.

They are abducted by the vampires but Fletch escapes and meets Reverend Vicar Paul McGann that tells him that Jimmy is a descendant of the baron and only hope to stop the evil curse of Cragwich.The Bmovie Lesbian Vampire Killers is indeed an entertaining silliness with a funny story supported by a stylish cinematography very sexy women and two imbeciles in the lead roles. There are many good moments and I particularly liked when Jimmy invites by chance the lesbian vampires to enter in the cottage or the reference to a gay werewolf inclusive in the very last scene or when Judy meets her lover at his home. This movie will certainly never be nominated to an Oscar and is not recommended to intellectuals or fans of art movie however for an average viewer like me that knows what might expect from a movie with the title Lesbian Vampire Killers he or she will not be disappointed and will certainly laugh a lot. The beautiful and sexy actresses have been very well cast by the producers. My vote is six.Title Brazil Not Available only on 30 October 2009".

On the present days the clumsy and naive cuckold Jimmy Mathew Horne is dumped again by his girlfriend Judy Lucy Gaskell and misses her. His best friend Fletch James Corden is fired in his job of clown after hitting an annoying boy. The two friends are broken and decide to camp in the countryside to forget their problems and Jimmy throws a dart in a map in a pub to decide where they should go. They head to Cragwich and when they arrive in the bar Baron's Rest they see four hot girls leaving the place in a Kombi.

Arriving in a small town they are sent to a cottage where there is free accommodation. It also happens to have a camper van full of girls staying there too! But they discover that there is an ancient curse on the girls in the village where when a girl turns 18 they become a lesbian vampire.....This movie is the latest to try and combine the horror and comedy genres. It certainly gets the humour content spoton. Paul Hupfield and Stewart Williams have written a very funny script. A lot of the humour does rely on the chemistry of James Corden and Mathew Horne as Fletch and Jimmy and they are both very good too. Paul McGann gives good support as a priest who helps fight the evil in the area. The girls in the movie are very attractive if not the best actors.Phil Claydon directs the movie quite well. The movie looks impressive the sets a throwback to the Hammer horror movies of the sixties.But where the movie fails is the horror element. There never any real scares that the best horror comedy movies have. It could be that this movie is aimed purely as a comedy that happens to be horror set but as it is billed as a horrorcomedy it has to be judged on those terms.The effects and makeup are pretty good and because of a lack of blood when the vampires die a white substance erupts from them it is only rated a 15 in the UK.The movie is fast paced and never outstays it welcome and for it's running time will have you laughing a lot. Sadly though it lacks the horror element to put it up there with the better horror comedies.".

Outside the more obvious things like the parodying of different horror movie antagonists and the loser with a fat best friend pairing of Horne and Corden the first 10 minutes is pretty much how Shaun of the Dead starts without the zombies and through Corden's acting you can hear him screaming I want to be Nick Frost! to himself.Outside of this though the movie is still terrible. Most of the humour derives from horror movie clichs you'll have lost count of them before you even open the popcorn and all of the jokes are unoriginal and incredibly predictable. In fact nearly everything that I gathered was supposed to be funny to some extent reminded me of a joke from another British comedy that was done so much better. One of the running gags through the movie is that HorneCorden fails at doing something simple like kicking a door down while a supporting character does it with ease. When I saw this I couldn't help but think the writers were thinking Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright did that thing with the fences in Shaun of the DeadHot Fuzz we need something similar.The acting is pretty terrible throughout as well. When the women came into the picture about 20 minutes in all of them with the exception of the lead female speak with this very fake and very annoying European accent. One of them also has a gimmick of only saying Ja ja which got old after... I dunno the first time she said it?

It's okay though because it's a comedy we can get away with it. The thing is you can only get away with an uninspired plot if the rest of the movie is original and inspired and since the rest of the movie can't even get the funny right it doesn't get anything else right either. Not even the horror bits. My girlfriend jumps a mile whenever there's a jumpy part of a movie but she didn't flinch for the entire 80 minutes of this. Why?

Some fans of James Corden and Mathew Horne  if there are any  may get a few more chuckles out of it than I did but I think even those with the most forgiving of temperaments are going to find this hard going.The plot if you can call it that appears to have been written on the back of a beermat with as little insight as possible two goodfornothing blokes go on holiday to Norfolk not that you'll recognise it and fall foul of an ancient curse involving lesbian vampires. In fact the plot was written around the title but if you're hoping for a cheesy bloodsoaked Bmovie in the vein of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN or TALES FROM THE CRYPT DEMON KNIGHT then you're going to be disappointed.There's barely any nudity and the decision was made to have the vampire blood white instead of red so any wouldbe splatter scenes are completely awful. Add in a bunch of models with hopeless acting and the kind of embarrassing computer effects that lace modern episodes of DOCTOR WHO and you have a film which relies on the script to work. And work it could have if the script had allowed for genuine laughs and warmth.It doesn't. This is 'comedy' of the lowest common denominator obsessed with dick and boob gags and without an ounce of wit anywhere to be seen. I tend to avoid modern comedy for a reason and the supremely unfunny James Corden is precisely that reason. What makes it all the worse is that this guy thinks he's genuinely witty and amusing when in fact most viewers will want to bash his head in with a shovel the second he appears on screen. Given the amount of screen time devoted to this guy watching LESBIAN VAMPIRE KILLERS is a cinematic equivalent of hell on Earth.There isn't much else to report. Horne is less irritating but that's purely because he's playing the straight man to Corden's socalled 'gags'. The actresses are terrible in the extreme and what Paul McGann is doing in this mess is anyone's guess  it's even worse than Queen of the Damned. It's also worse than Beyond the Rave worse than the terrible Fred Olen Ray vampire skinflicks worse than anything else that springs to mind. For a genuine lesbian vampire film you could do worse than Hammer's THE VAMPIRE LOVERS to banish this travesty from your memory.".

It's also worse than Beyond the Rave worse than the terrible Fred Olen Ray vampire skinflicks worse than anything else that springs to mind. For a genuine lesbian vampire film you could do worse than Hammer's THE VAMPIRE LOVERS to banish this travesty from your memory.";

Blake Edwards' trademark ability to combine lush romanticism with immitable slapstick comedy was here matched by a wonderful score by his longtime collaborator Henry Mancini Voila!  we're back in the early sixties again.  It didn't hurt that stars Julie Andrews and James Garner were hottest in the sixties and had acted together in 1964's The Americanization of Emily.Robert Preston The Music Man of late fifties Broadway and 1962 screen fame further added an element of early sixties nostalgia  with the twist that he here used his booming vocal tones in the service of a delightfully out and comfortable gay man.  Preston was one of two hot contenders for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year. The winner was Lou Gossett Jr. for his Drill Instructor in An Officer And A Gentleman.Rounding out the great cast are Lesley Ann Warren sexy and very funny in an Oscarnominated role as Garner's mob moll floozie and Alex Karras continually funny as Garner's softhearted ox of a bodyguard.  Karras gets a classic Blake Edwards slapstick routine trapped in the freezing snow outside a Paris hotel getting big laughs out of the simple line  You've got heat? That's good.And be sure to keep a lookout for Sherloque Tanney as the French private detective on VictorVictoria's trail.   Tanney was Blake Edwards dentist and appeared in almost every Blake Edwards film from Darling Lili 1970 on.  Other than his corpse in SOB 1981 the French detective is possibly Dr. Tanney's greatest role on the screen.  Tanney too gets to anchor several great trademark Blake Edwards slapstick routines.Oh and there's music too.  Enough music for a Broadway musical which is what VictorVictoria became and with a sad and wistful Mancini title tune reprised in the film by Andrews that reminds one a bit of Moon River and Days of Wine and Roses.  Just like in the early sixties.".

Enough music for a Broadway musical which is what VictorVictoria became and with a sad and wistful Mancini title tune reprised in the film by Andrews that reminds one a bit of Moon River and Days of Wine and Roses.  Just like in the early sixties.";

The acting ranges from the impeccable the leads through the touching Alex Karras right to the truly sublime Robert Preston and Lesley AnnWarren.  The musical numbers are lovingly staged and shot and possibly because this is a preMTV film we actually get to see dancers dancing as opposed to machinegun assemblies of body parts performing details of not necessarily connected movements.  The directorial touch is assured proficient but never showy the many complicated setups are executed with elegance economy  not a frivolous camera movement to be seen  and discretion.  The circular pan around Julie as she sings Crazy World is a lovely example of how camera movement can create emotion without drawing attention to itself.  The sets and costumes are lavish but again do not distract.  The screenplay is witty full of deft touches and Edwards treats his rather daring for 1982 theme without blinking and with great lucidity.  The other drag film of the year was Tootsie which stuck to the romance and stayed away from uncomfortable homosexual touches as much as it managed to.  The timing never falters. And the score is priceless.All in all a flawless entertainment which like the best movies from the studio system's heyday of which Victor  Victoria is a proud and worthy descendant rewards the attentive and interested viewer with far more substance  and style  than might appear at first.  I do not have the space to analyse this film at the length it deserves but I can recommend it which I do wholeheartedly.".

Blake Edwards converts the film's clever concept into a film of true cinematic flair and panache.The film's music alone is enough to make VictorVictoria a winner. With consummate verve Andrews sings the lively Le Jazz Hot a stage performance that has been mimicked by it seems one in ten talent competitors in the Miss America Pageant for the last twenty years. The colorful song The Shady Dame From Seville is memorable as a cultural classic. Even the restrained You And Me is satisfying with its old fashioned charm. And Henry Mancini's wistful and slightly melancholy original score adds melodic balance to the flashy stage numbers.The casting is perfect. I cannot imagine anyone other than Julie Andrews as Victoria. James Garner is fine as King Marchand. And in support roles Lesley Ann Warren adds sexy spunk as Norma and Alex Karras is surprisingly effective as Marchand's bodyguard. But it is music man Robert Preston who leads this top notch Hollywood talent parade. Preston is likable throughout and is a hoot in the film's finale.If the film has a flaw it might be in the editing. The plot in Act Two slows down. Or to say it a little differently it ... drags so to speak. The 132 minute runtime is a tad long maybe and so a few scene deletions here and there might have rendered a slight improvement in the pace. But this is a minor issue one that I raise only in my graspingatstraws attempt to find something to complain about.VictorVictoria is an expressive fun oneofakind musical garden party that easily makes my list of top fifty films ever made.".

	schema:headline " A relief from most of today's movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "Great wit wonderful set design very good acting  What can one say bad about the film? Perhaps the plethora of homosexuals was a bit over the top as was the part of the private investigator but these are nitpicks hardly noticed against the background of most modern releases. While I dislike musicals intensely this one is different most obviously in the setting for the music. Unlike the incongruous breaking out in song in the middle of conversation this movie's music occurs within the framework of nightclub acts. This adds to the credibility of a plot that could have spun out of control much as S.O.B. did unfortunately. What really sets this movie apart from the crowd of boxoffice hits that plague us is the incredible wit of the dialogue. The writing is truly wonderful! And Preston is perfect for his character his repartee style as sharp as the lines Blake Edwards puts in his mouth. It is my tendency to pick apart films on the issue of credibility allowing as we should for the genre of the film. H.G.Wells once said that good science fiction depended on introducing one and only one fantastic idea and then developing a plot whose events would follow reasonably from that one idea. Bad science fiction he said introduces several such incredible inventions and ideas creating a plot too fantastic for the reader to immerse himherself in. So too with movies. Good comedy science fiction drama even action plots should have one premise that might stretch the limit of credibility and then develop the plot reasonably from there. Most modern boxoffice hits fail to do this and in the process of feeding us one fantasy after another to stimulate our interest and attract our dollars dulls our minds. Victor  Victoria is good writing because it starts with its one major premise  an unsuccessful though talented singer achieving fame and fortune by altering her sexual image  and lets the plot play itself out. There are a few minor stretches beside the main premise but without fantastic physical feats explosions car chases and CG effects Edwards has created a script that pulls  rather than pushes  you in to the plot. The weakest part of the plot is the fact that Andrew's character attains success not just by crossdressing but also by substantially altering her act. We are supposed to ignore the fact that she has changed from simply singing to singing with well choreographed movement. However this is not a serious flaw because in the real Hollywood and Broadway very good talent is habitually unsuccessful while the fantastic and ridiculous is placed on an altar. Does anyone really think Schwarzenegger can act? Did I say acting? Perhaps I saved the best for last. Andrews playing herself is perfect here Garner is fantastic and Leslie Ann Warren adapted to her character's personality so completely that I hardly realized it was her. And at the risk of repetition Preston is perfection itself. The set design was almost excessive in the distraction it caused for you could not help noticing how artfully it was designed and lit. Finally Henry Mancini wrote the music. The DVD commentary added substantially to the production making the entire package a 5star offering a rating I rarely give.".

	onyx:emotionText "Great wit wonderful set design very good acting  What can one say bad about the film? Perhaps the plethora of homosexuals was a bit over the top as was the part of the private investigator but these are nitpicks hardly noticed against the background of most modern releases. While I dislike musicals intensely this one is different most obviously in the setting for the music. Unlike the incongruous breaking out in song in the middle of conversation this movie's music occurs within the framework of nightclub acts. This adds to the credibility of a plot that could have spun out of control much as S.O.B. did unfortunately. What really sets this movie apart from the crowd of boxoffice hits that plague us is the incredible wit of the dialogue. The writing is truly wonderful! And Preston is perfect for his character his repartee style as sharp as the lines Blake Edwards puts in his mouth. It is my tendency to pick apart films on the issue of credibility allowing as we should for the genre of the film. H.G.Wells once said that good science fiction depended on introducing one and only one fantastic idea and then developing a plot whose events would follow reasonably from that one idea. Bad science fiction he said introduces several such incredible inventions and ideas creating a plot too fantastic for the reader to immerse himherself in. So too with movies. Good comedy science fiction drama even action plots should have one premise that might stretch the limit of credibility and then develop the plot reasonably from there. Most modern boxoffice hits fail to do this and in the process of feeding us one fantasy after another to stimulate our interest and attract our dollars dulls our minds. Victor  Victoria is good writing because it starts with its one major premise  an unsuccessful though talented singer achieving fame and fortune by altering her sexual image  and lets the plot play itself out. There are a few minor stretches beside the main premise but without fantastic physical feats explosions car chases and CG effects Edwards has created a script that pulls  rather than pushes  you in to the plot. The weakest part of the plot is the fact that Andrew's character attains success not just by crossdressing but also by substantially altering her act. We are supposed to ignore the fact that she has changed from simply singing to singing with well choreographed movement. However this is not a serious flaw because in the real Hollywood and Broadway very good talent is habitually unsuccessful while the fantastic and ridiculous is placed on an altar. Does anyone really think Schwarzenegger can act? Did I say acting? Perhaps I saved the best for last. Andrews playing herself is perfect here Garner is fantastic and Leslie Ann Warren adapted to her character's personality so completely that I hardly realized it was her. And at the risk of repetition Preston is perfection itself. The set design was almost excessive in the distraction it caused for you could not help noticing how artfully it was designed and lit.

Julie Andrews plays Victoriaand Victor quite well but sometimes its hard believing that people would believe that she is a man.  There are some great scenes in this movie that are derived from this concept though.  James Garner and Robert Preston are both excellent in their roles Preston as Andrews gay friend and Garner the manliest man around.  Actually all of the performances are excellent but a lot of this movies success has to go to Blake Edwards. There is classic Edwards comedy in this movie and a very intelligent script that never insults its audiences intelligence.  I won't give specifics but I will say the there is a show stopping number at the end of the movie that is hilarious.  Most of the music is excellent and if its bad its intended to be that way. Really though I only have one question.  Having seen The Party and now this movie one has to wonder what does Blake Edwards have against waiters?  9 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Hey! I have a great idea  let's put on a farce!";
	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Blake Edwards this is a fast witty farce about a woman posing as a man posing as a woman in 1930s Paris. Victoria Julie Andrews is down on her luck. Oh not as bad as George Orwell in Down and Out in Paris and London but pretty far down this being the depression. She develops a scheme to cheat her way through a full meal at a restaurant by planting a cockroach in her salad. It more or less works but more important she runs into cheerful savvy gay Robert Preston who becomes her manager.Andrews has been unable to find work as a soprano because singers are a glut on the market but Preston promotes her as a female impersonator. She succeeds wildly. Among the audience at one of her shows in a fancy nightclub is rich James Garner his coarse moll Leslie Anne Warren and his big beefy bodyguard Alex Karras.Garner is sexually aroused by Andrews' sultry performance and when she whips off her headgear and reveals herself as a man named Victor Garner's face falls marvelously. He's been excited by a MAN! When he gets back to his room he needs to prove his manhood by virtually attacking Warren. Alas his homosexual anxiety renders him impotent but Warren is all understanding. Awww honey it's no big deal. Women are lucky. They can fake it. Oh not with YOU baby! Listen just 'cause you can't get it  Up till now it's been wonderful. After that it gets complicated.The writing is sharply witty. In the restaurant at the very beginning when Andrews and Preston meet there is a hilarious exchange between Preston and the waiter played by Graham Stark as one of those contemptuous French waiters who always seems distracted as if mentally deconstructing La Pensee Sauvage you know and you're interrupting his cogitation. But Preston being gay is his equal. Stark pours a glass of white wine for Preston who squints at it with distaste and remarks The last time I saw something like this they had to shoot the horse. Preston is trying to dress Andrews as a man and teach her to act in a masculine fashion. He tells her thoughtfully There are two main obstacles we must overcome. Andrews asks My bosom? and then adds that if she has to bind her bosom for years it will wind up looking like an old wallet. After Andrews' success Preston checks them into a threestar hotel and announces You must see the bathroom. It's a religious experience. Much of the humor revolves around gender bending of course but the script treats the audience as reasonably sophisticated rather than 19thcentury rural twits. I don't think Blake Edwards depends on shock value for laughs. The laughs arise out of the situations.There are a couple of songs thrown in. Julie Andrews has a splendid voice and a range that runs from elephantine subrumble to air raid siren. The dance numbers are elaborately staged with what I take to be a deliberate homage to Bob Fosse  plenty of derbies clicking fingers and swiveling pelvises.There's a mostly dull romantic piece in the mosaic done seriously in which Andrews and Garner try to come to terms with the fact that they love each other although if they want to keep her real sex a secret they must go dancing at a gay bar. And some of the comic interludes seems a little forced at least on multiple viewings. Andrews in her masculine disguise bravely accepts a cigar  and coughs. She looks immeasurably better as a woman than as a man. And the final number in which Preston is in drag and singing one of Andrews' numbers and falling all over himself isn't really either imaginative or very amusing.But those are small things. Overall this is a funny farce skillfully written directed and performed.".

One thing leads to another and he turns into a female impersonator! So she is a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman. The gay characters in this are fun and drive the story! This was Blake Edwards crowning achievement. In fact he later turned this movie into a Broadway play!

	schema:reviewBody "After finally seeing DARLING LILI on DVD I was surprised by how familiar the whole disastrous 1970 movie was. Then I realized LILI was just another Blake Edwards film filled with typical Blake Edwards shenanigans seen so many times in other Blake Edwards films including VICTORVICTORIA.Like DARLING LILI VICTORVICTORIA is a nonmusical musical. That is people don't sing out suddenly and dance and such. All the singing occurs on stage. So we watch people watching a stage show. It makes for a very inert musical. I prefer musicals like MY FAIR LADY or FUNNY FACE where the characters' singing isn't anchored to one specific area. There's nothing interesting in watching people watching a stage show.Like in DARLING LILI there's a lot of unfunny slapstick comedy in VICTORVICTORIA some of which are stretched out forever the whole scene with the cockroach at the restaurant for example. Or the scene where someone is outside Victoria's apartment trying to see if Victor is actually a man or woman. This scene is identical to the very long and unfunny scene in DARLING LILI which has two French police officers spying on Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson from a slanted rooftop while it's raining outside not snowing like in VV.Like in DARLING LILI the whole thing takes place in a kitschy version of Paris and yet all the songs are in English. And the production values are too sleek and they just don't jibe with Paris of that era. Why does Blake keep making movies set in France and yet they feel so nonFrench? Like in DARLING LILI the romance in VICTORVICTORIA is very artificial and forced. Instead of big squarejawed Rock Hudson in LILI Julie falls for big squarejawed James Garner in VV. What a stretch.Like in DARLING LILI there's a pointless striptease in VICTORVICTORIA which adds nothing to the story. In LILI it was Crepe Suzette. In VV we see Lesley Ann Warren dancing and wiggling her butt and taking her clothes off. Her musical number is horrible. Cats screeching sound better than this musical number.Like in DARLING LILI there's no payoff in VICTORVICTORIA. We expect some sort of amazing payoff at the end after milking the whole Garner falling in love with Andrews as Victoria only to refuse to believe that Andrews is a man bit for most of the film only for what? So that Andrews falls in love with Garner as woman and they live happily ever after? I thought the point of Andrews going through all of this charade was for her to have a successful singing career not live in poverty etc? Incidentally for a film that's about gender bending and homosexuality it's somewhat misogynistic and homophobic. Misogynistic because Andrews loses her sensational job for a man and it's a tad homophobic with the Garner falling in love with Andrews as Victoria only to refuse to believe that Andrews is a man bit is played strictly for laughs. How refreshing it would have been if it hadn't been played entirely just for laughs.And like in DARLING LILI the 1982 film is way too long and overstays its welcome after a while. Edwards just doesn't know when to end his films. Unlike DARLING LILI though VICTORVICTORIA is not an all out disaster like that illconceived 1970 film. It's OK but nothing remarkable and most definitely overrated from looking at the reviews here. Like I've mentioned above there's a vivid sense of dejavu whenever I'm watching a Blake Edwards film because you know he's such a risky director.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1964 Blake Edwards had directed his wife Julie Andrews in her film debut The Americanization Of Emily which James Garner costars with her and Henry Mancini wrote a fine title song for the film. The film was sort of a trial run before Andrews was launched full blast by Walt Disney in Mary Poppins.This fine team reunited 18 years later for the gender defying comedy Victor Victoria and Mancini wrote a few songs for Julie Andrews and Robert Preston and Lesley Ann Warren to do. A decade later Julie Andrews had it adapted to the Broadway stage for her.Andrews is starving in Paris poor as a match girl ready to lick the spaghetti sauce off a bib when she falls in with gay performer Robert Preston who is equally on his uppers. With conventional acts neither is getting anywhere. But when Preston gets the idea to pass Andrews off as a man who is a female impersonator they are a success. They even pretend to be lovers to keep the masquerade going.It all starts to unravel when visiting American gangster James Garner and his moll Lesley Ann Warren drop in to the nightclub. Andrews gets his hormones going and he's not sure why. Going in drag is an old movie story. Everyone from Katharine Hepburn to Gabby Hayes has done it on the screen. But the questions about sexual identity and gender attraction were never so provocatively raised before until Victor Victoria.Andrews and Preston were both in Blake Edwards immediately preceding film SOB and both had a pair of outrageous parts in that one also which I highly recommend. Andrews and Preston got rewarded with Oscar nominations she for Best Actress and Preston for Best Supporting Actor. Julie lost to Meryl Streep for Sophie's Choice and Preston lost to Lou Gossett Jr. for an Officer And A Gentleman.But saddest for me was Lesley Ann Warren who did a marvelous job recreating a throwback role from all those old gangster films of the Thirties. Her part was just the kind you used to see Joan Blondell or Glenda Farrell play to perfection. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but lost to Jessica Lange for Tootsie.In fact Victor Victoria was nominated for Best Costume Design Best Art Set Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay. It did win in a category that seems like it was created for the film Best Adapted Music and Musical Score. That was a new one on me when I saw it.Over 25 years after it was made Victor Victoria is still one fresh and naughty item. And a milestone in the mainstream for GLBT themed films.".

James Garner is the man's man who begins to doubt his manliness when he finds himself having some strange feelings for this guy. It's a very gayfriendly movie that's really squeaky clean though it might have been racy at the time when homosexuality wasn't as accepted as it is now if you want to call it accepted even now.There are lots of production numbers but this doesn't feel like a musical as all of the numbers are presented in context of a show and they don't propel the plot or develop characters. Lesley Ann Warren is fairly obnoxious as a bawdy American but Robert Preston steals the show as a fellow drag performer.As far as Blake Edwards projects go this is one of the strongest.Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "Blake's 'VictorVictoria' is a splendid musical comedy set in Paris during the late 1930s. Julie Andrews stars in the title role delivering one of her finest performances cannot imagine anyone else play the part along with James Garner brilliant Robert Preston superb Lesley AnnWarren hilarious and Alex Karras funny. All actors share a wonderful chemistry. Blake's colourful and heartfelt accomplishment is a result of the effort put together by cast crew and director. The musical numbers have been beautifully picturised without deviating from the witty screenplay. The dialogs are cleverly written and certainly more than add to the charm. The costumes and set designs though loud and lavish do not distract nor deviate from the main content and they look genuine. Blake also creates a strangely dark but humorous atmosphere of Paris where only the rich survive and there is no place for the poor.'VictorVictoria' does explore issues of homosexual lifestyles that clash with heterosexual lifestyle but never does it lose its touch with humour. After all this is a comedy and one of the finest. It doesn't try to be bigger than what it is. There are several hilariously memorable moments. A few examples are when Garner and Karras sneak into Andrew's and Preston's suite. Andrew's song and dance numbers Garner doubting his own sexuality Karras coming to terms with his identity Warren's scenes with Garner and Andrews when Preston and Andrews have dinner at the restaurant for the first time and Andrews pretending to be a man.The film though exceeds the traditional 2 hour length it's time well spent as you'll find yourself amused by this witty and cleverly made heartfelt piece of entertainment. It's one of my favourite comedies and I think you're gonna love it too.".

The movie was referenced in the very end when Abby talks to Tony about movies related to their case at hand and it just so happens that Victor Victoria comes up. I believe it was my brother who rented the movie from the library first and then we went from there.Victoria Grant the legendary Julie Andrews is a struggling singer who has problems earning money with her voice and is forced out of her home because she can no longer afford the rent. She comes upon Carole Todd the late great Robert Preston who is forced out of his job through no fault of his own. The two then become fast friends and eventually roommates. With an idea from Mr. Todd Toddy to everyone Victoria becomes a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman. Try to say that five times fast. She lands her first gig without a problem and comes across King Marchand the late great James Garner his bodyguard the late Alex Karras and King's girlfriend Norma Cassidy the everfunny Lesley Ann Warren during the opening performance. She wows everyone involved particularly Norma...who doesn't know that Victoria is actually a woman. King shakes it off and later talks with Victor after the show. After the pleasantries are exchanged King his bodyguard and Norma head back to their hotel while Victoria heads back with Toddy to their room that just so happens to be in the same hotel. After some performance issues with King and Norma and her having a conniption fit his bodyguard sends her back to the United States. In no time at all Victoria becomes the talk of Paris in more ways than one. And then there comes a private investigator who is bound and determined to make the woman out to be a total fraud. Needless to say he has some bad luck of his own struck by lightning gets his finger stuck in a closet door etc. along the way.Back in the States Norma does a little performance of her own and then cries to one of King's friends Sal. After faking tears she tells the man that King is hooking up with another man and Sal is not too pleased to hear about it. In Paris King eventually finds out that Victoria is not a man and falls in love with her. In the final 1520 minutes Norma Sal and a few other members of his entourage come to Paris to confront King about his homosexuality. However Victoria comes in and corners Norma in the bedroom exposing that she is a woman and not a man. The reaction by Norma is priceless to say the least. Shortly after that Toddy takes the reins as Victoria and the real Victoria is safe to be with King as the woman that she is without being exposed by the sly P.I.Back in 1982 LGBTrelated issues weren't so much of a hot topic as they are now. Blake Edwards nailed it perfectly without being blunt as it were. As the title states this is truly an LGBTfriendly comedy before its time. After all Toddy is homosexual King's bodyguard is homosexual and Victoria is a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that you will laugh until you cry fall over or both. Enjoy this timeless classic because it is not going away anytime soon.".

The sets remain sets and all of the actors except for Andrews are and remain American. Europe in the 30s is not convincingly evoked. The film is too talky and does come off as homosexual propaganda with Andrews lecturing James Garner as well as the audience. Overall the film feels more like a comedy from the early 60s which was the most prolific period for Edwards Andrews and Garner. The musical numbers are fine and there is fun to be had but it's somewhat overrated overlong and rather forgettable.

The Garden takes the persecution that Christ faced and puts it in modern times or an unknown time for that matter. We have two homosexual martyrs who are persecuted like Christ by the church. Tilda Swinton plays a modern day Mary who's chased around by ruthless Paparazzis. The film contains many strange visual delights. There is not a whole lot of dialog except for poetic narration. Like Jodorowsky's the Holy Mountain it's chock full of bizarre religious images. The set pieces and Costumes are extremely avantgarde and colorful. If you enjoy films that are a trip for the mind you'll enjoy the Garden. I felt that Derek Jarmon was inventive with his camera tricks and imagery. If you like bizarre arthouse films with hallucinatory imagery you must see this film.".

	schema:headline " An interesting perception of the media on religion and sexuality";
	schema:reviewBody "I wrote my analysis on this so I think its fitting to place it here I don't think there are any spoilers but just in case there is one someone notices I gave the warning. It does hint at other parts in the filmThe scene depicts the humiliation of two gay men portrayed through the main sections of the New Testament. This segment I have chosen is rich in colours symbolism and religious imagery and contains religious iconography. The deceased Derek Jarman was a well known director and screenwriter of unusual and challenging films which were often longstanding stories that had been warped or had changed perspective.The second section is set in what looks like a sleazy massage parlour. In it are the clear divisions of authority and power shown in terms of colour and grandeur and their performances shown in confidence and gesture. The two men as seen in the scene before have been found. It is clear that they are unhappy about this since their freedom is no longer possible and so they cower into each other in the middle of the room. They are in the middle of the room to show that they are the centre of attention the objects towards which the rich and powerful men are projecting their intimidation. As it is they do not seem to be rejecting their sexuality but staying true to themselves which is what Jesus did. The first shot is of a dripping wet hairy adult leg which is raised and a finger bounces off a point of his foot the point where a nail is driven through in a crucifixion this may be a reference to the amount of torture that is to come the fact of their impending death. In the massage parlour there are a number of highly unattractive older men walking around half naked and rubbing each other with oils and sponges laughing and joking acting as if they is nothing more pleasing than to humiliate and taunt the two men standing before them. The main man which I presume to be Pontius Pilate is wearing a grand red dressing gown and nothing underneath but for a pair of small gold pants. The reason for this presumption is that half way through when he washes his hands in the water with the other men. He sings 'down to the river Jordan' as he does so. The river Jordan is the river which was known then as the river that fed the 'garden of God' and in the New Testament Jesus was baptised in it. This image and act of washing his hands is reminiscing of the section in the New Testament 'I wash my hands of you.' Gold and red The colours of wealth and power. The other men are wearing an odd assortment of garments including a drawn on paper crown a towel a gold dressing gown a gold fan and sunglasses. All of these garments and objects give the men higher status they are comfortable assured of their wealth and power. They prance around stupidly with great confidence in themselves laughing along with their acquaintances in a casual faade and makebelieve happiness. The lovers standing there enduring their laughter their flaunting. Perhaps thinking wistfully of before when they were able to be alone together something that riches and power and status would not have allowed. Taking a different perspective this scene could portray a kind of hell. One where the devil is the man implementing the basin as a drum and going wild. His mental abuse of the men is challenging them each deranged primitive scream saying 'stand up for yourselves!' The parlour would be a taunting strange sexual fantasy invading them taunting them. As though the parlour is in their heads and it is just the devil and them the great illusion the temptation or allurement. The capricious nature of the devil defies all previous conviction of him being merely evil it is depicting him as a primitive impulsive being that transcends evil. His actions become almost bestial.Overall I find it and enchanted and fascinating picture from an artistic visionary  I loved it but you should make up your own mind this film is not for everyone.".

He mixes footage of his own extraordinary garden in Dungeness one of the most remarkable  bleak landscapes in Englandwith dreamlike reenactments of New Testament stories given a gay spin. Church antipathy to homosexuality the AIDS crisis police and media brutality all spin around the screen in kaleidoscopic fashion the images the film admits to be the dreamscapes of Jarman's own mind he appears in his study and in his bed.The trouble with The Garden is that although it is often visually remarkable it is also shudderingly obvious. The scenes in which respectable old tutors bash their canes and bosh through Bibles as a boy prances on a table or where 3 Santas homophobically abuse a gay couple or where a camp pseudoPilate laughs with his minions in a sauna are all crushingly obvious pieces of public schoolboy sketchshow comedy cutprice Monty Python skits which presume that the audience always already agrees with what is being said so we needn't bother to argue analyse or comprehend why. It's agitprop at its dullest and even Jarman's considerable abilities as a visual artist and editor can't raise this into being a work of art rather than a work of jejune satire.As for Jarman's vision of homosexuality again he shows his class colours and sentimental bent. His gay boys are nice middleclass lads neatly dressed and posing around like something out of Brideshead Revisited they're very cute and noticeably silent. It's a very middleEngland excusemaking image of homosexuality with no dissonance or awkwardness allowed as if Jarman thought to be gay was to be a Jerome K Jeromeish Two Men in a Boat.I suppose that the film is heartfelt and rises from a comfortable middleclass man's one piece of anger the anger that he isn't accepted by the establishment he is a part of.

The Yangs are then appointed important ministers though An Lushan is not given the court position he covets.

In the newly released Masters of Cinema version the critic Tony Raines is highly dismissive in the introduction  calling it dramatically inert and making a few rather pompous and pedantic points about the translation. Donald Richie in his 'Hundred Years of Japanese Film' is similarly dismissive. It is certainly not Mizoguchi's best it lacks the flair of Ugetsu and the character development of his more contemporary dramas but I think this movie is far better than the dismissive comments suggest. Maybe its just that Japanese cinema of the period is so fabulously rich that even very good movies can be discounted.The story is taken from an ancient Chinese legend  of the beautiful concubine of a great emperor sacrificed for the sins of her family. No doubt the Chinese setting looks rather ludicrous to Chinese viewers it was originally a coproduction with HK based company but they seem to have had no artistic input but thats hardly new  even Crouching Dragon Hidden Tiger was hated by most mandarin speakers I know. And its probably no worse that the Last Samurai or Memoirs of a Geisha appears to the Japanese.It was Mizuguchi's first colour film  while some commentators have praised the beauty of the camerawork I must admit I was left a big cold by it  not a patch on for example Ozu's first colour experiments. It may be that the blame is the digital colour transfer or just my poor quality screen but I think its more than that  I get the strong impression the movie was shot on a very tight budget  some of the sets look very fake compared to most Mizoguchi' films I've seen. I don't think the film makers were totally aware of how colour can show up fakery in a way they could get away with using black and white. In fact the whole movie has a slightly throw away feel as if Mizoguchi didn't fully have his heart in it. There are lots of opportunities for the sort of big sweeping scene he specialised in but which aren't taken up here  I would guess that he simply didn't have the time and budget for it.But I don't mean to criticise this too much  while the script is occasionally clunky it is usually very moving and beautifully acted. The characters are vivid and while its a little bit much to believe that a great Emperor could be quite such a sappy soul Mori and Kyo do a reasonable job in making their characters believable  or as believable as possible when translating such an ancient story. Kyo as always is wonderfully watchable. Mori is slightly less successful  he doesn't quite show the steel that much have existed under the cultured exterior of a man who ran an empire.So while this film is certainly not a masterpiece by Mizoguchi or one of the best movies of the period its certainly superior to most contemporary costume dramas and well worth having to while away a rainy Sunday afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Donald Richie the famous scholar of Japanese film has dismissed this as a dull reworking of Chinese history albeit with some nicelooking colors. Though many others have agreed his analysis is correct in one detail merely the colors are absolutely beautiful even in the VHS my library has. As it is one of only two color films Mizoguchi ever made and the more beautiful of the two this alone would make Yokihi a worthwhile watch.But this film has a strange relationship with the beauty that is present both in the color and in the relationship between the Emperor and Yang KweiFei. The film admires beauty but it is about the prostitution of beauty and the hatred that beauty can inspire. Some have accused it of being merely another Cinderella story just like all the others and it would certainly be a mistake to overlook the similarities. But it looks at the Cinderella archetype in a more disillusioned way instead of being Yang KweiFei's escape from her unfortunate family her relationship with the Emperor is exploited by the same family members so that she is just as much their slave as she had always been and so that when the Chinese peasants get upset at the corruption caused by her family naturally they lash out at her. But because of the sheer beauty of the film both visual and in the way that the relationship between the Emperor and Yang KweiFei is treated the film is not cynical ironic and it never thinks itself better than the myths from which it arises. Instead it becomes a sublime fabulous in much the same way that many of Mizoguchi's greatest films such as Zangiku Monogatari Saikaku Ichidai Onna Ugetsu Monogatari and Sansho Dayu resemble fables romantic tragedy about beauty and its exploitation.This is not a typographical error. Though the film itself is Japanese the legend of Yang KweiFei is Chinese and as such the film is set in China.".

Kenji Mizogichi a filmmaker I admire from Ugetsu has here a very lushly made film with perfectly constructed sets that spark a tinge of both fable and centuriesgone reality and costumes that compliment the color photography. And that part of capturing the images is maybe the best thing that can be recommendable about the film. For a film about a Princess who was once lower on the ranks in the Emperor's home and becomes the Emperor's love interest it provides such opportunities for a real vision to set in to guide it all.Mizoguchi provides it with his cinematographer Khei Sugiyama in order sometimes for the film to be told almost all on visual terms the filmmaker was most prolific in the silentfilm era. So in the end even as the story becomes a little cluttered with some scenes it's never too complex due to the basics that the filmmaker is going for and probably why it was picked up by Buena Vista distribution in the 1950s a beautiful scope of Japan's regal side mixed with some of the lower classes. It's like a Shakespearean tale if it was superimposed into Japan and given a touch of that lostera of color photography that was only matched by PowellPressburger's films.".

Be prepared to see ideal archetypes of perfectly virtous selfsacrificing women stupid greedy and cruel men and did I mention?...the cruelties of feudalism. I think such a simple story set during feudalism is a weakness in this film. It leaves a viewer commonly thinking feudalism sucks boy that's new it's good it's over...what's next? This is a perfectly valid critique. Mizoguchi's vastly better films are his realistic masterworks from 1036 'Osaka Elegy' and 'Sisters of the Gion' as well as his late more retrained masterpieces 'Ugetsu' 'Sansho Dayu' and 'Life of Oharu'.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard about Scooby Doo being turned into a movie I will confess to being rather reticent about seeing it. I am just old enough to remember the original Scooby Doo cartoons on rerun and was at the high end of the right target age group when Scrappy Doo hit the scene and of course remembered Scooby Doo with a certain love. Of course the cartoon was actually pretty terrible the writing was bad the cliches came in at a rate of knots and the animation was second rate... but that's what we all expected of HannaBarbara cartoons.I digress I had heard about SD the movie on the Internet quite early in production and let out a groan my childhood was being raped again for a buck in Hollywood. Why? Why bother??? Then when I heard Scooby was going to be CGI I actually groaned again. Of course there is no other way you could have pulled Scoob off onscreen without CGI at least not realistically... but CGI... that's just so passe any more! I still enjoy the artistry in modern CGI but to me it felt like SD was going to be done just to prove that it COULD be done with modern technology... not to tell a story.So it came I read a few online reviews that panned it and failed to be surprised. I caught the trailers and failed to be inspired. I steadfastly avoided the movie theatres and just didn't go see it.Fast forward to July of 2003 SD is playing on Cinemax I think and I've got some time to kill. Aw what the hell... could be good for background noise if nothing else...So having sat through SD the Movie what do I think? Well as much as I wanted to hate it because it was Hollywood raping my childhood I just couldn't. I'm not going to say I loved it because that wouldn't be true but I'll be darned if I can't admit that it was a whole hell of a lot better than I expected. Let me fill you inThe cast is incredible. They have a real onscreen chemistry that really makes the movie for me. Especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy... if he hasn't just completely NAILED the character as perfectly as you could in live action then I'm the queen of France. There's the romantic attraction between Daphne and Fred that comes out onscreen pretty much throughout and of course the distant attraction Velma had for Fred is right there too. But do I detect a little bit of an attraction to Shaggy? Don't remember that in the cartoon... but I can accept that.The story? Well it's a hell of a lot better written than the cartoons! Yes it borrows heavily from them and borrows from some of the SD animated movies that have been made in the interim but still it's an interesting story with a nice twist at the end that had me actually laughing out loud. Not Shakespeare by any stretch of the imagination... but a fun and engaging story that keeps your attention.So what about the CGI Scoob? Wow is all I can say! I don't know what makes it more the quality of the CGI or the way in which all the actors really made me believe they were sharing the screen with a 6'5 intelligent dog. The interactions were believable and not once did I catch anyone making the mistake of looking in the wrong place onscreen which is clearly evident in many instances where CGI characters are used. The personality is captured perfectly and translates Scooby from the twocolor animation of my youth to a perfect rendition of how I envisaged him in my minds eye.I'm sure many have heard about them already but there are plenty of injokes that pepper the movie for those willing to pay attention. I won't say they're all laughoutloud funny but they are amusing... and it was obvious pretty early on that the filmmakers didn't like Scrappy Doo either I know I didn't... I didn't even like him as a kid but rather than pretend he never happened cough Galactica 1980 cough they actually bring him to life in this movie too... and actually he has one of the lines that made me laugh out loud to those who have seen it it's the line he never finishes saying...So did I love it as much as I loved Scooby as a kid? No. The movie was definitely not without flaws and it did depart from the cartoons in some pretty major ways for example one of the nice things about the cartoon looking at it now from an adult's perspective was that at the end of every episode it was reiterated however lightly that there are no such things as monsters ghosts ghouls etc. and that we as people are always responsible for these things. This is something I picked up on as a kid but didn't understand until I was an adult and kids should be given that reassurance early in life that there are no monsters. The movie departed from that part of the formula... so personally I couldn't recommend the movie to younger under about 8 or 9 children. However even with these kids recommend that a parent watch it with them... but of course there's plenty of adulttype humor in there too that will completely pass the kids by. To me that's the mark of a great kids movie these days the ability to appeal to all ages.Overall I'd say a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "ScoobyDoo is a worthy live action film to a brilliant original T.V. showPlot The Mystery Inc. gang have split up and are each off on their own only ScoobyDoo Voice of Neil Fanning and Shaggy Matthew Lilard remain together and they own the Mystery Machine. They are called back into action when a strange man shows up and invites them to Spooky Island to solve a mystery. They are convinced when he mentions an all you can eat buffet and are on their way to the airport. There they run into the rest of the gang Fred Freddie Prinze Jr. Velma Linda Cardellini and Daphne Sarah Michelle Gellar. Still resenting each other they refuse contact and once on the island they meet the owner Emile Mondavariours Rowan Atkinson who informs them of the problem. He believes that somebody is casting a spell on the visitors who come to his resort. Starting off on looking for clues by themselves the gang realizes after a attack that they need to put their differences aside and team up if they ever want to solve the mystery.The Good News This being the motion picture film to a T.V. series that spawned thousands of imitators it had a lot to live up to and it delivers. Since it was released people have bashed this film to pieces but if you take a minutes and look at it closely it is a pretty underrated film. The actors all do an outstanding job at bringing the gang to life. At first glance Freddie Prinze Jr. may seem like the wrong choice but he fills Fred's shoes amazingly well with adequate skill. Linda Cardellini portrays the brainy smart Velma we all know but Linda plays her with a sensitive side which is new and a a nice choice. Sharah Michelle Gellar is the shining light here bringing warmth and believability to her character as Daphne everyones favorite danger prone female who proves she is tougher than most think in one of the film's best scenes. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy well and plays off of ScoobyDoo well even though there was nothing there during filming. Lillard's acting is a key success to the film. It doesn't matter how well the CGI Scooby is made Lillard really has to bring it to life by make believing that Scooby is actually there. The whole thing could have gone completely wrong but luckily this escapes that. Now the question that most people are asking. How does ScoobyDoo stack up? Neil Fanning's has to be the best since the original and the CGI Scooby looks pretty convincing. The action is a big part of this film as it plays a huge part. There are plenty of action scenes to keep you interested. My favorite one probably has to be the castle scene a ten minute romp where the gang uncovers clues and it all ends in a big bang but there are many more to more than fulfill your attention. The screenplay keeps thing's nice and simple and so is the direction. Constant and flashy cuts would've gotten in the way here so the direction they took works the best. The film all ends with more action scenes big bangs and many great twists. This could've been a lot worse.The Bad News The could've taken out the crude humor but that's my only complaintConclusion See this at any cost if you are a hardcore ScoobyDoo fan and others will all so want to check this out. RecommendRated PG".

Matthew Lillard is brilliant as Shaggy how is that possible?  His impersonation skills were flawless!.  The cartoonimation of Scooby and Scrappy Doo were interesting but were so 3D rendered that they did not match the original 2D versions very well.  The plot was reasonably interesting and twisted.  No mere disgruntled janitor in a spooky disguise there's some evil genius at work. There were some minor plot issues with Velma Fred and Daphne having much greater insecurity issues than in the cartoons but experimenting with such ideas is very cartoonlike.  The set and cast worked very well.  There's some biological humor with Shaggy and Scooby that I did not expect but the last bit that they did helped.  If you're prudish about gaspassing and belching there are about 4 minutes you can do without but they seem very much in character.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to watch them SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and I could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult I still find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a visually ridiculous movie with probably like most of the other TV series adaptations a boring and incoherent script.When I left the theater I was in love with this movie. It's a Scooby fan's dream come true.The film's never ridiculous a colourfull and coherent universe was built around the visual of the cartoon. It's a very rare thing but this time an exact transposition of a cartoon is perfect and doesn't breed an example in visual bad taste.The script intelligently breaks several rules of the cartoon in order to bring more deepness to the characters. For example Daphne's tired to be the eternal stupid beauty in danger and Velma can't stand Fred's attitude anymore as he always acts as if he had solved the mysteries alone. But these efforts would have been vain if a dream team of actors hadn't been gathered around the hilarious Scooby. Even if the team's composed of five characters they're all treated with the same importance and that's rare enough to be underscored.Matthew LILLARD IS Shaggy he reproduces perfectly the attitude of the animated character and his capacity to make you believe in the virtual Scooby is very impressive when he's with him you feel like if the dog was really on the set. The duo's perfect.Sarah Michelle GELLAR and Freddie PRINZE Jr have a very communicative energy. It's obvious that they had a very good time playing the two beautiful and quite stupid characters of the team. Even if the role of Daphne was written with Buffy references Sarah Michelle GELLAR succeeds in preserving the essence of the character I never thought about Buffy when I saw her as Daphne.And the last but not the least Linda CARDELLINI delivers an outstanding performance as Velma. She took the animated character and managed to make her more human funnier and even touching by bringing all sorts of irresistible details and mimics as for example in the way she laughs or says that she's the most clever of the team. Great job for a great actress.I hope that no sequel will ever reach the screen if any of them is missing from the cast.The story's quite simple but very well paced and entertaining. There are lots of cool dialogues and private jokes for the series' fans. All the gags are in the tone of the cartoon and always effective. I wasn't in favor of the use of martial arts through the character of Daphne but finally kung fu fits in the universe of SCOOBY DOO as it's used with parsimony to bring a few more good gags.As a conclusion I would say that SCOOBY DOO's a terrific movie it's fun fast and very well acted.I found in it everything that made me love the cartoon and even more. Don't miss it if you're a SCOOBY fan you won't regret it!".

	schema:headline " Scooby's a hit on the bigscreen";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother me during the movie but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the cartoon. The movie is pure cheese but so was the cartoon. ScoobyDoo has maybe the most effective farting scene since Blazing Saddles. Most fart scenes just come off as gross and not very funny but in the world of Scooby a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more chances at dialogueheavy roles here in the States.  Fred Daphne Velma and Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carboncopy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the show.".

My friends say I am a fanatic and I keep enough Scooby paraphenalia around my desk that people say it's closer to a shrine.The reason why it's important to remember all of this is because I write this review more than a little biased.  However I can say in all honesty that I LOVED the movie.  I thought everyone involved did a pretty good job at keeping it true to its roots and that's what I liked the most. Personally I think that producing a ScoobyDoo movie puts someone at odds between making a movie that mimics a Scooby cartoon or making a movie that will appeal to a wide audience.  The two are just not the same.If you look at what most people feel is 'classic' ScoobyDoo you get cartoons are that corny lowproduction and have a very thin plot.  They are for the most part mindless romps into a world of men in masks and teenagers with their talking dog gallivanting across the world solving the same old mysteries.  The locales and names may change but it's pretty much the same old story.  What we love about them and why a 28 year old man still stops flipping channels when I find Scooby is that simply put we love that dog and his fellow cohorts.  We like watching Scoob and Shag munch down an entire pizza in two seconds or seeing Scooby steal the soda from the rest of the gang.  And most importantly we love Scooby for all the corniness lame jokes and disguises.  This is a dog everyone would love to own just don't put your sandwich down in front of him.That really doesn't translate to a Hollywood blockbuster.  My most important consideration for the ScoobyDoo movie was whether or not they would keep that good clean wholesome image and in all honesty they do.  There are a few adult jokes but this is a family movie and if you put too much into adult themes complex story lines and character development you would definitely disappoint the real Scooby fans who will continue to watch the movies and cartoons long after this movie has had its run.If I take out my bias of Scooby I must admit that I don't think this movie would stand on its own.  It's a fun eightyseven minute flick but it's kind of shallow and there are too many inside jokes to truly enjoy it.  The bottom line is if you like classic ScoobyDoo you'll probably love the film however if you didn't like the ScoobyDoo cartoon you won't like the movie.  It still gets a 10 in my book but it's a 10 based on my interpretation of Scooby without him it's only about a 5.".

	schema:headline " What were they thinking??";
	schema:reviewBody "Hanna and Barbera are probably rolling in their graves. First of all let me say that I'm a 25 year old guy with bad taste who's been a fan of Scooby Doo since I was born. I've anxiously been awaiting this film since Mike Myers began working on scripts for it years back. I wanna know what the hell happened to his scripts. Although I can't see him as Shaggy Matt Lillard was perfect in the role perhaps if they had stuck to Myers' script the film would have been good instead of the PoS it turned out to be. I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it but after some of the stuff I had heard I wanted to preview it before taking them I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway  boy was I wrong!. Turns out it was no worse than the kids' endless viewings of Dumb and Dumber on TBS so I had to sit through this piece of crap twice....what a waste of 3 hours of my life.First of all the good things about the film. Matthew Lillard was phenomenal as Shaggy  the movie's only saving grace. The woman who played Velma was also wellcast though she didn't quite command the same presence Lillard has. Rowan Atkins also gives a good but small performance as the owner of the amusement park. The special FX ranged from excellent to abysmally computerized though Scooby was better animated than I initially expected. And the scene in the castle was beautifully filmed with a rollercoaster ride of good effects and one of the only jokes I found amusing  about drinking out of the toilet. The only other joke that I found great amusement in which flies over the heads of children is a reference early on to Shaggy being the stoner that everyone's always assumed he is. That's about it for the good qualities so on to the bad which I could write a book about.I could say that Gellar and Prinze were miscast but after two viewings I don't think that was the problem. The problem was that they were both badly writtendirected. Prinze's Freddy went from being the selfassured leader he was in the show to an egomaniacal buffoon. Gellar's Daphne became far whinier and selfinvolved than the character ever was with the exception of A Pup Named SD which made her far less sympathetic than she should have been. The addition of Scrappy to the cast was a forced and unfunny copout. The fact that he's probably the most hated cartoon character of alltime didn't justify using him the way they did and I'm among his haters.The script is awful. Bad jokes sporadically thrown throughout the film which were vulgar and tasteless made me consider walking out the first time I saw it  and I've never considered walking out on any film I've seen no matter how bad it was. The fartingbelchingpeeing scenes were what both audiences laughed most at though for the life of me I can't understand why. For them to go to such juvenile lengths to draw laughs it should prove how bad the script was. And it's a sad commentary on America's sense of humor...the majority of people in both audiences appeared to be around my age.And then there was the profanity. Daphne utters a line about opening a can of whoopass. Freddy says something about a byotch. And the villain says he would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling sons of... at which point he's cut off. I use profanity every day of my life so I wasn't offended but it had no place in this film and the kids left reciting Daphne's line.The music is atrocious.

And it's sad that such a talented cast was wasted. It's sad that as a hardcore SD fan I'd give this a two out of ten score solely based on Shaggy and Velma's performances otherwise it would be none out of ten.

	onyx:emotionText "Hanna and Barbera are probably rolling in their graves. First of all let me say that I'm a 25 year old guy with bad taste who's been a fan of Scooby Doo since I was born. I've anxiously been awaiting this film since Mike Myers began working on scripts for it years back. I wanna know what the hell happened to his scripts. Although I can't see him as Shaggy Matt Lillard was perfect in the role perhaps if they had stuck to Myers' script the film would have been good instead of the PoS it turned out to be. I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it but after some of the stuff I had heard I wanted to preview it before taking them I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway  boy was I wrong!. Turns out it was no worse than the kids' endless viewings of Dumb and Dumber on TBS so I had to sit through this piece of crap twice....what a waste of 3 hours of my life.First of all the good things about the film. Matthew Lillard was phenomenal as Shaggy  the movie's only saving grace. The woman who played Velma was also wellcast though she didn't quite command the same presence Lillard has. Rowan Atkins also gives a good but small performance as the owner of the amusement park. The special FX ranged from excellent to abysmally computerized though Scooby was better animated than I initially expected. And the scene in the castle was beautifully filmed with a rollercoaster ride of good effects and one of the only jokes I found amusing  about drinking out of the toilet. The only other joke that I found great amusement in which flies over the heads of children is a reference early on to Shaggy being the stoner that everyone's always assumed he is. That's about it for the good qualities so on to the bad which I could write a book about.I could say that Gellar and Prinze were miscast but after two viewings I don't think that was the problem. The problem was that they were both badly writtendirected. Prinze's Freddy went from being the selfassured leader he was in the show to an egomaniacal buffoon. Gellar's Daphne became far whinier and selfinvolved than the character ever was with the exception of A Pup Named SD which made her far less sympathetic than she should have been. The addition of Scrappy to the cast was a forced and unfunny copout. The fact that he's probably the most hated cartoon character of alltime didn't justify using him the way they did and I'm among his haters.The script is awful. Bad jokes sporadically thrown throughout the film which were vulgar and tasteless made me consider walking out the first time I saw it  and I've never considered walking out on any film I've seen no matter how bad it was. The fartingbelchingpeeing scenes were what both audiences laughed most at though for the life of me I can't understand why. For them to go to such juvenile lengths to draw laughs it should prove how bad the script was. And it's a sad commentary on America's sense of humor...the majority of people in both audiences appeared to be around my age.And then there was the profanity. Daphne utters a line about opening a can of whoopass. Freddy says something about a byotch. And the villain says he would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling sons of... at which point he's cut off. I use profanity every day of my life so I wasn't offended but it had no place in this film and the kids left reciting Daphne's line.The music is atrocious. With the exception of the David Newman score and around three songs Simple Plan's Grow Up Allstars' Bump in the Night and MXPX's SD Where Are You? cover plus a clever cameo by Sugar Ray who are far underused the majority of the songs are insufferable rap songs. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against rap when you can understand what they're saying. But the rap songs here are garbled garbage.

I loved Sarah Michelle Gellar's sassy and blackbelted Daphne and Freddy Prinze Jr. did very well as Fred. Seriously here folks this movie seems to have a really bad prereputation. It could not have been better.  Yes they may have four wellknown actors but after seeing the movie it was not soley to rake in the cash from their reputations.  They are all extremely GOOD the cast could not have been better.  I have found that there are the different depths of humor the obvious cartoonish humor that always gets the kids but there is also a lot of humor in the dialogue that will get the teenagers and older. I would reccommend anyone give this movie a chance!  Especially if you loved the cartoon!".

I'm not too familiar with the old series but I know for sure that there were NEVER ghosts or hauntings or anything of the sort.  However Scooby Doo the movie breaks into more foolish ground by changing all that flinging the series into a sort of stupid science fiction fantasy movie.  We have large gremlinlooking creatures that want to take over the world and they aren't masks and PROTOPLASMS which supposedly make up the soul of a human being.WRONG!  A protoplasm is the essential living thing inside a CELL.  Not a person.  Somebody didn't do enough research!  It was almost as if they used the word protoplasm just to sound cool.  Why when a little bit of skimming through a dictionary will prove that you're a total idiot who hasn't done any research?Scooby Doo is a movie filled with assumptions crummy jokes and a really perverted Fred who wasn't like that at all in the series.  The mystery is so lame that no clues were needed to solve it.  It was just WHAM! and the bad guy came out of hiding.One part I did like though was when the whole group entered the haunted castle.  It was rather thrilling for a moment while the axes were swinging the roller coaster was blasting forward and Shaggy and Scooby were stuck on a wall.  The music was really good too I think.  But that's about the only good thing about the entire movie.Scooby Doo was one of the worst CGI characters I have ever seen.  They might have done better with a real dog and not some plasticlooking CGI dog that could walk like a human.  I understand the original Scooby could but that was the original and it was a cartoon.  This is much different with live action.And the villain was so poorly introduced.  Even Count Dooku from Star Wars Attack of the Clones had a longer run time!  Scrappy was only seen for a few moments and only from a story told by one of the characters.  And then he showed up in the end... how stupid!  I'm sorry but this movie was lacking in depth from every single angle.One other good thing about it though is the friendship between Shaggy and Scooby.  Those actors were PERFECT for the roles.  Shaggy sounds just like the original.  I'm impressed.  The antics of Shaggy and Scooby help to lighten the movie and for a while I thought it would bring the movie back up.  But I was wrong.  It lost concentration less than halfway through.Attempts to modernize the movie were poor.  Acting was insufficient other than Shaggy and Scooby.  Story and plot were crumbling to pieces at the beginning.  The music was decent in some parts when no rock bands were trying to keep the teenager atmosphere with crummy lyrics and silly music.All in all Scooby Doo was a total flop.  I'm not sure what happened.  But I know that even I could have done better.  Just by staying true to the cartoon could that have been accomplished.".

They should've stuck to the tried  tested old Fred Bloogs the Lodger in the Shed scaring visitors away rather than indulging in face  soul swapping  brainwashing.The pleasure of Scooby Doo is the element of mystery  the whodunnit. There was no real mystery in here at all  nothing to keep the viewer guessing.The farting  burping scene seemed merely to appease the 3 year olds in the audience the characterisations seemed a little too different to the originals  I wasn't convinced by 'Scrappy as Villain' but there was enough in the film to still make it a fairly good effort all round.A low 510".

There was no real mystery in here at all  nothing to keep the viewer guessing.The farting  burping scene seemed merely to appease the 3 year olds in the audience the characterisations seemed a little too different to the originals  I wasn't convinced by 'Scrappy as Villain' but there was enough in the film to still make it a fairly good effort all round.A low 510";

	schema:reviewBody "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a truly magnificent piece of filmmaking and remains one of the most fascinating and wonderful adventure films ever made. One of the things that makes this film so intriguing is that it could have been made at any time. I mean just from watching it you can't really tell when it was made. It has been one of my favorite films for almost 20 years now and it wasn't until today that I actually realized when it was made. Watching it again last night I had convinced myself that it was made sometime in the early to mid 80s and I was shocked to find out that this year is the movie's 30 year anniversary. Until now pretty much the only movie I associate with 1971 is A Clockwork Orange and it's just strange for some reason to find out that this classic movie was made so long ago.At any rate Willy Wonka is a tremendously imaginative and inspiring film. It's a family film but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence family' film. On the other hand this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience like Cats  Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets who were at this candy factory and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory. One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and even more the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films hey some of them are really good. There are of course some exceptions such as Cheer up Charlie' which I have been fastforwarding through for as long as I can remember but for the most part the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candymaking genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life Anything you want to do it. Want to change the world there's nothing to it' but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat curiously named Wonkatania' which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later. The dialogue in the film contains some of the most interesting little tidbits in the entire movie. Wonka's lines in particular are wonderfully strange and amusing A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men.'. He is a truly eccentric and fascinating man and Gene Wilder captures the character flawlessly as he delivers the lines from the brilliantly written script. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare movies that comes along and completely changes the way that fantasy films are made. It's all about having fun in life and being hopeful against all odds and most of all being able to have fun in life. There are times when you have to let things go for a while and just act like a kid. Eat candy run around and play steal fizzy lifting drinks and bump into the ceiling that now has to be washed and sterilized it doesn't matter as long as no one's looking. That's such a trivial little quirk of Wonka's who sterilizes their ceiling? that it becomes obvious that the movie is trying to say that it's okay to break the rules every once in a while. Have fun in life. Besides being absolutely mouthwatering to this day I still fantasize about sinking my teeth into one of those gigantic gummy bears the movie is an uplifting adventure that warms the heart and sends people of all ages away with fairy tale candies dancing in their heads and wonderful songs just behind their lips. It is an alwayswelcome vacation from reality for people of all ages and it should always be remembered and loved for that. This movie will ALWAYS be a mustsee.".

It's all about having fun in life and being hopeful against all odds and most of all being able to have fun in life. There are times when you have to let things go for a while and just act like a kid. Eat candy run around and play steal fizzy lifting drinks and bump into the ceiling that now has to be washed and sterilized it doesn't matter as long as no one's looking. That's such a trivial little quirk of Wonka's who sterilizes their ceiling? that it becomes obvious that the movie is trying to say that it's okay to break the rules every once in a while. Have fun in life. Besides being absolutely mouthwatering to this day I still fantasize about sinking my teeth into one of those gigantic gummy bears the movie is an uplifting adventure that warms the heart and sends people of all ages away with fairy tale candies dancing in their heads and wonderful songs just behind their lips. It is an alwayswelcome vacation from reality for people of all ages and it should always be remembered and loved for that. This movie will ALWAYS be a mustsee.";

Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her.The first part of the story was a good satire on how people sometimes make trivial things so important and how the news media gets carried way with stupid issues. Wow look at it now! The second half of the story is intriguing because of the costar of the film Willy Wonka  a nononsense candy maker who doesn't put up with the brats  was fascinating to watch. The critics thought he was too nasty. Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy. Yes he has a bit of a mean streak to him but his comments are fun to hear and on the money despite his lack of verbal tact. Most people prefer Wilder's version of Wonka by the way over the bizarrebut talented Johnny Depp's.This was an entertaining film that should keep your interest. It's also an interesting comparison to the 2005 movie. Frankly I enjoyed both.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory' has withstood the test of time. And though quite dated it is still a widely enjoyed film with good reason!. This movie had a magnificent performance by Gene Wilder as Wonka a wonderful story and great art direction for its day as they brought all of the awesome things at the Wonka factory to life how cool it would be if you could actually go to a place like that to being a superb musical.The story is that of a famed chocolate manufacturer Willy Wonka who's factory is a magical secret that was shut down when competing candy companies kept trying to infiltrate the factory with their spies who wanted hold of the ingredients that made Wonka's candy the most novel and ultimately the most novel. Of course Wonka has a change of heart and decides to hold a contest whereby the people who can find one of the five golden tickets randomly maybe all of the winners were conveniently children four of which had horrible manners in Wonka candy. It could be anywhere. One by one it seems that the tickets are being found particularly by obnoxious kids who are all about the same age. Veruca Salt the most horrid and funniest of them all would later inspire a late 90s alternative band. The selfish British brat the slothy German boy the record gumchewer with the sleazy car salesman father and the boy who lives in front of the television. And there's only one ticket left. Meanwhile a pathetic depressed little boy named Charlie Bucket wants nothing more than to get hold of one of those tickets and witness the magic of the Wonka factory. Well cheer up Charlie because its about to happen.The trip in Wonka is more than just an invitation for unrivaled fun however. It is a test. One of Wonka's rivals known as Slugworth has promised a valuable sum to each of the children who steal from Wonka one of his newest inventions  an Everlasting Gobstopper so that his company might steal the ingredients. Will all remain loyal to Slugworth? This is one of Gene Wilder's best performances perfectly making the Wonka character his own. This was also the movie that introduced to the world the cautionary cult favorite midgets known as the Oompa Loompas slaves who were rescued by Wonka to...well serve as his slaves. And serving as a brief psychedelic inject into the events in the factory make the lessons learned more obvious than they could have already been. Charlie Bucket's character however could not be written to be more pathetic as though the filmmakers were absolutely sure that this was the kid you had the most sympathy for. From the mother working in the laundry handwashing clothes to the bare one room house and the enormous bed shared by all of the grandparents with counterpart names to Charlie's constantly furrowed brow and curled lip. But aside from this minor flaw the movie has so many memorable things about it. I particularly like the Dr. Suessesque setting. I can see why Tim Burton might be asked to be the next to recreate the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as the original looked like his style to begin with like the foamy float machine or the bizarre sequence where Wonka appears to go momentarily mad. Nonetheless may the legacy of the first live on for years to come. It is still one of the greatest family films ever made.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory' has withstood the test of time. And though quite dated it is still a widely enjoyed film with good reason!. This movie had a magnificent performance by Gene Wilder as Wonka a wonderful story and great art direction for its day as they brought all of the awesome things at the Wonka factory to life how cool it would be if you could actually go to a place like that to being a superb musical.The story is that of a famed chocolate manufacturer Willy Wonka who's factory is a magical secret that was shut down when competing candy companies kept trying to infiltrate the factory with their spies who wanted hold of the ingredients that made Wonka's candy the most novel and ultimately the most novel. Of course Wonka has a change of heart and decides to hold a contest whereby the people who can find one of the five golden tickets randomly maybe all of the winners were conveniently children four of which had horrible manners in Wonka candy. It could be anywhere. One by one it seems that the tickets are being found particularly by obnoxious kids who are all about the same age. Veruca Salt the most horrid and funniest of them all would later inspire a late 90s alternative band. The selfish British brat the slothy German boy the record gumchewer with the sleazy car salesman father and the boy who lives in front of the television. And there's only one ticket left. Meanwhile a pathetic depressed little boy named Charlie Bucket wants nothing more than to get hold of one of those tickets and witness the magic of the Wonka factory. Well cheer up Charlie because its about to happen.The trip in Wonka is more than just an invitation for unrivaled fun however. It is a test. One of Wonka's rivals known as Slugworth has promised a valuable sum to each of the children who steal from Wonka one of his newest inventions  an Everlasting Gobstopper so that his company might steal the ingredients. Will all remain loyal to Slugworth? This is one of Gene Wilder's best performances perfectly making the Wonka character his own. This was also the movie that introduced to the world the cautionary cult favorite midgets known as the Oompa Loompas slaves who were rescued by Wonka to...well serve as his slaves. And serving as a brief psychedelic inject into the events in the factory make the lessons learned more obvious than they could have already been. Charlie Bucket's character however could not be written to be more pathetic as though the filmmakers were absolutely sure that this was the kid you had the most sympathy for. From the mother working in the laundry handwashing clothes to the bare one room house and the enormous bed shared by all of the grandparents with counterpart names to Charlie's constantly furrowed brow and curled lip. But aside from this minor flaw the movie has so many memorable things about it. I particularly like the Dr. Suessesque setting.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's pretty safe to say that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless classic. Not only does it feature a great plot fantastic acting and show how movies don't have to be full of computer animation to be good but it also features some of the best music I have ever heard in a movie.I still remember almost as clearly as if it were yesterday the remarkable thing the movie did to me the first time I watched it It completely changed my mind about musicals! I was about 10 years old when I first sat down and watched the movie. Like a lot of kids I didn't much care for musical numbers in movies. So when the music for Pure Imagination started playing I thought Oh great a musical number! I was just about to press the fastforward button when Willy Wonka Gene Wilder began singing.Within about two seconds I was completely mesmerized! I didn't think I had ever heard such a beautiful song in my life nor had I heard too many singing voices that were as beautiful as Willy's. It felt like he was singing that song as much to me as he was to the kids and parents in the movie! That song certainly captured MY imagination and after hearing it for the first time I saw musicals in a whole new light.I may be grown now but I still like the movie every bit as much as I did as a tenyearold....and I will always have a special spot in my heart for Pure Imagination the song that convinced me that musicals can be some of the best movies out there!".

	schema:reviewBody "With the brandnew version of Tim Burton coming up I thought it would be appropriate to watch the very first filmadaptation of Roald Dahl's popular childrennovella first. Over 30 years old already but this charming and moralistic fairytale still is a joy for all senses with its likable main characters exhilarating songs and valuable lifelessons. The movie might start out a little slow and overly dramatic with the extended portrait of the poor Charlie Bucket who has to work in order to support his family and he can only secretly dream about winning a grand tour in the wonderful chocolate factory owned by the mysterious Willy Wonka. But when the miracle than occurs and Charlie walks into the factory together with four greedy kids the movie REALLY takes off! The children and their adult companions are guided through the colorful landscapes and ingenious techniques of Wonkaworld where chocolate flows in rivers and candy bars can be taken out of TVscreens. This is a very fun movie and Dahl's rich but bizarre imagination is wonderfully put to the screen by Mel Stuart. The set pieces are magnificent and they really have the true magical feel of fantasy. Typical for Roald Dahl's work also is the slightly sinister and horrific touch which is perfectly illustrated here in the unsettling boatridethroughthecavern sequence. This particular scene is perhaps the most memorable one of the entire movie because of it's great use of sound and lighting! New surprises and eccentric plottwists are provided every couple of seconds and Gene Wilder's jolly but tempered performance as the extravagant factoryowner really makes this movie complete. I can only hope the 2005 version will be as fabulous as this but I'm quite sure it will be. After all if there's one team able to retell this insanely great tale it has got to be Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is like a big bar of chocolate delicious...and you're never too old to enjoy it!".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people put this film in the back of their minds and label it as a kid's movie. First of all it's very entertaining for all ages and it has some parts which are really scary for kids like when Wonka takes his guests through a tunnel full of nightmarish images such as a chicken getting its head cut off which was actually edited out for television.Wonka is fascinating funny and often terrifying. The look in his eyes is demented and when he screams all hell seems to spew forth. Wonka doesn't care about what happens to the kids that get knocked off. He didn't give any warning to that boy not to drink out of the chocolate lake but starts yelling and running at him once he starts slurping it. In all the excitement the boy is pushed into the lake and gets sucked up a tube while the mother cries he'll be grounded into marshmallow. Wonka's response is That pipe doesn't lead to the marshmallow room. It leads to the fudge room. After the girl turns into a blueberry he casually says we'll have to squeeze the juice out of her before she explodes. Meanwhile the father is standing right beside him looking on horrified. When one of the brats does something they're not supposed to do Wonka gives less of a warning each time. The last time is nothing more than a softly spoken No wait. Come back. After the kids meet their fate we never see them again which is the equivalent of what? Death. At the end Wonka says they'll all be returned back to their normal rotten selves but I don't trust that smirk. Besides how are we to believe him if we don't see the kids ever again? He's a child killer who uses candy as bait. Sure the kids deserved it but the idea is still twisted.Take a slasher movie like Halloween for example where all the main characters are killed except for one who is innocent compared with the rest. Here it's kids instead of young adults and they all get disposed in some way or another until only Charlie is left to confront the demon Willy Wonka. What I'm saying is that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a horror movie in disguise as a children's movie. Ingenious!".

	schema:reviewBody "Willy Wonka is not a nice man. Yet somehow you can't help but like him at least as he's played by Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory the semipsychedelic and psychotronic 1971 version of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel. Wonka is aloof sardonic sarcastic mysterious manipulative and deviousa leprechaun with a hyperactive thyroid and an edge. But as Wilder plays him you sense the sweetness behind the wild gleam in his eyes he's really hoping that one of the five children he's invited to tour his chocolate factory will be a worthy heir to the world of his imagination.Yes Wonka is a cynic and a misanthrope. What else could he be after sequestering himself in his own little world for years on end? But he wants to believe that there is still some good to be found in a weary world. Wilder captures Dahl's creation perfectly.The rest of the cast is perfect too and they make the most of Dahl's often witty script. Peter Ostrom in particular is excellent as Charlie.Yet this minor classic of a movie has its flaws. The production design suffers from a lack of budget. Wonka's Chocolate Room looks like an elaborate minigolf course with a dirty river running through it in a brick warehouse. The Inventing Room is meant to be a whimsical magical laboratory but comes off more like an especially elaborate hideout for the Joker on the old Batman TV series. The songs range from reasonably good Veruca Salt's ode to brattiness I Want the Whole World to saccharine The Candy Man to downright wretched the OompaLoompa oeuvre entire with lousy choreography to match. Wilder's rendition of Pure Imgaination an overly sugary confection that could induce diabetic comas in the wrong hands works thanks to the faraway look in his eyes he makes it magical. The make up and costumes of the OompaLoompas Wonka's workers on the other hand are simply embarrassing.Yet despite these flaws Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is hugely entertaining and probably the best family film of the 1970s. Think of it this way Willy Wonka is to Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as the Batman TV series from the 1960s is to Burton's Batman. Both are different entirely valid takes on the same source material. Both are worth watching.".

Besides I wasn't too keen on him after reading his interviews. But with all that set aside from the very first reel he stands out from the rest because of the way he sees his scenes. They are refreshingly different and unique. The man is an allrounder. Hello? Director Writer Editor Dialogues Background Score Promo direction... what can't this guy do? And I'm sure I'm still missing something! Technologically its a film far superior than any other in Bollywood. The scene changes are spectacular... the colors are saturated in certain sequences to gain more visual appeal and the visuals used to express emotions are outstanding. Moreover he's taken all cinematic liberties and they're all used so effectively!If you saw KHNH and KANK and thought that was all there is to New York. Wrong! Sudeep Chatterjee shows New York in a different light altogether. More scenes are done in the eveningnight here rather than the broad daylight. Sabu Cyrill goes a step further and creates sets that further enhance the entire JaanEMann experience. Great job to both!Farah Khan's choreography shows us exactly where her heart is.... with Shirish Kunder. Her choreography flows SO well with the storyline and the screenplay. Its as if the body is meeting the soul because the songs are just an extension of the scene that precedes. No popcorn break here folks. Dialogues are placed within the songs and this is where teamwork really shines. Anu Malik Gulzar Farah Shirish and the star cast have really worked together to make the music of this film shine. While Gulzar has penned perfect lyrics yes! 'mom' 'dad' 'future' 'ignore' all make sense now! Anu Malik has given the music a majestic feel and Shirish and Farah have worked well together to place the songs in the right moments and give the most suited choreography possible. The actors just flow with the direction and make the dream of Shirish and Farah come alive on the big screen. Don't believe me? See for yourself and be the judge. While talking about the songs I must say that each and every one was presented in a completely different manner and held its own. One has to see the songs on the big screen to understand the importance of the lyrics and the way the song is pictured. The performances Piya Goel. Beautiful Smart Ambitious is she ... yet suffers from a lingering heartache. Though there isn't much scope for her as an actress Preity Zinta has still given it her all. She's cute as the popular college girl who cuts school to hang out with her bf who is most probably a dropout. In NY she's sophisticated cultured and a sweet . Fill in the blank when you watch the film! ... and she really shines in the climax!Agastya Rao aka Champu. A dreamer in his own right. THEN a geek with no clue on how to woo a girl. NOW sophisticated intelligent a great catch .. but still no clue on how to woo a girl. Akshay Kumar attempts a role he's never done before and churns out such an endearing character that you just can't let go of him. His full confidence and dependence in Suhaan shows through especially towards the end where he becomes almost desperate and the scene in front of the mirror is outstanding. Even when you leave the theater .. his Huhh Huhh Huhh laugh lingers in your head. Suhaan Kapoor. Selfish over confident arrogant and pompous are just a few words that describe Suhaan. THEN a drop out student who only dreams big... NOW he still dreams big... the only problem is not much has changed from then and now. In fact he's worse off now than before. The man can cry when affected because his heart deeply cares for those he loves. He blames the world at first and later only himself. This role is CUSTOM MADE for Salman Khan. Salman plays Suhaan to perfection. He takes digs at his own real life that no actor in his position would ever take. It really shows how comfortable he is in his own skin. The various characters that he takes on throughout the film are hilarious and really add to the flamboyance of entire canvas. In the second half of the film you see a more sensitive Salman. The subtleness he keeps throughout really shows that he's in control of his character. His emotional scenes are outstanding. When he cries you cry along with him because you understand the reasons for his mistakes. One of the highlights of this film is the chemistry between Salman and Akshay. They share such an AMAZING chemistry that not many actors tend to share. This film is miles ahead of Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in many ways. If you thought they gelled well in MSK you'll be happy to know that the chemistry they share here is much much more. I hope they continue making films. Love the two together.This is a movie that one should enjoy for its craziness flamboyance and visual style. Thie is one to be truly enjoyed on the big screen itself for all its grandness. It is an out and out Broadway show with plenty of glitz glamor musical numbers and talented performers. Ladies and Gentlemen .. after seeing this film .. I say .. ENCORE!! Yes I'll be seeing this one again in the theater the next weekend.".

The man can cry when affected because his heart deeply cares for those he loves. He blames the world at first and later only himself. This role is CUSTOM MADE for Salman Khan. Salman plays Suhaan to perfection. He takes digs at his own real life that no actor in his position would ever take. It really shows how comfortable he is in his own skin. The various characters that he takes on throughout the film are hilarious and really add to the flamboyance of entire canvas. In the second half of the film you see a more sensitive Salman. The subtleness he keeps throughout really shows that he's in control of his character. His emotional scenes are outstanding. When he cries you cry along with him because you understand the reasons for his mistakes. One of the highlights of this film is the chemistry between Salman and Akshay. They share such an AMAZING chemistry that not many actors tend to share. This film is miles ahead of Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in many ways. If you thought they gelled well in MSK you'll be happy to know that the chemistry they share here is much much more. I hope they continue making films. Love the two together.This is a movie that one should enjoy for its craziness flamboyance and visual style. Thie is one to be truly enjoyed on the big screen itself for all its grandness. It is an out and out Broadway show with plenty of glitz glamor musical numbers and talented performers. Ladies and Gentlemen .. after seeing this film .. I say .. ENCORE!! Yes I'll be seeing this one again in the theater the next weekend.";

The music was fabulous and it follows in sequence according to the next picture..The Introduction was OK with Akshay and the blondie chatting introductingly about the next character Suhaan to be shown.I wouldn't say the movie was slowpaced from the beginning but rather would accept all the introductory aspect which shows you the theme of the film. The film went through all phases of emotions from hilarious to seriousness to sadness and pity and at the end joy...its amazing!The clause of it is just that the second part where the climax appeared was more peaked than the first part but otherwise the scenes were shown in succession linking to the next without breaking.The way the three of the stars portrayed their character was good although not so much was given to 'Preity' but she excelled in the few she did and she really looked beautiful. Lots of chemistry between the stars. It was great..Akshay was really good he amazed me with his character that depicts a good actor in every sense and his chemistry with Salman is just too bonding..Anupam didn't have much to his credit although he played his character well.Now Salman. He was the brilliance in this film. He was the one string that pulled the emotions in this film to the surface all with his diversity..Even before the climax as he was mentoring Agastya on how to woo Piya you begin to pity his helplessness that turned him into a conman. And then you want know how its going to end you want to know who gets the girl afterwards and everything Suhaan's been through irrespective of being Piya's ex.The climax is so moving and Salman really drove home the message that you cant help but have a tear in your eyes His character shows someone who is on the verge of losing what he most wanted but didn't know how to stop it. He was awesome!The song 'sau dard hein' was too much to handle with the emotion going on with it and Salman did great justice to it all the other songs were great too but this particular one superceeds the rest my opininon.Overall the movie is worth a watch again after the first watch..Those who feel its not worthy should watch it with unguarded heart and feel what i am talking about because it is a realistic story that can happen to anybody with feelingsErase the comic aspect of it and see through the real occurrences...".

You betcha not! In factthis movie makes the lovetriangle saga seem new!First the movie starts off with Akshay kumar narrating the story of our three characters SuhaanAhgastya and Piya.The movie starts of well and makes the viewer interested.We follow the character's lives from present time to flashbacks in college.The firsthalf itself has its share of comedy moments but also sad ones as we learn about Suhaan and Piya's relationship.Then we follow Suhaan and Agastya to New York as Suhaan coaches Agastya to woo Piya.The scenes are beautiful and cinematography is excellent.The songs are melodious and beautifully picturised.OK now for the bad points...i felt that Anupam Kher's character was wasted.he had almost no significance in a role that actually wasn't easy to enact.Alsothe second half of the film gets a bit draggy.Ironicallythe directorSirish Kunder is an editor for films..Performance wise Salman and Akshay are awesome.Both enact their parts with ease and great passion.Can't wait to see them on the big screen again.Both were amazingits really difficult to pick one. Preity Zinta is BEAUTIFUL.Every single time she comes on screenI was absorbed..she does justice to her role as Piya.One feels the director should have given her more scope..but she did well anyway.Overallkudos to the main three leads! They are the heart and soul of JaanEMann.This flick is enjoyable from beginning to end.I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to have a good time with laughter and tears.Granted not all is perfect with the film as i mentioned earlierbut with so many positive points holing it togetherwho cares.JaanEMann is the type of film whereby when you see it onceyou'd want to see it over and over again and it would be just asif more enjoyable than the last time.Soyeahgo watch JaanEMann and have a good time!".

I liked the incorporation of the classic Cyrano de Bergerac device having Salman feeding lines to Akshay to woo Preity even though he loved her himself and also the 'camera obscura' spying technique borrowed from the US film Addicted to Love. One minor criticism I have is the use of British actors in the bit parts with a line or two who are supposedly Americans in New York why was this done?

Salman's amazing getups Akshay's geeky gestures and the wonderful backdrop of New York City are some of the major highlights that enhance the viewer's moviegoing experience.. If you are a person who critizes every scene of a film this one might not please your tastes.. but if you're like me who appreciates and understands creativity.. this one's a must because Shrish Kunder leaves you with a memorable movie to cheer about.. a movie that sets itself apart from anything seen before!";

There are certain points though which amaze you. E.g the whole Sau Dard song sequence  I was very impressed with that. The baby is also cute. The story is a bit fairytaleish but I think it is courageous for Shirish Kunder to make a fairytale movie especially when right now realistic cinema is all the rage.An interesting effort.".

	schema:headline " Zinta is definitely a Jaanmann";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Sirish Kunder has made a commendable debut in Hindi cinema as a director. This editorturneddirector has made an impressive attempt to make Jaanmann what it is. Superb editing exotic locales and a heart warming love story. I had never imagined that special effects could be of such an imperative to a romantic love story. This movie delivers the best in technicality. Scene transitions are superb dream sequences going into and out of flashback has its own style and the film is full of jolly and merry instances. But all that does not make a movie great if it lacks its soul the screenplay. Sirish Kunder in his first screen writing attempt has clearly shown his incompetence and inexperience.Kunder though has filled the film with lots of oneliners pretty catchy dialouges and an amazing score technically the script has pitfalls. Lack of adequate character conflicts the trait of the film gone missing somewhere and and most importantly a novice screenwriter makes the movie lose its charm. Jaanmann could be a thoroughly entertaining if we set the screen writing rules aside but beyond that if you're planning to watch a movie by experienced professionals this one is definitely not your cup of tea.Lets look at various aspects one by oneSalman Khan  Good performance. Thank god he's given up laughing like hyena. We see veteran in this movie. A sad an miserable shade of his character makes home in public's heart.Preity Zinta  After KANK she's my ultimate favourite. This angelic beauty looks great throughout and she's still watchable as a college girl. And my God she does great Russian accent. Akshay Kumar  I like the way he laughs he..hee..heee. Akshay has come a long way into romantic comedy from action movies and he's good at it. He's in fact good in any character he gets into.Anupam Kher  This one actor knows the heights of performance although he plays a person without um.. much height.Anu Malik  The track Humko Maloom is great. Fabulous. But not all songs are ones we can say are really great. Worked late night and wrapped up in a haste?Gulzar  Is he trying to be different or did the producers ask him to do so? Why does he need to use so many English words in songs? I feel bad calling a veteran bad but he fails to live up to the expectations.Farah Khan  Great. At least this is the best she can give to her newlywed husband Sirish Kunder. She's put her heart and soul into it making choreography one of the strongest aspects of this movie.Sirish Kunder  Editing  superb! Space sequence  superb! Visual transitions  superb! Should definitely go ahead and make more movies. But before that I urge him to buy the book Screenwriting by Syd Field and read it once.Apart from this the production design is laudable. The baby who plays Preity Zinta's daughter is really sweet. Enormous curtains hanging down from the roof look exhilarating. New York as always is breathtaking. What's even good is the actors' chemistry and the way the entire movie has been set up.If you're finding it hard to choose between Don and Jaanmann my choice would definitely be Jaanmann. It's a value for money but not yet the film I can call the best film of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Jaanemann after Don and I must say I enjoyed it.But as I always say why drag it on for almost 3 hrs .... when a tight 2hrs 20 min would have been more than enough. The story is the eternal love triangle but done in a fresh and innovative way by the first time director Kunder. He uses a novel approach with innovative flashbacks and song sequences to tell the story. The first song with Salman was well picturised and was used as a means to tell the flashback without boring the viewer. Flashback scenes were nicely done and using perspectives of all the three main players. Also had a couple of nice twists one of them in the second half was especially good in providing a valid reason behind the changing relationship between salman and preity.The acting... for me the most likable was Akshay with his goofy laugh. Excellent acting and get up for the nerdy role. PLus excellent chemistry with Salman Khan. But Salman was also quite good and don't be fooled... this is a salman khan movie all the way. He changed gears nicely playing the college rocker then the nogood husbandakshays mentor and finally the reformed husband with elan. He even cried and looked sad through out the latter half without going over the top. Is it me or did Preity Zinta have nothing to do in this movie except look great in her western outfits and appear in all the songs.. i did not think so. In one of the songs they used a cardboard cutout of hers and i think it would have played her role in the rest of the movie as well.MInor spoiler  Why oh Why did Anupam Kher have to play a midget and why did he have to have a double role... one role could have been played by another actor and there was no need for a midget at all. It was a bit cheap plus it did not look even remotely convincing as Kamal Hassan's midget act in '' Appu Raja'' almost 15 yrs ago. PLus why do all the foreigners in the movie speak with an Aussie accent if they are supposedly in New York? Music was melodious.. good qawwali type number and the song 'Ajeeb' was pretty good. Song picturisation was the usual New York thing although the first song was done in the old Hollywood musical style with some beautiful and elaborate sets.Shirish Kunder wore many hats for this production as he was in charge of direction story dialogues and editing. Probably the one that did not stand up to the test was editing which by the way was how he made his living before this movie.... could have trimmed another 20 minutes from the movie easily by getting rid of most of the midget. Anyway he has done his best to make a different product and I'm sure he'll do better in other projects. He did go a bit overboard with the CGI in some scenes but kudos to him and best of luck for the future.This movie is definitely worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Granted the story is old and inspired some scenes and plot lines are lifts some dialogs are lifted the 6 smiles one from Win a Date with Tad Hamilton for example but really that isn't what Jaanemann is about. This movie is all about the screenplay and editing and that's where it scores brilliantly.The screen is used like a stage with characters moving in and out especially during song sequences and this carries the story forward. Personally I feel the treatment is great. It works well and every frame is a visual treat.Salman and Akshay are not the best actors in the industry but have consistently proved themselves worthy of mention in comic roles.And these roles are mostly about timing. Preity Zinta is alright but then she usually is. I've never seen her do too bad and I've never seen her shine out either. Anupam Kher delivers as required. Javed Sheikh was a surprise and had a really short role with hardly much to say.The songs sound strange and incoherent when you hear just the audio soundtrack but fit in really well once you watch them in the film as they come. They truly are situational songs as i said before and they move the story along. A true break from directors trying to make the songs picturesque by shooting in Switzerland.Jaanemann is a good film definitely worth a watch and I'm surprised it flopped. Audience reactions can be a real surprise sometimes. I still recommend this for a good fun few hours.".

	schema:headline " Why did it fail?";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this one yesterday and after seeing this i had to think a long time about why the hell did it fail at the box office. I mean if I would have got a screenplay like this I would have definitely predicted it to be a Superhit material. About the story it is a typical love triangle as you think it is. It starts with Akshay as Agastya in space with his girl friend talking about friendship with Salmaan as Suhan and then it proceeds about the happening on their life. Salmaan is Preity's ex hubby who wants his wife to get married to any one else so that he do not have to give him a hefty divorce settlement allowance. In comes akki that is madly in love with the lady and spits of everything in front of Salmaan not knowing his real identity. What follows next is a hilarious ride of both the guys trying that preity comes to Akshay. In the meantime Salmaan starts feeling the old love all over again especially after he knows that he is a father too The end is all too predictable but with one beautiful twist.There are not many reasons for this movie to fail. Here this was a movie with dynamite performance by the main leads beautiful songs excellent cinematography and all too twists to keep you at the edge but still it failed. The first reason for it to fail is the long musical flashback sequence of Salmaan and Preity. It would have been plus only if the song might have been more catchy. You cant have a romantic song for 10 minutes and expect everyone to sit through it. Then there were those light effects. Very well picturised but they came in abundance. Sometime you start getting the feel that the cast is not good enough which the are to give the emotions and hence they are being amplified by these effects. The length of the movie is also a minus. The whole thing should have been finished off in 2 and a half tops. The viewers would not sit through all the pain for 3 hrs. This is one movie that could have been a wonder a movie that might have fulfilled Salmaan's dream of Filmfare for best actorit may still bring one for Akshay but its all this small mistakesloose ends that sunk the ship. We cant call this one too spicy or too sweet. It is all in there. Its just that its not at the right moment.".

The best thing about the movie is it is a very positive story told beautifully.Undoubtedly it is not a 'very' different story but of course the same story has been told differently and surprisingly in a very interesting manner. It is good romantic comedy as compared to the emotional drama as presented by its trailer and its very difficult to understand why Shirish tried to present it in that way through its trailer and promotions!. The worst thing with this movie is its really poor and insensible promotion.Movie also suffers with some technical imperfections like average cinematography and screenplay its not bad at all but could have been far more better with such a good cast technology and budget!. One of the worst scene of the movie which has also been used in promotion where Preity is dancing with Salman and Akshay alternatively and camera is taking rounds around them. The transition from Salman to Akshay and further is very inappropriate and does not looks beautiful at least now a days it could have been very smooth without cutting the scenes and presenting other actor in next shot!. The same scene being used in promotion as well created very bad impression it can and should still be improved. Even the whole promotion campaign should be revamped.However movie still is very good and has an amazing feel good effect with its climax as well! which makes it worth watch. Good work Shirish keep it up!!!".

With her now as a young French rural ingnue searching for years after The Great War aka World War I or even better The War to End All Wars for a probably killed fianc Jeunet crafted a moving often penetrating story centering on the charnel carnage of trench warfare.Lame as a singledigitage child because of polio and living with relatives who took over after her parents were killed in an accident Mathilde is befriended by Manech Gasparad Ulliel. Mathilde a loner separated from her peers by her disability and Manech become closest friends. Late adolescence brings love and lust commitment and an engagement.But in 1917 the French Army needed fresh meat for the bloody maw that was warfare on the almost terminally static Western Front. And off went Manech along with many others who never returned.Employing the harshest discipline of any Western army in modern history the French Army which gave the world the Dreyfus trial and in World War I actually used decimation to punish mutinous regiments and divisions sentences Manech and four others to be cast into No Man's Land without weapons without any possibility of being allowed to return but with the macabre requirement that they respond to morning roll call if alive not a good bet. Their alleged crime was selfmutilation to get out of combat what we call in the American military SIW SelfInflicted Wounds.Mathilde in 1920 steely faithful in a moving and believable way searches fervently for her fianc whom she believes must be alive somewhere somehow. Employing artful stratagems and enlisting the willing the paid and the dragooned her search takes her to cities and battlefields. With resort to a child's employment of magical thinking she frequently whispers tests about what will happen in immediate ordinary circumstances with one result proving for her that Manech is still alive. Tatou makes this selfdeception appealing and infinitely sad.As Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan Jeunet brings the immediacy of the meatgrinding battlefield to the viewer over and over again through superb if sometimes difficult to watch cinematography. Of course no film truly captures the desperation the epidemic fatality that gripped and demoralized the French Army after years of immobile setpiece fighting. One needs to read Robert Graves or Siegfried Sassoon for that. But Jeunet has brought to the screen the most realistic World War I trench scenes since All Quiet on the Western Front the 1930 original of course.Tatou is an acting tsunami here alternately beguiling and tense and always hopeful while fighting despair. Expect to see her in many fine roles in the future. She's marvelous.The entire cast is excellentfew are known in the U.S. A remarkable movie with an ending that will satisfy and disturb at the same time.Tatou and Jeunet deserve Oscar nominations.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is better than Amelie which I loved. The story is intricately plotted so people with a Seed of Chucky attention span will be overwhelmed. It must be the only movie to combine amazing combat scenes with romance comedy and a complex mystery puzzle. Audrey Tatou is a goddess. Jeunet the director is like a combination of Chaplin the romance and comedy Hitchcock the incredible camera work and storytelling and Spielberg the battle scenes and emotion. As to some of the comments I have seen on this site There were French people complaining that people were speaking too fast. Gee I don't speak French but I can read subtitles just fine so it was not a problem.Some people complained that it was too long. Then there were people that complained it was too short. Like Goldilocks I thought it was just right.There were those that said that Tatou can't act. Audrey's performance was nuanced people she's no Jim Carrey. Some said she was just playing Amelie again. Wrong. Amelie was a goodhearted but wishywashy spirit who was afraid to take any action in her own life. Mathilde is just the opposite somebody who believes so strongly in her convictions that she is able to follow what her heart tells her in spite of all available evidence and every single person she meets. In fact every actor no matter how small the role turns in a great performance I'm especially partial to the great Dominique Pinon who plays Audrey's uncle. There were complaints about the sex. There are a couple of brief shots of people having sex in the introduction very similar to Amelie. Plus you get to see Jodie Foster doing the nasty from several directions. If that bothers you go see Polar Express instead. Personally especially in light of the rumors of Jodie being a lesbian I am in favor of the sex scenes. There is also a shot of Audrey's fabulous naked booty which justifies the price of admission all by itself.Someone else complained that it was too jarring switching between the horrific WWI trench warfare scenes and the idyllic 1920s Paris. Argghhhh that's the point!Then there was the complaint about seeing a scene or shot from a different perspective later in the movie. Have you heard of a story called Rashomon? The idea is that you are experiencing the events from the viewpoint of different characters. This is cleverly done and never superfluous. At least one time you are quite startled by new information revealed by that shift in perspective.All in all this is a movie that really does have everything. If it were an American movie it would win best picture best actress best supporting actress Jodie still might get nominated best cinematography best script from a novel and best director. As it is scheduled for a Christmas national release hopefully a lot of people will see it.".

It is a wonderful piece of story telling  somewhat difficult to follow if you do have a short memory span for character names  and flashbacks. Yet at the end it seamlessly closes the web in a beautifully written script that has been well acted and filmed. It is particularly gory in the WWI battle scenes but probably accurate in depiction whilst the locations where the film was shot seem out of this world hoped they were not computer generated. Quaint towns fields beaches and houses lend a beautiful touch to the story of a love that will not die whilst Audrey Tautou delivers a spellbinding performance in a childlike heroine with a will of steel. A special mention must be given to Bruno Delbonnel's camera work which simply is amazing. Can't wait for the DVD.".

With so many characters and so many plot elements some people may feel a bit lost specially toward the end. But this is of lesser concern as the audience will still follow the main idea  a quest to find a loved one. So even through all the intricacies of the subplots the arc story and its finale always remain on the horizon.To put it short the movie is a masterpiece. The acting is strong the scenes are breathtaking and overall so much attention has been put to details that it feels like a labor of love more than a big production movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Lovely Audrey Tautou and director JeanPierre Jeunet reteam having previously made the delightful comedy Amelie in the epic war drama A Very Long Engagement based on the novel by Sebastien Japrisot. It is a visual powerhouse of a film that defies conventional genres by melding together different themes and injecting a generous dose of period authenticity. This French language film is an emotional odyssey that keeps you guessing while it never loses sight of its humanity and even humor.Childhood friends and then lovers Mathilde Tatout and Manech Gaspard Ulliel are separated when duty calls in World War One France. War is hell and the trench fighting that will claim countless lives begins to take its toll on men's sanity and tolerance. Manech becomes one of five soldiers arrested for cowardice because each has a self inflicted hand wound to evade the deadly fighting. But instead of execution by firing squad the condemned men are forced into no man's land to be fodder for the German line.It is almost certain that all the prisoners died that day but years later in 1920 Mathilde continues in her quest to find the truth and her lover. Aided by her aunt and uncle she enlists the help of an investigative agency and lawyer to track down the people who knew Manech. Slowly the list grows and one clue connects with another as more witnesses emerge. What starts out as a somber war romance develops into a fascinating adventure of love and mystery of fate as Mathilde follows the trail. Sure she does get frustrated as a couple of clues are dead ends but when a connection is established the story leaps forward. At times the help comes from an unexpected source and at other times sheer coincidence saves the day. There is even a subplot involving treachery and betrayal. Before long the audience will become caught up in her journey. Is Manech alive and will Mathilde ever find him? The film's structure weaves back and forth through flashbacks with great ease and clarity. An occasional voice over narration ties up the loose ends. As the plot begins to make more sense key scenes are retold from different viewpoints in the Rashomon style of storytelling. The battle scenes quite grim and realistic Saving Private Ryan type of action are light years ahead of Paths of Glory's anthill scenes although the opening march through the trenches is almost identical to Kubrick's 1957 classic. There is even a hint of the older favorite Random Harvest which also dealt with a wartime romance and search.A Very Long Engagement is blessed with a strong ensemble cast although it may require a score card to keep track of all the names. Andrey Tautou is quite good as the anxious searcher. Her beauty never detracts from her acting talent. Gaspard Ulliel reminds one of a young Ethan Hawke in his innocence amid difficult circumstances. As the wife of a key character Jodie Foster is effective as she corresponds with Mathilde. Yes Jodie does the French thing well but her appearance is a bit jarring. Dominique Pinon a favorite of Jeunet's Alien Resurrection Amelie lends good support as the uncle. Even the smaller roles are well rounded and memorable a testament to good casting strong writing and Jeunet's direction.This big budget film is lengthy but it does have the sweep of a big time novel. The production is outstanding in the authentic costumes and historic set designs of 1920. Jeunet employs cinematography and computer graphics effectively to recreate the era magnificently. He has always been a marvelous director of eye candy and the film is wonderful to look at. Angelo Badalamenti who has spent a lot of time scoring the moody thrillers for David Lynch is allowed to flourish here with a lushly romantic emotional soundtrack.Doubtless this is very likely the ultimate French tearjerker a kind of Gone with the Wind meets Cold Mountain type of film. It serves as a commentary on war a romantic fable a revenge tale and an intricate mystery. It is a film that defies pigeonholing and that's part of the fun. It also has well defined characters and nice touches of detail and exposition. In short it is one powerful movie to close out 2004.12 stars out of ".

Slowly the list grows and one clue connects with another as more witnesses emerge. What starts out as a somber war romance develops into a fascinating adventure of love and mystery of fate as Mathilde follows the trail. Sure she does get frustrated as a couple of clues are dead ends but when a connection is established the story leaps forward. At times the help comes from an unexpected source and at other times sheer coincidence saves the day. There is even a subplot involving treachery and betrayal. Before long the audience will become caught up in her journey. Is Manech alive and will Mathilde ever find him? The film's structure weaves back and forth through flashbacks with great ease and clarity. An occasional voice over narration ties up the loose ends. As the plot begins to make more sense key scenes are retold from different viewpoints in the Rashomon style of storytelling. The battle scenes quite grim and realistic Saving Private Ryan type of action are light years ahead of Paths of Glory's anthill scenes although the opening march through the trenches is almost identical to Kubrick's 1957 classic. There is even a hint of the older favorite Random Harvest which also dealt with a wartime romance and search.A Very Long Engagement is blessed with a strong ensemble cast although it may require a score card to keep track of all the names. Andrey Tautou is quite good as the anxious searcher. Her beauty never detracts from her acting talent. Gaspard Ulliel reminds one of a young Ethan Hawke in his innocence amid difficult circumstances. As the wife of a key character Jodie Foster is effective as she corresponds with Mathilde. Yes Jodie does the French thing well but her appearance is a bit jarring. Dominique Pinon a favorite of Jeunet's Alien Resurrection Amelie lends good support as the uncle. Even the smaller roles are well rounded and memorable a testament to good casting strong writing and Jeunet's direction.This big budget film is lengthy but it does have the sweep of a big time novel. The production is outstanding in the authentic costumes and historic set designs of 1920. Jeunet employs cinematography and computer graphics effectively to recreate the era magnificently. He has always been a marvelous director of eye candy and the film is wonderful to look at. Angelo Badalamenti who has spent a lot of time scoring the moody thrillers for David Lynch is allowed to flourish here with a lushly romantic emotional soundtrack.Doubtless this is very likely the ultimate French tearjerker a kind of Gone with the Wind meets Cold Mountain type of film. It serves as a commentary on war a romantic fable a revenge tale and an intricate mystery. It is a film that defies pigeonholing and that's part of the fun. It also has well defined characters and nice touches of detail and exposition. In short it is one powerful movie to close out 2004.12 stars out of ";

Instead I will blend entertainment with art whatever that may mean or with its artistic integrity  my usual method of evaluation for movies. I'm actually one of those people who found Amlie delightful on first viewing and more than a little irritating on second viewing two years later. And I must say that overall I preferred Un Long Dimanche de Fianailles.Right from the opening shot of a broken Christ statue dangling off a cross that's been blown to bits in a muddy WWI trench you are reminded of how well director JeanPierre Jeunet has understood the importance of masterful cinematography. Immediate attentiongrabbing snappy editing is also a speciality of his. A collection of memorable stills beautiful enough to be made into pictures to hang on your livingroom wall are the carriers of a compelling story with a universally accessible poetry both visual and verbal which alas is too often spelt out by a persistently meddling voiceover  a narrator just like in Amlie  just in case you weren't paying attention to ALL the little quirks jokes and poetry. A feast of visual humour we can trace right back to Delicatessen and a collection of interwoven snappy little stories from endearing or comic minor players could render the movie Disneyish The way Les Choristes was had Jeunet failed to also blend into the cake mix two helpings of darkness to one of sex he does exactly the same thing in both Amlie and Delicatessen. The resulting movie is one that most adults the world over will respond to a fairytale for grownups also considering the devastating WWI setting it's even more grownup than both Delicatessen which IMO was too cartoonish and Amlie too artificial and pleased with itself  like a small furry creature such as a squirrel prancing around and being well aware of its own cuteness. But as good movie as Dimanche is I don't consider it an art movie at all  rather a very accomplished and entertaining mainstream European movie.Most of all I loved the scenes in the trenches. This movie is an excellent example of how computer generated sequences SHOULD be used to enhance a feature! The CGI does its job without calling attention upon itself. The muddy dusty blood and gutstained greybrown desperation and folly of the WWI battlefields felt authentic and never idealised yet was visually stunning and also very entertaining to watch. The zeppelin in the improvised hospital scene was also amazing  a tense original and as they say memorable cinema moment. I was also fond of some comic interludes Mathilde imagining herself as the romantic heroine in her own erotic dream filmed as a silent movie the postman and his pesky bicycle Private Investigator Germain Pire played by the late Ticky Holgado and his antics for instance in the Corsican brothel etc. I also thought the flavour and FEEL of the epoch was beautifully evoked I'm a sucker for thorough research in costuming and setting so I cannot help responding positively when that aspect of a historic movie is accomplished.But I was reminded of Amlie's contrived little quirks one time too many when the German woman in the Paris bistrot trying to discreetly attract Mathilde's attention to give her some clues erases the writing on the Today's specialities blackboard by leaving just three M's. Or when we were told and shown the way Mathilde's parents had died when she was only a very small child. This was a quirky comedy death just like Amlie's mother being killing by a suicidal nun jumping off the top of a church spire. Also the vengeful prostitute Tina Lombardi's deadly contraptions used to murder the Army officials responsible for killing her beloved pimp on the battlefield were also a tad too cutesy and contrived and made me try to imagine a James Bond movie directed by Jeunet! Though this may be the fault of the novel that Un Long Dimanche is based upon I also found the mystery part a little too convoluted and again contrived. The pieces of the jigsaw fall into place a little too neatly for a situation as complicated as the search for Manech turned out to be! Regarding the central couple Mathilde and Manech whose young love for one another we are supposed to believe in and warm to in order to find the story moving at all I thought Jeunet did a good job of remaining just this side of cloying and sentimental. Again some of the poetic images were heavyhanded did we really need to hear the heart beating in the hand line so often? but on the whole efficient and sweet. Though Manech was a little too much of a wet blanket for my taste perhaps the role needed a slightly more charismatic actor than Gaspard Ulliel? I did nonetheless feel concern for him throughout most of the movie. I was also impressed with the Jodie Foster subplot and was more than a little impressed with her linguistic skills among Englishspeaking actors so far I only knew of Kristin Scott Thomas being such a convincing performer in the French language.Since Un Long Dimanche is a little too much of a ruffian to be a truly honest work of art I will therefore knock a few points off the 9 I would have given it just for sheer entertainment value and leave it with a more than dignified 7.5 out of 10 instead!".

	schema:reviewBody "Un long dimanche de fianailles mixes romance and mystery amid the brutal realities of World War I and though it's a solid film it never reaches the greatness it strives for so earnestly. Unlike most of Jeunet's other films it takes itself too seriously lacking much of the director's wonderful humor and imagination. For some reason Jeunet also comes too close in theme and setting to two much better works on World War I by Bertrand Tavernier La Vie et rien d'autre Life and Nothing But in which a woman searches for her missing husband in the aftermath of the war and Capitaine Conan about a group of French soldiers at the time of the Armistice and beyond. In fact the opening sequences of Un long dimanche de fianailles that take place in the hellish fox holes on the front line look like they have been lifted from leftover footage from Capitaine Conan. I'm not sure why Jeunet would do this. Unfortunately for him Capitaine Conan is one of the greatest films about war ever made and La Vie et rien d'autre has an emotional power and complexity that only serve to make one aware of how little of the same Jeunet is able to achieve in his own work.Audrey Tautou is charming of course and one enjoys watching her on the screen but she has to carry this heavy film on her back without much complexity in her character to explore or another strong actor to work against. One also wonders if she will get stuck playing Amelie the rest of her career. She's a wonderful actress but I find myself wanting to see her in a dark action film along the lines of Nikita. Something besides the same role over and over.One of the few times Tautou gets a break in the film is when we meet Jodie Foster's character and spend some time with her story. This is one of the best parts of the film and if the rest of the movie had had the same emotional urgency and passion as this sequence it would have been a much stronger work.Jeunet could also have spent more time on Manech and the other four soldiers around him. Their stories are interesting but it's hard to follow who is who at times and we never develop a strong emotional connection with them. More time with them and less with Tautou's Mathilde might have helped the film move a little better. One of Jeunet's strengths in Delicatessen and Amelie was creating a terrific and dynamic rhythm. This movie drags much more than it has to getting slower and a bit disjointed towards the end. The role of the detective Germain Pire provides a bit of comic relief and an element of mystery but Jeunet pretty much abandons the character after a couple of scenes. The mystery aspect of the film is handled poorly in general Jeunet turning something that could have been a real advantage into a dawdling storyline that holds little or no suspense.Visually Jeunet does a great job again though there aren't as many striking moments as in his earlier works. The most resonant image in the film involves a soldier carving the initials of his beloved into a battleblasted tree trunk in the middle of a grey apocalyptic wasteland between the French and German fronts. And while the battle scenes are sometimes powerful there is the sense that we have seen this all before.Un long dimanche de fianailles was an interesting choice for Jeunet's first movie after Amelie. From a commercial perspective it seems like a risky choice especially given the participation of Warner Brothers in putting up money for the film. This is definitely not a readymade hit  the movie is too long and slow for that. Many fans of Amelie will probably walk away disappointed. I respect his willingness to take such chances but I wish he had chosen a project that wasn't so melodramatic and pretentious in the end.And one whose plot and war theme hadn't already been done better by another director. A decent but but not great film.".

	schema:headline " It shouldn't have tried to be so sweet.";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere I've seen this described as halfway between Amelie and Delicatessen. I don't think the description fits.The movie has a very basic plot. It's about a young woman whose lover has supposedly been executed for selfmutilation in the First World War. She goes on a quest to find him trusting her intuition that he is still alive.After the dazzling spirit of Amelie this film had two choices. It could try to imitate the formula for success and most likely end up as disappointment or it could be something radically different. Instead the film seems in an uncomfortable state of trying to do both simultaneously. Styilistically it's close to Amelie we get to see lots of small short sweet background stories for the characters and the cinematography is beautiful. However this is fundamentally a tragicomic postwar drama and so the style feels oddly out of place.

	onyx:emotionText "Somewhere I've seen this described as halfway between Amelie and Delicatessen. I don't think the description fits.The movie has a very basic plot. It's about a young woman whose lover has supposedly been executed for selfmutilation in the First World War. She goes on a quest to find him trusting her intuition that he is still alive.After the dazzling spirit of Amelie this film had two choices. It could try to imitate the formula for success and most likely end up as disappointment or it could be something radically different. Instead the film seems in an uncomfortable state of trying to do both simultaneously. Styilistically it's close to Amelie we get to see lots of small short sweet background stories for the characters and the cinematography is beautiful. However this is fundamentally a tragicomic postwar drama and so the style feels oddly out of place. Although the general theme of the film is hope and thus positive.11111 Yes there are lovable characters the post man stealing the show.

To give credit where it is due the battle sequences are powerful and shocking and it is no bad thing for those of us who have never encountered war to be reminded just how fortunate we are. The film as a whole however sinks under a gratuitous load of quaint gimmicks irrelevant whimsies and distractingly unreal beauty.

For my surprise this movie is among the IMDb Top 250 being completely overrated since the story is very weird and although being a romance there is no romanticism at all. Stanley Kubrick's Path of Glory is an antiwar masterpiece and an excellent movie about the theme of soldiers sentenced to death in WWI by a French Martial Court.

	schema:reviewBody "A very long Engagement Review MMM Audience filmlovers connoisseurs of war films and probably yourself are used to bloody dark scenes where soldiers cry out of despair discovering their body torn apart. But this was just before A Very Long Engagement released on October 27th 2004. This film brings a new life to war on screen. Adapted from the French novel equivalent of A very long engagement in English by Sbastien Japrisot the French movie maker JeanPierre Jeunet brings a new perspective to the brutality of war by turning it into a kind of complicated dramatic detective story and romance full of hope and strangeness that is the love story between Mathilde and Manech. This touching film tells the story of Mathilde Audrey Tautou a young woman tirelessly searching for her fianc Manech Gaspard Ulliel sent the trenches of the Somme during World War One. These two out of time persons are in love since their earliest childhood. Together they were strong and able to face the world as the scene of the lighthouse shows it. But suddenly war appeared and put an end to the innocent and blissful love story. I stop you abruptly I can hear when you say Oh this is nothing but a love story a dud for young girl. Well I admit that thrill seekers would probably be disappointed with A Very Long Engagement and even never watch it seeing the title! Let's speak about it the title! I think that thanks to this title the audience is in the know that they mustn't expect disembowel soldiers like in Saving Private Ryanwithout criticize this excellent film of course. Anyway I thank dear JeanPierre Jeunet for having kept the original title. Yet detective storylovers will also get their share. The fact that it is filmed from Mathilde's point of view bothers and obscures the audience. Is Manech still alive or not? From the bottom of your seat you will try to understand as well as Mathilde clues given to her. Complex characters such as the private detective named Pire  Ticky Holgado the French prostitute Tina Lombardi Marion Cotillard or Elodie Gordes Jodie Foster bring different points of view which can let the audience think that each character is a liar and show the wrong way to Mathilde in her quest but actually they are not they just tell it how they saw it. All along the film Mathilde knows deep in her heart that if Manech dies she will know it and through her eyes her lover is eternal because he lives thanks to her endless love. She tries to convince herself and never stops hoping. She embodies innocence of love as two quotes show it Mathilde peeling an apple If I don't break the peel Manech is aliveIf I reach the bend before the car Manech will come back alive Beyond this love story the film denounces the absurdity of war especially through Manech and his fellows portrayed at war. Rouvires A Trench named Bingo Crepuscule? Why not Youppie Tralala? A Small slab of humor eases the hardness of being stuck in a battlefield. Thanks to JeanPierre Jeunet's intertwined qualities neither the horrific images of war nor the love story itself dominates over the other. The complementarity between the two makes the excellence and success of this film. The entire movie could be summed up by this beautiful sentence that Manech says to Mathilde which is punctuated by this alliteration in m Manech M Mathilde Mathilde M Manech Nothing and noone could change it.".

But suddenly war appeared and put an end to the innocent and blissful love story. I stop you abruptly I can hear when you say Oh this is nothing but a love story a dud for young girl. Well I admit that thrill seekers would probably be disappointed with A Very Long Engagement and even never watch it seeing the title! Let's speak about it the title! I think that thanks to this title the audience is in the know that they mustn't expect disembowel soldiers like in Saving Private Ryanwithout criticize this excellent film of course. Anyway I thank dear JeanPierre Jeunet for having kept the original title. Yet detective storylovers will also get their share. The fact that it is filmed from Mathilde's point of view bothers and obscures the audience. Is Manech still alive or not? From the bottom of your seat you will try to understand as well as Mathilde clues given to her. Complex characters such as the private detective named Pire  Ticky Holgado the French prostitute Tina Lombardi Marion Cotillard or Elodie Gordes Jodie Foster bring different points of view which can let the audience think that each character is a liar and show the wrong way to Mathilde in her quest but actually they are not they just tell it how they saw it. All along the film Mathilde knows deep in her heart that if Manech dies she will know it and through her eyes her lover is eternal because he lives thanks to her endless love. She tries to convince herself and never stops hoping. She embodies innocence of love as two quotes show it Mathilde peeling an apple If I don't break the peel Manech is aliveIf I reach the bend before the car Manech will come back alive Beyond this love story the film denounces the absurdity of war especially through Manech and his fellows portrayed at war. Rouvires A Trench named Bingo Crepuscule? Why not Youppie Tralala? A Small slab of humor eases the hardness of being stuck in a battlefield. Thanks to JeanPierre Jeunet's intertwined qualities neither the horrific images of war nor the love story itself dominates over the other. The complementarity between the two makes the excellence and success of this film. The entire movie could be summed up by this beautiful sentence that Manech says to Mathilde which is punctuated by this alliteration in m Manech M Mathilde Mathilde M Manech Nothing and noone could change it.";

That's just one of the tricks from Amelie that doesn't fully work here as that costume change does feel uncomfortable indeed... I honestly stopped caring if Mathilde's love who is also portrayed quite anonymously returned after the umpteenth thread of hope popped up with more and more new characters...  along with repeated reenactments of the same scenes. The high level of graphic war images mixed with Jeunets trademark quirky comic touches is also a bit too jarring for me. On the whole it's still safely and surely above average.

Everyone one way or another inflicts a shot wound to their hand in a try to get leave as wounded. But the punishment for selfmaiming in the French army is harsh death! The sentence is carried out by forcing the men out between the German and French trenches and let the inevitable happen.At the end of the war Mathilde learns that Manech her boyfriend was one of the five and that he died. Mathilde refuses to believe that Manech died and starts the seemingly futile task of collecting clues about the fate of the five and learn what ultimately became of Manech.Comments Of course this falls into the genre Romance because Mathilde searches for her lost love. But that is almost all of it. The rest is story of mystery and uncertainties. The fate of Manech is a web of clues misinformation assumptions and unknowns. Mathilde assumes the role of the detective that slowly and painfully pushes the investigations along. And even though it is never any doubt over the ending it is entertaining interesting and engaging to see Mathilde untangle this web.Even though the setting is the war and its aftermath and even though I think that is more of a mystery than a romantic movie maybe the best words to summarize the movie is warmth and love. Audrey Tautou makes a great performance and you can see and feel Mathilde's love for Manech the love that drives her and the warmth of the character. The warmth and love is also present between Mathilde and her fosterparents. Although the parents may doubt that Manech is still alive and wish for Mathilde to accept this and move on they dutifully support her and drives her wherever she wants.Two other things should be mentioned. The first is that you might find very good actors in smaller roles. For instance look for Jodie Foster and Tchky Karyo in small but interesting parts. The other are the sceneries chosen. All are impressive and beautiful if you might call a First World War battlefield beautiful. What I do mean is that it is noticeable that the director and crew has been very careful about both the details and the overall picture which gives each scene and background a very nice air of completeness. It might also be interesting to watch the change in colours Manech's adventures in the war is shown not surprisingly in a very dull grey. But when Mathilde is about the scene is full of warm colours enhancing the character.Not completely the genre I like most though so I rated it a 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a lovely Indian commercial film. Great songs nice story nice script and good actors. The film addresses a rather controversial topic by portraying a very young girl who gets pregnant and when her boyfriend does not wish to take responsibility for his actions she firmly decides to give birth to her baby and fight all the social prejudice including the initial opposition of her own parents. The film is interesting and engaging but the execution is very poor. The costumes are weird and the film is extremely outdated. Premarital pregnancy is not such a big deal in our times even in India making the portrayal a bit exaggerated. The film's depiction makes it look like an old picture from the 1980s. Even when Priya dances at the club with her pal the song that is being played is Michael Jackson's Billie Jean which is not bad but is not concurrent with the film's time. Maybe they should have defined the period of time as such it would have made much more sense. Additionally Saif Ali Khan's character is inexplicable Preity Zinta's elder brother's character is too aggressive and Zinta herself does not look the age she is supposed to be. At some points the film is a bit overly melodramatic which is unnecessary in a film that wants to be issuebased and portray realism.What I did like immensely is the portrayal of a loving united family. It was very touching and was portrayed well. The scene in which Priya's brothers turn on the video and cry quietly is very moving however clichd it may be. This is actually Preity Zinta's very first film and the one which established her as a leading star. She is the soul of the film and injects much energy and freshness into her character. She was not really brilliant as she would be in many of her future films and her voice and diction were pretty problematic at that point of time. Yet she succeeds in breathing as much life as possible into Priya with her boyish charm bubbly personality and sincere portrayal. Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachhur Singh don't impress much but Farida Jalal and Anupam Kher as her parents are very likable. Rajesh Roshan's soundtrack is one of the main reasons this film has such a colourful and positive feel about it. One very good example is the family song Kya Kehna. Other songs that I particularly enjoyed listening to include Dekhiye Aaji Jaanemann and In Kadmon Ke Neeche. Well do watch Kya Kehna. Don't expect to see a brilliant or a particularly realistic film but do expect to be touched by a very charming Hindi entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bollywood is not known for producing movies with controversial issues in them. Most movies are dramas or action adventures. Which is why it is refreshing to see a movie like Kya Kehna about being pregnant out of wedlock.SPOILERSIt is the story of a young high spirited college girl Priya Priety Zinta who falls madly head over heels in love with bad boy Rahul Saif Ali Khan. Rahul is the boy no parent wants as a soninlaw. He's handsome and rich but he's also a flirt who changes girls more often than he changes clothes. He is instantly attracted to Priya's beauty but I believe more attracted to her because he gets warned over and over again not to go near her by her brothers. Against her family's wishes Priya and Rahul get involved and eventually her parents agree to a marriage. Rahul however doesn't want to know anything about it and it is then that Priya sees Rahul's character. Things spiral out of control when Priya and her family find out that she is pregnant.The story is very promising. Young girl throws tradition to the wind and stands up to society and her family to protect herself and her child. A very realistic storyline whose execution unfortunately lacks realism. It is the little things that ruin this movie. I can believe Priya's independant highspirited character. I can't believe her journey from childlike innocence to responsible maturity. I can believe Rahul's irresponsibility. I can't believe his over the top mother who just seems to disappear in the second half of the movie. I can believe Priya's stigmatisation by society. I can't believe Priya's stigmatisation by the WHOLE of society including all of her college friends of whom I'm sure at least some must have engaged in recreational activities out of wedlock and surely would feel sympathy for her situation. I can believe Priya's tenacity. I can't believe the sudden way in which rejection turns into acceptance.On top of these unrealistic twists and turns and characters and stories there are inconsistencies that just turn my stomach at times. Not because they are so horrible but because they could have easily been amended. The most obvious one is appearance in particular Saif Ali Khan's hair which seems to be able to grow long in a day be short the next and be long the day after. Furthermore the way the director tries to portray grown girls as school girls in the boarding school scene is atrocious. You cannot give 20somethings pigtails and a lesson in how to behave as a fiveyearold and expect people to believe they are teens. And finally the monologues at times are horrible because they are too long and try too hard to make their point.Over all this movie tries to deal with a very controversial and contemporary issue which is very commendable. Unfortunately in my opinion it has failed. Not because it is so bad but because it could have been so much more. This movie can easily be described as OVER THE TOP. Perhaps my views would be different if I hadn't been born and brought up in a western culture. Nonetheless I would not want this to keep you from watching Kya Kehna because despite its faults it also has redeeming qualities. The strongest of which would be its ending. Predictability is for the first time thrown out of the window and replaced with brash boldness.5 stars".

I can't believe the sudden way in which rejection turns into acceptance.On top of these unrealistic twists and turns and characters and stories there are inconsistencies that just turn my stomach at times. Not because they are so horrible but because they could have easily been amended. The most obvious one is appearance in particular Saif Ali Khan's hair which seems to be able to grow long in a day be short the next and be long the day after. Furthermore the way the director tries to portray grown girls as school girls in the boarding school scene is atrocious. You cannot give 20somethings pigtails and a lesson in how to behave as a fiveyearold and expect people to believe they are teens. And finally the monologues at times are horrible because they are too long and try too hard to make their point.Over all this movie tries to deal with a very controversial and contemporary issue which is very commendable. Unfortunately in my opinion it has failed. Not because it is so bad but because it could have been so much more. This movie can easily be described as OVER THE TOP. Perhaps my views would be different if I hadn't been born and brought up in a western culture. Nonetheless I would not want this to keep you from watching Kya Kehna because despite its faults it also has redeeming qualities. The strongest of which would be its ending. Predictability is for the first time thrown out of the window and replaced with brash boldness.5 stars";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie never seems to bore me! It has it all whether it's character depth great story lovely songs or amazing scenery this movie adds everything! The movie belongs to Preity Zinta which is actually her first film but was released after 'Dil Se' and 'Soldier' for some apparent reason. Preity Zinta stars as Priya Bakshi who has just finished school and ready to return to her Bakshi family who all await her arrival but none more so than her lovable dad Gulshan BakshiAnupam Kher. As she returns the family is overwhelmed considering she is the favourite to whole family and the love of Ajay Chandrachur Singh her childhood friend who harbors a secret crush for her. Priya who is new to her college is spotted by playboy Rahul Saif Ali Khanand both fall in love with each other. Despite warnings from her brother and family to stay away from the flirt Rahul she still continues to meet him and ends up committing an act that will bring her family to shame. Wedding Rahul nor giving up her unborn child does not seem to be an option for Priya which sets challenges upon the path she walks. Kicked out of her house by her parents and no where else to go what are the alternatives for this young girl? Will she face humiliation? Will Rahul accept her? Will she be able to keep her baby? Watch Kya Kehna to find the answers! A truly Lovely story which will emote the audience to sympathise with Priya and follow her throughout her bubbly innocent journey. If you do not enjoy this movie i can not seem to think what movies you will like. Lovely performances by Preity Zinta as bubbly Priya Saif Ali Khan as playboy Rahul Anupam Kher as the kind hearted dad Gulshan Bakshi and Farida Jalal as the lovely mother Rohini Bakshi. My only complaint of this movie is something minor as i think the character of 'Ajay' should have been played by a more well known actor. This movie goes to show that Preity Zinta was a star right from her first movie and proves undoubtedly to be her film as she stars as the hero and heroine of the movie! 10 stars".

He likes to go out with girls just for bedroom duties and its so obvious because he has blatantly dated so many girls in college. But Saif see's Preity and wants her too. He gets warned by her brothers and the brothers warn Preity to stay away from him. But our immature bimbo falls for him and sleeps with him. Perhaps preity was so dumb she didn't know what a condom is and she gets pregnant. So the movie focuses on what happens now. Sadly the child is not to blame for being born but unwanted. Preity has committed a stupid mistake and deserves to get bullied and harassed. I was laughing and enjoying those scenes where she gets bullied and kicked out. But she gets forgiven. Saif performed well. I like his character because it relates to me. Preity is annoying as usual I wonder how she became a actress. I guess some guys have all the luck".

	schema:reviewBody "This film directed by Stanley Kubrik is not seen often these days. It was a surprise that it was shown recently on cable as it gave all of Mr. Kubrik's fans the opportunity to watch one of his early works.The copy that was shown is amazing in that it has been kept or probably restored with great care. Stanley Kubrik was a genius he probably knew more about movies than many other of his contemporaries. Yet his legacy is somehow meager only sixteen full length features in almost fifty years as a director.Killer's Kiss shows the Manhattan of 1955 like it has never been seen in other movies made in the city. Mr. Kubrik's attention to detail and style overshadows the story. The main problem is his screen play it never involves the viewer in what he is seeing. This is exacerbated by the voice over one hears over the action. We never know what makes these people tick much less what's going on in their heads at any given moment.The story is told in a flashback. We see Davy waiting at the old Pennsylvania Station for the train that is to take him to Seattle. He had planned to leave with Gloria but she seems never to appear for all we know he might be waiting in vain.The streets of Manhattan come alive in the brilliant black and white cinematography by Mr. Kubrik himself. That old New York that is no longer around is captured by Mr. Kubrik in such brilliant detail that we mourn the fact those buildings and institutions are not around any more. The night scenes around Times Square especially the stairway leading to the dance hall have a style that brings some of Edward Hooper's work to mind. Mr. Kubrik deserves credit for filming on location and never making it feel as though those scenes have been fixed to give that effect. In fact that's where Kubrik's genius comes into play we realize he had an eye for making things real.The acting is not the main focus of this film. Frank Silvera makes a menacing Vincent the mobster and dance hall owner. Jamie Smith and Irene Kane go through the paces but they don't convey to the viewer the passion that is supposed to be going on between them.This movie should be seen by the serious moviegoer as it shows Mr. Kubrik's tremendous talent. It might be a minor film in comparison to his best work but being one of his first movies one can clearly see what will come later.".

Yet his legacy is somehow meager only sixteen full length features in almost fifty years as a director.Killer's Kiss shows the Manhattan of 1955 like it has never been seen in other movies made in the city. Mr. Kubrik's attention to detail and style overshadows the story. The main problem is his screen play it never involves the viewer in what he is seeing. This is exacerbated by the voice over one hears over the action. We never know what makes these people tick much less what's going on in their heads at any given moment.The story is told in a flashback. We see Davy waiting at the old Pennsylvania Station for the train that is to take him to Seattle. He had planned to leave with Gloria but she seems never to appear for all we know he might be waiting in vain.The streets of Manhattan come alive in the brilliant black and white cinematography by Mr. Kubrik himself. That old New York that is no longer around is captured by Mr. Kubrik in such brilliant detail that we mourn the fact those buildings and institutions are not around any more. The night scenes around Times Square especially the stairway leading to the dance hall have a style that brings some of Edward Hooper's work to mind. Mr. Kubrik deserves credit for filming on location and never making it feel as though those scenes have been fixed to give that effect. In fact that's where Kubrik's genius comes into play we realize he had an eye for making things real.The acting is not the main focus of this film. Frank Silvera makes a menacing Vincent the mobster and dance hall owner. Jamie Smith and Irene Kane go through the paces but they don't convey to the viewer the passion that is supposed to be going on between them.This movie should be seen by the serious moviegoer as it shows Mr. Kubrik's tremendous talent. It might be a minor film in comparison to his best work but being one of his first movies one can clearly see what will come later.";

At any rate this is an opportunity to see Kubrick at work right before he makes it in the business.With an almostnothing budget you aren't going to draw too many professional actors and that certainly was the case here but still is worth watching. It's definitely a B noir that is more melodrama than crime until the ending when it gets very very suspenseful featuring a chase over New York City rooftops and then into abandoned warehouses.Jamie Smith and Irene Kane are the stars and if you've never heard of them it's probably because they weren't exactly Humphey Bogart and Bette Davis actingwise. The other star Frank Silvera at least is a name I recognized.Overall the best feature may be the camerawork. It gives us a preview of the visual talents that Kubrick would bring to the big screen in following decade. On its own merits if you are a film noir fan you'll want this in your collection.".

The use of depth light and shadow and of his trademark moving camera show us more skill and thought than directors with dozens of films and much better scripts under their belt. And Kubrick's trademark use of his camera to observe silently capturing the true spirit of his characters when they are alone no music no dialogue is seen over and over in the apartment.

He decided to go with FilmNoir.The film is filled with Kubrick trademarks through and through.  He uses boxing which was the subject of his very first short Day of the Fight 1951 zooming techniques flashbacks also used in his next film The Killing 1956 and narration.  The cinematography is exquisite as usual with many shots particularly in the boxing studio and the train station being backlit with a soft grey light to give it a disconnected almost rearscreenprojection feel.  However it is obvious that this is the early naive Kubrick at work here.  The entire movie like Fear And Desire is postdubbed much like a Fellini film with all of the sound effects being done over by a meticulous Kubrick.  And of course the FilmNoir.  Davey Gordon played to perfection by Jamie Smith is the almoststereotypical Noir antihero with Irene Kane aka journalist Chris Chase as his antiheroine.  Frank Silvera who had the lead role in Fear And Desire is the slimy villain whom you actually want to die a good sign for a villain.This Kubrick film can most be compared to 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 or Barry Lyndon 1975 in that once you get past a slow beginning the end is absolutely riveting.  Kubrick knows that he wants to grab his audience and he does so with perfection.  Some of it is padded the ballet sequence is not particular interest but the rest it great from the initial boxing sequence to the chase scene at the end.  If you're a fan of Kubrick see it. If you're a fan of great cinema see it.  If you're a fan of FilmNoir see it but take it with a pinch of salt.  If you're none of these things see it and you will be.".

This movie is however no masterpiece but that's not to say it's without it's plus points.First and foremost this movie is admirable for it's directing which is excellent. Of course Stanley Kubrick would go on to show himself as a genius behind the camera and this movie is an early taste of that genius in the directorial department. Secondly despite the Bgrade cast the acting is not bad at all. It's not marvelous but considering the cast's accomplishments previously and after this movie was made it's better than one would expect.One of the movie's major flaws however is its lack of ideas. There are some nice ideas in the film such as the part where Gloria tells her story to a backdrop of her sister doing ballet and the Rear Window style way that the Gloria and Davy meet but as the film is only 67 minutes long it felt at times that Kubrick was spending too long on certain sequences which is a problem if the movie is as short as this one is as it looked as though Kubrick was just dragging things out in order to meet an acceptable running time. That might be so bad in a longer film but here it's not good.This movie is a nice taut little thriller and is definitely recommended to people that want to see some early Kubrick and thereby see how he developed as a filmmaker but it's not a great film and I don't recommend going into this movie expecting it to be one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers Stanley Kubrick's debut film about obsession and murder on the gritty and dangerous streets of midtown Manhattan and the empty and deserted factory lofts along the Brooklyn waterfront. With a number of fine performances by Jamie Smith  Gloria Price as the two unlikely lovebirds Davy Gordon  Irene Kane and especially Frank Silvera as Irene's jealous and obsessive former boyfriend Vicent Rapallo. Who runs the Pleasureland DanceHall where Irene works as a dance partner for the customers who go there for their nightly entertainment. Davy who's a professional boxer just came back from the sports arena after getting his brains scrambled by the up and coming world welterweight contender 22 yearold Kid Rodriguez who knocked him out cold in the first round of their match. With his boxing career on the ropes the 29 yearold washedup fighter was nursing his wounds when he hears a scream across the other side of his apartment building. With the women Irene in question being beaten up by her boyfriendVincent and comes to the women's rescue as Vincent flees the scene. Irene had just broken up with Vincent who's also a parttime hoodlum as well as dancehall manager. After spending the next morning with Davy who had breakfast in her apartment Irene decides to leave New York City with him for Seattle. It's there where she can live and find work together with Davy on his uncle's horse farm. Davy and Irene plan to meet after they both get paid at Penn. Station in midtown Manhattan for a train to Washington State.Davy gets in touch with his fight manager Albert Jerry Jarret and tells Jerry to meet him at the Pleasureland DanceHall to pick up his check for his fight with Kid Rodriguez. Meanwhile Irene also goes to the dancehall to get her severance pay from her former boyfriend Vincent. After having it out with him when he begged her to please stay Vincent sends two of his thugs outside the dancehall to kidnap Irene and also work over Davy who's expected to meet her outside the place. Instead they mistake Jerry for Davy and end up beating him to death as they grab and take off with the terrified Irene. Davy getting to the dancehall late due to him chasing these two wackos who stole his scarf goes home and takes his belongings to go to the train station the next morning thinking that Irene left and deserted him. Checking Irene's apartment Davy finds it empty but as he's there he sees outside the window into his apartment two police officers talking with his super about him being suspected of murdering his manager Jerry earlier that night. Realizing now what really happened and him being framed for Jerry's murder Davy get's a taxi to Vincent's place at the dancehall. After taking him hostage Davy has Vincent drive him to a Brooklyn warehouse where his two hoods who murdered Jerry Mike Dana  Felice Oriandi are holding Irene captive. Exciting final with Davy battling both Vicent and his two henchmen with a real knock around battle with Vincent in a garment factory loft filled with mannequins that are used as deadly weapons in the fighting together with axes and steelhooked poles with Vicent ending up dead and Davy arrested for murder. Davy is later vindicated at the police station for Vicent's death due to selfdefense but Irene whom Davy rescued leaves the precinct without going with him to the train station to leave for Seattle as she said earlier she would. We see this all in a flashback by Davy reflecting on what he went through the last three days. Feeling hurt and dejected as Davy's about to get on the train by himself he spots running to the train station Irene! The film ends with Davy now knowing that he's not alone as he and Irene both kiss and leave for Seattle together like they planned to do in the first place. Stanley Kubrick showed in his first major motion picture Killer's Kiss just what the movie going public could expect from him in the future when he has more money and experience to put into the movies. Movies that he'll make and direct. And after some 44 years up until his death in 1999 the movie going public were never disappointed in any of his cinematic efforts.".

After taking him hostage Davy has Vincent drive him to a Brooklyn warehouse where his two hoods who murdered Jerry Mike Dana  Felice Oriandi are holding Irene captive. Exciting final with Davy battling both Vicent and his two henchmen with a real knock around battle with Vincent in a garment factory loft filled with mannequins that are used as deadly weapons in the fighting together with axes and steelhooked poles with Vicent ending up dead and Davy arrested for murder. Davy is later vindicated at the police station for Vicent's death due to selfdefense but Irene whom Davy rescued leaves the precinct without going with him to the train station to leave for Seattle as she said earlier she would. We see this all in a flashback by Davy reflecting on what he went through the last three days. Feeling hurt and dejected as Davy's about to get on the train by himself he spots running to the train station Irene! The film ends with Davy now knowing that he's not alone as he and Irene both kiss and leave for Seattle together like they planned to do in the first place. Stanley Kubrick showed in his first major motion picture Killer's Kiss just what the movie going public could expect from him in the future when he has more money and experience to put into the movies. Movies that he'll make and direct. And after some 44 years up until his death in 1999 the movie going public were never disappointed in any of his cinematic efforts.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kubrick was the director cinematographer editor coproducer and cowriter of his second movie and commendably despite his lack of experience and an obviously low budget Killer's Kiss proved to be an extremely enjoyable and visually impressive film noir drama.Davey Gordon Jamie Smith is a washed up boxer who meets and falls in love with a dancehall hostess called Gloria Price Irene Kane and together they plan to relocate to Seattle. Unfortunately Gloria's violent employer Vincent Rapallo Frank Silvera has designs on her and dispatches two of his henchmen to deal with Davey. However due to a couple of unexpected coincidences the plan goes wrong the two men kill Davey's manager and the police suspect that Davey is the murderer. In order to prove his innocence Davey pursues Rapallo and this eventually leads to a final confrontation between the two men when they engage in a spectacular and well choreographed fight for supremacy.Throughout the story the action takes place in locations which seem claustrophobic and often the framing of the shots emphasises this impression. Davey and Gloria's living areas and Rapallo's office are all small. Camera positions which look down on the characters when they're on the stairs in the couple's tenement building and in the dancehall entrance area also appear to significantly constrict the space they occupy. During a boxing match in which the two boxers are already confined within the ring when Davey's opponent stands up to start the bout he is seen from a low viewpoint behind the still seated Davey with the result that the space which he visually inhabits is made even smaller as he is then seen framed by Davey's right leg. Even the outdoor sequences in the latter part of the film convey the same impression as narrow streets and alleyways surrounded by very high buildings seem to close in on everyone who enters those areas.Some good ideas are also used to make the film visually interesting. Davey's face is seen peering through the water in a fishbowl and the viewpoint is the position of the wall behind the bowl.. Similarly when Rapallo throws a tumbler at a picture on the wall of his office the glass is seen shattering from the viewpoint of the picture. A dream sequence is photographed in negative and the final confrontation between Davey and Rapallo is staged in a warehouse full of mannequins in a sequence which is rather reminiscent of the hall of mirrors sequence in The Lady From Shanghai. There is also a brilliantly composed shot of the streets down which Davey is being pursued by Rapallo and his men where the lit area of the street and buildings is reduced to a limited area on the bottom left hand side of the frame with everywhere else being bathed in black shadow. Rapallo's thugs are also shown in silhouette when they attack Davey's manager and their elongated shadows on the walls of the alley seem to exaggerate the sense of danger involved.The night time street scenes shot in Times Square are particularly good and the other New York locations are also portrayed in a manner which powerfully conveys their squalor and potentially threatening atmosphere.Killer's Kiss is rather short and contains some dead pan performances but its real strength lies in its incredible visual impact and its ability to evoke threatening and oppressive atmospheres so successfully.".

Shot when he was 26 years old it shows a fantastic use of light when it came to emphasis and also a lot more confidence in narrative and framing.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow right from the start Killer's Kiss shows a noticeable step up from Fear and Desire we open in a train station and will see many people and large sets for the rest of the film. More than a technical advance Killer's Kiss is an excellent noir with a tight plot and much larger scale than what actually happens. There's a boxer a dancer a gangster and his goons and one big flashback. From the first scene and the beginning of an ongoing narration we see that Gordon is alone so we can focus on the why it relates to the message.There are great scenes in Killer's Kiss. The boxing is raw much better than fight scenes of the time it feels like you have front row seats. The ballerina and exposition of Gloria's life and the climatic chase and mannequin mangling. The acting is fair but Rappello is a real slimeball.This is a huge step up from Fear and Desire technically. The shooting is excellent feeling large and small at the same time. We get treated to some artistic shots as well. The editing is fine and the lighting is true noir. The music is fantastic very upbeat fast and fitting adding to the tension where needed. This is visionary directing with funds.Then there's the ending. No spoilers. This was an 8 the whole way through I was loving it but then the last scene shatters the message as well as the score. You'll roll your eyes at Gordon's reaction. If you want to see a much better film end it with 1 minute left.But overall the film is excellent and I feel it's better to have too much than too little you can edit the ending yourself. A solid noir and even more promise than Fear and Desire despite the contradictory ending. 6.610".

More than a technical advance Killer's Kiss is an excellent noir with a tight plot and much larger scale than what actually happens. There's a boxer a dancer a gangster and his goons and one big flashback. From the first scene and the beginning of an ongoing narration we see that Gordon is alone so we can focus on the why it relates to the message.There are great scenes in Killer's Kiss. The boxing is raw much better than fight scenes of the time it feels like you have front row seats. The ballerina and exposition of Gloria's life and the climatic chase and mannequin mangling. The acting is fair but Rappello is a real slimeball.This is a huge step up from Fear and Desire technically. The shooting is excellent feeling large and small at the same time. We get treated to some artistic shots as well. The editing is fine and the lighting is true noir. The music is fantastic very upbeat fast and fitting adding to the tension where needed. This is visionary directing with funds.Then there's the ending. No spoilers. This was an 8 the whole way through I was loving it but then the last scene shatters the message as well as the score. You'll roll your eyes at Gordon's reaction. If you want to see a much better film end it with 1 minute left.But overall the film is excellent and I feel it's better to have too much than too little you can edit the ending yourself. A solid noir and even more promise than Fear and Desire despite the contradictory ending. 6.610";

	schema:reviewBody "Killer's Kiss 1955 acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick's second feature film starred Jamie Smith Irene Kane and Frank Silvera.The story looks like it was partly inspired by Robert Siodmak's The Killers 1946 A boxer called on the slide Davey Gordon Jamie Smith is awakened from a dream a stunning piece of surrealism it's only fault being that it is too short by the screams of Gloria Price Irene Kane who lives on the other side of his apartment block as her lecherous boss Vincent Rapallo Frank Silvera forces himself on her. Gordon goes to her help but Rapallo escapes. He falls in love with Gloria a dancer at a nightclub run by Rapallo but in doing so he faces Rapallo's wrath and his deadly vengeance.While the plot may be slightly runonthemill stuff the movie as a whole is certainly not. Shot on the streets of New York by Kubrick himself the picture benefits enormously by this breathing quality making the story more believable as it's set and shot in a real place a rare practice at the time one wonders if Kubrick did this for purely aesthetic reasons the budget of the movie was only 40000 or so extremely cheap even then for a movie. The camerawork is very high contrast black and white all the automobiles surfaces gleaming and enabling the tower blocks Gordon rushes past during the final look dark and foreboding. He also inserts a few stylistic shots like Gordon looking through a fishbowl but Kubrick uses these sparingly so they always look unexpected. Along with the beautiful cinematography the action is the highlight of this motion picture a violent and ruthless boxing match early on shot with a handheld camera is exciting and brutal capturing what the sport is really like. Another set piece is justifiably famous a climatic fight between Gordon and Rapallo in a mannequin store house with fireaxes.But there are flaws flaws than cannot be overlooked even if one is kind to the young Stanley Kubrick and very lenient. First and foremost is the acting Irene Kane as the woman who sparks off all the trouble is desperately weak and is hard to see why a Rapallo lust after her and Gordon falls in love with her so quickly. Silvera is excellent as our villain and Smith while nothing special is good enough for his part but because Kubrick opted to film the movie silent and then put in the sounds in postproduction not only do you have errors like cars driving in the background but no noise issuing forth from them but the performances are made rather stilted and the dialogue spoken doesn't always match up to their lips. The motion picture is in a needless flashback so we are given a redundant voiceover and the ending in the trainstation is overlysentimental and it is not only alien to the world of noir but alien also to Kubrick. Despites these flaws the movie reminds an enjoyable at times very exciting film noir that isn't just for Kubrick buffs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The best thing to be said of KILLER'S KISS is it is promising. Like HEARTS OF AGE was promising for Orson Welles when he directed it as a school project in the 1930s. It's hard to believe watching this film that Stanley Kubrick directed first THE KILLING and then PATHS OF GLORY immediately after he did this film. One can see while watching it spurts of Kubrick's inventiveness and story telling ability. Two examples come to mind the murder of the hero's manager Albert by Rapallo's two bodyguardgoons and the fight between Rapallo and Davy in the mannequin factorywarehouse. The latter has been well analyzed by critical fans of Kubrick particularly as he uses the body sections of the mannequins note the heads and hanging hands and legs and torsos being thrown about as a suggestive way of showing how the ax wielding Rapallo can possibly maim and disfigure if not kill Davy. As for the former we see the killing in three stages the two goons separating Albert from Irene then the goons forcing a frightened and desperate Albert back into the alley to kill him and then the two goons leaving the alley  and briefly returning to the alley to make it look like a robbery murder. We never seek Albert dying we hear later that the poor guy's head was bashed in.Sequences like that are worth noting. It shows what to expect from Stanley once his career takes off. But that doesn't hide the defects of the film. Of the performers only Frank Silvera Rapallo rises to the role of the villain. He is a middle aged creep who has fallen for Gloria but she is disgusted by him. So he is determined to have revenge on her and on Davy whom she favors now. But Jamie Smith and Irene Kane are no more than competent and Jamie Smith is sometimes rather dull as Davy  the fight sequence is okay but no more than that It's no RAGING BULL. Better however is Jerry Jarrett as the doomed Albert making the most of the scene where he tries to escape the two goons. The actors playing the goons are reasonably threatening but no more than that one is surprised that one of them complains when he apparently hurts his leg in chasing Davy. And so it really goes in the film the acting is barely adequate except for the villain and you will note that only the villain really had a decent film career.There is also a defect in the script that the later Kubrick would not have made. The genius behind DR. STRANGELOVE destroyed the world in a nuclear holocaust. The man who made PATHS OF GLORY made sure that the film ended on a sad note of hope when Kirk Douglas' Col. Dax hears the soldiers singing the sad song in honor of their three murdered comrades. But the screenplaystory here is crazy. In the last quarter hour Gloria shows her real opportunism in an attempt to save herself at the expense of Davy by offering to return to her relationship with Rapallo. Davy is hurt by this and says as much  he doesn't even try to rescue her when he flees. Yet we see them in each other's arms at the end! Compare that to Michael O'Hara leaving Elsa Bannister to die at the end of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI or Phyllis Dietrichson being shot by Walter Neff after confessing she is rotten but does love him in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Film noir relationships are usually doomed. They rarely are set up for the man to forgive the woman and embrace at the end. In fact think of the way THE KILLING ends with Elisha Cook Jr. shooting the traitorous Marie Windsor. That's more typical.The shots around 1955 New York are fascinating. In particular the ones inside the old Penn Station torn down within a decade despite much public outcry. They too add a bit of enjoyment to the film for New York viewers. But if the total is tallied while above average KILLER'S KISS is minor Kubrick.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think in Killer's Kiss you can really start to see the genius that is Stanley Kubrick beginning to push through. By the time the film had reached the finale of its 67 minute runtime I was ready for it to carry on and keep on going giving us more and more. Alas what happens next on the train journey away from it all is never revealed but isn't that the sign of greatness when a director can leave the audience wanting more even when they've rounded the film off in a satisfactory manner anyway? Over the coming decades Kubrick would go on to cover a range of genres such as war comedy horror science fiction and so forth all with tremendous results but this seems to be his only divulge into noir and it goes without saying that it is a damn shame. In true noir fashion Killer's Kiss begins in the present and goes back into the past as an anxious and somewhat lonely man regresses on what's happened. Needless to say it isn't good it usually isn't in the genre of noir. The man is Davy Gordon Smith not a disgruntled P.I. or someone else connected to anything legal or illegal whom teeters on both sides of the law but a boxer plain a simple perhaps a boxer due to Kubrick's 1951 short Day of the Fight given its boxing content.Following Davy's fight he is awoken in the middle of the night by Gloria Price's Kane screaming and it turns out she's having a bit of trouble with her employer Vincent Rapallo Silvera who is helplessly in love with her as it is and thus the obsession inspired behaviour does not bode well with a woman unafraid to use her voice and loose enough as it is anyway. Naturally Davy gets involved but ultimately it won't be for the good. The film carries a fair amount of chemistry between the two leads and the scenes they share work to a degree but Kubrick would never become one of those sorts of directors and it's no surprise that the graphic content and element of antagonism are the key things here. There is a feeling of power struggle between two sides and we get a feeling there's something at stake once Davy has meddled with the affairs of criminal boss Vincent.What follows is the alleyway killing of a certain character by hoods employed by Vincent and you do get the feeling that although he isn't allowed Kubrick really wants to show us the beating to add to the danger these gangsters pose as well as well before that the expression of love between both Davy and Gloria. But he can't due to the censorship rules although it doesn't detract from the film's quality  later on Kubrick would confront global fears such as nuclear war and make a black comedy out of it and with A Clockwork Orange he would pull the film from cinemas himself due to all the content many people were unhappy with examples of taboo subjects and lack of compassion towards censorship that were trying or wanting to break out in Killer's Kiss.The film continues down its unpredictable route of noir and crime using bizarre street locations full of towering chimney's and bizarre desolate buildings as the finale nears. The location work echoes A Clockwork Orange for example the opening underpasstramp beating scene as well as the great use of the grand hotel in The Shining as a close and claustrophobic area almost threatening in its presentation. But what follows the scenes of chase in this film is a finale fight that should be mentioned within the same breath as the hall of mirrors fight in Welles' The Lady From Shanghai itself a noir from a legendary director. That is when the final fight occurs in a mannequin doll factory. As the fight goes on the dolls become increasingly eerie the audience almost distracted by them as they watch on in a humanlike manner. Killer's Kiss is a fascinating and really nicely unfolded film that ranks up with some of Kubrick's best in my opinion and should be seen by as many of his fans as possible.".

	schema:headline " An interesting early achievement by one of cinema's undisputed masters";
	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Kubrick famously wound up despising three of his films Fear and Desire Killer's Kiss both for being amateurish efforts and Spartacus for being a studio picture on which he was hired after the original director got sacked. And while it's true that Kiss his second feature doesn't quite match his more famous works it is undoubtedly a fascinating example of a genius filmmaker learning his craft.The most unusual thing about the movie by Kubrickian standards that is is probably the story which is very simple and straightforward as opposed to the more complex layered studies of human decay the director is known for it is also alongside Fear and Desire his only original screenplay. The film opens with a man Jamie Smith waiting for someone at a train station. He introduces himself as Davy Gordon a mildly successful prize fighter and starts telling the audience what led him there in a long flashback it all began when he met Gloria Price Irene Kane a dancer who was being followed and harassed by her manager and occasional lover Vincent Raphello Frank Silvera. As Raphello gets more obsessive and violent Davy decides to help Gloria and gets increasingly involved with her on a personal level which upsets Vincent to the point he asks for help to get the boxer out of the way.The transition from romantic drama to hardboiled gangster movie would be risible in other films but Kubrick manages to make it look natural and realistic. Realism also plays an important part in the strong characterization and sharp dialogue which are the main tools that allow the movie to be engaging despite a notsooriginal plot. Moreover while the picture lacks the technical finesse of his later work the director proves to be at ease with timeshifting narrative albeit at its simplest the flashback is completely linear with none of the headscratching jumps made normal by Tarantino and Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu.Overall this may not be Kubrick as we know him hell this movie even has a happy ending sort of but all fans of the 2001 director ought to give it a look. Amateurial it may be but there are flashes of real brilliance throughout.".

Mikis Theodorakis fans will love this movie for its music. Synoikia to Oneiro has few of the technical problems common among Greek movies of the time. I can't help feeling it a shame that Alexnadrakis hadn't directed more films. Let's not forget that movies in Greece at the time were made on shoestring budgets. This film is underrated.

	schema:reviewBody "This greek film moved me deeply like no other film of this particular cinematic era in postwar Greece more specifically the years between 19501960 the golden years of Finos Films and the greek cinema.Director and actor Alekos Alexandrakis made this film because he wanted to speak through it to communicate his thoughts about some truths that had to do with his own country and the people living in it.In contrast with the majority of greek films in the fifties which were mostly succesful comedies with very good cast and some romance or humorous plots Alexandrakis rejects all the typical approaches in a story that is true innovative and very close to the real environments and situations taking place in the film.Also the camera techniques frames and the atmosphere is very powerful and promising reminding us the characteristics of Italian Neorealism cinema. One great achievement is the collaboration between Alekos Alexandrakis director Tasos Livaditis theatrical writer and poet and two great personalities in the area of music production the musical composer Mikis Theodorakis and singer Grigoris Mpithikotsis. The song that plays along the movie is an overwhelming experience that makes us feel the antiheroes's emotions and desires. The story is that Rikos an exprisoner returns to his old neighborhood one of the poorest and underpriviledged areas in Athens. He then faces life as it is when his old lover Stefi has become friendly with some rich but hollow men in her try to escape from poverty and isolated home. Also his two friends Nekroforas Stefi's father and Asimakis face the same difficulties in this abandoned and unprosperous location.Alekos Alexandrakis made only two films in his whole life Synoikia to Oneiro and another one as codirector. This film has some sad events behind it and that is why it is such an important document in greek film's history. This one along with some other very special and different from the usual films like Drakos director Nikos Koundouros and movies like Stella or To Koritsi me ta Maura director Mixalis Kakogiannis are more raw critical to society and unacceptable from the politics of the country at the time.Censorship and political parties destroyed the film of Alexandrakis so much that he said he did not connect with it after all. He invested all of his money to this unique film making because his desire was to unveil the unfair situation that refugees from catastrophe of Middle Asia were living everyday isolated from the rest of the people as pariah and social outcast.Even though the film we watch is not the one Alexandrakis edited and that is a great casualty it transfers us a certain emotion. The way that noble people decide to be decent with an uncertain smile in their hearts.".

His humor is very crude in here another PG13 rating that is ludicrous but very funny in spots too. With that kind of humor it's easy to go over the line of good taste which he does on occasion. Overall however Murphy is remarkable as all these characters. I believe he plays seven in all. This is probably his biggest 'showcase' ever on film demonstrating his comedic talents.Even though this has a childlikeromancetype feel to it and a nice message about bias against fat people there are so many raunchy and downright nasty lines  mainly at the comedy club or the dinner table  that it's certainly not recommended for kids. This is a LONG way away from the original Jerry Lewis movie. Still....for adults this movie provides a lot of laughs.".

That is absolutely false not that the skinnies would ever buy that but I can at least try.Anyway to get to The Nutty Professor I found it to be one of the most sympathetic portrayals of fat people ever put on film. The only one that tops it is James Mangold's Heavy although the protagonist's weight wasn't all that was harming his wellbeing. The Nutty Professor did have some physical comedy involving fat that one could take as funny but I never felt that the jokes were  degrading. The main reason that I feel this was so sympathetic was that though he experienced life as a skinny stud he did decide to be a fat man at the end. One can chock this up to formulae but something that Sherrman Klump said at the end really touched me I could try to lose weight but I'm always going to be a fat man and you're just going to have to live with that. I think that a film where the screenwriters  who were bigoted would have said something like I'll lose weight without this stupid formula. That's not what happened though and I'm glad for that.".

Eddie Murphy cemented himself as a comedy legend with his performances in The Nutty Professor. I would go so far as to say that I've never seen two scenes funnier than the two Klump family dinner scenes. For Eddie Murphy to have pulled that off so seamlessly only showed his range and his talent. The two dinner scenes were gut busting hilarious and what made them so good is that you don't even realize that Eddie Murphy is playing all of those roles. The second dinner scene was particularly hilarious because of Professor Klump although he never says a word. He was so humiliated by his family's actions that he had the most mortified look on his face and a couple of times you could even see him attempt to cut his wrist with a butter knife. Priceless!!!".

It make me think he wasn't toilettrained properly.We get a fair amount of fart jokes in this flick but they work because they fit in the context of the scenes and the characters' motivations.  They make sense first THEN are funny rather than the other way around or just being silly because no one could think of anything funny to write. But overriding the gas glee is a thoughtful story about a fat man dealing with his weight and trying to find romance.  The special effects that gave Murphy his blubber are truly astounding.  It never looks fake.   And above all this is the incredible screen chemistry between Murphy's Professor Klump and Jada Pinkett Smith.  Smith is always genuine in her interest in Sherman and his bashfulness and sincerity are truly endearing. I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise.  I think you might too.".

	schema:reviewBody "The theme of each of us harboring a darker side just aching to get out and cause mischief is an old one but it truly flowered as literature in the age of Freud.  Never before had our animal impulses been so  well repressed.  The legs of easy chairs and sofas were dressed with tiny floorlength skirts.  Legs were impolite replaced by limbs.  A bull was a gentleman cow.  Virgins could be easily seduced because they didn't know the mechanics of what was going on.  Chicken parts became white meat and dark meat instead of youknowwhats.  Stevenson's Jeykll and Hyde were a perfect expression of this duality the contrast between what we were and what we pretended to be.  The theme has been enduringly popular because to some extent it's still an appropriate way to interpret culture.  And it's also a flexible theme one that can be changed to suit the times.  If Stevenson's story was about sex as was Wilde's Portrait of Dorian Gray then Jerry Lewis's 1963 movie of which this is a remake was about subservient conformity.  This one is about physical fitness and narcissism.Never in my life would I have dreamed that someone could remake a Jerry Lewis movie that made Lewis's humor seem subtly elegant but Murphy has managed to do it.  Eddie Murphy's movie is often extremely funny but about as understated as a train wreck.  I think the word to describe the hilarious dinner scenes that depend on open flatulence is raunch.  I don't know why we find it funny when someone farts.  There are cultures like the Samoans in which it is taken for granted as an ordinary biological act and receives no more attention than a sneeze does in our culture.  Murphy's entire movie is about at that level of raunchiness outdoing Lina Wertmuller's Seven Beauties which has a corpse farting outdoing Chaucer  outdoing everybody.Murphy has a fantasy in which he is taken to the ER filled up with gas and the staff are unable to stop his body from balooning.  He swells to a monstrous size enveloping one of the doctors the way an amoeba absorbs a food particle smashes upward through the building strides gigantically through the city streets while people scream and run reaches a hand through the upperfloor window of a hotel towards Jada Pinkett the way King Kong did with Fay Wray reaches PAST Pinkett and two huge sausagelike fingers delicately pluck the leg from a roast chicken next to Pinkett's bed.  But that's not enough gigantism.  Murphy gives this blimplike figure a spasm of intestinal gas which is released through the streets at hurricane force. A bum tries to strike a match and light a cigarette.  The city is vaporized by an explosion the size of a nuclear bomb's.  Okay that's all.  I think I'll quit while I'm ahead something Murphy chose not to do.Sherman Klump the fat man and the central figure is a likable character. One of the reasons for this is that he is one of the few actors who isn't constantly screaming with rage or laughter.  He speaks quietly and it's a relief what with all the bedlam around him.  But it's more than that. Murphy actually brings pathos to the role and without Disneyesque condescension.  What I mean is Murphy ACTS for a change instead of being Murphy.  He doesn't bring much to the alter ego Buddy Love except even more Murphy than we're used to.  There is a scene in which Sherman Klump brings his date  his first date  to a nightclub and the comic begins insulting Klump because of his weight.  Klump goes along with it genially at first but as the comic continues relentlessly humiliatingly Klump's accomodating smile fades and is replaced with an almost infinitely sad resignation.  He's been here before.  He does well by the character in other scenes too.The subtext is disturbing.  I don't know if Murphy realized exactly what he was getting hold of.  Smokers having become pariahs soundly trounced insulted and penalized for their weakness we've been seeking other targets and the searchlight has fallen on the obese the out of shape.  I can't help it said the Chairman of a sociology department but when I see somebody who is overweight I just think of him as weak.  That's a sociologist talking.  Insurance payments are higher for the overweight. Some airlines now charge double the usual fare because fat people make their seatmates uncomfortable.  I've seen bumper stickers in California No Fat Chicks and a red circle with a diagonal stripe drawn through the silhouette of an overweight woman.  I won't go into the many studies that have emerged from social psychology in the last decade or so showing the social handicaps suffered by the overweight.  I doubt that Murphy intended this movie to be so but it is a stinging critique of our pitiless society as well as a very funny movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This remake is watchable 90 of the time the scenes with the animals are not necessary it's surprising that PETA didn't go crazy on the filmmakers' behinds maybe they did but rationally they are not even real animals and this is just a movie.The in your face aspect is Buddy Love Eddie Murphy shouting and laughing over the top throughout most of his scenes it's extreme but it's obviously supposed to be. The movie turns into a type of alterego story Buddy is loud and crass and Professor Sherman Klump also Eddie Murphy is quiet reserved and respectful. The film is clever into making sure they are two complete opposites in personality as well as physicality.Even though this is a Comedy it isn't actually funny even the comic that cussed Sherman out is not even funny and Buddy getting his revenge with his jokesinsults against the comic was not even funny either on both parts it was just insults disguised as comedy real comedians can use insults but they have an actual point to what they are saying.The message in this motion picture is hard to find until the end when they make it clear that you should love yourself regardless of how you look.Sherman's family The Klumps are difficult to watch being that they are all unnatural due to most of them being played by Eddie Murphy in drag and what is up with Sherman inviting the love interest Carla Jada Pinkett Smith to have dinner with his family already knowing that they are rude people and it was verified by flatulence and swearing at the dinner table. One could argue that Sherman isn't perfect and that was a mistake but we see that him taking that potion already shows that he isn't perfect and is making mistakes do we really need to see him make more errors?!The pacing of the movie is fine some of the dialogue is too much but there's worse comedies out there.This is not one of Eddie Murphy's best movies but then again the majority of his films are rubbish the only decent films that he's done is the Beverly Hills Cop trilogy.".

The film is clever into making sure they are two complete opposites in personality as well as physicality.Even though this is a Comedy it isn't actually funny even the comic that cussed Sherman out is not even funny and Buddy getting his revenge with his jokesinsults against the comic was not even funny either on both parts it was just insults disguised as comedy real comedians can use insults but they have an actual point to what they are saying.The message in this motion picture is hard to find until the end when they make it clear that you should love yourself regardless of how you look.Sherman's family The Klumps are difficult to watch being that they are all unnatural due to most of them being played by Eddie Murphy in drag and what is up with Sherman inviting the love interest Carla Jada Pinkett Smith to have dinner with his family already knowing that they are rude people and it was verified by flatulence and swearing at the dinner table. One could argue that Sherman isn't perfect and that was a mistake but we see that him taking that potion already shows that he isn't perfect and is making mistakes do we really need to see him make more errors?!The pacing of the movie is fine some of the dialogue is too much but there's worse comedies out there.This is not one of Eddie Murphy's best movies but then again the majority of his films are rubbish the only decent films that he's done is the Beverly Hills Cop trilogy.";

	schema:headline " The Nutty Professor was nuts! I kinda like it. This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine.";
	schema:reviewBody "Eddie Murphy does a superb job playing multiple characters in this movie especially in the lead role of Sherman Klump a goodhearted obese university teacher who is tired of people making fun of his weight. Hoping to win the affection of a colleague Dr. Carla Purty Jada Pinkett Sherman will test a miraculous but risky experimental weightloss pharmaceutical formula on himself. However the results of experiment are not what he wanted as a dangerous obnoxious alter ego named 'Buddy Love' is trying to destroy Sherman once and for all. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say as much as I like the original 1963 Jerry Lewis's film of the same name for its odd sense of humor in the way it parodies author Robert Louis Stevenson's novel 'Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. I just thought 1996's 'The Nutty Professor' is a little more focus on the keeping the same type of a humor. In my opinion the original was a little uneven with its jokes. It introduce some short jokes yet never expand on it. For the most part the movie humor was all over the place ranging from childish somewhat dumb slapstick to too avartgarde to understand. Because of that many of the jokes fall flat. The remake at least kept the humor nearly everything in tone even if the scenes with the professor's extended family weren't really needed. Because of this the jokes in the 1996 version were better told. I understood what the dream sequences funny music montages and hilarious outtakes were trying to go for. Not only that but in a world of awful comedy remakes 'The Nutty Professor' also stands out as a film to watch when you want a good laugh even if some of the jokes were somewhat offensive gross and crude. For the most part the fat jokes and toilet humor kinda do hit the funny bone for me. I'm not the best of shapes myself however I'm willing to take a few jabs about my waistline as long as the movie has a good message. This movie does. There is some heart to this film. I truly understand why the likable professor wants to transform. I can't say the same with Jerry Lewis's clumsy character in the original. All I got from that movie is the fact that the somewhat annoying Professor wanted to boned his much younger student which is creepy. His drive for the change really lacks depth. Another thing that bugs me is how generic and tiresome Jerry's nerd character is as he used it in a similar role in 1958's film 'RockABye Baby'. Even his Buddy Love character doesn't seem new as it clearly parodying his onceupon Rat Pack buddy singer Dean Martin. Plus for a scifi formula plot that supposed to beef up the main character. Jerry Lewis's body doesn't really look any differ as Buddy Love. Don't get me wrong this remake also has its problems with the transforming like how does Sherman's body fat vanishes yet his skin somehow shrinking to fit in with his new body type but at least his Buddy Love seems like a new guy and the antagonist. This film really explore the conflict within man vs self. It was something that was missing from the first movie. Because of that Sherman's speech toward the end honestly does mean something while the Lewis version kinda doesn't as moments later the film contradict those statements when his girlfriend sneaks a few bottles before their honeymoon. Because of that the speech in the first movie toward the end doesn't seem so meaningful. This 1996 remake deserves more credit than it been getting. Some people had been dumping on it for years. Even original producer like Jerry Lewis abandoned it by 2009. Regardless of what Lewis and other critics thought. In my opinion it's as good as the original because of the amazing makeup magic and special visual effects at the time. The supporting cast in the new movie is also a lot better. I found Dave Chappelle's brief cameo as the bully comedian Reggie Warrington and Larry Miller's character of Dean Richmond to be just as funny even if it's a bit meanspirited. However Jada Pinkett is a bit weak in the role. She really doesn't stand out at all. Regardless of that the good hearted emotional music by composer David Newman makes up for the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Pinkett. No really give a listen to track 2 of Newman's original instrumental score. You will make you feel something. Overall While this movie is a bit raucous and crude it did create some laughs heart and poignancy than any Eddie Murphy movie has in quite in a long time. It was a Herculean task but somehow director Tony Shadyac and his crew succeed at it.".

For the most part I enjoy the humour in the movie although there are certainly too many fart jokes to the degree that it gets a bit irritating and the scene between Murphy and Dave Chappelle was unnecessary I also felt like Jason was a very underdeveloped character I enjoyed John Ales portrayal of him but we never get to know very much about him I would have liked to have gotten a clearer indication on the friendship between him and Klump. A redeeming aspect of this movie that you wouldn't normally see in these types of comedies is that there is a lot of heart the love story between Klump and Carla is very sweet and this is the engine that really gets the film running having something like this adds an extra layer to the character and makes him more relatable for the audience. Funny and well acted I would recommend the Nutty Professor to anyone looking for a good comedy.

Pinkett Smith adds not only beauty but a warm grace and dignity to an otherwise chaotic scene of runaway gerbils wild night spots and bizarre potions. David Chappelle meanwhile is entertaining as obnoxious standup comic Reggie Warrington. And of course there are the Klumps. Murphy outdoes himself as Sherman's dysfunctional farting family.

	schema:reviewBody "The Nutty Professor takes an old idea and fills it with great energy. The comedy is all over the map. It is silly and gross but also touching. On top of this is a great performance by Eddie Murphy who is able to create 7 characters. The pace of the film felt right. Murphy's professor begins as somewhat dull and a little depressed. This bit of seriousness and the university setting in a few minutes builds a solid story. Because of this the script can bring in pretty wild comedy without seeming too overdone. The special effects and dream sequences help make the Jekyll and Hyde story more believable and interesting. But even better is the terrific makeup which is so good that we forget that half of the cast is being played by Eddie Murphy. What I liked the most was that I really began to care about the professor especially when he is cruelly insulted by a nightclub comic. The Nutty Professor is not a masterpiece.

	onyx:emotionText "The Nutty Professor takes an old idea and fills it with great energy. The comedy is all over the map. It is silly and gross but also touching. On top of this is a great performance by Eddie Murphy who is able to create 7 characters. The pace of the film felt right. Murphy's professor begins as somewhat dull and a little depressed. This bit of seriousness and the university setting in a few minutes builds a solid story. Because of this the script can bring in pretty wild comedy without seeming too overdone. The special effects and dream sequences help make the Jekyll and Hyde story more believable and interesting. But even better is the terrific makeup which is so good that we forget that half of the cast is being played by Eddie Murphy. What I liked the most was that I really began to care about the professor especially when he is cruelly insulted by a nightclub comic. The Nutty Professor is not a masterpiece. Sometimes Murphy's Buddy Love gets too obnoxious and the gross humor gets a little stale. But the film had a tough hurdle to get over trying to improve on a mediocre Jerry Lewis film. Considering this I am amazed at how good this movie is.";

He plays overweight Prof. Sherman Klump who invents a potion that turns him into the cool but mean Buddy Love.Overall it seems that the movie is a big excuse to be crazy. And that's just what they do. Looking back on it they probably could have done without all the flatulence but that dream sequence was still a hoot. My favorite scene was either the parts with Dave Chappelle or the whole end sequence.Obviously they changed a number of things from the original version. Actually I must have been only eight when I saw the original version so I'll have to see it again. But either way this is a comedy classic. And it just goes to show that Eddie Murphy does best when he goes for straightforward clever comedy and doesn't degenerate into things like The Adventures of Pluto Nash or Daddy Day Care. A modern classic. Also starring Jada Pinkett before she added Smith to her name James Coburn and Larry Miller.".

Professor Sherman KlumpEddie Murphy is bright reserved and kind to everyone around him. Buddy Lovealso Murphy is slim buff and very obnoxious. When Sherman meets Carla PurtyJada Smith he would go to the extremes to have her. After the incident in The Scream Sherman becomes Buddy. And at The Scream Buddy puts ReggieDave Chappelle in his place with all the Your Mama's so fat... jokes. That scene left me in stitches. I enjoyed the characters in the movie including that nasty Dean RichmondLarry Miller Neccsary Roughness who is put in his place many times by Buddy and Alumni Harlan HartleyJames Corburn. This movie is funny all the way just don't use it as a weapon on the obese. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.".

Each of the family members has their own personality and quarks that make the otherwise pointless dinners very enjoyable and fun to watch. The special effects and makeup used in this film are also amazing and they portrayed very real looking qualities.Sherman Klump a very bright professor who is also dealing with an obesity issue finds himself falling for a colleague Miss Carla Perdy. Klump is convinced that he doesn't have a chance with Carla because of his appearance. He believes that he needs to change himself in order to get Carla to appreciate him so he decides to try a formula which he has been testing on hamsters on himself. The formula is a DNA restructuring chemical and when it is ingested by Klump he drops 300 pounds immediately. This skinny obnoxious and loud version of Professor Klump comes to be known as Buddy Love. Buddy is very critical of people especially obese people and he is determined to take over Klump's body and his life.This movies main objective is to show that you should be happy with yourself. The jokes in this film were also carefully thought through so they wouldn't offend most viewers especially overweight viewers. I found this movie to be more enjoyable than the original starring Jerry Lewis which has very few similarities with this version. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a little comic relief.".

My favorite type of movies are psychological horror movies. Favorites include Jacob's Ladder Mulholland Dr. Donnie Darko and in a similar realm Momento and Fight Club. I love seeing a good representation of the human mind on film and that is exactly what this film shows so well.It's about a college student Ryan Gosling who tells his shrink Ewan McGregor that he is going to kill himself on the stroke of midnight this Saturday leaving his shrink to enlist the help of his formerly suicidal girlfriend Naomi Watts to figure out why he wants to kill himself and how to stop him while his world falls apart.It's directed by Marc Forster of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland fame. The movie has been called pretentious shallow ridiculous bewildering absurd and empty by many reviewers. Personally I think that they didn't have the patience for it andor were put off by its extravagant visuals and cuts. I thought it was great and deserves much more credit than it has received.The movie's visual style is very interesting and jarring in a good way. It had me constantly saying to my girlfriend did you see that? Full of slight of the hand cameraediting tricks. Nearly everything in the movie is symbolic of other things or ideas in the movie. The acting is very good especially among the lesser characters. Everything in the movie feels so unreal but that is serves some purpose even if one couldn't know what it is right away. A second viewing would reveal many new things. In the end much of the movie is left up to interpretation and my girlfriend and I had a good conversation about our ideas on what things meant in the movie. After thinking about it for a day I'm pretty sure that I could explain everything in the movie even what the hell is up with Ewan McGregor's pants Why Gosling wanted to commit suicide and the twins and triplets.It was fun was figuring out what the rest of the movie meant after seeing its end the solution. The movie is like a code and the end is the decryption key. It differs from other sixth sense type surprise ending movies because everything you would see in the movie before the end would not act as a clue to what it all means or what the ending is. It's more like decrypting a diary than a problem with a solution to it.Basically any movie buff owes it to themselves to see this movie.

Those films succeed brilliantly because they manage to evoke a chilling impact on the viewer by the end. Stay on the other hand left me more confused than anything even though I understood what had happened  SPOILER ALERT  The film takes place in the consciousness of Ryan Gosling's character Henry who is teetering between life and death after a terrible car accident which killed the other passengers in his vehicle his mother his father and his soontobefiance. This is a horrendous tragedy what has happened to Henry if you can imagine being near death but yet aware that your 3 closest loved ones have been killed in an accident that you inadvertently caused his tire blew out  this is a monumentally sad thing to have happen to you but yet this sadness was not effectively conveyed at the end of the movie because I was instead confused about what had transpired and I had to think about it in depth afterwards to realize that Ewan McGregor's character Sam who seemed to be the main character of the movie was also part of Henry's semiconscious hallucinatory state.There were just too many scenes in the film that Henry didn't appear in although McGregor and the alwaysfantastic Naomi Watts are perfectly cast in their 'roles' as is Gosling. In retrospect I think this is what caused the confusion and left me not feeling the impact that should have been felt at the realization of what had just transpired.  END OF SPOILER. I don't like making comparisons but The Sixth Sense for instance was hugely successful because it was written in such a way that it included the viewer in Bruce Willis' shocking realization at the end it has the impact it does even on repeat viewings! because of the masterful way it's staged.What I'm saying is while Stay is a noble and ambitious effort and still worthy in my opinion of a couple of viewings it's not enough to have a movie that becomes a second movie once you've seen it  the movie has to stand on its own the FIRST time the impact has to be there the first time or there's no genuine payoff for the viewer. I love a movie that haunts you afterwards and makes you think that's the best kind of film but there does have to be that impact the first time that allimportant creeping sense of realization that makes your eyes go wide and gives you goosebumps.".

Why don't you all stop worrying about whether or not you get it or not. Movies are art and art is open to different interpretations. There is no right or wrong and to steal a quote that I loved I can't remember exactly Bad Art is even better because it documents human failure sorry that quote wasn't really necessary and didn't fit my point exactly but I was just dying to use it.Anyway my main interpretation of the movie is to show the intricacies of the human brain. A man went through a serious shocktrauma going unconscious allowing his subconscious to come out and play the movie demonstrates the power of the subconscious pulling out stored tidbits of information from the brain received by the human senses. The movie documents not the man's physical struggle to stay alive but his mental one. With his brain setting up a maze of obstacles to get past to regain consciousnesslife. In this maze of his mind I think his actual self represents death or the coming of death and he is in the form of the psychologist mcgregor trying to work his way through the maze to fight to stay alive. I think this is why we saw the movie makes such a point of showing us that they are the same person in his mind I think he has chosen mcgreggor as his self because in his subconscious he knows that in the real life mcgreggor is trying to save him. As for the powers it is his mind of course he is able to control what is happening. Leaving one end untangled the de ja vu with mcgregor and watts at the end. To go with the flow of this interpretation that the movie is demonstrating the power of the human mind perhaps subconsciously the mans dream was able to affect the other people involved through psychic powers I'm not sure on this this is a tough cookie.Of course another interpretation of this movie could possibly be two parrelel worlds colliding through an event car crash I don't know for sure I can only make my own interpretations and I like this movie because of the different ways it can be interpreted unlike most Hollywood movies which leave no room for the imagination.

In fact if you're paying attention you can pretty much figure out mostly what the situation is before you get too far into the movie. Unlike some of the worst examples of this genre i.e. The Sixth Sense Stay is not a film that hides the ball but instead presents you with characters and a storyline and asks you to draw your own conclusions.That said there isn't an obvious solution to the movie. While you may be able to explain the film after viewing it which is trickier that it will seem at first you may realize that the real brilliance of this film is in the levels of its narrative. At its core it is a basic psychological thriller. Simultaneously and perhaps subconsciously it also meditates on weighty issues of reality and identity consider what the imperative Stay means to different characters at different points in the film and it's almost like you're watching an entirely different movie than you originally thought.Finally the visuals in this movie provide their own context and narrative regarding the fragile nature of human memory and perception. This is the best looking movie I've seen in a long time and the fact that it's combined with such a great story and cast makes this a rare treat.If there is a weak link here it's probably Gosling who I think missed some opportunities to really dig in with his character and creep us out. Still his acting is better than that of most of Hollywood's garbage these days.Final verdict if you want a smart and unsettling film that will spur a serious discussion watch this.

I am so glad that I watched it because this film left me thinking for ages.This is a thriller about a psychiatrist which I happen to be one trying to help a depressed  suicidal patient. The film twists unexpectedly all the time without getting bizarre. The visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack created the eerie atmosphere which gave me creeps. The best thing about this film is that the film keeps you in suspense throughout the film without the use of sudden loud noises gore or scary scenes. Everything in the film seemed so every day life to me anyway and yet it keeps you on the edge all the time. The interspersed scenes of unrelated objects creates suspense in a way that is surreal. In the ending I was totally surprised at that happened. I had to really think a lot to figure out what happened. Usually when I don't understand a film I say it is bad bad bad but for this film it leaves me wanting to find out more about it.I strongly recommend anyone to watch this film!".

The story is not completely original it draws small inspirations from such films as Identity Fight Club 12 Monkeys and even a little Sixth Sense. But don't let that deter you if you did not care for those films! Stay is pure cinematic genius from beginning to end.Marc Forster is probably one of the greatest upandcoming directors of our time. What he's done with this film will make any cinephile drool with delight. There are so many innovative camera techniques that your eyes experience a sensory overload of pure genius. One of these trademarks is a technique where he transitions from one setting to another while still making you think you're in the previous scene for a few seconds. For example in a scene where we see Ewen McGregor's character in a shop the camera then switches views to the glass door of the shop which we see another important character looking through it. The door opens and the character walks through at which point we realize he was going through a subway door in a totally different scene. Forster uses this technique as well as many other amazing tricks throughout and it's no less brilliant every time we see it them.As I said the plot will remind you of a few other movies yet the actual twisted ending and the avenue which Forster and the writers take us there is so completely different and interesting that this film simply must be seen.McGregor did a fantastic job as psychiatrist Sam Foster and Gosling was unbelievably realistic and convincing as the mentally unstable patient. Of special note is Bob Hoskin's almost cameo role as Foster's friend Leon. His character is so sympathetic and believable that it almost made me cry.As usual with such films as last years The Jacket this movie was marketed as some supernatural horror film but it's by no means a horror film. In fact I went into this movie dreading all the jump scenes and disturbing weirdness that would make me run from my car to my front door at night but really this is a straight up thriller in the vein of 12 Monkeys and Sixth Sense minus the ghostly appearances and dead people.If you consider yourself someone who is tired of Hollywood's bigbudget slambang drivel and want to actually have your brain scrambling with thoughts throughout an entire film RUN do not walk and see this film.".

I just cannot believe how complex this movie is. It had so many levels to it. Mark Forster is an absolute genius.The plots basically centers around two characters Sam FosterEwan McGregor and Henry LethamRyan Gosling. Sam is a psychiatrist who deals mostly with neurotic stockbrokers but at the beginning of the movie he is filling in for one of his colleagues. That is how he comes to meet Henry. Henry is a very strange Art student who idolizes this artist named Tristan Reveur. Reveur was a magnificent artist who burned all his paintings and committed suicide on his 21st birthday he actually told people he was going to do this on when he was 18. Henry decides that he wants to leave the same mark and tells Sam that he is going to commit suicide on midnight of his 21st birthday. It then becomes Sam's job to try and stop him but during that promise Sam must also fight to keep his own grip with reality.This movie will mess with your head throughout the entire film. It is a very artistic film and the whole concept of art painting drama literature etc. holds the plot together. The most amazing part of this film however is the complexity of it. I still cannot believe how Forster was able to tie all these characters together the way he did it really was a work of art. By the time you reach the end of this film you will be utterly amazed. In my opinion this is a true masterpiece. I'm going to leave this with my favorite quote from the movie Bad art is more tragically beautiful than good art because it documents human failing.  Tristan Reveur".

I just cannot believe how complex this movie is. It had so many levels to it. Mark Forster is an absolute genius.The plots basically centers around two characters Sam FosterEwan McGregor and Henry LethamRyan Gosling. Sam is a psychiatrist who deals mostly with neurotic stockbrokers but at the beginning of the movie he is filling in for one of his colleagues. That is how he comes to meet Henry.

	schema:reviewBody "STAY is a strange bird of a movie one that you must be rested and in the mood for to watch and one that asks that you forget the usual linear storyline and stay alert every minute. Directed by Marc Forster Monster Ball Finding Neverland and the upcoming The Kite Runner and based on a story and screenplay by David Benioff Troy The 25th Hour and the upcoming The Kite Runner! STAY is more a mindbending visual excursion that explores some dark psychological questions dealing with life death suicide occult and a mlange of all of these.The opening of the film is a twisted visual experience that has to do with a car crashing on a bridge fire and a body  all given during the opening credits. We then meet psychiatrist Dr. Sam Foster Ewan McGregor as he encounters a college student patient Henry Lethem Ryan Gosling whom he is seeing for his colleague the emotionally exhausted Dr. Beth Levy Janeane Garofalo. Hesitant to work with a 'substitute psychiatrist' Henry eventually tells Sam he is planning to commit suicide that Saturday at midnight a reenactment of his painter idol's absurd life. Sam's artist girlfriend Lila Naomi Watts was herself a suicide attempt rescued by Sam and offers her help in dealing with Sam's patient. Sam also gleans advice from his mentor the blind Dr Patterson Bob Hoskins and after numerous attempts to contact his associate Beth for information Sam strikes out on his own in an attempt to understand Henry before he destroys himself. He looks up Henry's mother Kate Burton whom Henry says is dead discovers when Henry meets Dr Patterson that Henry claims Patterson is his father and is also dead. Ultimately Sam engages the services of a mental institution run by Dr Ren BD Wong and gains the promise that the institution will put a hold on Henry so that he will be unable to commit suicide.In the midst of this race Sam's world begins to crumble people don't make sense stories clash and Sam tumbles around in a state closely resembling madness until the final frames when the entire situation of the film is made clear. Nothing is as it appears when dealing with the thread that separates life and death. The script is clumsy the camera work is distractingly of kilter little gimmicks are used to the extreme and the tiny roles of supporting characters hardly merit the gifted actors such as Hoskins Burton and Garofalo. Ryan Gosling is again tossed into a role that is starchy and unidimensional and despite his fine work his character remains aloof. McGregor and Watts do the best they can with the script but end up becoming tropes wandering in from other similar stories.So why give the film 810 score? Because despite all the defects it does engage the mind and forces the viewer to set aside the general principles of understanding and just release the mind to a crazy ride. That is healthy film making and deserves attention. Grady Harp".

However Stay is absolutely different from the foregoing movies being a kind of Sixth Sense or Jacob's Ladder with a David Lynch style. The screenplay is very intriguing and challenging with weird situations and there is a catch in the end with Sam Foster vision when the truth is finally disclosed. The beautiful cinematography gives the sensation of a dream or nightmare to the viewer. This compelling film is attractive and deserves to be watched more than once.

But without altering this plot as written director Marc Forster has invented an editing style combined with a rigorous control of transitions and point of view to create nothing less than a parallel plot to the film in which the professor must contend with the horror of his own descent into fullblown psychosis.Since the director conveys this parallel plot entirely through visual means and within the point of view of the hero of the story its consequences are all the more disconcerting and we feel the terror of the realization of losing one's mind more acutely than in any previous screen depiction of madness I have seen.Much as the young artist's psychotic identity implicitly consumes the identity of his psychiatrist so does the visual plot consume the overt written plot of the film like an unconscious motivation that overcomes a conscious one.

The whole movie takes place from the perspective of what's going on in his head. His subconscious and various other mental processes and brain activity is going to work which constitutes most of what you see in the movie. That explains all the nonreal events that occur from time to time throughout the movie. Nothing too clever because again as we find out it was all not reality. It would have been quite the trick if it in fact was reality and somehow they had an explanation where it all made sense. But in that case one could argue that there would be no real theoretical value to the movie.Anyway what the dying character is doing subconsciously is pulling in people surrounding him from the outside or in reality and has represented them as characters in his dreamstate. The main character Ewan McGregor in his mind is the psychologist trying to save him from dying parallel to that in reality the person of an entirely different form who is trying to save his life from the injuries of his car accident.The movie depicts events that set out to question or challenge the state of reality in our minds what is real how what isn't real can transcend with what is real and vice versa. Basically the whole life is but a dream spill.But alas where have we seen this before? Well unfortunately this movie joins the masses of other realitymindbending movies i.e. The Matrix The Jacket Secret Window The Butterfly Effect that set out to get the wheels turning over the true nature of our existence in conjunction with reality and fantasy dreams and perception as a whole.For that reason as well constructed and beautifully executed as this movie was on an aesthetic level I found nothing new from the movie and all of the mindbending events simply being chalked up to the kids brain wigging out while he is in the process of dying left me feeling extremely disappointed and almost used. In all honestly in the back of my mind I kind of gathered this is what the movie was all about but desperately indulged in the hope of wanting there to be something more to the ending than again it just pretty much being all a dream  which is something I consider to be the cheapest and lamest way to culminate the events of a plot.In the end there wasn't more to it...just strange events that turn out to be the kids fading mind and a few symbolic events that ONCE AGAIN propose the speculation of reality.My position on this movie is don't buy into the overused science. This movie is not all that clever or the work of art that a lot of reviewers are deeming it. This movie is just a somewhat satisfying and intriguing experience until the ending hits and what once stimulated the senses to a degree now feeds it dog food.".

Also Ryan Gosling was compelling as the mysterious suicidal young guy. Unfortunately Ewan McGregor and his pants were badly miscast and Naomi Watts is forgettable.And the ending. Cop out.

It does however take some work on the part of the viewer to reap the full benefits of it's brilliance. Here's my take.Ryan Gosling plays Henry an art student out on the town with his soon to be fianc and his parents. He has an engagement ring in his pocket you won't know that until later though and he is the driver of the car that is carrying them all across the Brooklyn Bridge. They are involved in a fiery crash. This happens in the first few minutes of the film. What follows is the nightmarish moments it could be minutes it could be seconds between life and death. A place you cannot Stay.At the core of this film is guilt and loss. Henry begging fogive me asking himself if he is responsible for the deaths of his parents and his girlfriend. He's slipping away and it's not peaceful. The shock at the end of this movie was only outdone by it's sadness will you marry me?. It is brilliantly told and deliberately confusing until the end to great affect because dying is not neat and clean. We're left here to imagine to the best of our ability what goes through the mind of someone who dies of a head injury in a traumatic car crash. It is difficult to imagine unless you've experienced it yourself what goes through your mind when you think you're dead. Or you're actually dying. This movie comes about as close as anything I have ever seen. The cast does the story huge justice. Ryan Gosling Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are excellent. The director writer and editor painted a Van Gough. Bravo!".

Here's my take.Ryan Gosling plays Henry an art student out on the town with his soon to be fianc and his parents. He has an engagement ring in his pocket you won't know that until later though and he is the driver of the car that is carrying them all across the Brooklyn Bridge. They are involved in a fiery crash. This happens in the first few minutes of the film. What follows is the nightmarish moments it could be minutes it could be seconds between life and death. A place you cannot Stay.At the core of this film is guilt and loss. Henry begging fogive me asking himself if he is responsible for the deaths of his parents and his girlfriend. He's slipping away and it's not peaceful. The shock at the end of this movie was only outdone by it's sadness will you marry me?. It is brilliantly told and deliberately confusing until the end to great affect because dying is not neat and clean. We're left here to imagine to the best of our ability what goes through the mind of someone who dies of a head injury in a traumatic car crash. It is difficult to imagine unless you've experienced it yourself what goes through your mind when you think you're dead. Or you're actually dying. This movie comes about as close as anything I have ever seen. The cast does the story huge justice. Ryan Gosling Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are excellent. The director writer and editor painted a Van Gough. Bravo!";

In both the central figure is initially unaware of his power to affect impact and alter anything and everything within this newly found or rather created world. In fact they are merely lost souls trying to find answers from the cast of characters their mind has either created or that they have molded from reality or memory.In Stay as the functions of Henry's brain decline and the transition between worlds is completed the focus returns to reality and the perspective of other conscious minds. Unaware of the roles they played in helping Henry cross over their lives return to normal. In Lathe of Heaven is Henry Latham an anagram of sorts? hmmm one of the characters becomes painfully aware that his being as well as all others in his world is tied to the existence of the central character.Thoughtprovoking symbolism masterful transition effects artistic blending of architecture and scenery against the surreal backdrop of a diminishing mind all make this a must see must have film.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie along the guidelines of Identity and Fight Club is a terrific psychological thriller. The subtle nuances within the movie the doubles  triplicates of things like the twins triplets the 2121 on top of the ambulance alluding to the connection between Henry and Sam andor Lila and Athena  to Henry's 21st birthday it also alludes to the repetition within the story as Henry's mind is playing things over and over while his brain is dying. At the end it almost seems like Henry and Athena are reincarnated within Sam and Lila. The hints here and there still give you no clue until the end about what's really going on the crying baby the voices he hears the woman saying He's just a kid the couple saying He's not going to make it the child asking if he was going to die the piano ominously hanging above like a death trap his artwork the lost ring...everything. It seemed also that he was trying to make amens while he was dying curing his father's blindness and that he wanted to be forgiven because he thought he had done something wrong. The people are puzzle pieces that he puts together in his story of his life simply because they are there and maybe a little bit more than that it's for you to decide. And I believe that Henry's shooting himself was his way of choosing to STAY or go during his near death experience he obviously chooses to go. Lila almost seems like the other choice though she says There's just too much goddamn beauty to quit. It's like she's the decision to stay while Henry's suicidal thoughts are his decision to go. It's funny you always hear of near death experiences but it's strange to hear of a death experience. This is an excellent movie that I believe everyone should see it will truly make you think differently about life and death as a whole.".

Although this was amongst the first of Disney's PG rated films it has more of the feel of the G films their studio turned out in the70s i.e. Freaky Friday The World's Greatest Athlete than the PG films that came out in the early 80s i.e. Watcher in the Woods Tron Something Wicked This Way Comes. Because of Disney's backing Midnight Madness obviously had a large budget.  A huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that.  But zaniness a madcap scavenger hunt and spectacular visual style weren't enough to save the film from being an enormous flop...  A failure at the box office most of us were introduced to the film on HBO in the early 80s back in the days when the same films would be shown 29 times a week Oh wait  they still do that!.  Essentially HBO did for this film what CBS did for The Wizard of Oz  they created an enormous cult audience for a sugarysweet megaflop....The biggest problem that makes this a bad film is that there's too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out  Eddie Deezen's squad don't even have names!  The blue team although they're the villains are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters with the exception of the girl who can't act  doesn't have enough to do. Harold perfectly played to the hilt by Stephen Furst is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film.  The other standout character is goofoff Melio played with tons of charm by nowdirector Andy Tennant.  Although thenDr. Pepper spokesman David Naughton was supposed to be the star his character often comes off obnoxious particularly when pitted against his brother Adam Michael J. Fox.  While everyone has favorite characters I don't think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that Furst and Fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about.Despite the film's many flaws and bad actors most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun  and fun on the set equals fun on the screen.  Come on what college jock doesn't dream of floating around in a beer vat and what zoftig girl doesn't dream of stealing the show at the local discotech... er... I guess it would be at a rave nowadays...  Campy squeakyclean fun for anyone who was young in the 70s  80s it's only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves.  But where the hell's the widescreen DVD release with the commentary trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco?".

We didn't have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us and well and the rest was natural.    It was our first major film role and we had a blast making it.  We were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from The Disney Studio in Burbank and the Hollywood California area.  We grew up in front of the TV and probably some of the first generation of latchkeykids.  Twenty years later we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days.  We don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives.  Carol is a Chiropractor in our home town of Southern California and I am in the Information Technology field in Georgia.I maybe bias but I thought the film was cute clean and fun.  We knew it wasn't a master piece or an Oscar nominee however it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together.  It's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts.  And no one was more exited when it was released on video as Carol and I were.  Carol found it at Kmart for 6.99!  Now that's an inexpensive way to capture one's memories and share it with others.Sincerely Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn The Thompson Twins".

Furst is hilarious as the overweight slob Harold whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues leads to a gooey mess. Movies like this aren't made anymore. These days movies have to have an edginess to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. Go back to the days when the good guys led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly conflicted. So dump all serious pretensions and go back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS . . .".

He has a team of Jocks nerds fatties average kids and of course Flounder's team who are the bad guys. But this movie has no black and white. There are many shades of gray. Adam is not the altruistic hero with no faults. He treats Alex P. like crap. AND Flounder is the way he is because of pressures from his Dad and a cranky stomach. The jocks play dirty but so does everyone else! This movie rocks! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! Johnny's Obese Male Child? Can you write a better clue? This stuff is gold Jerry! GOLD! Maybe I am from a different generation but I love movies that seem farfetched but still have roots in reality. This never happened...but it could. EeeeeGypt.... EEEE....Easter Bunny....Easter Parade! Oh and watch for a young Paul Rubens still working on that Pee wee character. PS That Devra Clinger WASis HOT! She must have been one bad actress not to work in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS MOVIE!".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film for the first time not too long ago.  What I found was a nostalgia trip to the early eighties with the extremely happy disco laden theme song and the 2 roller skating beauties with nice smiles in the opening credits.  There was an innocence and sense of fun to this movie that is lacking in today's movies.  The film doesn't try to be too clever for it's own good or cynical which I actually found to be refreshing.The plot centers around a scavenger hunt around L.A. set up by a future Bill Gates type named Leon who is adorned by his lovely assistants.  The invitees for this challenge are 5 color coded groups representing every campus comedy stereotype Jocks Nerds Alienated girls the protagonists and the villains.

What I found was a nostalgia trip to the early eighties with the extremely happy disco laden theme song and the 2 roller skating beauties with nice smiles in the opening credits.  There was an innocence and sense of fun to this movie that is lacking in today's movies.  The film doesn't try to be too clever for it's own good or cynical which I actually found to be refreshing.The plot centers around a scavenger hunt around L.A. set up by a future Bill Gates type named Leon who is adorned by his lovely assistants.  The invitees for this challenge are 5 color coded groups representing every campus comedy stereotype Jocks Nerds Alienated girls the protagonists and the villains.

Midnight Madness is one of kind. From the ridiculous opening montagemusic to the Bonaventure HOtel I was hooked. Leon made us all feel so young and carefree. One question though how did he have those two hot hookers with him all the time? And how did have the timemoney to arrange such an event? The cast is top notch. David Naughton is at his best here. His tight yellow sweatshirt is disturbing. His little brother Michael J Foxin his first starring role is a real brat. There is also Naughton's love interest and a dork and the obligatory black dude in a fisherman's hat on the yellow team. Michael J Fox does bad things like try and steal cups of beer at the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery and runs away to Flounder's van. Flounder's team gives us the most comedy. What exactly is the deal with the blond on that team? Is she dating Flounder? Or Melio? Or Blade? Yes the Mexican gentleman's name is blade. The other guy on the Flounder team has the best lines of the movie i won't pomp them here. The Meat Machine team is a bunch of drunks. My personal favorite is Armpit. But the silent black man is great too. The other two teams are 4 nerds and 4 lesbianstwo of which are 450 lb twins.You know the ending from the start. But that doesn't matter. This is the 80's megenre at its finest. Don't rent this one BUY it. and Buy it now.".

Furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad Why can't you just accept me for who I am?  His dad looks over his obese slovenly frame and gives a simple oneword response  Yuck!And Deezen... well he's a show in himself.  As a latterday Jerry Lewis he stumbles around wades through minigolf ponds puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having Maggie Roswell fall for him.  My hero.As for the film it's typical early'80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a citywide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus the jocks the nerds the rich kids the feminists or the group made up of a little of each. Who wins?  Who cares you'll have a lot of fun watching Disney Pictures' first foray into PG territory before creating Touchstone Pictures.Seven stars.

This is a must see movie for anyone in love with the 80's Another great 80's movie is The Secret to My Success also with Michael J Fox";

	schema:reviewBody "This is basically a goofball comedy with somewhat odd pacing due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens it was their first filmFox had previously been in a short lived TV series and a TV movie.Since the movie is basically a racescavenger hunt type movie like Cannonball Run It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World or more recently Rat Race there are no main characters. Instead there are groups of characters splitting the screen time and allowing for tons of miniplots. Usually these kind of movies are a way to cram the maximum amount of stars or semistars onto a film.This one has teams with one being the primary team which Fox belongs to who are the only characters to be developed. Their plot is more of a stereotypical Disney affiar about a college boy not paying attention to his younger brother who he thinks of as a lazy punk. Since they are forced on a team together along with the older brother's girlfriend they are forced to work together. Since this is the main plot it gets the most screen time.Some of the other silly plots stand out. The Blue Team is about an overweight rich kid whose dad just wants him and his misfit friends out of the house. They end up with a cool custom van which had an onboard computer in 1980! to instantly solve the riddles plus play video games with the time saved! One member Stephen Furst went on to play Dr. Axelrod on St. Elsewhere and later was on Babylon 5. I'll also admit that I still laugh when Barf while trying to unscramble a word a'la Scrabble comes up with Fagabefe? This is much funnier than Bart Simpson's Qwyjibo in my opinion.The other three teams have plots that are somewhat linked together. The green team is a bunch of frat boys with mostly beer jokes which climaxes into a breakdown for one when the hunt leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They get a chance to harass the red team with two feminists and two funloving twins. The white team of nerds are lead by Eddie Deezen who was previously in Grease but went on to play a critical computer geek role in Wargames and later Tim Conway's sidekick in some of the Dorf series.If you grew up in the 80's then there are some classic moments in the movie that bring back memories. The early video arcade from back when they were cool is always a plus in my mind. Look for Paul Reubens and his quartershooting guns. There is also a miniature golf course and a roller disco.The movie is actually an okay family movie simply because profanity is almost nonexistant and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The odd pacing thanks to the yellow team's cheesy dramatic moments will put parents to sleep while their kids can giggle at giant melons at Fat Burger oh they actually have a special melon platter? That must be it right?".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not a scary movie it's like a weird version of Clueless. It brings me back to when I was in grade school and wanted to be apart of high school. And I always wondered if this was like what my future would hold meeting new people. Witches? The plot is kinda basic Evil Dawson's Creek. D Sarah is the new girl in town who is trying to fit in with very rude and snobby people at her new school. You can tell from the beginning that there is something very special about her. There are three girls Nancy who is the white trash scary goth girl Bonnie who has severe burn marks all over her back and Rachelle who is constantly picked on by a racist school girl they notice Saraa and they happen to be witches who need a forth in their group guess who that is? Sarah! She is also noticed by the high school jock jerk who uses girls and treats them like whores. She is first frightened by the girls mostly Nancy and leaves. She goes to see Chris but when she refuses a private invite to his house he spreads a nasty rumor around school about her night with him.

She also goes as deep as to invoke the spirit of their beliefs of Manoe and becomes crazy. Sarah's love spell on Chris was to only get him to like her and apologize but it turns on her very badly when he becomes too obsessed with her. Sarah knows that things are bad and decides not to participate her magics with the group and they turn on her badly. To the point of threatening her life.It's a strange movie it's entertaining to watch and the acting is pretty decent. You really get into the movie. I'm not sure if you could call it scary. But like the critics said It's Carrie meets Clueless. It's a fun teen movie. So if you liked those movies you might like this. 810".

And I always wondered if this was like what my future would hold meeting new people. Witches? The plot is kinda basic Evil Dawson's Creek. D Sarah is the new girl in town who is trying to fit in with very rude and snobby people at her new school. You can tell from the beginning that there is something very special about her. There are three girls Nancy who is the white trash scary goth girl Bonnie who has severe burn marks all over her back and Rachelle who is constantly picked on by a racist school girl they notice Saraa and they happen to be witches who need a forth in their group guess who that is? Sarah! She is also noticed by the high school jock jerk who uses girls and treats them like whores. She is first frightened by the girls mostly Nancy and leaves. She goes to see Chris but when she refuses a private invite to his house he spreads a nasty rumor around school about her night with him. She goes back to the girls and they discover how much more powerful they are with Sarah. They perform simple spells at first flying love spells changing appearances.

The only person of who I didn't like the acting was Fairuza Balk. Her voice is in this movie not exactly the nicest voice to listen to. But she ds have some good moments in this movie. Director Andrew Fleming who's budget for The Craft wasn't so big did a good job. The movie is at least in the first half a good combination between a thriller and a comedy in the end all the comedy disappears the atmosphere darkens and we get a fairly exciting thriller. Some of the special effects are very good. The music was o.k. but except for a few scenes nothing more. If you have the chance to watch this try it! The movie will certainly not appeal to everyone the movie is more for teenagers and people in their early twenties I think. Many older people won't appreciate this film so much.

	schema:reviewBody "The strangest phenomena in film today and I have seen a couple are films which when you see them you think they are merely OK but on second viewing they get better third viewing even better and so on. FORBIDDEN KINGDOM comes to mind seen it about 8 times but there are dozens like this. This has something to do with human nature I suspect an innate desire to criticize even where criticism is not called for. I believe this film falls into this category. Every now and then I watch it again and each time I find less to dislike and each time I fall a little deeper under the director's spell. But that is the key to this film aside from camera angles and lighting the story just builds and builds the suspense just builds and builds and not only is the ending pitchperfect but even the second ending or anticlimax is fun as well. I have seen a lot of these kinds of films but very few that I can make these claims about. I saw the film again just prior to writing this review and even though I knew what was coming I disappeared into the story. Another odd factoid is that for whatever reason this film may have captured Neve Campbell and Robin Tunney at the peak of their craft sorry for the pun. Tunney's charismatic sweetness works best when it plays off against something darker and Campbell has never been scarier in her career. She never gets to the point of eating the furniture  which would be overdoing it  yet you the viewer cannot help but believe her when depending on the point in the film you are at she alternatively threatens to kill you and then asks forgiveness for that same threat. I believe time will be kinder to this film than the current IMDb rating.".

	onyx:emotionText "The strangest phenomena in film today and I have seen a couple are films which when you see them you think they are merely OK but on second viewing they get better third viewing even better and so on. FORBIDDEN KINGDOM comes to mind seen it about 8 times but there are dozens like this. This has something to do with human nature I suspect an innate desire to criticize even where criticism is not called for. I believe this film falls into this category. Every now and then I watch it again and each time I find less to dislike and each time I fall a little deeper under the director's spell. But that is the key to this film aside from camera angles and lighting the story just builds and builds the suspense just builds and builds and not only is the ending pitchperfect but even the second ending or anticlimax is fun as well.

It is one of those films that it doesn't matter if you've watched it 100 times you still reach for it when you feel like watching a film.  The actings brilliant especially from Fairuza Bulk.  This was the first time I'd ever seen her in a film and she completely blew me away with her brilliant performance.  This film also has some funny moments e.g She's gonna cry then I'm gonna cry we're all gonna cry! You really have to watch the film to find that amusing.  Can I also say any film with Skeet Ulrich in it must be worth watching!!! Lol.Go and watch this film you will regret it if you don't!!!Kat xxx".

	schema:headline " Nancy is Burning with Fear and Pain";
	schema:reviewBody "A couple of things were popular in the late nineties. The sudden success of Scream made horror movies not only popular again but hip for the first time in years. Suddenly the genre that had been masked madmen hacking up teens for a decade had to have sharp scripts and realistic intheknow protagonists. Around the same time a rising awareness of new age pagan religions made witch a hot buzzword. Witches weren't greenskinned cackling hags anymore. They could be normal people. These two interests intersected with The Craft a poppy teen and femmeoriented horror flick that attempted to bring the witch concept into the present day.Set at a catholic school in fashionable California the film follows Sarah a girl with a history of mental problems who has just moved into town. She's quickly dubbed an outcast and befriends a trio of other strange girls The gothy Nancy the shy Bonnie and teased Rochelle. The three girls fancy themselves witches in the neopagan sense of the word and think Sarah might be the fourth corner of their circle. The fourth girls quickly excel at magic using their abilities to better their high school lives. However things quickly get out of hand especially thanks to the unbalanced Nancy and the girls start to turn on each other.The Craft is notable for focusing on female characters a rare feat in any genre but horror especially. The girls aren't your typical horror film victims. Instead the script makes the effort to get inside each one's head. Nancy and the others are at the bottom of the high social ladder. Nancy's Gothic fashion seems to be in response to her home life with a trashy mother and an abusive stepfather. Boys tell lies about her at school and her interest in witchcraft steams from a rather literal desire to take back control of her life. Bonnie's body is covered in burns leading to her shyness. Rochelle's ethnicity makes her a target for bullying from the school's resident queen bee. When their power grows they naturally use their abilities to improve their lives. Who can blame them? The Craft tries to frame itself as a story about responsibilities how power corrupts etcetera but the film is far more successful in its early half when the premise is played for wishfulfillment.That's mostly due to the mostly strong cast. The movie made Fairuza Balk who previously had experiences with witches in Return to Oz and The Worst Witch something of a cult icon. She's the center of the film and gives a powerhouse performance. Nancy is burning with fear and pain all of it exploding out as righteous anger. While the script isn't beyond playing her outburst as typical teenage angst Balk deepens the role making Nancy a real human being. Neve Campbell develops some honest anguish over her condition and when she heals herself has fun tramping it up. Rachel True works well as the first of the girls to notice they might have gone too far.The three are strong enough that they completely overshadow Robin Tunney as lead character Sarah. Tunney isn't bad but she's also playing the least interesting character in the film. While Nancy is speeding a car through red lights magically changing them to green Sarah is chastising them like a real fuddyduddy. Clearly the other girls go too far especially once they become murderous but you can't deny they're having more fun. Making the hero so comparatively uninteresting is The Craft's biggest problem.The style of The Craft immediately marks it as a product of the late nineties. The soundtrack is filled out with quasipop punk that was quasipopular at the time like Sponge Heather Nova Letters to Cleo and Love Spit Love whose cover of How Soon is Now would later be used as the theme song for witchcentric TV show Charmed. Andrew Fleming directs with rockvideo smoothness only occasionally overdoing it like during Fairuza's murderous freakout or a flying nightmare. The film's digital effects which include morphing a girl's fingers into snakes got a lot of press at the time. They come off as very dated today. The intensity the final witches duel produces has more to do with Fairuza's crazed acting then the melodramatic direction or cheesy effects.The Craft became a sleeper hit upon release meaning that its story and themes resonated with an audience. The film no doubt led to a rise in interest in witchcraft and neopaganism. It also probably led to hip witch characters being a common character on supernatural soaps like Buffy and Charmed. The film holds up astonishingly well mostly thanks to its excellent cast and decently structured screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERSI like this film because it presents a totally different religion in a world and a SCHOOL where Catholicism and Christ are the main backbone without shoving the alternative religion down our throats. I'm interested in different cultures and beliefs including witchcraft. There are no good witches and there are no bad witches because people have both goodness and badness inside of them. Nature is truthful in it's darkness as well as its light. The story is of four girls in an LA Catholic school Bonnie Neve Campbell a girl who hides behind her shaggy hair and believes that burn scars on her back make her an ugly monster Rochelle Rachel True a pretty black girl who is tormented by a mean spirited racist blonde Christine Taylor Sarah Robin Tunney a girl who recently moved into town from San Fran and whom the girls quickly notice has natural powers and finally Nancy Fairuza Balk the creepy gleeful goth girl who seems to be the leader of the little group of misfits. With the arrival of Sarah they are a foursome and capable of calling the corners. In time they are able to make contact with their god Manon who is described as everything and everywhere nature pretty much. They make wishes and cast spells and things begin to go their way Sarah gets the school hunk Skeet Ulrich to fall for her Bonnie's burn scars are healed and she turns from caterpillar to butterfly Rochelle gets some revenge when mean Blondie's hair begins to fall out and Nancy's step dad dies and leaves her family with more money than they know what to do with!!! I LOVED Balk in this movie. She has the goth chick down pat. Black lipstick wicked personality. Hers was the most entertaining performance. The other girls are great too more subtle but great. The battle between darkness and light at the end is great and Tunney's performance is the best right next to Balk's. I disagree with those who call this a scarey Clueless. It's a good real horror movie about the world of witches. And no Harry Potter stuff here thank God. In fact this is scarier than THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK and that one is darn scarey!!! I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 13 at all!!! It's a good real horrorthriller with clever comedy added in.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this case I was not aware of any of the starring actresses in it at the time at all except Neve Campbell who is undeniably one of my favorite actresses so I was immediately interested in watching it. I am a sucker for movies that have my favorite actors and actresses in them who isn't and will watch the film no matter how ludicrous or dumb the plot sounds though I didn't necessarily think the plot to this movie sounded ridiculous at all. My eyes locked on Neve Campbell like I said and if it had her in it I decided it must be great and I had to give it a try. I assumed the other three were little nobodies right away which was so unprofessional of me because I later figured out they had been in other films that have a popular reputation and they all showed their exceedingly fine acting talents in this incredibly fun and energetic but morose film that made me want to watch other roles they had took part in.I ended up loving this great and mentally twisted film that sets me in a mood of delight just setting my eyes on it for all the actresses' dedication to the vivacious yet dark witch atmosphere that the creators were going for because it is more of a teen film than an actual scare for adults. The Craft is a great and exciting movie nonetheless though and of course after I saw it I had to get a hold of some other movies I looked up that had these actresses in it because it was such a surprisingly wonderful film which had people who knew what they were working with and what kind of film they were making and just went with the flow.There were scenes of really high interest because of how well we get to know the characters in the short time that we have by their defining personalities and traits. I thought everything was handled very well and as I have hinted at already the performances are what make this film truly enjoyable regardless of whether or not they're Oscar worthy portrayals. This is certainly not an Oscar worthy film and was not meant to be but I can understand how someone could find it as lovable and gratifying as me. The Craft is purely excellent for what it sets out to accomplish with it's audience and I must say that it needs higher appreciation and recognition than what it has right now because it is an awesome film that is just another great example of how when you put the right cast together for the right kind of movie you can receive an explosively fun time that you didn't think you would have.".

I thought this movie had a great story with great actors like Fairuza Bulk Robin Tunney Neve Campbell Rachel True Christine Taylor Skeet Ulrich and Breckin Meyer.

The flavor of the film is typically French.It's easy to see why Mina the ravishing looking young woman at the center of the story seems bored with her present situation. She has married a man that is in some ways a loser to her eyes. Georges doesn't seem to share the same interests Mina especially for the movies. Georges an unemployed man prefers to spend his time at the local pub playing cards and drinking. As a couple one wonders what has kept them together so long. She is a beautiful woman and it's hard to see what attracted her to Georges.Mina on the other hand jumps at the offer she gets from Claire a wealthy woman in her town who offers her a job as a housekeeper. When she meets Matthias Mina loses all inhibitions and becomes involved with this man that is the opposite of her husband. Tommy the son plays a significant part in the affair. Mina has involved him from the start this young man instead of being horrified by what his mother is doing shows a perverse side when he goes along in keeping his mother' secret.The last scene of the film offers a poignant reflection on the movie in that Mina and Georges' separation is permanent as their lives have taken them in different directions.Carole Bouquet is a gorgeous woman. By pairing her opposite Gerard Depardieu the contrast is even more evident. Despite of the costumes she is made to wear one can see in her Mina an elegance that tells us she does not belong in this marriage or this town. Mr. Depardieu's Georges is a man that reacts with resignation to the break up. By being philosophical after trying to reason with Mina he conveys to us that he knew this would come as their relationship went nowhere.Charles Berling is seen as Matthias an engineer who is in charge of the construction of the bridge. He is a married man who will probably will end the affair and go back to his wife as most of these romances have a certain time span. Stanislas Crevillen plays young Tommy. This boy shows a cruel side toward his father although nothing seems to be wrong in their relationship.This film has elicited some negative comments in this forum but in spite of that reaction the movie will be appreciated for the frankness in which these people tell one another where they stand and for not beating around the bush in denying or hiding the truth. Adultery after all is a fact of life that shows its ugly face in all types of society.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gerard Depardieu can sometimes come off on screen as an oaf and other times he can be smooth and charming. I think his direction in this film can be described as the latter. This film starts out in 1962 in a small French city where Georges Depardieu is looking for work and decides to apply with a construction company that is going to be building a bridge. Georges wife Mina Carole Bouquet is bored with her life and goes to the cinema as often as she can with her son Tommy Stanislas Crevillen. One day at the cinema Mina notices a man near her crying during the film. After the film they talk and he introduces himself as Mathias Charles Berling and it turns out he is her husbands foreman at work. Soon Mina and Mathias are having an affair while Georges is away with the work crew. I liked the pedestrian pace that Depardieu sets for the film and the cinematography is very well handled. Its a very good looking film and it surprised me that Depardieu could be so impressive directing. They're is a lot of symbolism in this film and of course its apparent that the bridge that Georges is lending his hand to build represents an exit out of their relationship. Another thing that I found interesting was the tomato plants that Georges seems preoccupied with they seem to also symbolize George and Mina's marriage and when George knows his marriage is in trouble he spends his time tending to the tomato plants.SPOILER ALERT The last scene pretty much sums up where both characters are headed in life. They both meet by accident at a gas station and both of their cars are pointed in different directions. Film is written with a very mature focus to it and when Georges finds out about his wife he's not violent and doesn't make a big scene. He seems to understand it. No he doesn't like what has happened. But he's such a level headed lug that it would be wrong to argue. Some viewers complained about the slow pace but I found it refreshing. The characters stand out even more when a film is paced this way. Hollywood are you listening?".

	schema:reviewBody "Hmm....I've seen a lot of French films in the last year and have found that quite a few of them concern adultery. So I found myself a bit tired of the plot line already before I even began watching this film.Carole Bouquet is a middleaged woman married to Gerard Depardieu. She's an awfully pretty lady who's a housewife and he's a very traditional working man. Unknown to him she wants more out of life. She never tells him anything so he assumes the marriage is fine. Well he's out of work and needs a job so he has to work several hours away and only come home on the weekends. Since she is bored she doesn't try very hard not to become involved with another married man. During all this she does a lousy job of concealing it from her teenage soneventually this selfish and carefree approach towards her son will result in consequences the best part of the film I think because it actually shows the damage this behavior can have on the kids. Depardieu finds out but doesn't respond like a clodin fact he's very quick to forgive her and take her back. His character is just too decent about it. He also vows that if she's bored he'll do anything to change things. But she's extremely selfcentered and runs off with her lover.I actually liked the film better than most of the French adultery movies because you can see negative consequences. I think for those who think adultery is an evil there's enough there to prevent the movie from glorifying it. And interestingly enough I could also see the movie being taken as a do it if it makes you feel good film by those who think adultery is a legitimate alternative. It's interesting though how often in films the message appears to be that it is your partner's job to make you happyand isn't YOUR responsibility to make yourself happy. That's just my two cents worth. I would have liked it if the film had focused more on this but this is only a minor quibble.Wellacted and interesting but not a great film.".

It's interesting though how often in films the message appears to be that it is your partner's job to make you happyand isn't YOUR responsibility to make yourself happy. That's just my two cents worth. I would have liked it if the film had focused more on this but this is only a minor quibble.Wellacted and interesting but not a great film.";

The plots was horribly weak and gave no explanations for the events that took place or why the characters did what they did.  The characters themselves were as shallow as a puddle in the Sahara.  The main character has an affair for no other apparent reason than the fact that the man in the movie theater next to her cried.  She fights with her son over the affair they are in the heat of the argument and she says I just want you to be happy and just like that the argument is over and everything's fine between them again.  Perhaps things get lost in translation as it was dubbed but it would have to be just about the entire script that was lost in translation.  The ending is a giant nonsequiter and if possible even more of a disappointment than the rest of the film.  I was better entertained by the airline's external temperature update screen than by this film.".

The agent goes there does absolutely nothing and is informed that he should go to Hong Kong instead!. It takes another 30 minutes for them to put their Supersuits on why do they all act so surprised when they learn that the suits are bulletproof? Isn't this the fourth or fifth film in the series? And then it takes another 30 minutes for them to actually fight in their suits that's right the only Superman action occurs in the last 10 minutes of this 100minute movie. Even when the action comes it's almost exclusively Chinesestyle kung fu with limited acrobatics. Lo Lieh and Shih Szu do add some spice to the proceedings but series fans will probably be underwhelmed by this entry. One very funny dubbed line though  the kung fu teacher Now you have palms of steel. With just one hand you could kill a horse. With two hands....  the student ....two horses!.  out of 4.".

The dialogue is idiotic and so is what passes for a plot. Acting? Don't ask. They couldn't afford it. What they could afford is a 4th rate Italian Harpo Marx whose slapstick antics deliver not guffaws but jawdropping amazement at how badly he sucks. He makes Droppo look like Jim Carey. There's also a jerk playing the American ambassador who tries so hard to be funny but hams it soooo much that he misses the mark by more than a country mile. The rest of the cast bring nothing of note as well. I rated it one star because you at least get to seed some pretty shots of Thailand before they concentrate on the less than spectacular kungfu.".

The only thing I really remembered about this film was Aladdin's girlfriend played by Noelle Adam. What a gorgeous lady she was! She had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen on an actress. Plus she played a very convincing and lovely damselindistress. Her character is strong and stubborn but at the same time feminine and vulnerable. I don't think this movie is shown on TV anymore and it's hard to find a copy of it in the store.

The genie appearing in a matte shot smaller and smaller with each appearance made perfect sense to me. I rooted for Donald O'Connor. I was thrilled when he won the princess who I'd thought was Annette Funicello.When I saw it again about age 12 I was appalled. What a cheesy picture I thought. The winkwinknudgenudge joke of O'Connor but not the audience accidentally seeing the princess not Funicello after all nude seemed embarrassing. The special effects were just cheap.When I caught the movie again at college ageafter several years of reading about films and seeing films of all erasI was ready to forgive The Wonders of Aladdin its failings and enjoy it again.If you like 1001 nights type stories and you appreciate films of different eras The Wonders of Aladdin is an enjoyable Bmovie fantasy.".

Australian release 23 August 1962. 8292 feet. 92 minutes.SYNOPSIS In the ancient city of Baghdad a poor boy named Aladdin daydreams of great wealth and royal processions. One day his mother buys him a little lamp which the lad accidentally discovers contains a genie who can grant him three magic wishes. Aladdin uses his first wish to escape from some merchants he has robbed and then sets out by caravan to attend the royal wedding of Princess Zaina and Prince Moluk. Accompanying him is his devoted but unrequited girl friend Djalma and his loyal bodyguard Omar. When Aladdin and Omar are captured by mankilling Amazon huntresses the genie is once more summoned and he transports the pair to an Arab camp near the royal city of Basora. Meanwhile the wicked Grand Vizier has taken Prince Moluk prisoner and is planning to marry the Princess himself. But Aladdin and his friends...NOTES Both the French  Les Mille et Une Nuits  and Italian  Le meraviglie di Aladino  versions run 100 minutes.VIEWERS' GUIDE The 93 minute version contains material highly unsuitable for children. COMMENT Wonders of Aladdin is going to disappoint many potential customers because it's virtually a straight Arabian Nights adventure in the style of those Universal Tony Curtis Piper Laurie Rock Hudson Jeff Chandler pictures and very little use is made of the genie of the lamp and the consequent special effects. In fact it's a pity that the genie has such a small role to play in the proceedings because his first appearance and the special effects arising therefrom are rather well done and we look forward to more of the same and even better outcomes. Alas we have to wait rather a long time for more and when they come they are inferior both in quantity and in quality a wire is even visible in one scene.Although he receives such large billing De Sica has a very small and unrewarding part the final indignity  his voice is even dubbed in the English version. In fact O'Connor is the only member of the cast to use his own voice incidentally if you are not a fan of his you would be well advised to avoid this one he is on screen almost continuously and even doubles up in an uncredited bit part in which he plays the acrobatartist who draws a picture of Princess Zaina for the Grand Vizier.The rest of the cast is interesting  Adam Fabrizi Mercier  but cannot compare to the talent assembled behind the camera. The only dud is director Henry Levin. No writers are credited on the screen or Filmfacts but whoever they were they certainly came up with a lightweight pastiche that many would say wasted a lot of talent.On the other hand the film is always very colorful to look at and O'Connor is as acrobatic as Fairbanks Senior. There are some really bright moments in the script especially the scenes with the robot dolls and the aged wizard.".

Alas we have to wait rather a long time for more and when they come they are inferior both in quantity and in quality a wire is even visible in one scene.Although he receives such large billing De Sica has a very small and unrewarding part the final indignity  his voice is even dubbed in the English version. In fact O'Connor is the only member of the cast to use his own voice incidentally if you are not a fan of his you would be well advised to avoid this one he is on screen almost continuously and even doubles up in an uncredited bit part in which he plays the acrobatartist who draws a picture of Princess Zaina for the Grand Vizier.The rest of the cast is interesting  Adam Fabrizi Mercier  but cannot compare to the talent assembled behind the camera. The only dud is director Henry Levin. No writers are credited on the screen or Filmfacts but whoever they were they certainly came up with a lightweight pastiche that many would say wasted a lot of talent.On the other hand the film is always very colorful to look at and O'Connor is as acrobatic as Fairbanks Senior. There are some really bright moments in the script especially the scenes with the robot dolls and the aged wizard.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE WONDERS OF ALADDIN is an Arabian PEPLUM adventure which makes little sense. The screenplay by Bava and others is point blank terrible. I'd like to write a comprehensive review of it but the story is near incomprehensible that I can't review it because I still don't know what the story is about. It meanders here and there with no semblance of a cohesive storyline or logic. The first thing which stands out is that Aladdin is played by a 35 year old Donald O'Connor. I don't need to say anything more about this. Aladdin still lives with his mother who one day buys a cheap lamp which 'makes noise'. Now who would buy a lamp or even sell a lamp that makes noise? This 'noisy' lamp is meant to be funny but it's just the beginning of a series of comedic touches or jokes which aren't comical or funny in any way shape or form. Now Aladdin accidentally rubs the lamp while scratching himself because he has fleas !!!. Like the 'noisy' lamp the scenes featuring fleas go one endlessly and never illicit any laughs. I've never thought of seeing a movie waste 10 minutes of film on stupid fleas. It's overkill.The film continues on here and there with nary a story. Now the lack of story could be fine if the direction and pacing and dialogue where amusing but it's not. There are aspects of this story which beggars belief such as Aladdin NEVER knowing how to summon the Genie played with complete indifference by Vittorio De Sica. Once Aladdin figures he can summon a Genie he never asks for money love etc. It never dawns on Aladdin to ask the Genie to grant him all of his wishes. The Genie is simply there like a prop whenever Aladdin is in a predicament. At one point Aladdin tries to summon the Genie but since he doesn't remember how he did it the first time see above i.e. fleas in one scene we have to endure O'Connor goofing around rubbing his stomach and such. Aha! Again not funny. Just stupid and forced. This moment happens 30 minutes into the film and we still can't see any semblance of a storyline. Aladdin and his slave Milton Reid are stranded in the desert after a battle. The two end up being captured by desert Amazons who want to mate with them and kill them afterwards but Aladdin figures out how to get the Genie to get them out of there and bam they're back in the desert walking in a chaingang. The entire scene with the Amazons who look like Las Vegas showgirls was pointless. They could cut it out and go from the scene before and then to the chaingang moment and it wouldn't make any difference. It's inconsistent and padded and nonsensical as that.O'Connor was a talented and his artistry does shine through from time to time but for the love of God he was totally miscast. Terence Hill is in this and he's wasted in a pointless role. The whole project feels aborted and misconceived. Steve Reeves was supposed to star in this and the European film company LUX changed their minds as Steve was going to star in a couple of other productions including the much better and more successful THIEF OF BAGHDAD. So they cast O'Connor instead of Reeves. How does one go from Steve Reeves to Donald O'Connor is a total mystery.So to recap The bad unfunny jokes lame action scenes terrible meandering script padded. The complete total lack of any sense of wonder.The good locations great score by Angelo F Lavagnino and a scene or two showcasing O'Connor's talents.".

Mostly it works but sometimes I felt like I wanted to spend more time with main character Tommy Johnson or that they should at least had focused on fewer characters. Sometimes I felt that a scene was working really well but the story quickly focused on other things. As I said more often than not the episodic feel works fine but not all the time.As in almost all English movies the acting's great. From minor characters to main characters... they feel real. I especially think the voice over sounds very authentic it's Tommy speaking not actor Danny Dryer reading.I think this is a good movie it's rather violent and upsetting at times but also funny and entertaining.".

There is some terrific dialogue in this film... definitely one of the better football films to be released. I never knew Dyer voiced in some GTA games how interesting. This film takes on no real plot except for Chelsea's fixture list which didn't really bother because it reflects a culture not a 'storyline'. British films never cease to amaze me the acting is brilliant and script are always so clever and hilarious.Although the film was good it scared the hell out of me at times... the reality of it. Watching and thinking that this really does happen every weekend I guess that is the intention of Nick Love.

	schema:reviewBody "An auteur is regarded as a director who has a running theme throughout their resume . For example Robert Aldrich is considered a  sadistic  director and whileis films may be tame compared to the video nasty era the likes of TOO LATE THE HERO and ULZANA'S RAID do still come across as compellingly blood thirsty and violent . The films of Martin Scorsese usually involve protagonists being caught in an existentialist quicksand where the more they try and find their goal in life the more they sink into a problem of their own making . Let's not get too caught up in the auteur theory however because much of it is simply down to movie studios assigning scripts to well suited directors  Hey Marty  we've got a script here featuring a deranged loner wanting to join the mob . Bob and Leonardo have already signed on the dotted line . You interested ?  . Nevertheless it's obvious that Nick Love in the years ahead will be honoured in this fashion if only because his films feature blackly comical stories of working class British males fed up with the state of the nation In terms of style and execution THE FOOTBALL FACTORY isn't a million miles away from the likes of TRAINSPOTTING and TWO SMOKING BARALLS . It's very quirky  rather episodic  fairly violent and oh so bloody entertaining . You could say it contains all the flaws of recent British movies like an overuse of the words  FAHKIN'  and  KANT  but we are talking about the notorious Chelsea headhunters football hooligans and there are admittedly some unlikely coincidences involved such as two of the headhunters burgling a house that belongs to... but unlike Love's later OUTLAW you never feel at how contrived these plot twists are which probably says much of the film's entertainment factor . It could also be that the original source was strong in the first place since I get the feeling that Love totally fails as a screenwriter of original material  certainly the problem with OUTLAW was an underdeveloped script with very underwritten characters who lacked a recognisable motive . Here it's obvious but never overstated that the motivation of becoming a hooligan is to belong to something . And unlike in OUTLAW when something funny happens in THE FOOTBALL FACTORY you genuinely do laugh instead of scratching your head wondering if in fact it's supposed to be funny I have to confess that I've seen the feature films of Love back to front . I saw OUTLAW when it opened in the cinema in March  I saw THE BUSINESS a couple of months after that and saw THE FOOTBALL FACTORY for the first time last week . If Nick Love had released his films in that order then I would have said that here is a film maker who is really hitting his stride as his films just get better and better . Unfortunately what this means in reality is that Love is on a downhill curve and that nothing has come close to matching THE FOOTBALL FACTORY . One can only hope that the big screen remake of THE SWEENEY  a TV show well remembered for its mixture of black comedy and violence  will see a return to form for an underrated auteur".

Danny Dyer proves that there is more to young British Actors that Jude Pretty Boy Law and Orlando acts with his eyes Bloom with a stirring performance as Tommy Johnston. The social critique is as prominent in the film as the football hooliganism and the bathos that runs throughout is definitely a strong point. The Film is similar to Trainspotting in its feel and storytelling style and the soundtrack expertly tries to give you the buzz the guys are feeling as they are marching towards a ruck. Scenes to look out for are the Junior Football Match the 3rd Round Draw and Rod Meeting his girlfriend's parents. Ultimately the film asks more questions about the society that breeds the need for arranged violence than the actual link to football and ultimately leaves you on a high note after many lows during the film.I would recommend this to anyone not just football fans but anyone who wishes to see a film out heterosexual male relationships and the state of the British Male mindset in the year 2004.Love It!!".

What The football factory shows us is a bit of reasoning behind why seemingly normal go out and beat the crap out of each other because of a game with 22 guys and a ball. The truth is it has nothing to do with the game. How the team actually does really doesn't matter as long as you get to play your rivals because it's about togetherness and escaping the dreariness of everyday life. In a sick a twisted way of course but it's the only way for these guys. The movie itself goes by at a million miles an hour and gives us characters that seem both believable and real and a really touching story of a friendship that has lasted through the ages. The main character Tommy is a really interesting one He knows he's on the path to destruction and through visions of his own demise he realizes that it's all going to hell and that he along with the other hangarounds are along for the ride. It's a movie that is definitely worth an hour and a half of your time and you Americans should praise yourself lucky that at least you got one thing right You know how to behave at sporting events hell at NFL games they have barbecues out in the parking lot where fans of the opposing teams eat and hang out together.

	schema:reviewBody "I read a review of The Football Factory that said the characters are so orrible and hateful it was impossible to like them at all! You have to think that that particular reviewer knows nothing about the subject matter of the film he was writing about. Does he think that hoards of footie hooligans who delight in knocking seven bells of tar out of each other want to be liked?The Football Factory is directed by Nick Love and based on the book of the same name written by John King. It stars Danny Dyer who else really? Frank Harper Neil Maskell and Tamer Hassan Hassan fans should note he's rarely in it tho. The story is about what was termed The English Disease a disease where like minded adults from various walks of life religiously took to fighting like minded adults in the name of what football team they happened to support. There's been a ream of books written on the subject from those involved and by those who haven't a clue outside of reading their Sunday Times articles back in the day. There's also been one or two films about the subject from pretty ace efforts like Phillip Davis' ID to middling tellings such as Elijah Wood starrer Green Street. It's a subject that people seem hell bent on dissecting and attempting to get to the bottom of.So with that in mind Love's movie is something of a triumph in that it tries the hardest to understand its topic. To those on the outside of football hooliganism it looks like a bunch of blokes mindlessly inflicting harm on each other whilst simultaneously damaging the good name of the national sport. But Love with help from King's source explores ego led tribalism male bonding male conformity and dissatisfaction of life in general. Throw in the punches and a ream of genuine laughs and you got a film that is easy to like if you belong to a certain demographic. Here is the problem if you are not a geezer a tribal footie fan or a mindless thug The Football Factory holds no appeal to the casual observer which is a shame because as stated previously it's trying hard to reason and understand. There's for instance a cracking plotstrand involving two old fella's Tommy's Dyer granddad Bill Dudley Sutton  Albert John Junkin. Both lifelong pals who have grown tired of what their Britain has become thus they are in the process of emigrating to Australia. This dovetails smartly with the unfolding story of football violence perpetrated by the kids of the day. Generational differences? Perhaps maybe?The cast are strong either fitting the mean profile perfectly HarperHassan or delivering the needed cocky swagger line Dyer Love has assembled what is for the material at hand the perfect cast. OK we probably could have done with Vinnie Jones or Ross Kemp in there somewhere but it's a low budget movie you know!. The fight scenes are grim and look authentic and the soundtrack rocks the large one too. So is it glamorising a touchy subject? Well yes it is if you are a football hooligan yourself that is. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but it has good intentions in there even if not all of them are fully realised. To which it leaves us with an impacting intriguing and uneasily enjoyable movie. 7.510".

Violence is obviously a focal part of the movie but i feel the violence of this movie is shown in a negative light. Through out the movie football hooligans of Chelsea FC are followed in a number of different situations. The turf of other football firms and the local pubs are where many of the scenes are shot but despite following the violence of football hooligans this film is a lot deeper than that. It is about trying to feel a part of something. It is about confused individuals that are looking for something to believe in and throughout the movie there are internal struggles where the characters battle within their own minds as to what's more important growing up or football hooliganism. The violence in this movie isn't gratuitous. It is necessary and factual and is needed to show the internal struggles of the movies' many confused individuals. Not a bad film although it is a little rough around the edges.".

	schema:reviewBody "MY VERDICT The logic resulting in the production of this film is not hard to follow. The scathing social satire and searingly countercultural Trainspotting was a brilliant British film. The flashtalking fastplotted gunwielding hardbrawling Lock Stock was a good British film. So why not combine aspects of both? Predictably the result is a mess but flashes of good filmmaking keep the viewer interested for the 1 hour and 20 minutes or so of football 'n' fights.The opening sequence closely follows the Trainspotting format. A narrator later we discover called Tommy delivers his criticism on how we live our lives and how he has found excitement and meaning by flying right off the rails. The soundtrack moves from one Brit hit to the next as we are introduced to his gang in some snappy montages. Again the Trainspotting skool of filmmaking isn't so much an influence as a screenplay storyboard and script.Soon we get to know the gang and learn that the love of their lives is violence especially but not exclusively surrounding their football team Chelsea and particularly focused against their archrivals Millwall. I was preparing myself for some gruesome violence as geezers started drinking pints and looking for a fight. And then the film ... just ... chickens out. A film which is supposedly about football violence should um contain some football violence maybe but Football Factory becomes a film version of one of its thugs  all bluster and intimidation and no bite. Supposedly hardhitting action sequences have soap operalike qualities. Never do we seem to see a fist connect in anger or teeth shatter or bones crack. Just some bad pantomime blood and incompetent camerawork. This inadequacy seriously undermines the film's impact  it fails to pump up the audience to the next big fight and thus has no discernible pace. Just scenes shots and cuts.Instead the focus of the film falls rather disastrously on the uninteresting homogenous characters. With a sigh I realized this wasn't going to get any better and began to take mental notes of names story lines etc so I could at least follow the plot. Tommy and Rod are the central duo the thugs with brains imagination and perhaps the insight that will lift them out of this life. Bill is meant to be the ultranasty psycho  Robert Carlyle in Trainspotting was clearly what they were trying to emulate  but some unconvincing acting gives him all the terror of a particularly inyourface door to door salesman. Zebedee is there for exposition on the cocainefuelled lifestyle that all youths supposedly lead is this true? I was a teenager for years and I never remember being offered cocaine. There's also an organised violence ringleader although I don't have to worry about his name because he brings absolutely nothing to the plot at all.In brief the plot follows the gang on the buildup to a particularly bruising clash  Millwall versus Chelsea and particularly how Tommy begins to get cold feet about his thuggery and starts considering his options. This isn't helped by some heavyhandedly almost bludgeoningly symbolic dream sequences. I quite liked the filmmaking device of giving no warning or visual clues to as what was a dream and what wasn't. It's not put to an ultimate good use though much like the rest of the handful or so of original ideas in the film. I like the dopesmoking old men though.So is this worth viewing or not? Certainly it's got more to chew on than another awful CGIoverkillmarathon like Van Helsing or Catwoman. But don't expect it to truly open your eyes to another world or indeed still be with you a month later.".

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest movies like The Football Factory aren't usually ones I enjoy. But this one really surprised me.

	schema:headline " Stunning look at questioning one's identity and role within a football firm further still within contemporary Britain.";
	schema:reviewBody "At its very centre the question The Football Factory revolves around is 'was it worth it?' It is a question its protagonist Tommy Johnson played by Danny Dyer sees written in shop windows and on the sides of buses as his life increasingly spirals out of control whilst his conscience takes over and forces him to confront what it is he's actually doing in life. It is a question that Johnson asks himself near the very end but replies to his own voice with Of course it was! before he witnesses an act of violence so horrifying that it eclipses anything previously shown in the film. This would've left the film on an ambiguous note as to whether Johnson will now reconsider his prior reply or whether he'll even survive the next ten seconds of his life following this incorrect confirmation that it was indeed 'worth it'. The only thing that taints this final thought is the 'what happened next' captionimage that spoils what is essentially a fantastic film.The film was Nick Love's second second only to Goodbye Charlie Bright which was a bit of a mess. Here Love takes on substance and he takes on a relevant issue that is linked to today's British culture that being football hooliganism. The topic may not be as common now or indeed in 2004 when it was made as it was a couple of decades ago but it exists and The Football Factory acts as a sly reminder it does just as it is a stylish studycomedemonisation of said topic. The film does this through a variety of scenes but takes time to look at the bond between hooligans as this out of control journey takes place amidst a sea of grotty and grimy locations in and around England.The film follows Tommy and a couple of other characters in Chelsea football club's 'firm'. But teams are immaterial here as we look at Billy Bright Harper Rod Maskell and a younger member of the firm whom it would seem has quite large aspirations in terms of climbing the ladder within the group named Zeberdee Manookian. Around all this lies the film's anchor the film's one sane head who becomes a more humble and a more mature individual when he suffers a tragedy himself linked to his best friend of about fifty years. His name is Bill Farrell Sutton and he's Tommy's grandfather. One of the more memorable scenes is the introduction of Bright himself which draws away from both comedy and drama and just becomes plain frightening when the light hearted tone in a pub is replaced by pure menace once he challenges a younger and smaller firm member. The character and his aggressive confrontational mindset is set up perfectly for the rest of the film. Another scene that compliments the shifting in tone is when Johnson is cornered in some public toilets to do with who he is.The demonisation of being a football hooligan begins with a typical establishment of a night out. Tommy and Rod are looking for women and a drink and eventually they find both in a couple of loose girls with whom they venture back the one of their homes with. The following scenes offer light relief or comedy when it appears both males fell asleep but very quickly it turns into danger when Tommy wakes up with a knife to his throat and a fuming brother of one of the girls snarling at him. He escapes and in his own words that's when all the trouble started. What began as a routine and potentially silly 'pick up and easy lay' scenario quickly turns into light comedy and then life threatening before you realise the demonisation of the scenario has been completed when Tommy turns up to work disillusioned still shaken and slightly frightened. The whole thing suddenly does not look as glamorous.Twinned with this is Johnson's gradual decline into honesty about what he's doing thanks to nightmares and visions something that branches out into a realm of the uncanny in this refreshing and multigenre approach that has already been established will zip in and out of comedy drama and horror. The key scene in moving the film into the third act occurs at a flower stand when someone who has escaped 'the life' tells Johnson to do the same thing with Bright himself being identified as a figure you don't want to end up as as a figure of such hatred and violence and dedication to these two things that being with him will only incur further punishment.What's interesting about both character's demise into this mindset is how each one deals with the questioning of their own dedication. When Johnson asks himself if it's worth it he begins to move away and questions his involvement. When Bright's dedication is questioned by the higherups after some eavesdropping Bright chooses the wrong option and ups the stakes by bringing in firearms following the knocking of his ego. Such a scene demonstrates the correct and incorrect choices when this way of life pushes you into a corner and forces you to make a decision based on what involvement you truly truly want in a hooligan firm. The Football Factory is stylish but doesn't glamorise it is gritty and involving but you never really have 'fun' watching it. What you do feel however is thoroughly intrigued by the plight of this lone individual as he falls by the wayside and questions his own masculine identity amidst a sea of egos and violence.".

There was an interesting subplot but in the end several plot holes were left and the main question in the film at the end and the main characters feelings about what he does are completely forgotten. I was also diappointed by the end of this film overall. It basically promotes football violence and when the characters are beaten up you don't feel for them as they do it all the time to hundreds of other men. I'm sure football hooligans themselves will love this but I ain't one and there must be more swear words in this film than any i've ever seen in my life. The characters don't talk any sense whatsoever. There probably didn't even need to be a script for this film as the actors could just improvise all their swear words for every scene as they didn't have much else to say. At the end of the day these men live for nothing. They're just a bunch of thugs who go round beating people up and thats it. Nothing else. Some life. So I must say although this film was well made in some respects there is no sentiment whatsoever and I actually felt as though it was a waste of time in the end. I give it a 610 and thats being very generous because it probably deserves much lower.".

Basically this is a proper lads film and like most films that fit into that category it is pretty bad. Sure some of the characters are interesting and the acting from most of the cast is very good but the overall feeling is that this film is trying to be a bit of a joyride for guys who have similar interests to those portrayed in the film. So there's lots of violence lots of shots of people stamping on each other etc and a good deal of attention is paid to the prefight bonding sessions that the characters go through including lots of drug taking and shouting. Well done for presenting it realistically but to me its just not interesting. There are a couple of very unsubtle attempts to make the viewer think this film might be going somewhere interesting when the main character seems to begin to question the dodgy way he's choosing to live once at the start of the film and once mid way through. Then nothing! we see a few more fights the characters don't develop and nothing is learnt. There's a good scene where the scariest of the group acts insulted to frighten one of the smaller guys but even this is ripped straight from Joe Pesci's brilliant scene in Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong I wasn't hoping for all the characters to see the error of their ways or anything but I wanted to learn something or see something original. The style was Snatch meets Human Traffic... so kind of fast and snappy but not very original and not at all interesting at least to me. That said due to the quality acting and totally realistic storyline if you're a football hooligan or are in general into street violence this may be well worth a look.".

With its silent and unfussy release on DVD I decided I might as well give it a try. The film kicks off with Tommy's firm in a typically violent clash in which we learn of the appeal of the rush and the buzz as well as getting a feel for the characters. At this point I was happy enough because I was grateful that the film acknowledged the appeal of the hooliganism and to try and just pretend it has none would have been stupid. However no right minded person even one that sees the appeal could claim that it justifies it and I then looked for it to be more than just this. Although the film sort of starts to wander into the idea of the need for a tribe or a sense of belonging it generally just concentrates on the narrative rather than opening up the ideas.This is a problem because then all we have is a film that is some sort of drama around the world of football violence rather than a film that explores the lives involved. This is a shame because it could have been interesting but instead it just ends up wallowing in violence with only a vague subtext going on. This is not to say it glamorises it only that it presents it as it is but fails to really critically analyse it. In this way it will still be as confusing and repulsive to the majority as it is when it is on the news but to those involved in the real firms this will be seen as a great fun film  and that is a real shame.The cast are mostly just concerned with delivering swearing 'geezer' clichs and the film gives them no real opportunity to have greater depth than that.Dyer is a good lead who does occasionally bring out a bit of stuff with expressions and body language but mostly he fits the mould. Harper is just tough but his one scene of selfdoubt shows he had more in him if he had been allowed to go further. The rest of the support cast just simply fall into clich and lazy geezer accents with burberry for all!Overall this film was a disappointment in the way that it missed the deeper issues on the whole and just ended up being an depiction of violence without a great deal of depth to it. Worth seeing for a realistic depiction of football hooliganism but it doesn't do anything else beyond that. It may not glamorise or promote the life but it doesn't have the depth to criticise or analyse it in the way it really should have done.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a disappointing flick. When so many sorely underrated flicks have already addressed such amammoth problem in British society The Firm and the sadly little seen I.D to name just two Nick Love's film is sadly rendered completely redundant before it even had a chance. And that is before the film even puts its first foot wrong which it does very very early. This is a juvenile simplistic film sloppily directed. Whilst the majority of the acting must be commended Manookian in particular works brilliantly withlittle to no material the rest of this flick stood impotent and misjudged for its entirety. A big shame really because Nick Love's debut Goodbye Charlie Brightshowed such immense promise. At the end of the day there is only one word to judge this film by lazy. At times if felt like an amateur music video with pop songs appearing on the soundtrackevery minute alongside stilted boring visuals. A disappointment.".

	schema:headline " Yet another Brit flick that is like watching a first draft script";
	schema:reviewBody "You can't make a good film from a bad script as is the case here. The script is just underdeveloped come the end of the film you just don't get that satisfaction feeling that you're supposed to that you need to. Why? Because the themes are badly explored plot trails go nowhere and most of all we can't really get a hook into any of these characters. Even with hardnosed content like this we should still be able to care about someone. Here the opposite it is true and in the film's final moments we even find ourselves cheering a character we've only briefly glimpsed.A good example is the Bill character overhearing a plot by the other head guys to keep him out for being unreliable. This dramatic moment of undoing for the character should signal later events but nothing comes of it. There are lots of these unpaid moments which amounts to poor scripting.The British representation is very true to life. It looks so much like the Britain we all know yet never rises above it enough to become a proper movie. Obviously the budget is less than an episode of EastEnders and the fact it looks to be shot on video doesn't help. You can't really have dream moments in a film like this it's just not magical enough. The grandad subplot is also completely at odds with the rest of the film's unrepentant hooligan theme leaving really messy results.The dialogue in this film is too pedestrian lacking comedy or sparkle. The narration is of the most intrusive and expository type. The action scenes weren't a patch on Gangs of New York. The unrepentant themes are jarred badly by the closing moments and there is no real exploration of why these normal people need to do this.If the Football Factory had been funnier and less afraid of the tragedy it might have been a great film. As is you're just left with one of those messy mismatched genre films that is evidence of the British Film Industry's consistent mistake of filming too raw and unsatisfying a script.".

	schema:headline " This Film should have been called Gangs of London";
	schema:reviewBody "The Football Factory more like Gangs of Chelsea. I honestly thought I was going to get a typical British film out of Football Factory and I did but I got more than I thought I would. I don't know much of Nick Love and the same goes for Danny Dyer and after this I can't wait to see more of them as they brought this film to life in a complete original fashion for British movies definitely. We follow Tommy Rod Zeberdee Harris and Billy Bright through their weekdays work and their weekends of football and fighting this is their life and they would never change it for anyone not even their families.They support Chelsea but don't live for the game only the battles afterwards. What Nick Love brings to the table is a not a film about football hooligans but about choices in life. Throughout Tommy is having nightmares about being beaten by a dozen hooligans and being left for dead for a boy with a white bandage covering his face to turn up and haunt Tommy even more. He believes the drugs he takes are the only reason for these mad dreams instead of them being a wake up call to change his ways before its to late but soon after he gets a gut feeling that its more than that. This is what Love brings to the movie a dark deep look into the world that these kind of people live in. This is the kind of movie which makes you scared to go into a London pub or any that hails a football team in case you get your head kicked in or if you do keep your head down. It's very scary to how much a movie can do things like that to you because this is how I felt after watching this movie which is why I love The football factory cause its great when a film like this can do that to you. Some clich Guy Ritchie moments seem to appear a lot in the film but with it being based in London what am I to expect but Danny Dyer is something else as far as new fresh British talent goes. He fit's the part as Tommy perfectly and gives a more real performance than anything I have seen since Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting and this should be the film that sends Danny Dyer on his way. Everyone else was also on fine performance as was Dudley Sutton as Bill the aging old veteran coming to terms with his age but living each day to the full. The music plays out great in every scene like something out of Goodfellas and with acting and fantastic direction from Nick Love there is no way you are going to dislike this film because it tells the harsh truth about what football hooligans are really like and what they stand for. You can compare this to I.D and not wanting to take anything away from I.D as it was a great film with great acting football Factory has the edge on it and plays out beautifully. If you love British films football Factory is for you. If you like gang films football Factory is for you. If you like dark films then football Factory is your film. Overall Football Factory is an outstanding achievement that should put Britain back on the map for making great films.".
