It's up to Nora to discover the truth to what happened that rainy night in the plaza.Mario Bava is known for his magnificent use of color. So it's a little odd that two of my favorite films that Bava made The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Black Sunday are black  white. Whatever the format Bava again demonstrates his mastery of shadows and light very effectively. The film presents a series of images that are hard to forget. Each shot is perfection. One of my favorites is of the thief who steals Nora's purse as he moves from one side of the stairs to the other. It is admittedly a very minor moment but Bava puts more care into this insignificant tracking shot than most director's do in the main scenes of their movies. It is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.The Girl Who Knew Too Much is an obvious and not just in title homage to Alfred Hitchcock. Bava has loaded the movie with moments that are done as I imagine Hitchcock would have done them. If the movie weren't in Italian you would swear Hitchcock directed it.But the thing that make this movie so effective is Leticia Roman as Nora. Her performance is one of the best I've seen in a Bava film. She comes off as fragile yet determined depending upon what the script calls for. She has a believability that is necessary for this kind of movie if the audience to feel concern when she is in peril. Roman is perfect in the role.One final note this movie is often cited as the first giallo. Whether this is true or not I only know what I've read. The Girl Who Knew Too Much does establish a very elementary framework for later gialli to follow. But it bears little resemblance to the gialli that would come later. It's not until Bava fleshedout the giallo in Blood and Black Lace do we get look and rules that have become so familiar to fans of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH Mario Bava  Italy 1962.I finally got to watch this in the way of the relatively cheap French DVDrelease LA FILLE QUI EN SAVANT TROP which includes Bava's original Italian cut as well as the American cut titled THE EVIL EYE which has a completely different ending and excludes some references to marijuana as well as a stronger emphasis on the romantic plot line between the two leads John Saxon and Letcia Romn reputedly to make the film more marketable for children! which I find impossible to comprehend but apparently this was what U.S. distributors had in mind. Furthermore a bombastic Les Baxter score was added a common treatment for most U.S releases of Italian films in that period instead of the charming jazzy score in the Italian version and a very catchy theme song. Letcia Romn stars as a young American woman who loves reading mystery novels. In fact she's seen reading a detective novel called The Knife when we meet her on the plane. She plans to stay with her aged aunt but one evening the old lady dies before her eyes. When she stumbles upon the streets she witnesses a woman stabbed to death in front of the Spanish Steps and suspects it's the work of a serial killer. Going unconscious she awakens in the hospital and tries to convince everyone she witnessed a murder but since no body was found nobody believes her. She does convince a young doctor John Saxon to help her investigate the murders and they soon find out a series of murders was committed ten years ago the Alphabet Murders. She realizes that previous victims had surnames beginning A B and C and because her name starts with a D she could be the next victim.This is often cited as the first Giallo that specific Italian breed of thriller named after the line of books with yellow covers hence Giallo Italian for yellow. THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH basically contains most core elements attributed to this particular cinematic subgenre with the prime motive of the helpless heroine subjected to all kinds of dangers and physical as well as mental abuse. Nora Davis is seen reading a Giallo novel on the airplane the foreigner as vulnerable outsider in Italy an obsession with travel and tourism the first murder takes place before the Spanish Steps but the film shows countless tourist hotspots throughout Rome and the fascination with fashion and style or the jetset in general. Although it would take Bava's own BLOOD AND BLACK LACE 1964 lavishly shot in colour to introduce the more elaborate lengthy and  above all  much more violent and bloody killing sequences which would typify many later Giallos carried out by the archetype Giallo killer with gloves and black raincoat. Wideeyed Letcia Romn is the kind of innocent looking girl with just the right combination of sexiness and innocence to pass as a very likable heroine perhaps a touch too innocent and certainly worlds away from the sexually liberated female in later Giallos.Early sixties' fashions and habits abound such as Nora Davis' exuberant snake leather jacket. There's also a lot of smoking on the plane and later on Nora condones Marcello's smoking habits claiming it's bad for his health which is presented as the audience is supposed to laugh at her preposterous observation instead of Marcello's smoking habit. Typical role reversal. There's also the running gag with marijuana. In the first scene the man next to Nora on the plane turns out to be a marijuana smuggler but on arrival in Rome the always alert Italian police is quick to take this character into custody. Perhaps Bava's way of saying the Italian police is always on top of these issues and malicious elements from abroad are dealt with in proper fashion.Masterfully shot in blackandwhite the film doesn't contain the outrageous imagery of THE BODY AND THE WHIP 1963 and BLOOD AND BLACK LACE both sumptuously shot in colour and certainly is much lighter in tone with the sadistic bloodletting so typical of that other pivotal entry in the development of the Giallo BLOOD AND BLACK LACE largely lacking. Originally it was conceived as a romantic comedy and  hence the title  as a light parody on Hitchcock's work but Bava decided to put a larger emphasis on the more horrific elements of the story but doesn't lose sight of the plot development which I always found a major demerit of BLOOD AND BLACK LACE. A bit oldfashioned perhaps by American or British standards but combining these elements with a more typical Italian tone Bava does create something new here. Nevertheless the tone remains conspicuously breezy and that's probably why this film turns out to be such an endearing mixture of clever Hitchcockian suspense and the occasional comedy relief. Perhaps a bit too cutesy and innocent for many Bavafans but I found his a thoroughly enjoyable film. Camera Obscura  810".

	schema:reviewBody "La Ragazza Che Sapeva TroppoThe Girl who Knew too Much1963 is the first of the giallo genre that didn't blossom until the late 1960s.  Also the final film by Mario Bava to be done in black and white.  Although a Giallo the film follows the plot lines of the more traditional mystery story with a few twists.  The film that uses the perverse and violent elements of the Gialli or Giallo is Blood  Black Lace1964.  Mario Bava's next film Blood and Black Lace1964 is less interested in story and more interested in mood and style.  The plot involves a woman who misinterprets the meaning of a murder she witnesses.  The first horror picture that John Saxon was in.Bava in a rare instance uses naturalistic lighting.  Usually the lighting in a Bava film is drenched in artful color.  The only other film by Mario Bava to use naturalistic lighting is Rabid Dogs1974.  Lacks the sex and violence that dominates the gialli novels.  The director was fascinated by the deception of appearences in this film and in his entire filmography.  He seemed to have little optimism about human behavior or human nature.  There are only three murders that occur in the film while the others happen before the story begins.The Girl who Knew Too Much1963 deals with Bava's favorite theme of greed. The murderer before being overcome with bloodlust does these deeds because of obsession with money.  Greed is the seed of destruction for the characters in Blood  Black Lace1964 A Bay of Blood1971 and Rabid Dogs1974. Part Alfred Hitchcock and part Edgar Wallace.  The acting in the film is good.  Leticia Roman is excellent as the naive and attractive Nora Davis.  Mario Bava was not interested in doing the film but due to money reason directed it anyway.Downplays the romantic subplot involving Nora Davis and Dr. Marcello Bassi. The scenes that uses suggestions of drug use were cut for the USA release. I love the scene where Nora sets up a booby trap to catch the murderer with disasterous results.  The camera was in love with the figure of Leticia Roman during the scene at the beach while panning from her face to her feet. The short love scene between Nora and Marcello has a short spurt of eroticism.  One of the writers who worked on the film was Django director Sergio Corbucci.  John Saxon does some fine acting as the leading man.Mario Bava and John Saxon did not get along due to many misunderstandings during filming.  The director it seems didn't think too highly of actors or actresses.  Dante Dipaolo plays the newspaper reporter with sympathy.  The use of the tape recorder by the murderer is cleaver.  Valentina Cortese gets the top acting honors as the mysterious Laura Terrani.  The discovery of the murderer is one of the film's main highlights.  Impressed Dario Argento when he did The Bird with the Crystal Plumage1969 and thus being responsible for the longevity and success of the Giallo in Italy.".

The scenes that uses suggestions of drug use were cut for the USA release. I love the scene where Nora sets up a booby trap to catch the murderer with disasterous results.  The camera was in love with the figure of Leticia Roman during the scene at the beach while panning from her face to her feet. The short love scene between Nora and Marcello has a short spurt of eroticism.  One of the writers who worked on the film was Django director Sergio Corbucci.  John Saxon does some fine acting as the leading man.Mario Bava and John Saxon did not get along due to many misunderstandings during filming.  The director it seems didn't think too highly of actors or actresses.  Dante Dipaolo plays the newspaper reporter with sympathy.  The use of the tape recorder by the murderer is cleaver.  Valentina Cortese gets the top acting honors as the mysterious Laura Terrani.  The discovery of the murderer is one of the film's main highlights.  Impressed Dario Argento when he did The Bird with the Crystal Plumage1969 and thus being responsible for the longevity and success of the Giallo in Italy.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl Who Knew Too Much 1963 is director Mario Bava's gleeful homage to Hitchcock and one of the earliest examples of the Italian Giallo subgenre of horrorsuspense cinema that would go on to inspire an entire generation of horror filmmakers throughout the subsequent two decades. If you're at all familiar with the work of director Dario Argento for example then you can see the roots of films like The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970 Deep Red 1975 and Tenebrae 1982 already being established by the skillful blending of lowkey thrills character development and good old fashioned murder mystery as captured by Bava in this excellent slowburning suspense piece. Although it may take some viewers a while to settle into the overall tone of the film  with those first few scenes presenting us with a veritable bombardment of information both narrative and thematic before the first murder has even taken place  the eventual unravelling of the plot and Bava's excellent direction eventually draw us deeper into a story that is here punctuated by a charmingly romantic subplot a miniature travelogue around the tourist traps of Rome some subtle moments of almost slapstick humour and the director's always inventive use of visual experimentation.The usual Gialli trademarks are already beginning to take shape here with the film focusing on a foreigner  in this case twentyyear old American student Nora Davis  who travels to Rome to visit her ailing aunt and inadvertently witnesses a murder. Alongside this central plot device which would be utilised by Argento in many of his greatest films such as the three aforementioned we also have the ideas of sight and perception with the central protagonist unintentionally witnessing something that is shrouded in elements of doubt and abstraction and thus having to prove what she saw to sceptical police officers and those nearest to her. Bava's film is also given a neat touch of selfreferential subtext opening with a shot of the central character herself reading a Giallo murder mystery casting some doubt as to whether or not the film plays out in the literal sense or whether it is a merely a constructed reality taking place in her own mind as she reads the book to herself. This is a thread of interpretation that is examined throughout by the filmmaker with the title of the book itself The Knife having an importance on the plot that perhaps surreptitiously suggest some element of imagined fantasy.Once we get through those hectic opening sequences which introduce the characters and a number of potential subplots that are essentially windowdressing to throw us off the trail the film settles into the murder mystery aspect and the burgeoning relationship between Nora and her young doctor friend Marcello Bassi. Through the relationship Bava introduces a subtle comment on the Holmes vs. Watson partnership recast as a romantic dilemma whilst also creating space within his story to let the audience catch up and think about the potential clues already collected in order to lead us to the eventual discovery of the killer's identity. The use of sight and Bava's directorial slightofhand is used meticulously for the initial murder sequence with the director creating a literal feeling of hazy disconnection and a distorted perspective through a somewhat dated visual effect and the always masterful use of light and shadow. Although the actual effect  which replicates the look of ripples on a pond  might lead a more contemporary audience to giggle or cringe it does tie in with the continual use of watersymbolism in Bava's work from the final story in The Three Faces of FearBlack Sabbath 1963 and A Bay of Blood 1971 most famously as well as a somewhat cheap gag about marijuana cigarettes that will pay off in the film's closing moments.Again the use of humour taps into the spirit of Hitchcock with intrigue voyeurism suspense and murder being reduced to mere complications in the continual romantic wooing of Nora by the charming Dr. Bassi. Nevertheless the thriller aspects are what we remember most clearly with Bava's always atmospheric direction iconography and ability to create tension from the slightest movement of the camera. Once the credits have rolled we release just how subtle much of Bava's use of sight and perception actually was with a number of scenes leading on from a moment of confusion by the central character in which she thinks she sees something that turns out to be nothing of the sort. Again it shows the director playfully undermining the central character presenting Nora as someone unable to trust her own eyes and thus unable to be trusted with the ultimate unravelling of the plot. Nonetheless Bava also succeeds in throwing us into this enigmatic mystery undermining our own perspective of the story by showing us important information early on allowing us to feel superior to Nora with our benefit of a forewarning only to then cast further doubt in our mind as the gallery of suspects mount up.Though still something of a minor work for Bava The Girl Who Knew Too Much is undoubtedly great enlivened by the fine performances from the two leads John Saxon a cult actor with an impeccable list of credits and the delightful Leticia Roman I'm honestly quite smitten and absolutely brimming with style and energy. The gag at the end is inkeeping with Bava's work but certainly doesn't lessen the impact of the more thrilling scenes that came before or the air of grand mystery and excitement suggested by his excellent approach to editing cinematography and design. Beware that the film also exists under the title The Evil Eye reedited by Bava for the American market as more of a lighthearted romp Tarantino calls it's a masterpiece. The version reviewed here is the original Italian version a minor masterpiece of Giallo thrills cinematic abstractions and an oldfashioned approach to storytelling that grips us from the start and never lets us go.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming out in 1963 The Girl Who Knew Too Much is not as groundbreaking as other Mario Bava efforts but it's still every bit as stylish and suspenseful. The plot of the film convoluted and filled with twists and red herrigns galore anticipates the giallo cycle of the late 60's. Of course one year later the director would practically define the style with Blood and Black Lace introducing other genre staples like the blackgloved killer the garish colours and the gore but that doesn't detract from the ifluential status of this protogiallo.As the title imples The Girl Who Knew Too Much is with one foot firmly set in Hitchcock territory but whereas Hitch films had a tendency of trying to be too many things at once little bits of comedy romance etc something I always considered distracting Bava allows nothing to come between him and his goal a suspenseful horror thriller.The chiaroscuro photography is simply beautiful to look at light and shadow play off each other in expressive ways not unlike filmnoir. Leticia Roman's face is at times only halflit to stress her confusion while in other setpieces dark figures stand out against fully lit backgrounds. Bava is famous for being one of the best visual directors in the history of the medium for good reason. His black and white work is as good as his colour films.Minor quibbles I had with the film include that many scares turn out to be false the first person narration another filmnoir influence and the implied possibilities in the ending was it all a dream? Leticia Roman and John Saxon hit it off with great chemistry the DP work is fantabulous the opening 1520 minutes leading up to the first murder are among the best 20 minutes in 60's horror and this an all around accomplished horror film that deserves every fan's attention.".

	schema:headline " The Girl Who Knew Too Much Mario Bava 1963 ";
	schema:reviewBody "This Bava film whose title is clearly a nod to Alfred Hitchcock credited with being the first giallo was also one I could have watched earlier  having long considered picking up the nowOOP Image DVD not to mention via a DivX copy I've owned for some time  but thought it best to wait for this definitive edition complete with a Tim Lucas Audio Commentary.Anyway I don't know whether it's because I preceded it with Riccardo Freda's delirious and luridlycolored THE GHOST 1963 or the fact that the film retains an incongruous light touch and leisurely pace throughout  including the heroine's ruse to ensnare her stalker by the unlikely methods adopted in the pulp thrillers she avidly reads  but while I enjoyed it a good deal it felt to me like an altogether minor work from the maestro! Similarly the murder sequences  a stylized highlight of later giallos  are pretty mild here. Still Bava's consistent virtues  as a director  for creating tremendous suspense and the fantastic lighting and crisp cinematography that come with his intimate knowledge of the camera are well in evidence.The first halfhour is pretty busy plotwise as all sorts of things happen to the charming leading lady the strikinglooking Leticia Roman daughter of Oscarwinning costume designer Vittorio Nino Novarese first she gets involved with a drugdealer then the old woman she was to live with dies on her after which she roams outside in a frenzied state to be held up by a smalltime crook and witness a knifemurder across Rome's famous Piazza di Spagna! Her disoriented frameofmind is effectively rendered by Bava through simple expedients such as distorting lenses and focuspulling. Incidentally the foreignerinvestigatingaseriesofmurdersinItaly plot line prefigures such notable Dario Argento films as THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE 1970 and DEEP RED 1975. Interestingly since there was no yardstick for the genre as yet Bava relied on such familiar film noir trappings as firstperson narration to push the story forward.The film also features a young John Saxon in his first of many EuroCult outings as Roman's boyfriend and Valentina Cortese as her wealthy eccentric landlady the script provides plenty of suspects but the final revelation comes as a surprise though in hindsight it seems pretty obvious  and this is followed by a lengthy explanation of the motive behind the killings which became a standard 'curtain' for this type of thriller. There's an amusing final gag involving a packet of cigarettes and a priest while Adriano Celentano's catchy pop song Furore serves as a motif during the course of the film.Additional footage was prepared for the U.S. version snippets of which are present in the accompanying trailer while the title was changed to THE EVIL EYE and Roberto Nicolosi's score replaced with that of Les Baxter as had already proved to be the case with Bava's BLACK Sunday 1960! It would have been nice to have had this cut of the film which is said to stress the comedy even more included for the sake of comparison  and it had actually been part of the original announcement for The Mario Bava Collection Vol. 1 along with the similar AIP variants for BLACK Sunday itself and BLACK SABBATH 1963 but these were subsequently retracted! Incidentally I now regret not renting the alternate version of THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH on DVDR while I was in Hollywood  but back then I wanted first to watch the film as the director intended.In John Saxon's otherwise entertaining interview on the Anchor Bay DVD in which he recounts his experience working on this film and other stuff he made during his tenure in Italy he erroneously mentions that he worked with director Lucio Fulci  whose name he even mispronounces as Luciano! Despite there being a considerable amount of dead air throughout Tim Lucas' Audio Commentary it does a wonderful job at detailing the film's background  plus offering his own take on events it does prove enlightening on several aspects of the film I had initially overlooked such as how the costumes were carefully chosen to define character or the impressive contribution given by Dante di Paolo George Clooney's uncle! as the dour journalist investigating the murder spree. Surprisingly Lucas also mentions that some of Bava's camera moves are more elaborate and graceful as seen in THE EVIL EYE which makes me want to see it even more!  but then important dialogue stretches heard in the Italian original involving the creepily asexual voice of the killer were bafflingly left out of the American version!!".

Still Bava's consistent virtues  as a director  for creating tremendous suspense and the fantastic lighting and crisp cinematography that come with his intimate knowledge of the camera are well in evidence.The first halfhour is pretty busy plotwise as all sorts of things happen to the charming leading lady the strikinglooking Leticia Roman daughter of Oscarwinning costume designer Vittorio Nino Novarese first she gets involved with a drugdealer then the old woman she was to live with dies on her after which she roams outside in a frenzied state to be held up by a smalltime crook and witness a knifemurder across Rome's famous Piazza di Spagna! Her disoriented frameofmind is effectively rendered by Bava through simple expedients such as distorting lenses and focuspulling. Incidentally the foreignerinvestigatingaseriesofmurdersinItaly plot line prefigures such notable Dario Argento films as THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE 1970 and DEEP RED 1975. Interestingly since there was no yardstick for the genre as yet Bava relied on such familiar film noir trappings as firstperson narration to push the story forward.The film also features a young John Saxon in his first of many EuroCult outings as Roman's boyfriend and Valentina Cortese as her wealthy eccentric landlady the script provides plenty of suspects but the final revelation comes as a surprise though in hindsight it seems pretty obvious  and this is followed by a lengthy explanation of the motive behind the killings which became a standard 'curtain' for this type of thriller. There's an amusing final gag involving a packet of cigarettes and a priest while Adriano Celentano's catchy pop song Furore serves as a motif during the course of the film.Additional footage was prepared for the U.S. version snippets of which are present in the accompanying trailer while the title was changed to THE EVIL EYE and Roberto Nicolosi's score replaced with that of Les Baxter as had already proved to be the case with Bava's BLACK Sunday 1960! It would have been nice to have had this cut of the film which is said to stress the comedy even more included for the sake of comparison  and it had actually been part of the original announcement for The Mario Bava Collection Vol. 1 along with the similar AIP variants for BLACK Sunday itself and BLACK SABBATH 1963 but these were subsequently retracted! Incidentally I now regret not renting the alternate version of THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH on DVDR while I was in Hollywood  but back then I wanted first to watch the film as the director intended.In John Saxon's otherwise entertaining interview on the Anchor Bay DVD in which he recounts his experience working on this film and other stuff he made during his tenure in Italy he erroneously mentions that he worked with director Lucio Fulci  whose name he even mispronounces as Luciano! Despite there being a considerable amount of dead air throughout Tim Lucas' Audio Commentary it does a wonderful job at detailing the film's background  plus offering his own take on events it does prove enlightening on several aspects of the film I had initially overlooked such as how the costumes were carefully chosen to define character or the impressive contribution given by Dante di Paolo George Clooney's uncle! as the dour journalist investigating the murder spree. Surprisingly Lucas also mentions that some of Bava's camera moves are more elaborate and graceful as seen in THE EVIL EYE which makes me want to see it even more!  but then important dialogue stretches heard in the Italian original involving the creepily asexual voice of the killer were bafflingly left out of the American version!!";

After all we are talking about the man who once said If you don't admire all the colours when you are outside there is no point in becoming a writer. The same goes for watching a movie by Mario Bava he was a genius at composing colourful movies. Many movies from the sixties have a special colour but even amongst other movies from that decade Bava's clearly stand out.The Evil Eye also known as The Girl who Knew too Much is a blackandwhite movie. There are no colours to admire apart from the variations in grey. Is it still a great movie? Yes. The colours are that little bit extra the bit that makes a good movie excellent. In The Evil Eye we follow Nora an American girl who goes to Italy to visit her sick aunt. There she witnesses a murder or so she thinks. There is no body to be found and only moments before the murder Nora had been attacked by a thief. As we follow her on her journey to the truth it becomes clear why the European title a literal translation from the original Italian title La Ragazza che sepeva troppo is The Girl who Knew too Much. This is the Bava version of a Hitchcock movie a case study for Bava's later gialli.If we forgive the movie for being a bit too sketchy at times we are left with an intriguing puzzle with a movie that wants to show beauty in almost every scene with a few scenes that'll remain in your head for at least a few months. in short with a very good movie. Letita Romn is so intriguing it looks like she is having an affair with the camera. There is no reason why you shouldn't be the voyeur.".

One thing I find interesting is that Bava is known for his black and white photography but also developed interesting techniques with lighting in color that allow him to use the same type of shadowalternating light effects that work in black and white in color films.  I've noticed these types of effects in other Italian films but none so striking or consistent as in Bava's films which leads me to believe he is one of the innovators of this style.

These were adaptations of British writer Edgar Wallace mystery and crime stories made specifically for the German market between 1959 and 1972. 'Giallo' were more baroque in style and notable for extended murder sequences stylish camera work and Grand Guignol style drama. Full of madness alienation and paranoia atmosphere is everything and character development acting and strong pacing are immaterial. Unlike the American horror  stalker  slasher  finalgirl films the killer is rarely male or suffers from gender confusion that places him in the feminine position Argento's The Bird With The Crystal Plumage 1970 is an example as is Fulci's A Lizard In A Woman's Skin 1971. Almost as a convention 'Giallo' titles frequently feature animals or numbers such as Fulci's Don't Torture a Duckling 1972 or Umberto Lenzi's Seven Blood Stained Orchids 1972. Mario Bava's The Girl Who Knew Too Much 1963 is considered the first 'Giallo' film. A cinematographer who received his first chance to direct finishing Riccardo Freda's 1956 I Vampiri which is considered the first Italian horror film Bava then handled cinematography and special effects on Hercules 1957 kick starting the sword and sandal genre. He shot The Day The Sky Exploded 1958 which is the first Italian scifi film with a large German 'Krimi' cast. He then had a chance to shoot and finish directing another Freda film Caltiki  The Immortal Monster 1959 a genre favourite. It is remarkable to watch Planet Of The Vampires 1965 and then take a moment to think about whether Alien 1979 could exist without it answer? It couldn't. Bay Of Blood  Twitch Of The Death Nerve 1971 was hugely influential in regards the American 'slasher''body count' genre. The Girl Who Knew Too Much establishes what will become one of the critical conventions of 'Giallo' that of an outsider or foreigner who witnesses a murder and investigates the crime. Trouble comes when warnings not to get involved are ignored. 'The Girl' is more restrained than any of Bava's later 'Giallo' in which he would develop a baroque and garish use of colour. Filmed in black and white that connects it to filmnoir the literarypulp origins of 'Giallo' and Hitchcock's influential Psycho 1960 and the title refers to Hitchcock's 1934 and 1956 The Man Who Knew Too Much Bava mixed in the conventions of the thriller film noir and horror creating 'Giallo.'Check it out!".

In fairness it doesn't much resemble the films that would typify this genre in the 70's.

But there is no doubting that some of the recurring motives and ideas of this most Italian film genre began here.As the title suggests The Girl Who Knew Too Much is indebted to Alfred Hitchcock more than anything else. The idea of an innocent thrust into the middle of a deadly situation is one Hitchcock used many times. While the romantic subplot and moments of light comedy also recall his work. These latter two elements are mainly what mark out TGWKTM as a crossover film as they are certainly not features of giallo cinema as it would develop. But the light comic approach is one of the things that make this one of the most playful and upbeat films that Mario Bava ever made. Unlike his three other gialli this film actually has sympathetic characters. While it doesn't have the melodramatic tendencies that those ensemble movies had either. The approach is much more restrained with a fairly simple amateur sleuth narrative being the framework. Completely different too is the black and white aesthetic. Bava is of course rightfully famous for his masterful use of colour but in this film he shows that his use of light and contrast is just as impressive. This is a very handsome looking movie. Letcia Romn adds to this aesthetic too of course seeing as she is a very beautiful woman. Visually this is a terrific film. Storywise it's certainly less interesting. The fairly mechanical plot is sufficient enough in taking us from A to B but it isn't particularly memorable.

It's a film that is as breezy and light as the genre ever got. It's a lovely and beautiful looking flick from a master filmmaker.".

Horror and mystery combine in this shadowy mystery of hallucination and a killer who murders alphabetically.

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl who knew too much is a terrific film and I personally have the advantage that it unites two of my alltime favorite cinema persons. Mario Bava the greatest director who ever lived directs John Saxon one of the most charismatic actors ever in this genuinely creepy and wellconstructed Italian milestone. This outstanding Bava effort might be considered as the very first Giallo ever made the Italian variant on the detectivestory complete with slick plot twists macabre visuals and extravagant characters. The story centers on Nora a beautiful young American whose vacation in Rome starts out miserable. She's almost mistaken for a softdrugs smuggler at the airport her beloved aunt dies right after her arrival she's robbed and  on top of all  she witnesses a vile murder during her first night. When she comes to her senses it seems that all the traces that could lead to the killer have been erased and no one believes her. Along with the handsome doctor Bassi Saxon! the stubborn Nora starts her own private investigation that brings her close to the Alphabet Killer who was active in the area ten years earlier. Bava stuffs his film with tributes and references towards Hitchcock's repertoire the title alone is an obvious homage but he certainly is a good match for the master of suspense himself. The soundtrack is perfect and the atmospheric black and white cinematography even increases the already hightension level. This latter aspect is quite ironic as Mario Bava is especially famous for his brilliant use of color. I stated this in all my Bavareviews but I can't repeat it enough Mario Bava was a genius and every single one of his cinema achievements is an absolute must for horror fanatics. You'll never see so much beauty and elegance in movies that actually handle about morbid topics.".

Giallo films are purposely simple and gory and filled with dramatic camerawork. In a sense they play off the style one after another becoming increasingly about the genre rather than movies that stand on their own. It's like slasher films these days or maybe even zombie films where you watch knowing what you're going to get and that's exactly what you want.Even the director Mario Bava admitted openly this was a silly film with great cinematography. That sums it up. He couldn't even remember the two leading actors. There is a bizarre cheesy lowbudget thriller aspect to the whole enterprise that makes it fun in a campy way even if you aren't a giallo fan. But it's not good in a traditional sense.Even the main premise is old as the hillsa serial killer is stabbing women in the back in alphabetical order by last name. This is oddly confused in the plot because woman C was killed a decade before and we see the next woman killed before our eyes. But the heroine's last name begins with D as if she is going to be next and indeed she finds her picture in a file at the end suggesting she really is next in line. So what letter did the woman killed before our eyes have?One of the weird aspects to the plot might explain thisthe woman accidentally smokes a marijuana cigarette at the beginning of the movie and we come to realize she might have dreamed the whole episode. Never mind there are other deaths and mishaps that seem rather real. And a handsome Italian doctor in love with her.It's also weird in a funny way that the lead woman is an Italian actress playing an American visitor in Rome. Naturally her Italian is excellent. And the whole movie is centered around the Spanish Steps which are often completely completely empty not a person around. Adds to the surrealism. There are creaky horror film conventions like the shadowy man seen through the window or the overdecorated house with creepy lights where the woman is staying alone of course.What's to recommend this? The photography. The noir influence and the Roger Corman one I suppose is clear. And beautiful. Now if the story and acting made some modicum of sense we'd be set for a classic overthetop scary movie. Yes it's important as a giallo example but don't overblow the result.".

Two drawbacks are that a Saxon doesn't get to show his body at all in a beach scene and bthe Italians sometimes talk so fast that the subtitles fly by like crazy.

The Girl Who Knew Too Much was the inspiration for the entire Giallo subgenre and it also marks one of Bava's very best successes. Mario Bava is probably most famous for his vibrant use of colour and picturesque scene setting ability and while this film doesn't have any colour just like with Black Sunday before it lack of colour hasn't stopped Bava from creating a wonderfully beautiful film. The visuals in the movie are amazingly fluid and Bava's ability to capture scenes is shown brilliantly. The black and white atmosphere also allows the great director to implement a lovely foreboding atmosphere into the plot and to be honest this movie is all the better for NOT having colour. As this is the film that laid down the blueprint for the Giallo subgenre it's plot is typically bare bones. We follow an American tourist called Nora Davis that has landed in Rome and quickly witnesses a murder. It isn't long before she realises that this murderer kills women in alphabetical order according to their last name...and 'C' has just gone.The biggest name in the cast is definitely John Saxon. This cult favourite has been in a number Italian horror films and he delivers a fine performance here too. Letcia Romn takes the lead role and fits it perfectly. She's elegant enough to be vulnerable but tough enough for us to believe that she'd try and solve the crime herself. The title of the film is an obvious homage to Hitchcock but Bava's real inspiration for the movie is obviously the pulp Italian mystery books 'Giallo'. The voice over that runs throughout the film helps to make the plotting feel more like we're reading a book as the narrator gives us insight into the lead character. Bava skilfully handles the plot as he builds up his red herrings enough to give the audience suspicions but not so much that they're too obvious. The climax to the mystery does become a bit too apparent as we near the end however and it's somewhat unlikely but Italian horror isn't usually known for making sense and being realistic so the cult fan will forgive this. I love a good Giallo and this is a very good one. On the whole The Girl Who Knew Too Much is highly recommended to the cult horror fan!".

When she arrives at Ethel's place she meets Dr. Marcello Bassi john Saxon and finds that the old lady is in the deathbed. During the night Ethel has a heart attack and dies Nora runs to the hospital to call Marcello. However she is attacked and robbed in a staircase by a thief and faints while awaking she witnesses a stabbed woman and a man after her. In the hospital nobody gives credit to her words. In the funeral the stranger Laura Craven Torrani Valentina Cortese introduces herself as a friend of Ethel and invites Nora to stay in her apartment while she travels to Switzerland to meet her husband. Nora accepts the invitation and decides to investigate the murder she believes that the serialkiller of the so called Alphabet Murders is chasing her and she will be the next victim.The Girl Who Knew too Much is an overrated melodramatic thriller of Mario Bava visibly inspired in Alfred Hitchcock. The awesome cinematography in black and white using shadows gives a fantastic atmosphere to the streets of Rome. However the hysterical Nora Davis is annoying in many moments and the attitudes of Dr. Marcello Bassi are silly and naive. The conclusion of Dora about the cigarette of marijuana is ridiculous. My vote is five.Title Brazil Not Available".

When she arrives at Ethel's place she meets Dr. Marcello Bassi john Saxon and finds that the old lady is in the deathbed. During the night Ethel has a heart attack and dies Nora runs to the hospital to call Marcello. However she is attacked and robbed in a staircase by a thief and faints while awaking she witnesses a stabbed woman and a man after her. In the hospital nobody gives credit to her words. In the funeral the stranger Laura Craven Torrani Valentina Cortese introduces herself as a friend of Ethel and invites Nora to stay in her apartment while she travels to Switzerland to meet her husband. Nora accepts the invitation and decides to investigate the murder she believes that the serialkiller of the so called Alphabet Murders is chasing her and she will be the next victim.The Girl Who Knew too Much is an overrated melodramatic thriller of Mario Bava visibly inspired in Alfred Hitchcock. The awesome cinematography in black and white using shadows gives a fantastic atmosphere to the streets of Rome. However the hysterical Nora Davis is annoying in many moments and the attitudes of Dr. Marcello Bassi are silly and naive. The conclusion of Dora about the cigarette of marijuana is ridiculous. My vote is five.Title Brazil Not Available";

	schema:reviewBody "This might be the craziest Stephen King adaptation ever made and yes I am aware of The Lawnmower Man. It's so fking intense from start to finish that it makes Stanley Kubrick's The Shining look like a Hallmark movie. The studio executives no doubt wanted to make a few bucks with a bythenumbers Bmovie and chose the director based on his past experience on a number of respectable movies no one could have predicted that he'd go ballsout crazy and treat a story about a mutant rat monster as if he'd been handed the script to Macbeth. A drifter named John arrives in the town of Gate's Falls and applies for a job in a ratinfested textile mill run by Mr. Warwick played by an unknown actor named Stephen Macht whose attempted Maine accent sounds more Transylvanian a deliriously evil man who rules not only the mill but the entire town with an iron fist. Warwick regularly strolls through the mill to laugh at how exhausted everyone is and knowingly sends his employees to their doom in the basement which is inhabited by a huge ratbat hybrid. This seems like an extremely counterproductive way to run a business but it's best not to question anything in this movie. Meanwhile an exterminator gone wrong Brad Dourif's performance will give you nightmares attempts to flush out the mill's rats and John sort of develops a relationship with the mill's secretary although even the romantic scenes are not handled calmly. As an example of the film's overall mood at one point Warwick sends John to help clean the basement the script probably said Warwick sends John to clean the basement but it plays out with Warwick and John staring each other down wildeyed as if Warwick had challenged John to a deathmatch it is indeed the most intense one character asks another to do a simple task scene in history.Basically everything in the movie is like that until the final sequence at which point the maniacal director apparently tore the script into confetti and threw it into the air because all nine levels of hell break loose. Our small cleaning crew including Warwick descends through a trapdoor and finds itself lost in a maze of wooden tunnels the mill being some kind of labyrinthine House of Leavesstyle structure that extends hundreds of feet below the surface of the earth and the ratbat begins killing them off. Warwick goes completely off the beam at this time and begins chasing John and his girlfriend through the tunnels after smearing his face full of black grease. He encounters the ratbeast and throws himself at it screaming We're going to hell... TOGETHUUUHHH!!! Somehow John and Jane descend even deeper and end up in a massive cavern packed full of human bones I could only imagine the director running around foaming at the mouth as he told his set design crew he needed the most gigantic cavern ever put on screen. Then through some miracle our man John makes it back into the textile mill and defeats the monster using and this is no less crazy than it sounds a Pepsi can. These final scenes are exhausting but the movie isn't about to let some trifle like an ending release its grip on the viewer because a nightmarish theme song then begins playing consisting of a bizarre techno beat with sounds of industrial machinery and bits of dialogue mixed over it. The tremendous amount of effort that was put into this thing forces me to rate it 810 any less and I am afraid the director might track me down and cut out my eyes or something.".

You need little imagination to smell the filth and dirt. David Andrews makes a superb antihero as the collegeboydrifter who takes it right up to Mill owner Warwick...as dislikable a screen presence as any and so well played by Stephen Macht. Loved the caddiebashing sequence. Brad Dourif as the Exterminator was simply out of his tree here  overacting?????  hardly! this is Brad Dourif we're talking about!So fourfifths of you heaped scorn on the ratbat? it was a BAT actually What the HELL does it matter WHAT it was  a feral chicken even? I've seen way worse monsters than this in my time around horror flicks. The production values on this film were high this was NOT a rabid elcheapo along the lines of HOWLING II !In case you're interested. I would rate this as one of the better horror flicks of the last millennium. If I'm losing my objectivity then it must be a case of collective hypnosis because everyone in this family and you're talking seriously varied tastes here likes this flick! I would rate it a 6.75 !".

	schema:reviewBody "You don't hear or read much about this movie based on a short story written by Stephen King and I think that's a shame. It sure ain't no big masterpiece but it got several things going for it. Though there is ONE aspect that makes this film very memorable ! The very creepy atmosphere. Graveyard Shift takes place is a textile factory during a very hot summer. Temperatures are so high the men have to work at night...during the Graveyard Shift !You can actually feel the heat these men are working in. You can feel the sweat running down their back and you can feel the dirt on their bodies caused by the hard work. That's a very good mood being set. When it comes to the level of scary I would dare to say that some scenes equal to that of Arachnophobia... Because the hideous little creatures here are rats and these animals scare and disgust people as much as spiders do. Graveyard Shift contains some great acting performances as well. Andrew Divoff is a decent actor and the guy who plays Warwick is fantastic ! He has the face of a natural born bastard so the role he plays fits him very well. I don't know his name but he reminds me of Fred Ward. I'll keep my eyes open for possible other movies he starred in. And then there's ...Brad Dourif!! This guy always delivers !!! Whether he plays in big budget productions like LOTR The Two Towers or in small obscure horror films he's always brilliant. Especially here as the Exterminator. His little Vietnam anecdote is the best scene in the whole film. He's still too underrated if you ask me. So these are all good elements no ? Then why is Graveyard Shift not up there with the big titles in the genre? Well the low budget obviously killed this movie. Most scenes are very dark and hard to follow. The big monster is supposed to be very impressive but you're never able to see it properly. Half of the time you're wondering what? ...what happened ?? Real shame and waste. I'm convinced that with a few clear and decent special effects and makeup this movie could have been one of the best horror films of the 90's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films like this one were released by the bucket load in the 1980's but as 1990 approached they became less and less common. Still there are a lot of silly horror flicks that were released in the 90's debut year and surprisingly this one isn't all that bad. It lacks all the elements that make great films great films of course things such as brains coherency and any whisper of characters has been neglected in favour of monster special effects and a few nice death scenes but seriously that's all you want from a film like this so to say that Graveyard Shift does it's job isn't wrong. The film is based on a short story by Stephen King. Nearly everything that King has ever touched has been turned into a film with a lot of mixed results. I would put this one in the middling category which isn't a bad place to be in considering all the failed adaptations. The plot is typically thin it is a SHORT story! and it follows a man who gets a job in a cotton mill. The place is infested with rats and after being charged with cleaning the place up our hero finds a trapdoor and soon he and his team are up against the reason rats have made their home in the mill...One thing that really stands out about this film is the atmosphere. Director Ralph S. Singleton delights in presenting a fetid and disturbing aura around the central location and this helps the story massively and gives the film an almost 'odyssey' approach when the characters finally make their way underground. I don't find rats scary personally but many people do and this film could easily be a reason why! The way that the rats surround the characters is brooding and frightening and provides the film with one of it's key elements. Acting definitely isn't a key element of Graveyard Shift but the appearance of popular cult actor Brad Dourif will please many of this films' audience. I'm not a massive of fan of Dourif personally but I respect his ability to shine in campy productions. The story doesn't offer anything in the way of a point and it's incoherency will annoy many  but if you go into this film with the right sort of expectations and don't think you're about to see a horror classic Graveyard Shift really shouldn't disappoint.".

It's simple schlock and awe goo and slime for 90 minutes straight every human character either an unsettling nutcase or cardboard stock archetype. There's just something so Midnite Movie esque about it though a sense of fun to its gigantic hollowed out mess of a textile mill in which some kind of vile denizen stalks a night crew that pretty much deserves everything they get. People wander about squabble and are picked off in ways that get steadily more gruesome until the final reveal of the monster in some overblown pusspalooza of a finale. What more do you need in your bottom feeder helping of horror? Steven Macht is the sleazebag who runs the mill at his tyrannical whim while David Andrews is the closest thing you'll find to a stoic protagonist. Andrew 'Wishmaster' Divoff shows up as a stock character but it's Brad Dourif who chews scenery and ends up the only memorable person as the world's most simultaneously intense and incompetent exterminator a bug eyed little weirdo who freaks people out with extended monologues about Viet Nam when he should be perusing corridors to find whatever's lurking there. The monster itself if I remember correctly is one big pile of grossly misshappen poopy prosthetic puppetry as is often the case in early 90's King fare. Would you want it any other way? Simple efficient and impressively gory is what you'll find on this shift.".

	schema:reviewBody "Graveyard shift is set in a textile mill that from the outside looks like a large house. It also has a small run down graveyard next to it that is constantly enshrouded in mist and fog no matter how sunny and clear it is elsewhere. It's late at night a worker is operating a machine called a 'picker'. He notices rats everywhere the mill is infested with them. He picks one up and puts it into the machine which slices the rat up into little pieces. Then he notices a shadow someone or something is behind him he turns around there is a loud squealing noise he screams and falls into the machine. Chopped up bits of his body emerge from the other side which the rats begin to nibble on. This unfortunate 'accident' means there is a job vacancy at the mill. A drifter named John Halls David Andrews wanders into town and sees an advert in a local diner for the position at 'Bachman Mills'. He talks to the supervisor Mr. Warwick Stephen Macht and is given the job that of operating the picker from 11pm to 7am which is dubbed the 'graveyard shift'. Shortly after starting work Warwick gives Halls a chance to earn double pay. He is assembling a clean up crew to tidy up the basement. Halls agrees along with four other workers Charlie Carmicheal Jimmy Woodward Brogan Vic Polizos Danson Andrew Divoff and Warwick's ex wife Jane Wisconsky Kelly Wolf. While cleaning up Halls discovers a trap door they all venture down inside only to become trapped and be killed off one by one by a giant ratbat monster!Directed by Ralph S. Singleton this is a seriously poor stupid and incredibly clichd horror film. The script by John Esposito based on a short story by Stephen King is terrible. The fog enshrouded graveyard characters who argue with each other and split up rather than help each other to survive a stupid overthetop exterminator Brad Dourif who takes his job ridiculously seriously and rambles incoherently on about past exploits and Vietnamese trained rats who becomes the 'comedy relief' plus a blossoming relationship between the two leads which becomes stronger as the film goes on because of the situation they find themselves in. Every clich in the book is here you can easily figure out who's going to die and who's going to survive. The scenes in between the ratbat monster attacks are really dull and uninteresting I just sat there waiting for the next special effects scene hoping it's not too far away. No explanation for the giant ratbat monster is given at all not a single reason for it being there or how it was created. It's just sort of there and that's it we have to accept it. The acting is uniformly bad Andrews has to be one of the most bland and uninteresting leading men ever! You can barely understand what Macht is saying because of his ridiculous accent. This film apparently cost 10500000! Where did all the money go? I bet the executives at Paramount had heart attacks when they saw what their money had brought! There's not even that much gore in it a chopped off foot a man with no hand and a couple of shots of blood splattering over walls and furniture and that's it. No nudity either I'm afraid. The monster is never really completely seen just shots of it's head claws tail and wings although I thought the effects looked alright. A real wasted opportunity this film adds nothing new to the horror genre and is pretty poor. Definiteatly one to avoid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King and Hollywood has always had an unsteady relationship. For every good to decent film produced from the prolific horrormeister's works MiseryPet SemetaryStand By Me there have been several more middling to downright awful ones Children of the CornThe Lawnmower ManThe Dark Half. Graveyard Shift a 1990 adaptation of King's same named short story is absolutely in the latter category. Graveyard Shift is a complete waste of time and celluloid devoid of any scares laughs or any other redeeming quality. If you want a bottom of the barrel Stephen King film look no further than this travesty.Set in a cotton mill in what I guess is supposed to be Maine one character references Castle Rock King's well known fictional Maine town Graveyard Shift begins with a character who likes to shoot rats with rocks being attacked by . . . something . . . and then dying in the cotton picker. Into town walks John Hall Dave Andrews a drifter looking for work who lands a job at the mill under the direction of the rather unkind and potentially unhinged foreman Warwick Stephen Macht. Warwick is a rather despicable character using the female employees to fulfill his sexual needs while trying to cut a few bucks here and there in regards to worker safety. When he is ordered to clean up the basement or be shut down he recruits several of the plant workers for the job but they quickly realize that there is . . . something . . . down there in the basement with them.Graveyard Shift is the kind of film that used to be cranked out in the 1970s and 80s by major studios I suspect because they were cheap to make and even with a lower than average box office compared to major films they still managed to turn a decent profit for the studio. Because it is almost certain no one was greenlighting Graveyard Shift because it promised to be a good movie. And a good movie is definitely not what director Ralph S. Singleton and screenwriter Jon Esposito have supplied. There is nothing of value in Graveyard Shift. The characters are almost exclusively ciphers existing for no other reason than to be picked off one by one by the film's creature that lives in the mill. Main character John Hall has no development to speak of and the attempt by the filmmakers to create a relationship between him and female worker Jane Kelly Wolf is dead on arrival. Neither character is interesting or heck even really present other than to serve as something for the camera to be focused on most of the time.Stephen Macht provides a seemingly hissable villain in the form of Warwick but he is almost completely a caricature a creation of the screenplay to give us someone to root against not a three dimensional character. When he goes off his rocker towards the end of the film it is completely out of left field not something that has been building throughout the narrative. The only character who is even vaguely interesting is the exterminator called in to deal with the rat problem at the mill played by Brad Dourif. His exterminator holds a personal vendetta against rats due to their use in torture when he was in Vietnam and I wonder if some material intended for his character was transplanted to Warwick at some point in the rewrite stage of development. But slightly interesting doesn't equal necessary and Dourif's character is even given the weakest most pointless sendoff of any of the film's characters.The makeup effects of the creature are acceptable I guess but we are never given much of a good look at it. But for the most part the film's gore quotient one of the reasons people would show up to these films is pretty limited. And there is certainly no tension scares or suspense to speak of. Never once was I concerned for anyone on screen and there is a jump scare or two but nothing remarkable and many of them are predictable.Graveyard Shift was released in 1990 at the end of the horror film era of the previous two decades before the genre would go into remission for a few years before being reborn with the self referential Scream series followed by Hollywood's brief dalliance with JHorror. And frankly if Graveyard Shift is representative of what the genre brought to the table then it was deserving of being buried.".

The story is about a group of workers who are instructed by their boss to clean out the rat infested basement of the mill they work at. Meanwhile a few other people have been murdered by a mysterious creature roaming the workplace. Also there is a hoard of rats down there which love to lick up human blood. So as soon as the cleaning crew start their work they get attacked by the huge creature and many of them die. The creature's death at the end is done well but it doesn't make up for the boring movie.Now I still don't know what the hell the huge creature is at the end. It's supposed to be a giant rat I think but it looks like a bat. Maybe it's a mutation who knows? It does look gruesome though. The death scenes involve lots of gruesome gore as well. The problem with this film which was originally a short story is that it goes on and on too long. It's very dull and just plain boring at times. And I have to say watching this film I wonder if the actors were told not to shower at all during the making of it. They all looked so dirty and nasty. The grittiness of the movie is at an extreme.And all of the characters are plain scum. As viewers you root for them to die in a way just so they'll shut up. Like the guy down in the basement killing rats with a water hose. Did he have to scream every time he pumped out the water? That scene went on for a good three minutes. I couldn't wait for him to be off my screen. This is one of Stephen's King's worst adaptions. Children the Corn is often frowned upon when King's films are mentioned but this is far worse.310".

	schema:reviewBody "Heh man I actually saw this in the theater when it came out if you can believe that. And in all honesty I think I do remember feeling at the time that I wasn't overly impressed. But I just watched an excellent HD Print of the film and I must admit that looking at it now I really appreciated it a LOT more than I did initially.Have you actually SEEN a lot of the Stephen King adaptations...? I'm not talking about the amazing Classic ones like 'THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' which is likely one the GREATEST films ever made or the other Classics like 'THE SHINING' or even 'SALEM'S LOT' but I'm talking about the runofthemill other ones. Normally I find quite a few of them very overdone plastic and not terribly engaging. But this one I felt was actually done fairly well for the type of film that it is.Remember this is just your basic Monster movie BUT with a really nice Gothic look and feel. I also REALLY liked the soundtrack which I thought was quite effective and added a lot to the mood LOVED the male choir! Apparently even though the director never directed another film I truly felt that he did a very good job crafting not only the excellent atmosphere look and sound of the film but with SO damn many 'Horror' movies today filled with atrocious 'acting' I thought he did a great job bringing out the qualities of the characters in a more realistic way. That is one point in which I feel that many of King's adaptations do NOT do well. In my lowly and wretched opinion in most cases the characters come across as 2 dimensional empty stereotypes that are completely unbelievable. And even though this story had the requisite and mandatory Redneck types that flood King's work in THIS case I think that the director had them come across in a much more believable and coherent way that didn't detract from the story like it has many times before.I guess I am kind of a sucker for this type of Old School Monster movie ESPECIALLY when there is a strong Gothic look and atmosphere to it. Add to that the frigg'n OUTSTANDING performance by Brad Dourif naturally... and the surprisingly restrained but effective one by the boss dude I personally thought he blew away the leading guy with the quality of his performance you end up with a pretty good entertaining old fashioned Horror movie that I felt was a lot of fun.I probably was a TAD generous with a '7' rating and if I was grading it compared to ALL genres of Horror films of course it wouldn't measure up as much. BUT... and it is a BIG BUT like Mariah Carey's... Compared within the TYPE of Horror movie that it is I honestly felt that it was above average and merited a '7'So I would say that as long as you DO like these older Retro Horror films especially with a nice moody Gothic atmosphere and if you also like a good Creature Feature I think that there is a good chance that you will enjoy it...".

	onyx:emotionText "Heh man I actually saw this in the theater when it came out if you can believe that. And in all honesty I think I do remember feeling at the time that I wasn't overly impressed. But I just watched an excellent HD Print of the film and I must admit that looking at it now I really appreciated it a LOT more than I did initially.Have you actually SEEN a lot of the Stephen King adaptations...? I'm not talking about the amazing Classic ones like 'THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION' which is likely one the GREATEST films ever made or the other Classics like 'THE SHINING' or even 'SALEM'S LOT' but I'm talking about the runofthemill other ones. Normally I find quite a few of them very overdone plastic and not terribly engaging. But this one I felt was actually done fairly well for the type of film that it is.Remember this is just your basic Monster movie BUT with a really nice Gothic look and feel. I also REALLY liked the soundtrack which I thought was quite effective and added a lot to the mood LOVED the male choir! Apparently even though the director never directed another film I truly felt that he did a very good job crafting not only the excellent atmosphere look and sound of the film but with SO damn many 'Horror' movies today filled with atrocious 'acting' I thought he did a great job bringing out the qualities of the characters in a more realistic way. That is one point in which I feel that many of King's adaptations do NOT do well.

As far as the budget is concerned GS is mediocre but the way this tale has been presented makes this film bit outlandish. The plot is simple but the cause is freaky.

We soon watch John Hall David Andrews taking role of a night shift worker. Others are astonished to see John take the night shift. The shift has a notorious past because it took the life of old workers. We also come to know that the deaths have something to do with rats.

John is bullied by his fellows Danson Divoff and Brogan Polizos but he wants to keep his profile low. John also shares some pleasant intimacy with his coworker Jane Kelly Wolf which is despised by Warwick. Time goes by and other incidents of disappearances take place.

However John still has his time for the final showdown.The film succeeds in taking the viewers to discomfort. Unlike any other ambiguous horror farce that is trashed out in the name of horror this doesn't lose grip. A newbie to horror may take it for a slow starter and soon start pigeonholing this gem of a film with other inferior squibs. This film has a strange atmosphere that gets tedious and intolerable due to the presence of rats. Well consider yourself working past midnight at a mill with no ventilation heavily enervated and badly perspiring.

	schema:reviewBody "With more of an accent on comedy than romance Jumping Jacks turns out to be more of a Jerry Lewis than a Dean Martin picture. Usually Dean got one or two good songs in one of their films here he got none and didn't even bother to record any of the material written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston.But Jerry got a ton of laughs as the former comedy partner of Dino who's been drafted into the army and is now a paratrooper. Dino's got himself a nice lush assignment there he's got to put on a talent show and maybe get himself a permanent berth doing that sort of thing if he can only impress General Ray Teal. But the amateur talent Dino has from the army pool has its limits.What to do but trick is hapless former partner into visiting him on the base at Fort Benning and take the place of one of the other soldiers and be in the show. It works only too well as Teal singles out Lewis and really loves the idea of the show traveling to other bases as is. Now the Airborne Rangers are stuck with Jerry Lewis.And Dino and the rest of the guys are stuck with keeping the con up to the extent of fooling their new sergeant Robert Strauss. Watching Strauss we get an idea of what his character the Animal must have been like before he became a prisoner at Stalag 17. He and Lewis form a curious bond.Speaking of Stalag 17 another cast member from that great film that would be coming from Paramount a year after Jumping Jacks is Richard Erdman. Erdman if you'll remember played barracks chief Sergeant Hoffman in Billy Wilder's classic. In Jumping Jacks if Jerry Lewis is the Schlemiel Erdman is the Schlamazel as Dogface Dolan the soldier who Jerry takes the identity of. Erdman cuts himself in for quite a few laughs himself.The service comedy stuff is reworked a lot from previous films Buck Privates and Keep 'Em Flying from AbbottCostello come to mind. The finale is straight from Keep 'Em Flying. But I do like the way Lewis distinguishes himself in the war games which has some really good moments for Jerry.Still the weakness of Jumping Jacks is Martin is relegated almost to the side. You know that when the best number in the film is done by Mona Freeman and Jerry Lewis at the beginning A Boy In A Uniform.Paramount and Hal Wallis brought Dean and Jerry and the whole crew to Fort Benning Georgia the army's Airborne Headquarters to shoot the film. I'm sure the troops we see here who were no doubt on the way to Korea liked getting in the movies.Jumping Jacks is a good MartinLewis comedy but definitely more Lewis than Martin.".

While this idea is ridiculous it's even more so when Jerry is stuck in the paratroopers and cannot get outeven though he really wants to.This film finds Jerry Lewis at his most spastic and even louder than usualmaking you wonder how anyone could possibly mistake him for a soldier or human! In addition because of the performing angle there are a larger than usual number of musical numbersalong with dancing and other choreography. If you like this you're in luck. As for me this mix created a less satisfying sort of Martin  Lewis film. Fortunately the film was saved somewhat by the notion of idiot Jerry accidentally succeeding and becoming a great soldier! But to me this isn't enough to make this anything other than a loud timepasser.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starting in 1949 and through the early 1950s Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis made 16 films together. Their matchup is the familiar one of comedy teams. A straight man who often gets the gal and a goofup klutz or clown. So we had had Laurel and Hardy Crosby and Hope and Martin and Lewis. This is one of the earlier MartinLewis comedies. As with most of their films Dean's singing and their comedy routines play in the plot. So we get a little singing and dancing along with a wacky story of sorts. After Chick Martin goes in the Army Hap Smith Lewis finds himself a female partner for a new show. But before they can get launched in the big time Chick calls for help that only Hap can provide. So he sneaks on base to help with a show for the troops. Well it's not hard to imagine what happens from there on. The base is a fictitious one of course but for this one Paramount did some film shooting at Ft. Benning GA and the Army parachute school. While this and similar films still bring a chuckle here and there they don't seem as funny as they must have been to audiences in the mid 20th century. I remember watching these in theaters as a youngster. Slapstick can still be good and very funny but I think the comedy with actors completely changing their voices was a phase from that period that hasn't lasted. This film is OK for some laughs and the music and comedy. The rest of the cast provide nice support for the two leads.".

Lewis often makes an admirable stooge for Strauss but just as often he is too inclined to hog the camera. His solo segments and bits with less amusing players such as Freeman and Martin could be cut to the film's advantage. But two support players to be retained in full are Ray Teal as an overreactive general and especially Richard Erdman who has the role of his career here as the real but striving to be innocuous Dogface. His shaving routine with Strauss and his underthetable sandwich act with Strauss and Lewis are the comic highlights of the picture.After a comparatively late entrance Martin has little to do than sing a few ballads in a couple of indifferently and most economically staged production numbers. Also hovering around  even more so  on the sidelines is Don DeFore whose role seems mostly to consist of looking daggers at Lewis from the near background.Taurog has directed with his usual unimaginative efficiency whilst Fapp has adopted a grainy style in order to seamlessly blend his stars' material with copious stock footage. But for all the location lensing production values are extremely modest.OTHER VIEWS Martin  Lewis fans will doubtless find this quite a passable comedy while those who can't stand the pair will indubitably give it a miss  so there's not much use writing a review. However Robert Strauss contributes a few laughs as a harassed sergeant while Richard Erdman is perfectly cast as the innocent schnook and there is one really hilarious sequence with Erdman under the table in a dining car. However most fans will have seen the climax before. It's almost identical to Laurel and Hardy's routine in Great Guns 1941 where it was at least ten times funnier.

TO some extent it's sort of predictable although most films are...aren't they? This is more Jerry Lewis' film than Dean Martin's but I couldn't help but think as the film progressed that had you taken Dean out of all the scenes what would be left? Mugging.Dean has a couple of good numbers. The Parachute Jump didn't rate a Capitol recording but it's a nice production number and Dean does it well and why wasn't it recorded on Capitol? It's not a love song!. Similarly The Big Blue Sky is another militarilythemed production number not suitable for a Capitol release but features a rather nice vocal performance by Dean. I Know A Dream When I See One is a more traditional love song by Dean. And Keep A Little Dream Handy is a nice Martin  Lewis duet.Both Dean and Jerry pretty much follow their film traditions here. Dean is clearly the straight man while Jerry does far too much mugging. Robert Strauss was probably born to play an army sergeant and he's entertaining to watch. Other supporting actors include Don DeFore 9 years before his best known role in television's Hazel. It's nice to see Ray Teal so often a supporting actor in Westerns and in Bonanza as the sheriff.Parts of the movie were filmed at Fort Benning in Georgia and you can learn a bit about paratroopers and their training in the somewhat silly film action. All in all a decent film comedy though probably more for the audiences of the early 50s than today.".

I went with expectations to see good 3D effects sometimes a movie may not be up to the mark but special effects and 3D feel keeps you glued to the screen but not this one. Throughout the movie i can count and say there are only three instances where you feel that its a 3D movie one when title appears A Sohan Roy Film two when the title appears  DAM 999 and three... well find it for yourself because now my conscience kills to write so badly about something. All in all the movie fails to reflect the tragedy sorrow or helpless situation of the people which is very expected when such an event occurs mostly because it spent all its time in portraying the tension between the two love birds who cant be together for astrological reasons but the the director fails to even build up that emotional attachment and deliver it to the hearts of the viewers. In conclusion I would say you can watch the movie for the sake of it but don't expect any hair raising scenes Spectacular 3D experience as the poster claims better don't hope anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all... .let me tell you..If you are expecting visual effects like '2012' please don't watch this movie.. If you expect the thrill of a chaotic situation as like in'Armageddon' don't watch this movie.. If you expect the tragics of a disaster situation as like in'The day after tomorrow' don't go watch this movie... This is a movie apart from all those genres which deals with a disaster situation in a different kind of way although that way fails to make a mark as the directorscript writer would have expected it to be..... The main drawback of the movie is it's selection of cast for pivotal roles.... To be 1stlet's take the case of the protagonist of the movieVinay whose acting is just terrible.. . He lacks expressions and the mere artificiality in his acting is clearly visible all through out the movie! The movie doesn't specify much about the dam although it depicts life of people around the dam in a rather interesting? way.. The cinematography is awesome as it cared to suck up every minute aspect about the scenic beauty of the locations... And when it comes to acting The villain Durai is in a class above all others who are cast in the movie.. His acting is flawless and we can't demand more from him owing to the poor script... And when we're coming to the VFX part it can be considered notable considering this is an Indian home production and no Hollywood biggies in VFX were roped in.. Two of the 4 main female characters did justice to their roles..namely Vimala Raman and Linda Arsenio.. Others' acting are just okay or below average.. The movie lacks intensity where it's mostly in demand in the dam bursting sequences... Also..the portrayal of death n it's after effects are likethey're of lesser importance in the movie.. Actually the real protagonist the Dam comes into play only in the 2nd half of the movie... We feel like whether it's the story of the dam or whether the dam disaster is just like a sidedish while the story is revolving around the lost love of the protagonist.... The movie can be rated an average one with a rating of 610 as far as I am concerned...".

	schema:reviewBody "DAM 999 can easily be rated as a project with probably the best pre release publicity received in 2011 both by effort and by chance. To have an idea just sample the below mentioned points related with the promotion of the film which can easily influence any serious cinema lover to go for it at the earliestAn Indian English film whose screenplay gets officially selected for The Oscar Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts  Sciences even before its release for the first time in India.According to the makers 'The film is a tribute to the1975 Banqiao Dam disaster in China that claimed 250000 innocent lives'. But the Indian Political authorities take it in a different way and BAN the movie in Tamil Nadu on the grounds that it can disturb friendly ties between the State and Kerala related with Mullaperiyar Dam in the region.The rumors spread that the movie is about What will happen if the Mullaperiyar Dam collapses due to any reason?The official website of the film names many International Film Festivals where the film has strongly made its presence felt amongst the various appreciable films coming from all over the world.The posters and publicity material of the film are all beautifully designed showing a big dam with loads of water all over suggesting a great Disaster Movie on the lines of Hollywood with some exceptional graphics and that too in 3D.One of the taglines on the posters says  'Take the journey of a lifetime  Nine characters Nine moods and a crumbling dam of emotions... DAM 999  experience it in 3D!'. Probably indicating towards the 'Nine Rasas' of human emotions.Now who would not like to watch this film called DAM 999 after going through all these prerelease proceedings related with the project. So being in the same state of mind I also went to see it eagerly with a hope to witness something out of the box as projected. But unfortunately it couldn't fulfill majority of the expectations raised by its brilliant prerelease hype with its weak handling of an interesting script and mediocre performances.First of all I really couldn't understand the selection of its script for the Oscar Library. The story is no doubt interesting with a lot of emotional touch but its surely not anything which can be treated as capable of being the source material for the students of cinema all over the world. The tag line of DAM 999 does indicate towards The Ancient Indian Concept of Navarasas or the nine human emotions depicted in its script. But I really didn't find much of that in its plot because if seen from this angle then most of the Indian films are always made around these 9 human emotions only.Secondly on one hand all its publicity material posters and promos were presented featuring the Dam Disaster very prominently. But on the other the film has only its last 1520 minutes given to the Dam and rest of it focuses completely on the love and relationships progressing between its various characters. And to be straight DAM 999 is more of a touching painful love saga and very less of a Disaster movie as wrongly projected by the makers which remains the major factor working against it. Moreover due to this same reason the 3D attraction also doesn't work in the film with just a few above average graphics strangely credited to a mixed technical team including many foreign names.So there is nothing even close to what you see in its promotional campaign to be precise. Content wise it has a story based on two characters who do love each other from their early childhood but are never able to become a couple due to their own destiny till the disaster separates them forever. Their true but controlled love is compared to a DAM which breaks open one day due to its huge pressure. The cast is an amalgamation of Indian  foreign artists who are not able to make any kind of contribution with their mediocre acting. But still I found a few positive things in this sincere attempt as given belowThe film takes you into a different culture and outdoor locations of South India Kerela with a soft introduction to AYURVED  An alternative healing therapy raising many positive questions in mind about the ancient method of medicine and the inviting scenic beauty of South India.It is originally made in English but I really liked the idea of using 3 different songs in Hindi English and one in south Indian language probably Tamil in the film quite intelligently. Among its all below average to average performances there is one worth mentioning act coming from Vimala Raman who superbly plays the quite suffering girl as the main victim of her own cruel destiny which surely needs to be appreciated.Hence DAM 999 is not a great film with a well designed Publicity Campaign supported by pretty weak execution of its basic theme. But I would still rate it better than all the RASCALS and DESI BOYZ because it at least doesn't treat the viewers as mere fools coming to the theater.".

It is all about a couple separated from loving each other due to having an inauspicious horoscope  I kid you not if they snog the World falls off its axis type thing. This is against a background of a colonial throw backs' son who is actually played by an American. A one hundred year old colonial era dam is about to be replaced by a much larger Indian one. Only the usual money grubbing and political shenanigans has meant that corners have been cut.The characters run around being in and out of love with each other whilst we all wait for the monsoon rains to deliver the much promised for 'money shot' and that is the dam falling over. It is not a plot spoiler by the way as this is the films' whole raison d'tre. We have sub plots to do with alternative medicine and spirituality  which I felt would have made a better film.The acting is not just wooden it is veneered in places bad casting has added to this there are also a number of frames where the 'actor' deliberately delivers their lines direct to camera. This may have been for the 3 D version but it is just stilted as is the ever too bright lighting that makes this look like it was all filmed during a super nova which would have been the only real star in this entire production.The special effects are quite pass at best and at one time you want to shout 'it's a model' I mean this was bigged up for it great CGI etc and what we get is paltry and only for a few minutes of screen time. So not really a disaster film disastrous some may say but not up there with any of the classics. I don't know why this won any awards let alone so many including Best English language Film at Sangli Film Festival possibly the only other entry was 'Debbie does Dallas  3'?. I also don't know how I got to the end I did fast forward a few times but this was the most unedifying film I have seen for a considerable while and would avoid everything by Director Sohan Roy from now on. The 10 out of 10 'reviews' for this on IMDb also seem to be from people associated with the film but overall as of today it gets 3.7. I would give this a 3 so 2 stars is being generous. Only watch this if you are Sohan Roy as a form of punishment or you were in it  ostensibly for the same reason.".

On screen the audience gets to see the life of 9 characters entangled in 9 scenarios which ends up with a disaster. The dam disaster has come out really well lets keep in mind this is not a high end disaster movie similar to that of 2012 but it conveys its purpose. The director has put in a lot of effort to share about India which is still not very sound among the international audience. The soundtracks were quite colorful in multiple languages. A family entertainer and a awareness spreading effort by the director and the national award winners in it.Overall the movie was a nice experience worth watching once preferably in 2D as 3D is needed only towards the dam collapse sequence which comes in the second half.".

The 3D added depth to the visuals and dam disaster scenes were crafted with great GFX supported by nice BGS. The story holds it uniqueness and freshness and the craftsmanship of the director is commanding. Locales were beautiful and captured nicely by the cinematographer. Songs were a mixture traditional western and desi beats and the duet song stand apart. To summarize the movie is worth a watch and a mustwatch for all south Indian states.".

I am not a big fan of Mel Gibson I thought that he is just average but too overrated actor. So you can understand why I didn't expect too much from this movie. But now I want to apologize to Mr. Gibson. In this overlooked masterpiece he proves himself incredibly good both as an actor also as a director. The story was absolutely great realistic and touching. Relations between two main characters  former teacher and young student boy perfectly played by Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl were shown as great as it possible. It was for sure best Mel Gibson performance ever. Young Nick Stahl acting also looked incredibly good as Chuck Norstadt. All supporting casts also did a very good job in their roles Director and whole cast team brought to us incredibly powerful atmosphere of total misunderstanding in Chuck family and in the whole town. People can't understand and worst of all they don't want to understand other people who are not like all ordinary people in their small town. If you're not like all  you're odd and nothing more. This movie teach us never judge people only by appearance and groundless suspicions teach us always look inside the people. It was very strong powerful and important messages. All dialogs were very well written and very memorable. In addition to this cinematography and soundtrack were very good.So I consider The Man Without a Face as a stunning excellent film best Mel Gibson film one the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you're a Mel Gibson fan or simply love films with excellent story and perfect acting I highly recommend this film. Thanks a lot Mel and all people involved in this masterpiece.My grade 10 out of 10 or AThanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.

It's a simple case of an adult taking an interest in and making a difference in a young man's life.  The movie is even more poignant because McLeod loses the safety of the anonymity he had worked so hard for when he opens his mind and heart to young Charles.I have read all of the reviews on this site for this movie and object to those who attempt to review both the movie and the book at the same time. The movie should be reviewed here and the book at a site for reviewing books.  To do both at one time is akin to going to Burger King and ordering a Big Mac.You don't need to be a Mel Gibson fan to love this movie but you do need to have an open mind and an unfettered agenda.

Not only is it touching and heartwarming but it showcases one of the best actor turned directors in Mel Gibson. The Man Without A Face would be my choice for one of the most touching films I've ever seen. Gibson certainly knew what he was doing as performed along side a newcomer named Nick Stahl. I can't tell people enough positive things about this newcomer who possesses rare natural talent. Gibson played his character Justin McCleod the way actors should portray the characters.......with heart. I can't think of a film that showed the world the reality behind people in Justin's situation. Gibson crafted the story very carefully and it shows. Mel Gibson is an actor with heart and has brought it to big screen as McCleod. I would venture to guess that this role is not that far off than his reallife role as husband and father.When I saw this film I didn't have to do much but sit back eat popcorn and drink my soft drink. I knew it was going to be a moving touching and heartfelt film. However it turned out to be much more. I was pleasantly surprised how Gibson crafted this film into a work of art by using his knowledge of working in front of the camera.I knew by the end of this film everyone involved with this awesome film from the talented directoractor to the up and coming star along with the viewing audience had fun making and watching The Man Without A Face.I recommend this film to anyone and everyone young and old who loves movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I should perhaps point out that my comments below are based solely upon the film. Unlike a lot of reviewers I have not read the original novel by Isabelle Holland indeed I had never previously heard of either the book or its author.Mel Gibson's first film as director is set during one summer in the late sixties. Charles Norstadt a twelveyearold boy is on holiday with his mother and two halfsisters on an island off the coast of Maine. He has ambitions to attend the same military academy as his late father who he believes was a war hero but receives no encouragement from his mother Catherine who regards military schools as fascist and is firmly convinced that her son is too stupid to pass the entrance examination.Charles makes the acquaintance of Justin McLeod a painter living in a large house on the island. Because of his reclusive nature and because his face has been horribly disfigured in an accident McLeod is treated with a mixture of fear and mockery by his neighbours particularly the local children. Charles however discovers that McLeod was at one time a teacher and asks him to tutor him for the entrance exam. The gruff taciturn McLeod is at first reluctant but he gradually warms to the boy and a close friendship grows up between them. Charles comes to see him as a fatherfigure especially after he makes the unwelcome discovery that his own father was not a war hero but an alcoholic who abandoned his family and later committed suicide.Gibson initially wanted to cast another actor as McLeod but was eventually persuaded to play the role himself. I think that that was the right decision I have not seen all his films as an actor but of the ones I have seen I think that he gave his best performances in this one and in Zeffirelli's Hamlet. McLeod is a complex character who is more than an innocent victim. He is also haunted by feelings of guilt arising out of the car accident in which he was injured and his passenger one of his pupils was killed. It is these guilt feelings which have led to his becoming a recluse and to his refusing to have plastic surgery to correct his disfigurement. His mentoring of Charles can be seen as an attempt to make amends for his past. The young Nick Stahl is also very good as Charles.Gibson has the reputation of being one of Hollywood's more conservative figures and there are conservative aspects to The Man without a Face. Although the film is set during the Vietnam War a time when all things military were regarded with deep suspicion by a large section of American public opinion Charles' ambition to attend a military academy is presented as a laudable one. The politically liberal Catherine is too wrapped up in her own emotional needs to consider those of her children. She has been married several times her three children all have different fathers and many of Charles' emotional problems stem from his unstable family background and the lack of a fatherfigure in his life. The title The Man without a Face can refer to the disfigured McLeod but it can also refer to Charles' father who is without a face in the sense that his son has no mental image of him.In another respect however the film can be seen as having a liberal theme although not in the narrowly political meaning of that word. The local people's distrust of McLeod does not derive solely from his disfigured appearance. He is also rumoured to be a paedophile and his friendship with Charles is therefore seen by many including the local police chief as deeply suspicious. I note that one reviewer actually concludes that McLeod is a paedophile and that another thinks that the film would be more interesting if he were to be portrayed as one. I think both these viewpoints are wrong. It seems quite clear from the film that the relationship between McLeod and Charles is platonic and nonsexual. If it were otherwise McLeod would be a detestable character rather than a pitiable one and the film's key theme that of not judging people particularly those who are in some way different on the basis of suspicion rumour and unfounded accusations would be fatally undermined.Of Gibson's four films as a director I think that The Man without a Face is together with the very different The Passion of the Christ the best. It is a welltold human drama a sensitive exploration of the teacherpupil relationship and of the corrosive effects of suspicion and prejudice. It is certainly better than the overblown and overrated Braveheart for which he won an Oscar. 810".

	schema:headline " Fine Coming Of Age Debut From Gibson";
	schema:reviewBody "Mel Gibson's directorial debut is a fine coming of age film but it's also much more than that. Nick Stahl in his debut film plays a boy named Chuck in a family that is somewhat dysfunctional. Chuck wants to leave to go to military boarding school and follow in his father's footsteps. The problem is he failed in his first attempt to get in and now he resorts to being tutored by Gibson's disfigured character who has a questionable past. Along the way he learns lessons about friendship knowledge life and truth. Newcomer Stahl is fine as the young man who learns to question the majority and find out things for himself. Gibson is terrifically understated as the renaissance man forced to live in isolation after tragic circumstances. Their scarred backgrounds are what draws them together. The film takes a while to get going but once it does we are drawn into a special relationship between Stahl and Gibson. Gibson is a little obvious at times with the Shakespeare references from The Merchant Of Venice but they do not prevent the film from being ingratiating. Stahl's mother Margaret Whitton and sisters Fay Masterson and Gaby Hoffman who are all good have little to do in the film and the townsfolk are a bit one dimensional. The film is also somewhat predictable as it progresses. Despite these criticisms the film's message is not lost on us and it remains a very entertaining coming of age film. This is a very good debut film from Mel Gibson as director.  of 4 stars.".

I must say I am puzzled however. How can any of the posters to the boards for this film have any doubt about whether McLeod molested Charles or not? That was the whole point! When Charles runs to see McLeod for the last time and McLeod forces him to answer the question concerning McLeod's previous possible molestation of another boy the dialog answers the question for us unequivocally. If you don't get it then you are not paying attention. Open your eyes and your heart and your mind and let this film touch you.".

	schema:headline " Turns the theme of 'the beauty within' on it's head. spoilers for the book and movie";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Man Without a Face' is a story about a boy Chuck Norstadt played perfectly by a young Nick Stahl who seems to be the odd man out in his family. He is consistently at odds with his mother Margaret Whitton sadistic older sister Gloria Fay Masterson his mother's numerous dull stepfathers 'The Hairball' is played by Richard Mauser and sometimes his youngest sister Megan Gabby Hoffman. You get a perfect sense of these inhibited relationships with his family during the opening sequence with Chuck describing his dream. He seems to be misunderstood especially when he is constantly reminded that he is the family dummy. He just wants out. And boarding school is his opportunity.Chuck desperately needs to figure out a way to bone up on his academics and pass an entrance exam which he knows he can't do on his own. That's when he meets Mr. McCleod the town recluse. Badly burned from a car accident and carrying a dark secret he has become the topic of much gossip. He is essentially the Quasimodo of their sparsley populated summer village and the people like to cruely entertain themselves with suspicions of Hamburger Head McCleod. Lucky for Chuck McCleod was a former teacher who reluctantly agrees to tutor Chuck and the boy has to stick with it as much as he fears McCleod and hates his teaching methodsMcCleod is pretty authoritarian at first. But over time McCleod becomes Chuck's closest if not only friend the other kids on the cove don't really seem to be friends in that sense. He becomes a great tutor for Chuck as well as a surrogate paternal figure and a source of much needed emotional guidance for Chuck. He comes to look past the disfiguring scars of Justin McCleod and see him for the person he really is. McCleod too learns from Chuck. In the book author Holland defines this as his 'golden cocoon' the unfettered place where Chuck and McCleod share a bond and it seems like nothing can go wrong.But something does go wrong. In the movie the towns suspicions tear apart the friendship as McCleod's secret is revealed and it seems like Chuck can't convince anyone how foolish and impulsive they're being which is likewise destructive to someone as fragile as Chuck. It seems to him like whenever he has something good someone always wants to take it away from him. It is a remarkably good movie about trying to get past the ignorance that prevents people from really getting to know one another and such ignorance is usually dangerously destructive. And in this movie we get one of the worst case scenarios.'The Man Without a Face' is both a wonderful novel and movie although the movie turns the theme on it's head when they screenwriter Malcom MacRury and director Mel Gibson choose to rewrite the misunderstood McCleod as a heterosexual and make several reiterations of his sexuality while the text version of Justin McCleod was that he was a homosexual man and even the student came to learn and accept his own sexual orientation towards the end. The entire theme of the movie was about disregarding the town gossip and really getting to know someone for who they are. So why change that trait about the character? It seems so damn contradictory.The movie does more to illustrate a story about how willfull ignorance guides people's perceptions. The book is much more about Chuck's need for familial affection and guidance for confronting those things in life which he is most afraid ofsomething that is prevalent in the movie as well but not as much as the former. I can only guess that it was essential to write McCleod as a person who was mistakenly gay and suspected of molesting a student in order to create a conclusion to a story that would reemphasize how people believe what they want to when they hate something or someone they don't know about.I don't see why author Isabelle Holland who narrates the tale of Chuck Norstadt would get flack for her story as it is not one about pedophilia. A young boy is struggling to stop repressing things about himself that he finds difficult to deal with. One of those is sexual orientation which he finally realizes in the end and can honestly say that McCleod's teachings must have been effective since he was no longer ashamed of himself. But so what if the person who taught him to no longer be ashamed of himself was gay? Chuck didn't learn to accept himself because his teacher was gay but rather because of the advice of his teacher not to run away from his problems. The accusation that the story is pure pedophilia is ridiculous.With the exception of the central characters and the general story the movie and book are quite different from one another because it was necessary to expressing themes which are slightly different from one another. The novel is more about one person coming to terms with himself. The movie was more a statement about people in general. But both are very good engaging stories nonetheless. Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl both give great performances in this coming of age tale. The movie has often been overlooked especially when reviewing Mel Gibson's career. I'd consider it one of his best.".

I decided to open an exception this time and write a review about a movie on its anniversary. I selected The Man Without a Face.Well let me just start by saying that this is a pretty good and interesting film. The best thing Mel Gibson has ever done that's for sure. Not only he is part of the cast he also directed it. The story takes place in the Summer of 1968 and is rather simple but at the same time solid. It's a simple but great movie. Definitely approved. Although this movie is quite comical in many moments it also is a serious work that deals with very serious and dramatic subjects such as sadism family's problems misunderstood people a hostile society various types of tragedy anger depression etc....Chuck Nordstadt is one of cinema's funniest kids ever. He says some bombastic lines he has a wicked sense of humor and a sarcastic personality just as much he is a troubled kid at the same time. He is a high class cheat like Mr. McLeod says and openly a fan of John Wayne and he is the only one who loves his cat Mac. He also makes some of the most ridiculous and goofy facial expressions of all time something which always cracks me up. Nick Stahl is terrific in this role which is his best and most memorable one. Chuck despite being a teen has a babylike face. He's a cute kid. We mustn't also forget how ironic and funny it is a dog with the name Mickey and the fact of Gloria's boyfriend being nicknamed Flintstone by Chuck. It's impossible not to laugh with Chuck's morbid humor. Mel Gibson is awesome as the exteacher Justin McLeod and his burns look so real that they're almost chilling. He says some interesting Latin lines such as Aut disce aut discede Secare deo Stultus puer and Et tu Chuckus? as well as a funny line about women The problem is one of water.Beautiful landscapes also make this great underrated movie forests green places beaches mountains stunning views of the sea and so on... Chuck's mother has a nice and beautiful car a Citroen DS. That is such a great car! By the way Meg Chuck's youngest and clever halfsister has good taste for music the song they play in the car's radio at the beginning Sandy Posey's Born a woman is a very nice song!This should definitely be on Top 250.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favourite films Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt Stahl who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother and her many husbands his younger half sister  his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner this is where Justin McLeod Gibson comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship  judging people under assumptions.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of my favourite films Mel Gibson being my favourite actor has proved yet again what he can do with a role. Nick Stahl also does a brilliant job at playing Chuck Norstadt. Mel Gibson also made his Directing debut with this film and made it something special. A beautiful story about Chuck Norstadt Stahl who has an urge to get away from his family consisting of his mother and her many husbands his younger half sister  his older half sister who he has a bitter feud with. He is seen as a hard learner this is where Justin McLeod Gibson comes in. Chuck in order to get away from his family must pass an exam to get into a Military Academy his father attended. Justin having been disfigured in a car accident is considered a 'Freak' by many including Chuck until they encounter each other. Chuck discovered Justin was a teacher and takes this opportunity to get him to tutor Chuck for the exam. Justin having lived alone for seven years is not interested in the idea until Chuck returns. Justin lives by the philosophy 'Learn or Leave' towards Chuck until their friendship grows. Brilliant performances making a brilliant story that will tug at your emotions each time you watch this film makes it truly something special. This film is beauty in every sense of the word and brings new light to friendship  judging people under assumptions.";

This is a story which needed to be told.Lacking in moral qualities? The whole movie is a moral statement about so many things.

Here's a prime example of that.'The Man Without a Face' is a funny human sensitive touching and harsh movie. It is a lesson of life and it deals a lot with life's problems and serious stuff. Besides there is also a lot of comedy which is a surprise for such a serious film. But the combination of these different elements is effective.Mel Gibson is someone I tend to find overrated as an actor and as a director. But with 'The Man Without a Face' he made a great movie and proved that after all he is worth something as a director and as an actor thanks to his great acting as Justin McLeod.Nick Stahl is brilliant as Chuck Norstadt. I love his acting he really convinces in whatever he does in this movie he's truly that expressive. Chuck is so funny his hilarious lines his strong personality his devilish sense of humor and the extremely goofy facial expressions he does when he is completely in the moon. He is also very inquisitive determined and stubborn It's also funny that although he is 14 years old his face is very childish making him look much younger than he is. However Chuck is also a troubled and enraged boy. I can't blame him with a father like he had a mother like that and an older halfsister like that no wonder he is a little crazy. Only his younger halfsister is decent.The film can also count with the help of a nice soundtrack with soft instrumental music and a great oldie song  Born a Woman by Sandy Posey as well as the simple fact that it takes place in Maine  which means it has beautiful vistas all natural. It is also worth for the old cars and those acquaintanceships in family and with neighbors and friends. Like I said before this movie is a lesson of life. You can actually learn a lot from it. It's interesting what is possible to learn from it.Title in Portugal 'Um Homem Sem Rosto'.".

On the one hand the hero played by Jason Scott Lee is constantly jumping from time period to time period so there's always some action or intrigue going on.  But amazingly at the same time the filmmakers manage to acknowledge all of the great moral or ethical dilemmas that a time altering premise provides.  It's thoughtprovoking and even a little emotional.  Basically the film is stuffed with great ideas good acting and decent action scenes.  The only way Timecop 2 suffers in comparison to the first is in the cinematography.  Whereas the first film had fantastically moody photography the sequel looks like an above average television film.  It has a too clean look to it.  It isn't horrible but it's not very cinematic either. In terms of action the film is exceptional at demonstrating fast brutal Jeet Kune Do moves.  I guess Jason Scott Lee has still been practicing since he did Dragon The Bruce Lee Story all of those years ago.Bottomline give Timecop 2 a try.  It's far better than it has any right to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this film on SciFi Channel at midnight one evening. After a good meal sitting in a relaxing chair you're liable to watch just about anything. Which is why I didn't immediately turn it off once I spotted the incredibly horrible visual effects at the beginning which just smacked of godawful DirecttoVideo cinema. That being said I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the film.The key to enjoying this film is to suspend disbelief. Pretend that you're looking at the German countryside not some foothills in the LA area shot through a Sepia filter. Pretend that a Chinese man dressed in a business suit in the 1800s wouldn't arouse a lot of suspicion. Above all pretend some of the more horrible special effects don't look as bad as they do. Once you've done that you'll enjoy the film a lot more.The performances by most of the cast are neither outstanding nor bad save for Thomas Ian Griffith who makes an incredibly good villain in this film. The plot of the film is almost secondary and unnecessary chock full of plot holes and serving only as a backdrop against which to set fight scenes and excuses to change the era. But if you went into this movie expecting something scientifically sound just stop remember that this is the sequel to a JeanClaude Van Damme movie.Were a few things changed in this movie specifically some of the horrid special effects two or three of the more illogical and confusing points of the plot the cheesy DirecttoVideo style overlays for the credits and most importantly the unbearably long final 10 minutes of the film it could have been worthy of a cinema release.Final verdict 510. It's worth watching if it happens to be on or worth buying if you spy the DVD for cheap. Really cheap.".

I loved the story and the moral conflicts that the main characters go through in being Time Cops. It was a pretty good role for the antagonist in this movie too. The movie contained one of the longest epilogues I have ever seen but they kept it entertaining so I didn't mind. Another really cool thing I personally loved is his use of Jeet Kun Do Bruce Lee's fighting style. He used it in the movie Dragon and did so well with it. For those that know a little about his fighting style and even for those who don't it is pretty awesome to watch. In a future movie I would love to see the characters spend more time with a particular historical event They were in Berlin for a total of maybe 7 minutes in the beginning of the film. I would love to see another Time Cop movie but only if Jason Scott Lee plays in it again! It's a Tivo keeper ".

	schema:headline " Combines SciFi  Martial Action fairly well";
	schema:reviewBody "First before watching this movie you should be aware that it is about time travel...therefore there is bound to be some inconsistencies and paradox problems and yes...the film does bump into some of these rather clumsily. If you are a movie viewer that demands perfect logic and continuity or a real time travel buff you will have to let it go for this film. Yes this movie is ABOUT time travel but it is NOT a time travel movie it is an Action movie. Secondly this is a sequel and thefore presumes some previous knowledge of the basic premise what a timecop's purpose is and some of the primary paradox problems as to what would happen to the present  future if you changed the past. I can say that this movie does try to follow most of the rules of time travel as outlined in the Star Trek TV shows a well known standard in science fiction circles. The movie starts out posing the question should Hitler be assassinated before he has time to put events into motion  what would then happen if he was?. The viewer gets to see what happens when someone wants to try and the Timecops have to stop it from happening or DO they?. Viewers may also want to know that the Timecop story about cops that monitor consistency  prevent history from being altered was a comic book before it was a movie. True time travel movies must address such issues in a consistent  believable manner and in this regard the movie is somewhat disappointing. However as an action movie that makes you think it generally succeeds.In my opinion it is far better than the first Timecop movie starring JeanClaude Van Damme 1994. Given the comic book  Van Damme history the target audience for this movie is going to be action  martial art movie fans. Jason Scott Lee as hotshot Timecop Ryan Chan does very well given the script  direction. Viewers may need to remind themselves that Lee is NOT related to Bruce Lee although he did play him in the movie Dragon the Bruce Lee Story 1993. For that movie Lee was trained in Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do style of martial arts. So not only does he physically look like Bruce Lee he also fights using the same moves. Seeing this I believe the director recognized that he would be unable to avoid the reference so he uses it consciously. In one fight scene there is deliberate homage paid to Bruce Lee. Timecop Ryan Chan after getting hit in a fight gets really mad and takes off his shirt flexing his muscles in the famous Enter the Dragon style. When you see this scene you will know why Jason Lee was picked to play Bruce in The Dragon... and why the director and likely the actor must accept  work with the inevitable references. For martial arts fans there are some fairly good albeit shortexamples of Jeet Kune Do style handworktrapping and a couple of Jeet Kune Do style limb traps  breaks. The martial arts kicks are all movie style  less than crisp. Thomas Ian Griffith is quite good in the supporting role even in the fight scenes however the movie watcher doesn't really see his character's motivation until the end of the movie. The movie's script is what you would expect given the Timecop movie history  story genre somewhat in the comicbook style although I have the impression that Lee did quite a good job fleshing out his lines. Overall the movie gets a bit muddled because of all the different time periods involved the period costumes are made necessary however to separate and enforce the different time linesand it is possible that the editing contributes to the confusion. Many of the fight scenes appear to be chopped or cut short while the special effects scenes although not overdone are a tad long. I imagine the editor of this movie had a hard time keeping a cohesive story line and flow given the topics. There are a lot of things going on in this movie all at once the good guy chasing the bad guy through different time periods shifting realities due to the changing of past events and even characters changing or existing  not existing depending on which reality you are watching. Not only does the bad guy want to kill Lee's character he also has the option of going back to almost any time period and kill his parents thus ending the Hero's family line. If that is possible then can the Timecop kill the bad guy given what has already happened? You'll have to watch! In a similar movie's plot line Jet Li's  The One 2001  one of my favorite timetravel movies these issues and paradox' are better addressed however I had to watch that movie 4 or 5 times to understand all the nuances. Although you probably won't want to watch Timecop The Berlin Decision again and again if you liked Jet Li's  The One you will probably enjoy this movie as well.".

Veteran TEC agent Ryan Chan Jason Scott Lee of Back to the Future 2 Lee fears he has been time jumping a few times too many. He complains about losing pieces of himself in those various eras. Chan isn't the only one concerned about the toll that too much time jumping is exerting on TEC agents. An exasperated female physician Doc Mary Page Keller of The Negotiator complains vociferously that the agents aren't given enough turn around time. She argues We're suspending them in their own reality and ripping them back and forth through time. She has evidence that cerebral hemorrhage has impaired one agent. Nevertheless O'Rourke John Beck keeps sending his goto boy Chan back into the breach. Villainous Brandon Miller Thomas Ian Griffith of Excessive Force wants to change history out of a sense of moral duty. I'm just saying if time travel is possible Miller opines we have a moral obligation to right the wrongs of the past. Chan thwarts him early on in Berlin when Miller attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler. He manages narrowly to save Hitler's life by knocking aside Miller and shooting Miller's wife Sasha as she is about to shoot Hitler. Miller winds up in prison but this wily fiend manages to escape and put the status quo into real peril. Since Timecop 2 lacks the beefy budget of its predecessor Slapshot 2 director Steve Boyum and Furious and the Furious scenarist Gary Scott Thompson have changed the focus ideas instead of big action. They advocate that time must remain the same. Interestingly enough they introduce a new source of antagonism. The Society for Authenticity sends people back to observe the past so that we remember it correctly. This organization creates no end of danger and Miller is the chief example. Timecop 2 does some other things differently too. They don't launch them the same way they did in the Van Damme epic. Instead of riding a rocket sled toward a dead end wall they sit in a chair and particles bombard them. Despite its straighttovideo look Boyum's thriller is still pretty entertaining. Boyum and Thompson lace the action with exposition straight out of the original movie. John Beck is suitably gruff as Chan's boss. Mind you Boyum is no Peter Hyams but he stages the action with a modicum of style.".

Have you ever wondered if you have the power to go back in time knowing your past world history what would it be if you change it acccording to your goodright moral sistem would it really be in for a better world? what if hitler would never existed what if something have had worked in other way that you really knew but if someone had changed before you have ever been born how can you know that it was the other way around It's a puzzle allright but a nice one. Only they know the real truth only they are allowed to travel through time to put history on the natural course to be sure that what time sealed by its passing would stay the same. It's a lousy job because only them know if they failed or suceeded because they are the only ones that can see the history changes.The time cops are the ones you owe your present life because they defend it by defending the lives of your ancestors. My advicesee the movie cause it will be a pretty nice experience. And if after you saw it you will begin to wonder let's be realisticnobody can travel through time!".

Have you ever wondered if you have the power to go back in time knowing your past world history what would it be if you change it acccording to your goodright moral sistem would it really be in for a better world? what if hitler would never existed what if something have had worked in other way that you really knew but if someone had changed before you have ever been born how can you know that it was the other way around It's a puzzle allright but a nice one. Only they know the real truth only they are allowed to travel through time to put history on the natural course to be sure that what time sealed by its passing would stay the same. It's a lousy job because only them know if they failed or suceeded because they are the only ones that can see the history changes.The time cops are the ones you owe your present life because they defend it by defending the lives of your ancestors. My advicesee the movie cause it will be a pretty nice experience. And if after you saw it you will begin to wonder let's be realisticnobody can travel through time!";

I was a fan of the first Timecop and I thought the followup maintained the good action scenes and fairly interesting storyline that the first one possessed.  There are also some nice effects throughout the movie which complement the movie well. For people who liked the original Timecop I recommend that you at least rent the dvd.On another note I am glad to see Jason Scott Lee back in an action driven movie.  Dragon was one of my all time favorite movies such a fine movie and I was expecting to see Jason star in alot more movies than he has been thus far.  Hope to see more of him!ThanksJohn".

Not many judging by Derailed.Hang on though  continuity? Not one of Timecop 2's strong points and at the end of the day the only reason Timecop 1 didn't contradict itself at every turn was because it kept the actual time travelling at a modest level. Timecop 2 ventures into Nazi Germany the Wild West and various other places ultimately making only the most halfhearted attempt to imagine let alone visualise the consequences of changes made to the timeflow. One of the characters mentions a mysterious war a couple of times. Someone else gets an eyepatch then loses it again. Oooo! Change my pants.Worse it's boring. While small mercies are appreciated  such as Jason Scott Lee being given a new character rather than trying to be passed off in Van Damme's role which wouldn't have surprised me and being marginally more charismatic than the total nobody who starred in the TV series  they're not enough to save the film from inconsequentiality. Neither is Lee's hair which remains rooted in the late 70s. You'd think he'd be able to do something about that at least being a Timecop and everything.Queuing up behind the leading man is the usual racially diverse but underused and pointless supporting cast including a limp Thomas Ian Griffith as the baddie. Any and all attempts to make us sympathetic to Griffith's cause fail because of his fundamental Hollywood Baddieness compounding the gaping holes in the plot and reasoning on one hand I suppose we should be grateful that the writers tried to ask 'meaningful' questions and stray from the standard goodevil action film templates but on the other hand if you can't do it properly then don't bother because you'll end up with nowt but plot holes mixed messages and viewers trying to stay awake just for the big fight at the end.

You know if TEC actually did exist they'd have to be guarding Hitler around the clock I'm sure he'd be a pretty popular target for rogue time travelers.  No wonder he was so paranoid...  By the way I find it amusing that although Hitler was very obviously portrayed all the characters never mention him by name ever. Remnids me of that Justice League episode...Anyway for some odd reason time travel is actually more dangerous than it was in the first movie with risks to cellualar stability and all although only one person dies as a result of this.  I can olny imagine this was supposed to make the time jumps more dramatic having that risk but really seems kind of pointless to me.Is unique in that the main antagonist is someone who wants to change history for the better rahter than just get short term gains from it like in the first.  However how that philosophy ties into preventing the existance of every TEC agent is beyond me... all that seems more tying into avenging his wife's death than his orginal mission.As the villain tries to prevent the existance of Chan you see a pretty big logical flaw in his initial target... Now I suppose the chinese guy you see in 1881 Texas is more logically Chan's ancestor than Jason Anderson who actually is.  However the only reason he knew to go back there is the genealogical database that named the time and place AND NAME of the ancestor and I serouisly doubt one would think that chinese guy was someone named ANDERSON.  If he though it was he's an idiot and if he didn't than he killed somoene just for the heck of it which kind of contradicts his altruistic intent of changing histroy for the better.Another logical flaw is his jump to the dance hall in 1988... I seriously doubt the genealgical database specifically pointed out specifically when and where Chan's parents would be dancing... logically it would make more sense to attack them at their wedding or their home or something of that nature.  It must be a very detailed database to point out their attendance at that dance... I don't know maybe that's where they met or something but seems a rather personal fact to be put into a database that's just supposed to be describing ancestry of TEC agents.  Though watching Chan's reaction to seeing his parents dancing to 80's music is solid gold still cant stop laughing at that.  That almost ranks up there with catching your parents having sex it really weirds you out to see your parents that way.The final fight just seems silly... I think Jason Scott Lee forgot he wasn't playing Bruce Lee for a few minutes.  Hope he doesn't get typecast because of that movie.Overall a fairly decent ride movie does flow well.".

	schema:headline " Not great but worth a look if you like time travel stories";
	schema:reviewBody "Time travel has always been my absolute favourite scifi subgenre with postapocalyptic a close second and so I actually shelled out my hardearned cash last weekend to buy this movie.I got round to watching it tonight and am writing this review with mixed feelings. The title The Berlin Decision and the cover blurb led me to believe that most of the story would involve the main protagonists travelling back in time to Nazi Germany with that era being the focus of the film. I figured that would be the basis for a very interesting and exciting movie. Unfortunately though the Nazi Germany part of the film takes up only a few minutes at the beginning of the film and after that  just like in the Van Damme original Timecop  the characters spend most of their time in the movie's present 2025 and recent past 2002 ... in other words almost the present day now which to me seriously reduces a movie's time travel feel the same major beef that I had with the vastly overrated Quantum Leap TV show.I also thought that the whole thing was rather rushed  it tries to be too clever for its own good and while it does throw up some interesting paradox questions the plot moves at such a rapid pace that the viewer has little time to ponder them and the whole thing just gets confusing and not a little messy in places. No attempt is made to explain or resolve any of the numerous paradoxes that arise and in the end the best thing to do is just ignore them and try and get the best of the movie for what it is. Many potentially interesting questions arise that are left unanswered such as what exactly was the war that resulted from the past being changed and when Chan the main character arrives back in the alternate 2025 in which his boss sports an eye patch and the female doctor a purple punk hairdo what happens to his alternate self  the one who has presumably lived though the changed timeline? Is he somehow displaced by our Chan?? We never find out and this fundamental question is simply ignored.That said this film does have a few positives. The time travel sequences back to the Old West and Nazi Germany are fairly interesting if a little short. There's a fairly gruesome bit where one of the timecops arrives back in the lab fused together with his younger self and hideously deformed  a result of him having made physical contact with himself in a continuity nod to the original Timecop movie this was described as being a potential problem for time travellers in that film. And some of the martial arts sequences are pretty good if you like that sort of thing.Summary Not great but I've seen worse sequels and I'll probably dig this out again at some point and give it another go  maybe I've missed some of the subtleties.".

	onyx:emotionText "Time travel has always been my absolute favourite scifi subgenre with postapocalyptic a close second and so I actually shelled out my hardearned cash last weekend to buy this movie.I got round to watching it tonight and am writing this review with mixed feelings. The title The Berlin Decision and the cover blurb led me to believe that most of the story would involve the main protagonists travelling back in time to Nazi Germany with that era being the focus of the film. I figured that would be the basis for a very interesting and exciting movie. Unfortunately though the Nazi Germany part of the film takes up only a few minutes at the beginning of the film and after that  just like in the Van Damme original Timecop  the characters spend most of their time in the movie's present 2025 and recent past 2002 ... in other words almost the present day now which to me seriously reduces a movie's time travel feel the same major beef that I had with the vastly overrated Quantum Leap TV show.I also thought that the whole thing was rather rushed  it tries to be too clever for its own good and while it does throw up some interesting paradox questions the plot moves at such a rapid pace that the viewer has little time to ponder them and the whole thing just gets confusing and not a little messy in places.

I say pretty much because I have also seen Soldier in which he plays the villain... but from what I've heard it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee film. This however is. And if this is any indication of the quality of such films I won't be seeing any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial arts artist... as the lead he's awful. He gets in a fight with random noname characters every few minutes of the film probably because the script writer couldn't figure out how else to stretch out the film to the minimum required running time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality and aside from the fact that he's certifiably insane he barely seems like a villain at all. The majority of the film is basically Lee chasing the villain through time... or maybe it's the other way around. I can't say for sure... and I definitely wouldn't watch it again to make sure. The effects are not completely horrible... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of using a timemachine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow the film screws up that interesting idea as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. The pacing is poor. I can't think of one positive thing to say about this film... I really can't. It's simply too formulaic and pointless. If only I had a timemachine so I could go back and prevent this film from ever being made... no never mind. I just hope as few fragile minds are exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to fans of Lee and no one else. If you're looking for a quality film... well this isn't it. That's for sure. 110".

Fist seeing The Last Temptation of Christ and now Kundun I wouldn't care if Scorsese ever made another gangster film.  It is easy to see that he is an artistic genius the acting in the film was great but I could have watched it on mute and still have been amazed.If like I was you are unfamiliar with the Buddhist religion and the Chinese takeover of Tibet this film has even more to offer.  Scorsese's risk of using real Buddhists to do all of the acting payed off better than I ever expected it would the fact that we are hearing the story through the people it affected adds another level to this movie.I cannot believe that this film only has a rating of 7 on this site.  If you are a fan of Scorsese and are not sure you are going to like this just give it a chance it deserves at least one viewing if you give it that I am sure you will be amazed as I was.

	schema:reviewBody "As The Last Temptation of Christ showed Martin Scorsese is not a filmmaker interested in playing it safe when it comes to religion.  Instead he wants to get into the heart and soul of it.  While that film was obviously closer to his heart since he was raised Catholic this one burns with the same conviction and passion.  The difference is he and writer Melissa Mathison adjust themselves to the way of storytelling needed to tell the life of the Dalai Lama.  Unlike say Little Buddha though where Bertolucci seemed to have no sense of distance from his subject Scorsese does so we are allowed to come to our own conclusions rather than having them shoved down our throats.Visually and aurally this is also a real treat with the images being more powerful than anything Scorsese has done before.  And while the music here is old territory for Philip Glass he produces a stunning score which should have won the Oscar.  The mostly nonprofessional castI did see a familiar face here and there but I can't remember them also does good work.".

Instead he wants to get into the heart and soul of it.  While that film was obviously closer to his heart since he was raised Catholic this one burns with the same conviction and passion.  The difference is he and writer Melissa Mathison adjust themselves to the way of storytelling needed to tell the life of the Dalai Lama.  Unlike say Little Buddha though where Bertolucci seemed to have no sense of distance from his subject Scorsese does so we are allowed to come to our own conclusions rather than having them shoved down our throats.Visually and aurally this is also a real treat with the images being more powerful than anything Scorsese has done before.  And while the music here is old territory for Philip Glass he produces a stunning score which should have won the Oscar.  The mostly nonprofessional castI did see a familiar face here and there but I can't remember them also does good work.";

This is not his typical kind of story and  fittingly  neither does it bear his typical direction. Using a cast of nonactors for the most part and opting for a more artful photographic style kudos to DP Roger Deakins veteran Coen collaborator for his mesmerizing work here Scorsese gives a truly spiritual film revolving around one of History's great tragedies. It is a feast of sights and sounds that succeeds in making Tibet alluring and makes for even more of a heartbreak for the viewer when this country is violated and destroyed. Perhaps as important as any other collaboration  if not more so  is the score by Philip Glass providing unusual but haunting melodies and depth.Kundun is regarded by many as a misstep. It does wander a long way from the gangster territory and the familiar NYC surroundings Scorsese usually plays with. In truth that such a comfortable veteran director might take such an artistic and financial risk is both surprising and inspiring. This will never gain the popularity of Raging Bull or Goodfellas because it speaks of a world that disappeared.

While I am no expert on Buddhism I know enough about it to see how brilliantly Martin Scorcese and Melissa Mathison weaved the core  philosophy into this tale of the Dalai Lama's formative years. They did it without succumbing to ostentation sentimentality or populist good vs evil film dramatics. And yet it showed us how human the child waslaughing as the monks meditated while a rat drank the ritual offerings being frightened in the dark monastery taking on the  very great responsibility of leading a truly wise noble and compassionate religion while being confronted by the threats of the modern world. I appreciated how they didnt portray the Chinese as simple villiansby including the scene where he dreams the army personnel are explaining to him why they embrace Mao's communism. And they also presented enough of the Buddhist ritual and way of life to show us how alien it is to western religionsthe scene where they cut up the body for the vultures comes to mind though they dont gloss it over by excluding comments about the Lama's isolation and loss of childhood or the corruption surrounding his first Regent. It was also quite moving to observe the devotion of his monks and people.Scorcese really demonstrates here that he is a true film artist and master storyteller. I wholeheartedly concur with the commentator that compared this film to the Last Emperordespite similar story frames and lengths this motion picture doesnt drag at all. If this had been say Steven Spielberg's project you  would have expected to see some manipulative melodramatics and insincerity. And how can one not be impressed by the performances he got out of mostly non actors! That alone was amazing. The film maintained its pace from the early years to the Lama as an adult. From what little of the man I have seen on tv his humor and wisdom was conveyed remarkably well by Mathison's script and the actors chosen for the role.Finally his comment to the Indian guard near the end after being asked if he was the Lord Buddhaencapsulates the wisdom and the humility of its spiritual leader perfectly.".

With probably only The Age of Innocence to compare to in Scorsese's now hallowed canon Kundun is a breathtaking work of artvisually sumptuous with beautiful work from cinematographer Roger Deakins hauntingly transcendental and deeply symbolic.As an outsider looking in Scorsese manages to create an intimate level of detail that someone who lives and breathes Buddhism might have overlooked. Many rituals and practices are presented exactly as they are with no attempts to explain their purpose or translate their meaning to Western culture. This allows them to keep their rich symbolism which translates perfectly to Scorsese's visual palette. From the rich colors of meditative sand art to the bright red blood spilled during China's unlawful occupation of Tibet everything takes on a deeper meaning that leaves much to the imagination and higher mind.Wisely Scorsese follows the same template of Richard Attenborough's equally resonating Oscar winning epic Ghandi by adapting a straight forward approach to his presentation of the Dalai Lama's most tumultuous years. Except for a few dreamlike vision sequences he stays mostly out of the man's head and instead shows his power through his actions and dedication to his people and the practice of nonviolence. Kundun is as near perfect a biopic as one can make.".

The pace may be slow but the views stunning and the moral dilemma compelling. Scorsese poses the question faced with violence how does a leader fight for survival with Buddhist compassion? With the growing violence we see on the international headlines this film is highly relevant both spiritually and ethically for all countries and peoples.Seen on a large screen with a brush of the sands and my tears this film changed my life. I support many first nations that have suffered killings and wish we can redress the wrongs. Seven Years in Tibet was also good but this movie changed my life and made me study the different branches of Buddhism and found much peace in meditation.

The scene where spoiler! the Dalai Lama absorbs the horrific news that some Chinese soldiers made children kill their own parents though it lasts only seconds. When I say absorbs I mean it the news goes through him like a knife in the guts and through any attentive viewer's guts also. I fail to see how anyone can say it never comes close to the emotional heights there or in the sky funeral where his father is fed to the vultures. To call this empty symbolism and some wooden acting is just to abhor Buddhist teaching itself which emphasize calm and ritual to remain calm only. How could something so interesting at the same time create such ennui? Easy. Because it's putting you in that state.I agree that like Baraka and Koyaanisqatsi the devices of the film maker are important as the script and that the film is not attempting to glorify the life of an extraordinary man but instead presents a balanced look at a complex country and a complex religion. Instead of making the Dalai Lhama out to be a saint he presents him as the humble but very human man he is caught up in the struggle for his country and his religious freedom from the Chinese in the only way that his principles and religion will allow. and that this movie is not just about one man but about the pain of all mankind and the way to transcend the pain and sin of ours in a very buddhist direction. To say that at its heart it is also a cold detached and distanced view may be a compliment. The very hot story requires a very cool treatment.Is it passionless? I doubt it. It does give the audience a cultural experience to try to convey a religious state of mind through the use of the camera and the sound track. To get us in to the Buddhist mental state it must sacrifice in the script and drama departments if by those one means action and conflict. The main conflict is the political one and it is played out in stages especially the sequence of generals starting off with reasonable explanations of why the Communists had to rise ending up with blank repeated orders  each lower in rank. Yes it had the best cinematography and best music Phillip Glass outdid himself and he clearly understood the passion that lives within Buddhism. If you feel this film is passionless close your eyes a while. Or get the soundtrack itself and play it in the dark. Really.I agree that Kundun is up there with the screen's greatest biographies Lawrence of Arabia Ghandi Out of Africa but since it is about a great Buddhist it would do a disservice not to separate itself from the emotion from the humanity. If it ends up failing miserably to convey the horror experienced by the Tibetan people fine. If someone was as emotionally involved in this film as I would have been in a PBS documentary on insects then consider having compassion for insects as the boy who will become the Dalai Lama demonstrates in one of the most compelling early scenes. Kundun in my opinion needs to be viewed as a cinematic audiovisual exploration of the Tibetan spirituality and the cycles of existence  birth death reincarnation.It is no contradiction to see it as a huge beautifully and intricately decorated gift box which when I opened it proved to be empty. But your Box is the gift isn't it beautiful? Well sure it is... but you could have put SOMETHING inside it. Why? Religion is itself the box.I agree that in twenty years time Kundun will be recognised as one of the top ten films ever produced in motion picture history. I empathize with the fellow watching this movie hours after finding my girlfriend with her new man and being the last to know the relationship was overI completely broke down almost on every chapter  ah exactly the point. I saw it with a woman I had asked to marry me several times she said no her son who was about ten and a good friend of ours who had been in jail in India and meditated with the Dalai Lama when he visited. I think it was the last significant thing I did with these three people. I can no longer separate my love for them from my love for this film. I think I learned its lesson. Attachment is not the point of living well.The beautifully wrapped box will always be empty  and that is wonderful.".

I haven't seen any other Scorsese films except The Aviator but that can't hold a candle to this one.The two points that really make Kundun shine are the dropdead gorgeous cinematography by Roger Deakins which really adds a whole dimension to the film but that's peanuts compared to the brilliant score by Philip Glass. If anyone other than Glass had done the score to the film it wouldn't be half the film it is in my opinion. Certainly this is one of Glass's stronger scores right up there with Koyaanisqatsi. The dramatic work the movie has done to build up to a climax are realized with the ending which is amazingly poignant and really serves for a wonderful sense of closure or not. I've been saying a lot about how wonderful and brilliant the film is haven't I? And yes something must be said about the acting. There have been complaints that the acting is stiff and unmemorable and that's true for a few cast members but Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong as the adult Dali Lama shines.So for my final score I'll make it a ten but knock one point off for some of the stiff acting for a grand total of nine points. This is a film that truly deserves it.".

The dramatic work the movie has done to build up to a climax are realized with the ending which is amazingly poignant and really serves for a wonderful sense of closure or not. I've been saying a lot about how wonderful and brilliant the film is haven't I? And yes something must be said about the acting. There have been complaints that the acting is stiff and unmemorable and that's true for a few cast members but Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong as the adult Dali Lama shines.So for my final score I'll make it a ten but knock one point off for some of the stiff acting for a grand total of nine points. This is a film that truly deserves it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Even though this movie came out in 1998 the 1st time I saw it was a few years back. This was because at that time it had received so much criticism that anybody who thinking of watching this movie thought otherwise. But while I was surfing the IMDb site I had noticed that this particular movie had a high rating considering the fact that it was considered a flop back then. So I decided to see for myself how this movie was like and boy was I stunned..Why was Dil Se a 'flop' in India? A gem amongst the commerciallyhyped bollywood hits..SRK's acting as Amar in this film was superb at once we see a mix of his endearing boyish vulnerability tenderness and wild explosive impulsiveness that characterize the intelligence of this great actor. The transformation that his character went through was amazing to watch from carefree arrogant pup to an obsessed lover to a desperate man and finally to a dead man walking. It was a welcomed relief to all his other bubblegum characters like Rahul in KKHH K3G I am not saying that he didn't act well in those movies. Its just that he remained the same  at same time was boring compared to Amar...Manisha Koirala's acting as Meghna was flawless. One minute she felt guilty about using Amar by using the AIR All India Radio tag in order to get close to the President while the next minute she didn't bat an eyelid when he was arrested. Her breakdown scenes seem extremely forced into the script and the only reason why these scenes proved effective is because Manisha is an amazing actress. The sequence where she tries to cry but the tears won't come out is mindblowing and no other actress could have portrayed this scene so well. Even though Meghna was portrayed as someone who was damaged emotionally with no recovery the last scene when Amar asked her to say 'I love you' she just looked deeply into him and with the least possible motion nodded lovingly  her eyes shinning with love for such a brief moment... Simply amazing...Santosh Sivan's cinematography was stunning. He flexes the visual muscle as the movie veers from the world's coldest lake to the inside of a monastery and he's helped considerably by the eternal undeniable beauty of this leading lady sans makeup. As Meghna washes her face casually we can see why Amar has fallen hard for her. For those of us who will probably never visit Ladakh Sivan's images will forever remain in our minds....Farah Khan definitely deserved the Filmfare Award for best choreography for Dil Se. Who can forget the dance in SATRANGI RE incredibly erotic piece of footage  the two of them squirming in that red fabric.... Hollywood could learn some lessons here in how to be amorously sexy without being cheap or porno or SRK's contagious energy on top of that train in CHAIYYA CHAIYYA or him tenderly protecting Manisha in the DIL SE RE?....Music by AR Rahman is the soul of the film .The songs doesn't feel or look out of place at all. Dil Se is hauntingly done both musically and visually as well. This is all because of Mani Ratnam's direction. He told the story in the most human way possible it is essentially a love story told against the backdrop of terrorism also showed us the birth of the terrorist  simplified to a great extent but neatly executed. Ratnam uses 'passion' as his keyword exploring it on various occasionally obvious levels...Overall I think this movie will always be a classic and is way ahead of it's time. I am sure if this movie was released after 2002 it would have been a huge hit.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the greatest and most crafted works of the incredible Mani Ratnam. I was stunned by every moment of it and the very first scene was enough for me to get completely hooked. Mr Ratnam's ability to make a grandiose love story and yet keep it starkly realistic is just unbelievable. It makes the viewer believe that true intense love does not exist only in fairy tales but in reallife too with simple and ordinary people. Dil Se is a rare gem of its times  authentic hardhitting gripping and deeply involving. Some people have deemed it a bit slow and tedious but according to me the film moves at a steady pace and is totally focused engaging and captivating.The film's concept a young hardworking radio broadcaster falls in love with a mysterious strangely apathetic woman who is actually a terrorist may have been tackled before by filmmakers around the world but none has done it the way Mr Ratnam did. He directs this feature with heart and soul and intensifies it with complete mastery so much that you cannot leave the screen even for one moment even if you are one of those who prefer skipping the songs. The script is grounded in tension and mystery and it thankfully avoids sentimentality. And then we also have some genuinely real yet exceptional dialogues which bring forth a poetic quality that eases the serious proceedings.Every artist involved in this film gives one of their best. A.R Rahman for one creates one of the most crafted and beautiful movie soundtracks of his career giving so much life and essence to the film. The songs flow incredibly well with the film they never feel unnecessary they fit the situations and ultimately enhance the narrative and contribute to the film's mystery and intense atmosphere. Dil Se Re Jiya Jale Chaiyya Chaiyya and Satrangi Re  each track is a gem and showcases the greatness of Rahman and Ratnam who visualises them exceedingly well onscreen. This of course could have been done without Santosh Sivan's brilliant cinematography.The performances are top notch. This is one of Shahrukh Khan's most accomplished and realistic performances. He is intense witty vulnerable believable and convincing as Amar. He portrays a suffering man who would go to any strengths for a woman he hardly knows and though his character's unconditional love may seem peculiar he manages to keep it real and balanced. He conveys his feelings whether it's sorrow love pain or anger in his own inimitable style using his troubling intensity and nervous mannerisms. One can really feel for the pain in his eyes which is evident every time he meets this woman who keeps rejecting him. A superb act.Manisha Koirala one of the most talented dramatic actresses India has seen is flawless as Meghna. She smiles barely once in the entire film but her expressive eyes and silence speak volumes and always do the job. It's a natural and ambiguous portrayal of a woman who has lost belief in life and love or at least of someone who compels herself to think so. She brilliantly displays the little nuances which let us sense her constant fights with herself and her struggle to not submit to her feelings every time she faces the bright side of the world forcefully and firmly fossilising herself for the sake of a mission which must be completed.Preity Zinta the star herself in her debut film does something very few actors have been capable of doing she makes a great impact despite having a very small role. It's a great achievement for any actor to excel and make a lasting impression with a role of such minimal importance and screen time. She is natural vibrant and very likable commanding the audience's attention with her strong screen presence and lively persona. She's always been known for her ability to add happiness and positivity to films which are overly serious and dark and this one is no exception. Her full of life frank and direct Preeti is one of the most unforgettable characters in recent years.Dil Se is a socially relevant movie but it is a love story at heart and there it scores the most. It may not appeal to all kinds of audiences in fact it was a box office failure in India though a success overseas more because of its brutally honest depiction of terror and national battle yet it remains thoroughly fascinating. The film is atmospheric dark and deep. The only aspects that abstract the viewer from these features may be the energetic music and Preity Zinta's light character. In anyway it is a picture of great artistic excellence and I would recommend anyone to see it. The ending is also most unpredictable only making it more beautiful and memorable.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with Hindi cinema is its very strong formalistic framework where it has to fit in. It must pass the censors must be made for a billion of mostly analphabets and must contain a great number of song and dance scenes. Mani Ratnam is one and only? director who constantly  extents this genre to embrace the producers the popular audience and the critical and political aware intellectuals with his strong political  claims Roja Bombay. This one now beats it all and everybody in India talked about it. Such an end was not seen before in Hindi cinema and all fits perfectly well despite to what some other critics said. And it works even if you know the end before which most do.It's my current favorite. Technically superb very sophisticated content big fun and emotions.

	onyx:emotionText "The problem with Hindi cinema is its very strong formalistic framework where it has to fit in. It must pass the censors must be made for a billion of mostly analphabets and must contain a great number of song and dance scenes. Mani Ratnam is one and only? director who constantly  extents this genre to embrace the producers the popular audience and the critical and political aware intellectuals with his strong political  claims Roja Bombay. This one now beats it all and everybody in India talked about it. Such an end was not seen before in Hindi cinema and all fits perfectly well despite to what some other critics said. And it works even if you know the end before which most do.It's my current favorite. Technically superb very sophisticated content big fun and emotions. An american version would have been a typical political thriller about an unlucky love to a female terrorist but Mani Ratnam gives us 300. Not just the Indian Spielberg or Tsui Hark this is more. Go for it.";

After seeing Dil Se for the second time it was easier to see how the seemingly irrational actions of the characters were a result of their life circumstances.  I understood much better why Amar was compelled to pursue Meghna  if you've ever been in love with the wrong person you'll understand too.  Meghna is like many other damaged people I've known capricious confused sometimes cruel to others but in the end her own worst enemy.  Both know that their paths are not supposed to join and pay lip service to that fact but find themselves irresistibly drawn to each other.  This is evident by Amar's reaction to seeing Meghna at his engagement and again in Meghna's attempts to convince herself to feel nothing but fiery patriotism.  It is this relentless attraction that forces the shattering scene at the end of the moviethere is no other way for them to be together.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw Dil Se I had no idea who Mani Ratnam was but I have since sought out and seen many of his films. Dil Se remains his best film in my opinion. A chance encounter at a remote train station between a brash radio executive Amar Verma and a mysterious woman Meghna? leads to Amar's dogged pursuit of Meghna. He is in love she is enigmatic elusive and unattainable despite his following her and pressing his suit. She keeps walking away. Amar seems to give up and goes back home to get engaged to pretty and perky Preety. But then Meghna walks back into his life and asks for help. Amar takes a while to realize that all is not as it should be and the movie rapidly turns from a romance into a thriller in the second half. There is a terrorism subplot there is intense emotion and the fact that there is one woman too many in our hero's life.. The movie negotiates all this and moves us rapidly towards a stunning finale.The film is visually stunning  the train top song Chaiyyan Chaiyyan the Ladakh locales including a snow covered lake and ruins among the dunes the masterful use of light in the most intense emotional moments the mundane streets of Delhi children running up and down the stairs in an old house  the moments of visual beauty are too many to list. A R Rahman's music is astoundingly good. There is no mediocre number  Sukhwinder's stunning Chaiyyan Chaiyan Sonu's gritty Satrangi re Udit's haunting Ae Ajnabi AR Rahman's soulful Dil Se re and Lata's sensual Jiya Jale  every song is situationally perfect masterfully sung and worth going on the Alist on your iPod.Mani is a master craftsman  the tale of Dil Se is not easily absorbed at one go. The first impact is one of mystery and confusion. But the second time around one knows that this was the intention all along  Meghna carries deep dark secrets that will not allow her to accept her attraction for Amar yet Amar can sense the mutual attraction and keeps pursuing her. Dil Se is set in some unknown North Eastern state in India. These regions were historically never a part of India and were added to political India by the British. Their populace is culturally and ethnically different. Postindependence these states have been in a state of unrest and more and more isolated. The influx of refugees from Bangladesh into this region has strained resources and made the political situation even more volatile. These states are less affluent and there is much separatist terrorist? activity going on in almost every state despite programs from the central government that provide resources and raw materials at a reduced cost and also decree that only permanent residents and natives can buy land in these states to keep ethnic identities intact. This political situation has parallels in the story  Amar is happy go lucky affluent confident in his family relationships in his identity in his ability to achieve his goals  whether they be wooing a reluctant woman or meeting with the separatiststerrorists. This is very much like mainstream India. Meghna on the other hand is unhappy relatively poor notice the often close to tattered clothing has feelings of dissociation and estrangement a need to fight back.Their meeting is by chance  just as by happenstance the NE states became part of political India. They are as different as can be  he is brash and hyper she is introspective and quiet. She is attracted to Amar yet also strangely repulsed by him. This is very much like the uneasy political alliance between the NE states and mainstream India. There is the danger of getting engulfed by other neighbors so an alliance is necessary yet there is perceived disenfranchisement as there is not enough representation in the political process.Amar is shown to be a bit coercive in the beginning and overly helpful in the end and this represents the two extremes of how the central government handles the situation in the NE. There are many facilities provided cheaper resources protection given in terms of property rights. Yet the hand is heavy when it comes to political decision making.Meghna's past parallels some of the heavy handedness at the hands of the center while Aamr's attitude of trying to figure out why there is unrest indicates that there is a basic desire at the center to help.The love story is rather unusual and highlights these forces of attraction and tension. Only in the very end is Mani completely enigmatic. In the end are we now witnessing the love story alone or is it a prophecy for the future? Mani stays completely on the fence the entire time and looks at the situation and indeed at the love story as Amar the journalist would. He is merely reporting the facts and not passing any judgments. The film is superbly acted. Shahrukh effortlessly conveys the brash young man in search of a story the obsessed lover the reluctant fianc the angry man the patriot. This is one of his finest roles to date. Manisha does an excellent job as Meghna  she is luminous diffident attracted and yet repulsed driven  and all this with almost no words spoken. Shahrukh conveys so much with body language  watch him in the desert after Meghna leaves in the night  he is despair personified. And Manisha uses her eyes  a look says it all when Amar asks her on the roof top if she loves him. Preity is great as the perky girl  excellent in the sensuous number Jiya Jale. I hope Mani Ratnam is aware of the huge impact this film had and continues to have. Watch Dil Se you will not be disappointed.".

It is not presented as a separatist polemic nor should it be considered as such as a lot of myopic viewers have done. Nor is it a film about terrorism.  It is essentially a love story told against the backdrop of terrorism.  Mani Ratnam is at his best producing what can only be called surreal realism.  Many of you may have forgotten but once upon a time Shah Rukh Khan was a good actor and this is easily one of his best performances.  Preity Zinta is the only glimmer of relief in this heavy handed tale of darkness and despair.  This was also her first film. Rahman's songs are his career best each of the six tracks more replendent than the last.  Above all however Dil Se belongs to the luminously gifted Manisha Koirala who delivers a crushing and skinless portrayal of a reluctant avenger.  In a role of almost no dialogue she speaks volumes through her reticent glances and a body language that is burdened by sorrow. It is a sin that such dramatically gifted actresses like Manisha Tabu Juhi Nandita Das etc. are relegated to competing for potboiler nonroles that crown glamorous dance queens like Aishwariya Amisha Madhuri and ilk the top of the heap.  India has great actors the film industry just doesn't know how to utilize them.".

But the characters of Manisha Koirala and Shah Rukh Khan are so convincingly and urgently represented that one can comprehend his deep unconditional love the same way one can comprehend her fear of him getting closer to her. Because after all the atrocities she has experienced and her role in the suicide command and terrorism she still in her quiet reserved ways clings to life as she develops relationships with other people again and again for the reason of friendliness and humanity and not for her inhuman cause of terrorism. In the same extent he wants to save her she develops a fear of this rescue. No matter how she rejects him his love grows and he does not want to give up even if it could cost his own life.This story is so fascinatingly told that one has hardly time to breathe. In addition to that the film language is so enormous and the use of light in some scenes is so space and timeless beautiful that it is hard to find a comparison to DIL SE. One of those scenes is set at a campfire somewhere in a desert. In the unique Mani Ratnam style there is bright light in the background intimate whisperings between Meghna and Amar about the three dearest things in the world close up shots on their faces. The closer Meghna and Amar are getting the fewer light beams radiates between the two heads and less the observer can see of this intimate moment the farther away they are from each other the more one can see of what they are doing but less is happening. Light means life. Although in Indian Cinema rarely real kisses can be watched this almost kiss belongs to the Top Ten of best film kisses ever. One could almost feel and taste the tension in this scene.Whoever particularly watches Bollywood Cinema because of the music and the dance scenes will also enjoy this movie. The scene on top of the train became film history and meanwhile it is already quoted in advertisement. In this regard the film is also unusual the music smoothly adjusts itself into the story and continues to carry it on a bit. As the characters wonder what could have happened if they would have met in another life under different circumstances. The music is made so beautifully.I think that Western or European spectators could find an easy introduction to Indian Cinema with DIL SE  the story telling reminds of the European Cinema Style in a way. It gives enough room to read between the lines and in the faces of the brilliant actors. Words are not needed to explain their actions it is simply there to see it and experience it.Dil SE is absolutely no film which one can easily forget. As far as I'm concern the question that still employs me after having seen it a few times is whether there could have been another end for the two characters or whether the end shown in this film remains the only possible ending to their story. Well the end of this movie is really the only thing which does not please me. I don't think there has to be a happy ending after all but still the end shown is missing the strength and love of the rest of the story it just ends it period.".

The Sufi spiritual and divine essence of love in both the music and the movie as a whole makes it a brilliant piece. It is beautiful how innocence and love are projected in a background of misery and suffering. The song lyrics are amazing especially those of the song Dil Se. It defines the delicacy and fragility of human nature and the passion and yearning with which the human heart calls out for .. love. Personally I think that Shahrukh Khan has never acted better in any other movie than this one because of the demands of his role that seems like a minor character when compared to the complicated and fearless heroine. It is good to see that the hero is an ordinary man falling in love and being thrown in the face of patriotic duty rather than the typical macho heroes of Indian movies. His realistic character shows in the fight scenes where he gets beat up by the enemy repeatedly and consequently grows to put up a fight driven by love. The heroine has more of a character than that of a Bondgirl or damsel type seductress typical of Indian movie heroines. The choreography of the songs is very touching as it combines different aspects of love i.e. innocence and spiritual fulfillment with sexual longing.".

The images are haunting the sensibilities are delicate and the scenery breathtaking. If you plan to see only one Hindi film that you plan to see this should be it.

	schema:reviewBody "Scene 1 Year 1998 I was 11 when i took my brother with me forcefully to watch my favorite actor'sSrk's movie. The movie had already bombed at the Indian box office. But i heard somewhere that this movie has made it to the Top 10 list of UK Box office. So i insisted but later regretted. After the movie was overi was like where is the real SRK that we all love??why is he overreacting in the movie??what is this girl doing in the movie??. Though i loved Preity Zinta like all of us did. But i thought i would never watch such movie again in my life.Cut 2Year 2009 I have been a regular visitor of IMDb there are 100's of movies which i loved and i have watched it over n over again but never bothered to register on this site to comment on them. But today I broke my years long promise of not to watch this movie and i saw it again and i was taken aback. I specially took some time out to register on this website and to post something about this movie. I did this just because of the following reasons which actually justify why i have given 10 stars rating to this movie   It is one of the most intelligent movies that Bollywood has ever produced. Expect few songs the entire movie runs at a very fast speed. Santosh Sivan did a wonderful job in not only capturing the beauty of Ladakh but also in involving us as much as he could. A.R. Rehman's best work till date. Though some songs were unnecessarily added in the movie but still I didn't mind that because they are simple outstanding. Not just his songs but also his background music is something to write about which is simply superb. High production values. Proper doses of humour and romantic elements has made this Romantic thriller very pleasant to watch. Extra Ordinary Direction by Mani Ratnam. I don't know how much Shekhar Kapoor Ram Gopal Verma and Bobby Bedi were involved in writing and execution of the movieThe story is powerful and its execution is out of the world.The subject has been treated very cleverly by Mani Ratnam. Lastly and most importantly Supreme Performances by its lead actors. After few minutes into the movie I never felt that this is SRK and Manisha Koirala who are acting there in Sub Zero temperature. This is SRK's best work till date. No one in bollywood could have played this part with such an obsession like SRK did. Not for a second i thought this is SRK. I was so involved in his character and that was possible only and only because of SRK. Manisha Koirala has done complete justice to her role of meghana. Just watch her emote in every sequence of this movie. Its really sad to see that she is not getting good roles now a days. What a waste of such a brilliant actress. Both the actors deserved an award but there used to be a rule in bollywoodand still is??that if the movie is a success the even the worst actors can get best actor's award.Just because indians were not ready for such an intelligent movie this movie was a disaster at the Indian Box Office. But this is a Masterpiece which grows over you with every scene of it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Scene 1 Year 1998 I was 11 when i took my brother with me forcefully to watch my favorite actor'sSrk's movie. The movie had already bombed at the Indian box office. But i heard somewhere that this movie has made it to the Top 10 list of UK Box office. So i insisted but later regretted. After the movie was overi was like where is the real SRK that we all love??why is he overreacting in the movie??what is this girl doing in the movie??. Though i loved Preity Zinta like all of us did. But i thought i would never watch such movie again in my life.Cut 2Year 2009 I have been a regular visitor of IMDb there are 100's of movies which i loved and i have watched it over n over again but never bothered to register on this site to comment on them. But today I broke my years long promise of not to watch this movie and i saw it again and i was taken aback. I specially took some time out to register on this website and to post something about this movie. I did this just because of the following reasons which actually justify why i have given 10 stars rating to this movie   It is one of the most intelligent movies that Bollywood has ever produced. Expect few songs the entire movie runs at a very fast speed. Santosh Sivan did a wonderful job in not only capturing the beauty of Ladakh but also in involving us as much as he could. A.R. Rehman's best work till date. Though some songs were unnecessarily added in the movie but still I didn't mind that because they are simple outstanding. Not just his songs but also his background music is something to write about which is simply superb. High production values. Proper doses of humour and romantic elements has made this Romantic thriller very pleasant to watch. Extra Ordinary Direction by Mani Ratnam.

Such was the persona of Shah Rukh Khan as a romantic hero that it was improbable that the burning issue of NorthEast insurgence would salvage this wonderfullycrafted film from the fate it suffered.On the whole the film impresses with its breathtaking visuals of Ladakh and the NorthEast the mesmerizing music and a fiery performance from Manisha Koirala. Granted that Priety Zinta was more of an ugly duckling than the elegant woman she is now hers was a delightful debut. But the biggest disappointment is Shah Rukh. Tied to a role light years apart from the moongazing mandolinstrumming Casanova that he was so accustomed to he fails to bring the required weebit restraint to an investigating reporter. Perhaps movies with hardhitting realism were not his forte then.Despite that there are plenty of sequences worth remembering the disturbing throwbacks into Meghna's Manisha past the awkward interaction between Amar Shah Rukh and Preeti Zinta and that song on top of a train. I read somewhere that the songs were brilliant to listen to but were inserted at the most inappropriate of moments in the film. I don't disagree. However considering the length and the pace of the storyline I wouldn't blame the editor and the director either. In any case the songs are fabulous on their own and take the listener on a rich and vibrant journey of foottapping modernity and old world classicism. There is also a mournful melody rendered by the thenrejuvenated Sukhwinder Singh that somehow escaped a listing on the soundtrack. Maybe you need to watch the movie to savor that.It is definitely worth watching and more realistic than the fare dished out by Karan Johar and his ilk but it is more an adventure of human motivations than a treatise on terrorism that the filmmakers would like us to believe. Pity it suffered badly at the boxoffice.".

Same is with this one.Shah Rukh Khan as Aman Verma has done a good role specially at the beginning and one can see Manisha Koirala in one of her few good roles. The film begins well stalls in the middle and then again picks up well near the end. I loved Priety Zinta's character. She looks absolutely cute and sexy at the same time. Some of her dialogues with Shah Rukh khan are quite hilarious and add that tiny bit of humor in the otherwise serious romanticdrama. The film essays the problems faced by the people of NorthEast India and depicts the subsequent terrorism prevailing in those areas. The film has beautiful cinematography. The scenes from Ladakh  Leh are breathtakinglybeautiful while those of NEIndia aren't so bad .

This film is dominated by its music and the story becomes weak before the music in spite of being good on its own.Songs just fit into the film very well. The haunting music composed by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with the right dose of Punjabi words in the songs is the best thing happened to this film. The image of Punjabi songs at least for me was only balle balle type of songs. However after I discovered the treasure of Punjabi poetry in Nusrat's other compositions I decided to learn Punjabi one day. The songs of this film are definitely and definitively representatives of the wonderful Punjabi poetry.If I remember what I heard on TV correctly the music for this film is as such not composed for this film but the film makers took the music of Nusrat and ACKNOWLEDGEDcredited Nusrat for his music. This honesty is reflected in every department. Unfortunately Milan Luthria could not live up to the expectations of people like me with his other offerings Chori Chori and Deewar given the promise of his talent that was present all over Kache Dhaage. I recommend this film very strongly. God Willing I would own a DVD of this film soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kachche Daage is not a great film but it's highly watchable with some really fun moments. Directed by Milan Luthria who also directed Chori Chori 2003 and Deewaar 2004.I'm not sure why this film got so trounced by the critics  it's much better than a lot of other BW movies. Pehaps there is something here I don't understand  perhaps there is some possible communal offense as this is about Indian soldiers who betray their country and help terrorists smuggle guns into the country. Be that as it may as a clueless westerner ... I find this film very enjoyable.Saif and Ajay perform really well together  they have macho chemistry! And both of these wonderful men look really handsome and cool here. Saif plays the gogetter successful city yuppie willing to risk it all on his deals  while his illegitimate halfbrother Ajay has turned to stealing to vent his anger at being rejected by the society for being a bastard. Ajay's illegitimacy prevents him from marrying Manisha the love of his life because her parents wont accept him. Ajay's mother is Muslim and Saif's parents Hindu. Apparently Saif's father wanted to marry Ajay's mom but the religious difference ruined their chances for happiness.The film starts off with Ajay poking a stick into a cobra's hole! Once the snake emerges Ajay grabs it and stares it in the eye with his own piercing AttilatheHun eyes! I like this. There is also a sweet romantic scene with Manisha where Ajay tells her to close her eyes and then says something like ... the rain will get you wet and she says let it get me wet and he drops water on her cheek and then slowly kisses it away ... Nice!Saif is very convincing as the enraged spoiled brat yuppie who finds himself helplessly dragged into Ajay's accidental involvement with the terrorists and the army. Saif wants his 'pin' card his cell phone and doesn't like getting blood on his spiffy business suit. Frog's broth makes him gag! The contrast between the two is the conflict of the young city techie male against his more rural street wise counterpart  and is played to amuse rather than make any kind of statement. These two endure the endless chase a danger packed cool train scene and gallantly ride horses to catch the bad guys in top style! They look great riding together  so dashing!The music and dance numbers are also worth seeing. There are some colorful hot qawwali numbers with lots of swaying guys feeling excessively soulful. Manisha looks lovely and she has some tender chemistry with Ajay. Saif is paired with Namrita Shirodkar who fits as the yuppie girl friend. Naturally Ajay and Saif come to bond and love each other. I really like this film. Perhaps that year it just had too much competition 1999 was the year that Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Taal came out. I recommend it especially for Saif and Ajay fans. There's lots of exploding trucks hand held rockets fight scenes horse  train stunts and good music. It's BW!".

It makes you feel brain dead. After watching it I felt so bad for seeing something so explicitly stupid I was so angry that I literally couldn't put into words how I felt and still can't accurately explain how bad this movie is partly because I'm trying to block all the memories of it. I don't know if it's possible to describe the type of moronic writing that had no logic at all and the terrible truly vile characters. Spoilers start from here so stop reading if you really seriously think you'll see this piece of art. I mean we're supposed to root for a spoiled overdramatic rich teenage girl that really has no idea what she wantsfeelsthinks and 90 of the time the only opinionreaction she has to a situation is to scream and complicate things while on the other hand takes her 40 sec to forget what she was overdramatizing about. Oh and I forgot to mention that after her best friend's boyfriend dies she ditches her best friend. Stops all contact with her. I mean that's just great writing. And if you think that's all oh no buddy you're in for a treat. The male character that of course all the girls have a crush on and the viewers are also supposed to feel attracted to or at least sympathetic is macho man psycho who all in all to the end of the movie beat up at least 6 guys 2 of whom almost to death for no apparent reason. I mean okay you find your mom having sex with another guy sure you get angry maybe even sucker punch the guy but beat him up like a dog is a little bit just over the top. But that's the acceptable beating up that happened in this astonishing movie. I mean my favorite part is when a guy spills wine all over his spoiledrichgirlgirlfriend and he got so unbelievably angry?? that he actually hit the guy in the middle of an official event. But really why I don't get why any sane human being would even remotely not hate this guy  the part where he actually hit his girlfriend. And this my friends is a love story. I mean they had a competition on who could do the most pull ups??? And you know how usually things in the plot or the plot development happen for a reason or at least there is some logic behind the things that get down? Yeah well I really missed that principle in Tres metros sober el cello maybe the plot is just trying to be mysterious. I don't know. The only reason why I would recommend this movie is to feel this mixed feeling of nausea shame for being a part of humanity that created this piece of art and at the same time the loss of words regret anger disappointment and the best part  the ending when through out the whole movie you have hoped that something meaningful and logical will happen at the end that will make all the terrible things you just saw worth itor at least bearable and nothing happens. I hope I spared someone from feeling dead inside.".

Justifying and encouraging such treatment  to insult someone in order to get her.This movie justifies men treating women with no respect what so ever the main character Hugo harassed the girl Babi more times than I can count without any reason. This treatment kept on going even after they became a couple. And Bebi kept running back to him two seconds later whatever 'big' mistake he did. One second they were broken up and the next they were kissing again.Tres metros sobre el cielo provides terrible gender behavior and roles for both men and women. It reinforces the stereotypes of men being violent cold emotionless brutal and disrespectful and it portrays women as weak indecisive extremely emotional and incredibly dependent. I don't even know where to start I could write a whole book about this movie and how it reinforces the gendered stereotypes we already have and what kind of message it sends out to young teenagers  who I guess are the main audience for this movie.One of the few good things I can say about it was the beautiful photography it was thoughtful lovely and very artistic. The actors were doing a good job as well but their characters and the script was very very bad.I will not recommend this movie to anyone  but probably rant about how bad it was and how disappointed it made me. I kept waiting for a twist a twist that somehow would make all the behaviors and the treatment justified but it never came.. Please don't waste your time on this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since it came out I kept hearing every single teenager going crazy about this film so after years I had to watch it. I have to say I have seen most romantic films even the really cheesy ones like Nicholas Sparks cheesy or even Twilight. But nothing could have prepared me for this film.Putting aside the fact that everything was so predictable typical of romantic films the plot was very unrealistic and poorly written. Let's think about Babi's friend. She falls madly in love with a guy that was stealing money from her bag. In which messed up universe does this happen? Not to mention how annoying Babi is one of the main characters. She keeps breaking up with Hugo or whatever his name isfor no real reason and she abandons her best friend after her boyfriend died right in front of her. Oh and that Hugo guy. What a character! He gets into fight with anyone for no reason and not just a simple fight oh no. He beats those guys nearly to death. The best part is where he does this as Babi's 18th birthday party to a guy who spilled wine on Babi by accident. I'm telling you the perfect guy. And the cherry on top is where he slaps Babi. That to be fair was the only time when he was entitled to do it as Babi was accusing him of killing his best friend even if he wasn't there when it happened and he had nothing to do with it. OK so this is a film where the main characters are people anyone would hate in real life even though they're supposed to be the opposite. This is a film where resorting to physical violence is justified only when a man hits a woman. If you put it like that it would sound quite interesting and it would probably deserve a greater rating because it would be a drama not a LOVE STORY. I have just seen the film like an hour ago. Honestly it was so bad I cannot even find my words to explain it. It was cheesy she gets a tattoo of his name the day after they kiss for the first time and nothing had any meaning. You're expecting everything to fall into place at the end and it doesn't.It wasn't enough that the film was a disappointment but seeing that on IMDb it is rated 7.210 breaks my heart. Seriously people? Seriously???".

Honestly it was so bad I cannot even find my words to explain it. It was cheesy she gets a tattoo of his name the day after they kiss for the first time and nothing had any meaning. You're expecting everything to fall into place at the end and it doesn't.It wasn't enough that the film was a disappointment but seeing that on IMDb it is rated 7.210 breaks my heart. Seriously people? Seriously???";

The characters were so hard to relate to because all they did is make me angry and annoyed. I was not able to feel empathy and root for those characters. Their decisions were irrational their emotions didn't make sense and their moods and feelings kept changing from scene to scene first they hate each other then they love each other then they hate again then they love again and so on. Is this a kindergarten?! I mean sure such love sometimes happens but in this case it just wasn't reasoned enough. One thing that made me a little happier is that they seemed to get a bit more mature in the ending and left all that typical but overdramatized romance behind. I still feel mad though.It also appeared to me that the film's claim is that the only way to achieve spiritual happiness is by being a rebel and breaking the rules. How shallow and smallminded really.".

	schema:headline " Great modern take on Romeo and Juliet";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow! What a knockout of a movie. If one was to say that this is aimed at the female Twilight audience one would only be partially correct. There is enough of a hard edge to the story and the characters to appeal to any redblooded male in the audience. The story of a girl from a rich family who falls in hatelove with a smartass illegal motor cycle racing street hood kicks this up into a testosterone story about a thug trying to come to terms with his uncontrollable angers and find love amidst his own brutality. Taken from an Italian novel by Federico Moccia this was originally filmed in Italian in 2004 then remade in Spanish in 2010. This movie cries out for an American remake!!! One only prays that if that day ever comes that the studio committees won't screw it up as they have done waaaay too often with foreign remakes.Whatever the budget was for this movie every penny is up there on the screen. Fantastic direction fantastic cinematography. Great acting from the young leads. A great soundtrack and constant surprises that increase the romantic aspect under threat of constant danger. If this movie was to be remade scene for scene for the American market it would be a sensation and make major stars of its young leads. Fernando Gonzales Molina the director of this movie should have been hired YESTERDAY to shoot an Englishlanguage version of this movie. One only hopes that the hero or antihero would be drawn from the ranks of America's melting pot rather than the androgynous whitebread actors currently in vogue more suited to supporting roles in freshscented tampon commercials.The story of a motor cycle street racer from a good family gone bad in rebellion against the hypocrisy of his family who invades the remote comfort zone of the rich high school girl who despises everything about him yet is irresistibly drawn towards him could be trite  but never is in this fastmoving tale. The supporting characters in the related subplots provide tragic elements that time and again remind one of Romeo and Juliet in a highspeed modern setting.The most interesting thing about the lead characters is the way in which they change and mature. This is not a loveydovey romance that hits all the predictable points but rather a tale of two people drawn towards one another in a relationship that cannot hope to succeed. This is one movie that will have every female in the audience blubbering into her handkerchief at the ending. Did I say it was romantic? Did I say that it absolutely kills with its constant juxtaposition of hardpartying action and quiet romantic moments? The stars of this Spanish version Mario Casas and Maria Valverde appear destined for long and successful careers based on their performances here.Have I raved enough about this movie? No I haven't. If you have one romantic spark in your soul then see this movie. And PRAY that Hollywood doesn't screw it up in a dumb elcheapo remake!".

And in the end you see that for people like him it's really impossible and that makes me kind of sad and angry at the same time because I found myself in his character. And also it's obvious that there are a lot of women who just fall in love with that kind of menJust like Babi did so that's their choice and no one should judge them. I hate fake feminism or boys talking about sexism you won't find them in this movie. The only thing I didn't like are stuffs like British flag big Coca Cola sign so inappropriate for a movie of the nation with so rich and beautiful culture like it is Spanish culture there's no need for making attention with it. But finally I think that this movie don't deserve bad critics from people who don't understand psychical structure of a person who had been hurt by family member lost faith in life during growing up  suffered strong violence of any kind etc. And to me its all about Hugo's life in their love story and that actor who's playing him is really good one so charming.".

If it had been about a football star I wouldn't have watched it. The story line is as thin as Gable's moustache. But the automotive background 55 years old is priceless. Some of the action scenes are stagey but you can tell that Gable does some of the close up high speed driving  you don't get wind buffet on cheeks and arms from driving at 30mph! To see an Offy' motor being stripped to see inside what looked like a genuine 1950 racing shop and to see Mauri Rose in the legendary Novi was incredible. Not for everyone but for classic motor racing enthusiasts this movie is a hidden treasure. You get the feeling that Gable must have been a motor racing fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "To Please a Lady 1950Amazingly this is from postwar America. It feels like a movie from the 1930s both technically and the way the story is told. Even the stars though both obviously alive and still working are better known for their earlier work.I'm speaking of Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck. And they have a certain degree of good chemistry on screen though the story is so constructed I'm avoiding the better word contrived you don't always feel what they are feeling as characters. The one scene that does this best is an extended dinner at a club where a string orchestra is playing and they fall in love and then seem to fall out of love quickly. It's really beautiful and romantic and the strings are as lush as any string section has sounded and I mean it.Because of all these things this ends up being both a great fun movie and a bit of a throwback that doesn't quite take off. The director Clarence Brown is also known best for much earlier movies like the award winning precode A Free Soul which is fabulous. He's good the acting is good and the story is well pretty good. It's serviceable but a little too packaged and somewhat thin going.Another factor here is the racing itself the Indianapolis 500. Some of the footage is clearly from real races probably the 1949 or 1950 race...this movie was released in the fall of 1950. There are lots of scenestoo many unless you are car racing fanof cars zooming around the track. Credit goes to the cinematographer Harold Rosson who is a bit legendary because he helped with Wizard of Oz and did several other classics like Asphalt Jungle and The Bad Seed. The photography matters more than usual here because it's just car racing and it's made exciting and visually intense. Closeups of Gable in the car are of course constructed in the studio but seemalessly. Great visuals throughout.See this? You bet but remember it's really an entertainment and it has little complexity or depth and it has lots and lots of race track stuff that doesn't propel the plot just the immediate energy. It's no classic but it has classic qualities and faces for sure and I liked it. And in the end without giving a thing away the woman Stanwyck stays strong and keeps her independence a rare thing in 1950s movies.".

If you are a real racing fan you'll love seeing the the old midget racing footage much of it is real footage so for a real fan it's great. And so is the Indy 500 footage! It depicts the way racing really was back in the day. They raced midget's 7 nights a week and if you were good enough and got the right breaks you headed for the Indy 500.

Even though Clark Gable was mostly acting in front of a projection screen for the racing closeups they spliced it all together very well. And even though auto racing is dangerous now wow they raced open top cars with no seat belts at all no roll bar no fire suit pretty much nothing at all to protect a driver except a partial helmet and goggles. Also fun to see the pit stops with a lever for a jack and hammers to remove and replace the main tire nuts. Apparently a lot of footage from the 1950 Indianapolis 500 was used and it was something to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "So in 1950's To Please A Lady TPAL for short I'm being told that in order for the irresistible Mike Brannan to win over any woman yes even superbitch Regina Forbes all that he has to do is first slap her face good  hard and then without missing a beat forcefully plant a big wet lovable kiss smackdab on her eagerly waiting lips.And with that done you can be sure that any dame in her right mind of course would be more than willing to follow Mike to the very ends of the Earth and beyond. Yes. Even that alltime castrator Regina Forbes.... Ha! Yeah. As if! Well here's one thing positive that I can say about TPAL  Thank goodness Clark Gable had enough starpower clout to keep Barbara Stanwyck completely out of at least some of the scenes in this predictable and petty little Chick Flick  'Cause otherwise Stanwyck would've literally chewed up this picture to absolute shreds with her overbearing and detestable character portrayal.At least when Gable was on screen at first anyways the focus was on his character racing midgetcars. But alas once he planted that first fateful kiss on Stanwyck's lips this film's story fizzled right out bigtime and turned into a totally demented romancefromhell that bored me to tears.The very best moments in this picture were when daredevil drivers were entertaining all of the excited thrillseekers under the big top at the circus. But these scenes just didn't last long enough for my liking.It's like I said earlier  The best scenes in this supertrite romance story were when Stanwyck's character was completely out of the picture.To say that Stanwyck just about ruined this potentially promising picture would truly be an understatement. At least Gable in all of his arrogance was somewhat likable.".

	onyx:emotionText "So in 1950's To Please A Lady TPAL for short I'm being told that in order for the irresistible Mike Brannan to win over any woman yes even superbitch Regina Forbes all that he has to do is first slap her face good  hard and then without missing a beat forcefully plant a big wet lovable kiss smackdab on her eagerly waiting lips.And with that done you can be sure that any dame in her right mind of course would be more than willing to follow Mike to the very ends of the Earth and beyond. Yes. Even that alltime castrator Regina Forbes.... Ha! Yeah. As if! Well here's one thing positive that I can say about TPAL  Thank goodness Clark Gable had enough starpower clout to keep Barbara Stanwyck completely out of at least some of the scenes in this predictable and petty little Chick Flick  'Cause otherwise Stanwyck would've literally chewed up this picture to absolute shreds with her overbearing and detestable character portrayal.At least when Gable was on screen at first anyways the focus was on his character racing midgetcars. But alas once he planted that first fateful kiss on Stanwyck's lips this film's story fizzled right out bigtime and turned into a totally demented romancefromhell that bored me to tears.The very best moments in this picture were when daredevil drivers were entertaining all of the excited thrillseekers under the big top at the circus. But these scenes just didn't last long enough for my liking.It's like I said earlier  The best scenes in this supertrite romance story were when Stanwyck's character was completely out of the picture.To say that Stanwyck just about ruined this potentially promising picture would truly be an understatement. At least Gable in all of his arrogance was somewhat likable.";

	schema:headline " Stars  Studio gloss that got me interested in subject I normally wouldn't care less about.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that the subject of stock car racing has only passing interest for me. Only with other aspects in the plot could I remain interested in films like this Indianapolis Speedway and Grand Prix. Even boxing films a subject I am not a fan of are more exciting generally on screen because of the crime elements and the darkness of film noir attached. But with Stanwyck and Gable in their second film together and only romantic pairing together that was enough to give this film a repeat viewing. Gable is of course a stock car racer and Stanwyck the world's foremost female columnist. She wants to do a story on him after his driving for the second time causes another driver to be killed during a race. They don't click at first a natural to lead to romance in these kind of films but eventually the sparks fly.The race car sequences I must admit in this film are intense and Stanwyck's toughness is nice to see Gable to have to reckon with compared to his recent leading ladies of Lana Turner and Loretta Young. Stanwyck's short Jane WymanMamie Eisenhower hairstyle doesn't fully suit her but of the veteran stars of the 30's and 40's she was one of the few that aged gracefully and mostly naturally. The same year she was ravishing with long hair in the western noir The Furies.Still this is an adult picture with mature romance stars nearing 50 and has the distinction of legendary MGM director Clarence Brown. It is also a historically significant picture politically because of the recent investigation into communists in Hollywood its costars being extreme conservative Adolph Menjou who allegedly named names during the hearings and soontobe blacklisted Will Geer. It should be noted that they do not appear on screen together. In a pivotal political plot point Stanwyck shines in a scene where she threatens to destroy a public figure to his face while trying on a dozen pair of shoes.The third pairing of Stanwyck and Menjou after 1932's Forbidden and 1939's Golden Boy their relationship here is quite different as Menjou's character seems intent on manipulating Stanwyck into remaining a basically loveless hard as nails columnist. This asks the question can a tough female columnist remain objective in a story when she's in love with the subject of it? Scrappy and facicious Stanwyck also shows a human side when one of her victims takes his own life. She claims to Gable Don't you know? You're nobody until somebody loves you all the while unsure of where this will lead her in her career. The teaming is memorable for its reverse of what Katharine Hepburn said about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers In this case Stanwyck gives Gable class while Gable gives Stanwyck sex i.e. femininity.This is a man's picture where the woman is just as important rather than an outsider looking in. Stanwyck is very alluring in a scene cooing with Gable on the phone while he is in the next room on another line watching her. For me it is also a film that as I read into things not said in the script I began to rate higher than my original viewing 20 years ago.".

	schema:headline " Does anyone remember real virtue?";
	schema:reviewBody "Does anyone recall a time when values integrity uprightness and true human compassion were a way of life? A Walk in the Clouds does. The story is sweet romantic dramatic and heartwarming. The 1940's was an era when it was terrible shame to be unwed and pregnant. Daughters were often cast away or sent to some distant relative to bear their child in loneliness and disapproval then the child was given for adoption. I know because I was one of those children. For my mother there was no Paul Sutton to love her and rescue her and her child. The father portrayed by Giancarlo Gianni was a typical man of those desperate war torn years who was unable to get in touch with his feelings on any level except work and anger. I am more amazed at his ability to show affection for his wife than I am at the anger which rules his life. The family who eventually adopted me was just like this family. Hard horrible father heavy drinker full of anger yet rapier wit and tongue. The rest of the family are so real because in those days most families who had a disagreeable father figure pulled together to make up for and cover over the hurts and embarrassment generated by that father. Very different from today's dysfunctional families. Anthony Quinn was superb and Keanu Reeves could not have been more believable as a simple man with a good heart and high values. His character is not meant to display anything but goodness which he does beautifully. We have to remember that men used to be governed more by what was right than by the emotion of the moment as they are today. Aitana as Victoria is very lovely and desirable but her character is also governed by the morals of the day. While she is sexy and flirtatious and clearly loves Paul she stops short of using his attraction to her to seduce him because the very things she values and loves about him are his stability and uprightness. Today most women would simply go for it but this film is not about today. It is about real love and true respect. The musical score is simply beautiful and very moving. The wine country and the shot of the California coast along Big Sur are great. Oh by the by for the unbelieving after the grape harvest in the fall the branches of the vine die and become dry and brittle very quickly. The only part of a grape vine that continues to live is the stock and it's root but even that seems all gray and dead from just looking at the outside.

	onyx:emotionText "Does anyone recall a time when values integrity uprightness and true human compassion were a way of life? A Walk in the Clouds does. The story is sweet romantic dramatic and heartwarming. The 1940's was an era when it was terrible shame to be unwed and pregnant. Daughters were often cast away or sent to some distant relative to bear their child in loneliness and disapproval then the child was given for adoption. I know because I was one of those children. For my mother there was no Paul Sutton to love her and rescue her and her child. The father portrayed by Giancarlo Gianni was a typical man of those desperate war torn years who was unable to get in touch with his feelings on any level except work and anger. I am more amazed at his ability to show affection for his wife than I am at the anger which rules his life. The family who eventually adopted me was just like this family. Hard horrible father heavy drinker full of anger yet rapier wit and tongue. The rest of the family are so real because in those days most families who had a disagreeable father figure pulled together to make up for and cover over the hurts and embarrassment generated by that father. Very different from today's dysfunctional families. Anthony Quinn was superb and Keanu Reeves could not have been more believable as a simple man with a good heart and high values. His character is not meant to display anything but goodness which he does beautifully. We have to remember that men used to be governed more by what was right than by the emotion of the moment as they are today. Aitana as Victoria is very lovely and desirable but her character is also governed by the morals of the day. While she is sexy and flirtatious and clearly loves Paul she stops short of using his attraction to her to seduce him because the very things she values and loves about him are his stability and uprightness. Today most women would simply go for it but this film is not about today. It is about real love and true respect. The musical score is simply beautiful and very moving. The wine country and the shot of the California coast along Big Sur are great. Oh by the by for the unbelieving after the grape harvest in the fall the branches of the vine die and become dry and brittle very quickly. The only part of a grape vine that continues to live is the stock and it's root but even that seems all gray and dead from just looking at the outside. A fire in a dry postharvest vineyard would spread and destroy all just as it did in the film. Today there are sprinkler systems etc. to prevent such loss but not in the 1940's. What a great movie. I own it and will always enjoy watching it again and again.";

While many modern romance films claim to be such they invariably end up with hero and heroine ending up in bed sometimes with a little too much detail thanks very much.  But here in this visually stunning feast we have a romance where the hero out of honour and respect doesn't bed the heroine.  I am amazed that it has taken me five plus years to see this movie and I am grateful to the family channel for screening it for me to tape.  With a relatively simple story set against beautiful scenery with cinematography to die for we are swept into a world of the past where honour meant something where marriage vows no matter how hastily taken were still to be respected and where a single pregnant female was a family shame not the norm as today unfortunately.  I read one review where the reviewer said in reality Paul would have said not my problem babe get an abortion  in whose reality?  2002 reality perhaps but not 1940s reality abortions were for bad nasty girls in back streets by unlicensed doctors not for nice girls who had made a mistake okay so some things have changed for the better.  I simply loved this film while it gives a fairy tale view of the vinyards and the family running it it is a feast for the eyes and the soul.  The entire cast are superb particularly Anthony Quinn who relished his role as the family patriarch and seemed to simply enjoy being in this delightful tale and of course Keanu whose performance is so beautifully low key and understated he reminded me of those wonderful hollywood leading men of old strong silent gorgeous Cary Grant would have played this role back in the day who would have thought to put Keanu in the same role?  Turn off your 2002 brain and just revel in the sheer delight of this wonderful film.  I just know I will watch this again and again.".

Paul Reeves agrees to pretend to be her husband for a few days and then he will abandon her leaving her and her child alone.

Why did it take Hollowood so long to rediscover Debra Messing after her bit part in this film? Why is Keanu Reeves a big star while the extremely sexy Gregory Martin whom I still remember steaming up the small screen in the miniseries Ellis Island never appeared in a movie again?

It's actually nice to see a man who is gentle and kind...who says that's not masculine? And Keanu is very easy on the eyes too!Pure romance  the kind we rarely see and what we need more of!

The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief housedress and ostrichtrimmed highheeled mules to watch in the afternoon lying on the couch eating bonbons.   In fact bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.The only reason I was able to watch to the end is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene.  In most of his films he moves too fast to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality  more Italian than Mexican really.  The dialog is as stiff as wood.  Unfortunately no bodices are ripped  the hero is disgracefully perfectmannered and mild.  The aristocratic warmblooded oldworld family cliche is as old as the hills.   What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican?  This is a fairy story.I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for.   The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I didn't see his name listed but the art director surely was Thomas Kinkade who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias.   This film was literally seen through rosecolored glasses.   If you like dreamy pink and blue sky this film is for you!  The bonbons looked really good too!".

	schema:headline " A Magical Romance";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a magical fairytale of love struggle and romance directed by the brilliant Mexican director Alfonso Arau 'Like Water for Chocolate'. Keanu Reeves has never been better at being a 'good guy' here tormented by his origins as an orphan betrayed by a frivolous young wife returning from War with a head full of hopes only to meet with the apparent collapse of all of his prospects. But Fate intervenes and he meets the amazingly delicately beautiful Aitana SanchezGijon. She is the halfSpanish halfItalian actress who two years later was so brilliant in 'The Chambermaid of the Titanic' see my review. She has all the freshness of a rose which has just opened in the morning dew. This is what Penelope Cruz was like before she went to Hollywood. The story concerns her family the Aragons. Her mother is played radiantly by the Mexican actress Angelica Aragon and her intense and domineering father by the Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini. One of the finest performances in the film is by Anthony Quinn. He was rarely better than this. It is little known that he was born in Mexico half Irish half Mexican. Since his middle name was Oaxaca his mother must have been a Zapotec Indian. Here he is utterly in his element since the story is of an ancient Spanish family with a vineyard in the Napa Valley of California. Whether such people still exist anymore I doubt. But this is a fantasy very similar to the wonderful series of three novels by Bret Harte commencing with 'A Waif of the Plains'. Certainly these days as Hispanics become more and more important in America more films like this should be made exploring the early Spanish settler traditions. Much was made of this sort of thing in Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' but the lead was not followed up by subsequent mainstream directors. This film is a poignant story of how the lost and lonely orphan Keanu Reeves finds true love and acceptance at last in the bosom of a family and in the arms of one of the most delectable gals imaginable. But he only achieves this by being noble generous kind unbelievably tolerant and patient and by being tested in every conceivable way. Reeves could not possibly have played this character so well unless he had a lot of these qualities himself. The film is a wonderful achievement the period costumes and sets are perfect the buildings are authentic Spanish survivals from various places in the Napa Valley apparently the atmosphere is pure magic the vicissitudes are harrowing but love and devotion and goodness conquer all. This is actually a romantic film from an adult perspective which children can safely see and that's saying something these days. No grunting in corners as the emphasis is on love  remember love? It used to exist. Maybe it will come back one day. We need more films like this to encourage us. We also need more Aitana SanchezGijons if we can remember and pronounce their names that is. Etana was Sumerian for 'eagle'. I wonder if there is any connection with Aitana as she has the same noble quality. This film is an eagle it soars it truly soars.".

	schema:reviewBody "You often hear people lamentthey don't make them like they used to. This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant oldfashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II Keanu Reeves and Aitana SanchezGijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an exGI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and SanchezGijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by SanchezGijon's family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro SanchezGijon's grandfather. He steals every scene he's in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it's pure heart and the exquisite joy of it's touching romance.".

The trouble is however that their marriage was a rushed wartime affair as Paul like soldiers everywhere in America wanted to taste love and matrimony before being sent into battle. She seems happy to see him but wants him to return to his traveling salesman position as soon as possible. Once on the road again Paul meets a stunningly beautiful MexicanAmerican woman named Victoria Aitana SanchezGijon on the bus. When a small group of men begin to harass her Paul comes to her rescue with fists flying. Subsequently both Paul and Victoria are tossed off of the bus. As they are waiting for the next Greyhound Victoria tearfully tells Paul that she is pregnant done wrong by a professor at the university she attended. Her father a wealthy vineyard owner is going to kill her as Victoria states. But wait. What if Paul pretends to be her new husband and goes home with her for a day or two? Then the big blow of an outofwedlock pregnancy will be avoided and the couple can divorce some time later. Paul agrees to help her and they return to the stunningly beautiful vineyard and mansion she calls home. Naturally her father Giancarlo Giannini is angry at the sudden marriage especially since Paul is an orphan and Victoria can trace her family's history back 400 years. Yet Victoria's mother and grandfather Anthony Quinn try to make their new relative comfortable. But will Victoria and Paul be able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes? And what about the undeniable attraction that is brewing between the young couple? This is one of the most romantic films ever giving great delight to anyone who craves tales of epic love. Reeves and SanchezGijon are terrific as the gorgeous and confused young lovers while Quinn gives a great turn as the family's patriarch. Giannini too does a nice job as the proud yet vulnerable father and the other actors are quite fine too. As for the costumes script and production values they are wonderful also. But indeed it is the stunning photography of the lovely vineyard and stately family home that takes this film into the upper echelons of visuallyarresting movies. For those in the world who would like to stir up a romantic evening with their partners this film is a great catalyst. After a showing of its loveliness and romance most every viewer will be in the proper mood for a night of love.".

He travels the length and breadth of America working as a skilled tradesman in the construction industry. When times get tough however he finds himself living in a shelter where an acquaintance suggests they go out for a hamburger. What the friend really has in mind is to rob the diner and Allen soon finds himself working on a chain gang with a long jail sentence. Allen manages to escape however and heads to Chicago where over several years he slowly but surely works his way up the ladder to become one of the most respected construction engineers in the city. His past catches up with him and despite protestations from civic leaders and his many friends in Chicago he finds himself again on the chain gang.

	schema:reviewBody "In a society known for freedom and justice how is that justice truly measured and meted out?  When an individual's very life hinges on a verdict of innocent or guilty is there such a thing as an objective call?  Or is a person's life subject to mere perception a subjective evaluation of facts' assimilated through a filter of bloated egos and personal agenda?  All questions that many perhaps would prefer not to have answered nor indeed even asked at all.  Those who are so secure in the absolutism of our justice system that they will willingly defer to the establishment in all matters and with a clear conscience.  The system' after all is infallible or at least good enough isn't it?  Good enough that is when it's being tested on someone else.'  But what if that glitch in the system becomes personal? What if you' are the one who falls victim to a miscarriage of justice and your voice becomes impotent grinding your pleas into so much pulp beneath the wheels of a machine to which you are nothing more than another insignificant cog?  It's a situation examined in the absorbing drama I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang' directed by Mervyn LeRoy and starring Paul Muni.  James Allen Muni returns home from WWI to find his old job in a shoe factory awaiting him.  But James is a changed man with aspirations of doing something meaningful with his life and he wants to put the experience he received in the Army in the Engineering Corps to use.  He wants to build things bridges roads useful things.  And toward that end he sets out and scours the East Coast from north to south looking for work but jobs are scarce.  Finally having taken to walking the ties' the rail leads him into St. Louis just another outofwork bum in the eyes of society.  There he meets up with a guy named Pete Preston Foster who tells James he knows where they can get a hamburger as a handout.  The trusting and somewhat naive James goes along only to find himself on the wrong end of a stickup gone bad.  From that point the justice system moves swiftly and James Allen finds himself sentenced to ten years at hard labor on a chain gang.  His offense? Being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong guy.Based on the autobiographical story by Robert E. Burns and written for the screen by Sheridan Gibney and Brown Holmes LeRoy's riveting film is an inditement of the justice system specifically the brutality of the chain gangs but also of a society too smug and filled with selfrighteousness to realize how fragile and tentative the freedoms we enjoy really are.  America is the greatest country in the world a veritable bastion of freedom but those who would throw out their chests while holding up the Constitution citing whichever amendment it is that suits their personal agenda should be made to walk a mile in the shoes of Robert BurnsJames Allen.  Or for a start be required to watch this film.Released in 1932 this film is devoid of the melodrama common to many films of this era and instead presents the story in very realistic terms the meaning of which is indisputable.  Like Hitchcock's unnerving 1957 film The Wrong Man' also based on a true story this film is not only disconcerting but downright scary when you stop to consider the implications of it.  It also evokes a sense of Kafka's The Trial' also made into a movie in 1963 by Orson Welles but without the abstractedness unlike The Trial's' Joseph K. James Allen knows exactly what's happened to him and how.  What he can't understand is Why.'  Nor would any rational man betrayed by the very society in which he placed his implicit trust understand.Paul Muni gives a dynamic stirring performance as James Allen capturing all of the confusion exasperation pain and anguish of his inexplicable situation all of which you can see in his expression in his eyes and in his body language and demeanor.  You feel the darkness into which he is forced to descend and with him you share that sense of hope fading away more with each passing day.  From the tension of the moment when he first attempts to Hang it on the limb' to what is one of the most haunting endings ever filmed you're right there living it with him.  It's a powerful truly memorable performance by Muni.The supporting cast includes Helen Vinson Helen Noel Francis Linda Allen Jenkins Barney Berton Churchill Judge Edward Ellis Bomber Wells David Landau Warden Hale Hamilton Rev. Robert Allen Sally Blane Alice Louise Carter Allen's Mother James Bell Red William Le Maire Texan Edward Arnold Lawyer and Willard Robertson Prison Commissioner.  In no way does this film exaggerate the situation it depicts it doesn't have to.  In the end I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang' is a wakeup call of sorts a warning to those who take personal freedom for granted or place too much trust in a flawed system mired in bureaucracy.  That a film made in 1932 can still have such an impact today says more than enough about how good it is.  And once you've seen it you'll never forget that final haunting scene and James Allen's final words.  I rate this one 1010.".

I remember originally seeing this on TV back in the 1970s and really being shocked by it.  It's not graphic but what you hear is even worse then being shown it the whippings in particular.  It also shows a law system that doesn't give a damn about how they treat their prisoners. They should be treated like dirtand are!  The story moves quickly and Muni is just superb.  This movie made him and you can see why.  Also it has one of the most depressing endings I've ever seen in a motion picture.  It hit me hard back in the 1970s and still works today.  Muni's haunted face and the final line are harrowing.  A true classica mustsee.Be warnedsome noncable TV prints cut out the final line!".

He then went back to New Jersey. The state of Georgia home of these chain gangs tried to extradite him but New Jersey wouldn't give him up.Regarding the film........Powerful was a word describing this movie when it came out over 70 years ago and it still holds true today. It was based on a true story and if injustice bothers you this film will be disturbing.

But the others  Public Enemy Little Caesar and Scarface  although investing the protagonists with recognizably human traits like jealousy or male bonding  were nevertheless on the side of the state.  Okay he might love his Mamma but he's still a menace to society.  They all died violently in the end.  Here on the other hand is a story in which the protagonist is completely innocent guilty of nothing more than wanting to strike out on his own and accomplish something constructive after having been through hell in the army in World War I.The state  Georgia  convicts him in error.  He was forced into participating in the crime by a stranger although to be sure he acted guilty enough.  And what with the real James Allen acting as consultant and the film being based on his autobiographical book who can really tell how unwilling a participant he was?  Still the point of the movie is that even if were guilty of robbery the punishment imposed by the state the conditions at the chain gang were inhuman.  Let's say many sensible people would consider it cruel and unusual.  So Allen escapes the first time just as Cool Hand Luke did. According to the movie he rises to prominence as a selftaught engineer although again the point would remain the same even if he never rose above the station of busboy.  Coerced into marriage by a domineering greedy and selfindulgent wife whose autobiographical novel should have been a companion piece to Allen's he finds himself falling for a nice girl. But his past catches up with him. His wife betrays him out of spite.  The governor of Illinois is understandably reluctant to extradite a prominent citizen who has shown how socially valuable he is but the representatives of Georgia insist on a symbolic retribution.  Return to Georgia voluntarily says the soothing expensive Georgian.  There'll be only a token service of say 90 days in a cushy job then you'll be pardoned.  Alas he's thrown into an even more horrific penal servitude and his hearing is suspended indefinitely.  So he pulls Cool Hand Luke's Excape Number Two right down to the admiring companion who jumps aboard the truck with him. This time there is no going back at least not according to the movie.  The final shot is heartbreaking.  I don't know how much of this story can be believed insofar as Allen's character is concerned.  Suppose you were to write an autobiography.  Might you not come out looking a little better than you actually are?  Oh that God the giftie gie' us to see ourselves as others see us.  But I believe the chain gang sequences allright.  If Allen is fibbing about that he's still done a good job of convincing me that these conditions were real.  I've worked with Corrections Officers and while they might be tough and contemptuous towards inmates they treated them fairly.  But I can believe things were quite different in 1925 in Georgia. The South has an interesting way of dealing with deviance.  Southerners tend to be polite compassionate and helpful.  They go out of their way to be friendly  until you break an important rule.  Then you forfeit any claim to humane treatment.  You want to be executed?  Murder somebody in Texas or Florida.  In the course of the 1960s the state became as much of an enemy as the criminal himself  maybe moreso.  But this movie was released in 1932 a time at which it still took guts to depict a social system so thoroughly corrupt and sadistict.Catch this one if you can.".

I thought he was extremely believable as the unduly accused and convicted James Allen. This story will rip your heart out and rightly so.  The film is very well done in every way down to the smallest detail best example of this the disgusting looking prison food  if you can call it that.  The use of newspaper headlines is extremely effective as well as the very realistic scenes in the prison and work yard and the whole environment in which Allen must live.  The viewer can almost feel Allen's pain as the other inmate hammers away at his leg chains to give him a glimpse of hope toward freedom. However even the scenes of Allen's life on the outside still evoke a sense of foreboding.  This is a very powerful film.I saw it as part of the Essentials series on Turner Classic Movies and Robert Osborne said that the reallife protagonist on whom this film is based acted as a consultant.  Since he was still on the run however he was not credited.  The whole situation is so sad and this sadness and feeling of oppression hang over the film with such realism that sometimes it is as though you are watching Allen's life caught on videotape instead of a motion picture.  It is extremely gripping and downbeat with a killer ending.  The fact that it's a true story just adds to the pervasive feeling of doom.  Way ahead of its time and a brave picture to make in its indictment of the justice system.  WOW.TWO FAVORITE MOMENTS 1  Allen looking directly at the policeman in the barbershop with a determined steely glare as if suddenly realizing that he will not be recognized and simply defying the cop to recognize him.  The barber doesn't recognize him either even though the cop and barber have just been describing Allen.  This scene I am sure meant to emphasize the incompetence of the police and justice system without using any words to do so.  Fantastically done.  I am in awe.2  Chain gang inmate Barney Sykes played by supreme character actor Allen Jenkins finally released from jail is offered a ride from the prison staff who are carting the coffin of a dead inmate off the grounds.  Very matteroffactly as though he has done this before and thus demonstrating the dehumanizing effects of prison life Sykes hops up onto the back of the truck and sits right on the coffin. Upon seeing this out the window the other inmates ruminate on the fact that there are only two ways to leave the chain gang  get let out or die out.'I will not give the ending away but if it doesn't move you to tears I don't know what will.  Haunting.My ONLY minor problem with the film is that all of the ladies in Allen's life look so similar I could barely tell them apart!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!  See it.".

	schema:reviewBody "You could watch I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang a thousand times and still be seized with suspense and anxiety during both of James Allen's escape attempts. The story of a man wronged by injustice a man who gave his youth for his country his past to his future and his mind over to civil engineering. Forced at gunpoint to hold up a diner he is summarily sentenced to 10 years hard labor on the chain gang. If you have a soul this movie will move you. You would have to be heartless not to get angry whether during the scene where the warden causes the death of a sick inmate when Allen is betrayed for the first and second times by the prison board when he's betrayed by his loveless wife. It's a movie that draws out involuntary emotions. Strong emotions.You might just find yourself yelling at the screen It's not fair! I noticed that Paul Muni toward the beginning is to a T the prototype of James Dean and Marlon Brando. He epitomizes the frustration of youth as he tells his mother and brother he doesn't want a factory job anymore. He wants to build. He descends into abysmal poverty. He gets caught and thrown on the chain gang. He slaves away before a black prisoner helps him escape. See how progressive this movie is? The guards are white the saintly inmates are black. He builds a new life for himself from scratch on only his wits and skill. He's caught again just as he's found himself a woman he really loves. Allen is a tragic figure his tragic flaw is only his willingness to believe in the American criminal justice system.The title says it all. It's not I WAS a Fugitive... because he never gets away or is permanently caught. Like Al Roberts in Detour he flees forever. Parts of the movie are almost nihilistic as he gets stuck on the chain gang for guys who were too tough for the chain gang. Prisoners cry I don't care whether I live or die! What are you gonna do kill me? The chain gang breaks a man. It destroys his spirit until he's just a hollow shell that works until it can no longer and then gives out dies. All with stark BW cinematography to match the depletion of humanity the draining of life from the individual and from the nation.This along with Scarface is Muni's tour de force. He is eternally sympathetic and we are eternally in chains with him. Stone walls may not a prison make but when you're on the chain gang long enough you clearly become stuck in an imprisoned mind frame. As everyone has commented the ending is one of the greatest of all film endings. This surprising vision of Allen more a rat than a man leaping out of the darkness after his final heroic escape obviously no longer a hero. In the sparse light we get we see his emaciated and hardened face. He shakes his head when this woman whose only thought is for him asks if he'll need money or if he'll come see her. He backs out of the scene clearly afraid that somebody's traced him there and will have him back on the chain gang in an instant always running running running and then she calls out to him like any normal lover would How do you live? But his answer is not that of a lover. His answer is not that of a man. Nor of an innocent man nor of a hero. We don't know what he is.I steal he hisses in a ghoulish voice whose echoes linger in our ears long after the scene fades and out and THE END rolls with the Warner Bros. logo. I steal and we are forever haunted cursed with this vision of what an innocent man can become. A fugitive. I shiver every time I think of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG Warner Brothers 1932 expertly directed by Mervyn LeRoy is one of those rare movies released during the early 1930s to really stand the test of time. Although not the very first film to deal with prison injustice and harsh conditions this is probably the best of its kind. Based on the story by Robert Burns a war veteran who twice escaped from a chain gang in Georgia it seems likely that Warner Brothers would be the only movie studio willing to take risks dealing with a social protest story but here it is. And while actors like Spencer Tracy or James Cagney might have taken up such a challenge for the role playing it to conviction as fate would have it Paul Muni has turned out to be the best and only choice.The photoplay focuses on a World War Army veteran named James Allen Paul Muni who served his country earning his medals and now respect of his small community. Regardless of being offered back his old job he decides to find himself by drifting from state to state job to job until he finds something to his liking. Along the way Jim innocently becomes involved in a robbery by a guy named Pete Preston Foster. A shoot out occurs by the police killing Pete and arresting Jim. Because the money was found on his person the judge Berton Churchill sentences Jim to ten years of hard labor in a chain gang prison camp. Due to harsh conditions in a living hell Jim makes a successful escape becoming a model citizen over the years rising to the top of his profession in a construction firm only to be betrayed by his golddigging wife Marie Glenda Farrell for wanting a divorce so he could marry Helen Helen Vinson a socialite. Because of his expose to the media Jim finds he'll never be given his promised freedom after serving 90 days. He makes his second daring escape into the new world now hit by the Great Depression. In spite of his new found freedom he finds he'll always be chained for life as a wanted fugitive.Not exactly a family oriented movie I Am a Fugitive is a dark and very realistic drama told in documentary style with a touch of film noir. It includes violence though mostly taken place off screen such as the flogging of the convicts who groan out their pain. Unlike other chain gang movies this one doesn't feature punished convicts being placed in sweat boxes for long periods of time. While Paul Muni would achieve success in later years for his biographical dramas winning an Academy Award as Best Actor for The Story of Louis Pasteur Warners 1936 his role as the doomed Jim Allen victim of circumstance is obviously his best and most remembered performance. What makes Muni so different from the other screen actors is that Muni doesn't just play a character he BECOMES that character.Full of memorable scenes too numerous to mention the one that stands out is the scene where Jim after being brought back to the chain gang on a promise for parole and release within a year is awaken from his bed by one of the guards to be told that his appeal has been denied and that he will have to serve out his original tenyear sentence. Hearing this Jim with unshaved face and looking fairly dirty looks straight into the camera with tears slowly flowing through his eyes with the expression of disgust and betrayal making fists with his hands before resting down his head on the pillow. As for the prison escapes they are well staged with the second escape more exciting than the first.Taking support in this hardhitting drama are Louise Carter Mrs. Allen Sally Blane Alice Allen Jenkins Barney a fellow convict Edward Ellis Bomber Wells Jim's cellmate David Landau First Warden Edward McNamara Second Warden Noel Francis Linda the lady of the evening who makes Jim's night's lodging comfortable and James Bell as the illfated convict who suffers from stomach pains. When the movie played on local television back in the 1960s and 70s it was presented under a shorter title I Am a Fugitive but when distributed to video cassette in the 1980s its complete title was restored. Other than Paul Muni's Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his performance as Jim Allen the movie was honored the Best Picture award losing Cavalcade Fox 1933.After all these years I Am a Fugitive remains a fastpace manontherun drama which holds interest throughout its 93 minutes of screen time and not so easily to forget once it is all over. With the chain gang system being virtually a thing of the past younger viewers might ask What is a chain gang? the movie is a curious look back as to how prison conditions were like in the early part of the twentieth century and how the judicial system has changed since then. I Am a Fugitive available on both VHS and DVD formats has become a frequent revival on Turner Classic Movies. ".

Unlike other chain gang movies this one doesn't feature punished convicts being placed in sweat boxes for long periods of time. While Paul Muni would achieve success in later years for his biographical dramas winning an Academy Award as Best Actor for The Story of Louis Pasteur Warners 1936 his role as the doomed Jim Allen victim of circumstance is obviously his best and most remembered performance. What makes Muni so different from the other screen actors is that Muni doesn't just play a character he BECOMES that character.Full of memorable scenes too numerous to mention the one that stands out is the scene where Jim after being brought back to the chain gang on a promise for parole and release within a year is awaken from his bed by one of the guards to be told that his appeal has been denied and that he will have to serve out his original tenyear sentence. Hearing this Jim with unshaved face and looking fairly dirty looks straight into the camera with tears slowly flowing through his eyes with the expression of disgust and betrayal making fists with his hands before resting down his head on the pillow. As for the prison escapes they are well staged with the second escape more exciting than the first.Taking support in this hardhitting drama are Louise Carter Mrs. Allen Sally Blane Alice Allen Jenkins Barney a fellow convict Edward Ellis Bomber Wells Jim's cellmate David Landau First Warden Edward McNamara Second Warden Noel Francis Linda the lady of the evening who makes Jim's night's lodging comfortable and James Bell as the illfated convict who suffers from stomach pains. When the movie played on local television back in the 1960s and 70s it was presented under a shorter title I Am a Fugitive but when distributed to video cassette in the 1980s its complete title was restored. Other than Paul Muni's Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his performance as Jim Allen the movie was honored the Best Picture award losing Cavalcade Fox 1933.After all these years I Am a Fugitive remains a fastpace manontherun drama which holds interest throughout its 93 minutes of screen time and not so easily to forget once it is all over. With the chain gang system being virtually a thing of the past younger viewers might ask What is a chain gang? the movie is a curious look back as to how prison conditions were like in the early part of the twentieth century and how the judicial system has changed since then. I Am a Fugitive available on both VHS and DVD formats has become a frequent revival on Turner Classic Movies. ";

	schema:reviewBody "I have an interesting point of view for youI'm actually in favor of bringing back prison chain gangswork camps while at the same time being in favor of legalizing all consensual crimes yet I think that I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a simply brilliant film. I mention my unusual view on correctionsinstitutional punishment to stress that one need not completely agree with the film's surface ideology to think that the film is a masterpiece. And that's as it should be. Films should be appreciated or not as artworks not adopted or rejected as symbols of political or other views as if films are campaigning for office and you are wearing a button.Still this is a social conscience film and important as such. The story was adapted from the autobiography of Robert E. Burns who ended up on a chain gang in Georgia after he stole less than 6 so that he could eat. Burns has been changed to James Allen Paul Muni and the chain gang was relocated in Louisiana interestingly Georgia officials still became incensed at Warner Brothers and issued what amounted to threats against studio executives and the artists behind this film.The film begins with James on a ship in the military on his way home from World War I. He returns as a war hero decorated with a medal. Prior to joining the military he had been working at a factory in his New Jersey hometowna job he doesn't at all look forward to resuming. But when he arrives home he discovers that his Reverend brother and his mother are expecting him to go back to the factory and not make waves. He obliges at first but he really wants to become an engineer. Exasperated he leaves home again looking for work. Times are tough remember that I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was made during the Great Depression in the U.S. and James quickly moves from state to state trying to find and retain work.Things do not go so well. James ends up traveling along rail lines and staying in homeless shelters. At one he hooks up with a man who says that he can mooch a couple of hamburgers for them from the owner of a diner. The mooching works but the man suddenly pulls out a gun and initiates an armed robbery. James is forced into participating and gets caught bringing him to prison. The first section of the film focuses on existence in the chain gang. Later as one could surmise from the title James becomes a fugitive and the story becomes entrancingly complex as he tries to begin a new life. But difficulties keep arising.As he often did director Mervyn LeRoy achieves a style that seems remarkably modern. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is extremely serious but never approaches melodrama. Instead it has a wonderfully gritty atmosphere that tends to be underplayed insteadthere are similarities to more recent films that it probably influenced such as Don Siegel's Escape from Alcatraz 1979 and Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law 1986 both excellent in their own right.The plot is a bit sprawling in terms of the number of events the number of years and the number of geographic locations covered yet the screenplay by Howard J. Green Brown Holmes and Sheridan Gibney is extremely tight and logical. Nothing is superfluous. The pacing is always right on target. LeRoy knows exactly when to dwell on a scene versus when to let months fly by with changing calendar pages. The cinematography is also very attractive. LeRoy includes a lot of subtly clever artistic touches such as symbolic continuity in his editsfor example from a judge's gavel to a swinging sledgehammer on the chain gang.Muni is simply incredible. He's a perfect fit for the character. His performance makes the film extremely believable even when the character makes some illadvised choices. He seems as skilled at action as he is at drama there are a few action sequences here in the modern sense of that genre term. I haven't seen many of Muni's films yet but after seeing this one I'm anxious to check them out. The rest of the cast is fine but Muni receives 90something percent of the screen time.In addition to the indictment of the chain gang system LeRoy and his writers make the film a tragic parable of freedom versus regimentation. James is a freethinking individualist almost in an Ayn Rand sense who is constantly trapped in various conformist systems. The military is the first symbol of this and so is the factory that James dreads going back to. His brother is a symbol of conservative systematization via religion. And of course the chain gang is the most negative system in which James becomes entrapped. When James is the freestwhen he's wandering from state to statehe's also the most disadvantaged in terms of societal norms. His eventual vocation in the film can be seen as a gradual climb towards existential authenticity and his work is symboliche's not just literally building bridges roads and such. Ironically he was engaged in the same kind of work on the chain gang and ultimately James is not able to achieve the freedomauthenticity that he desires. It's as if the film is making the argument that extreme uniqueness entails marginalization as a fringe element in a way that's often actively negative. Of course there are many other interpretations possible but it's difficult to deny some of these messages.But however analytical you want to get I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a mustsee for any cinephile. The film is enjoyable on many different levels and is far ahead of its time.".

Unlike Scarface where Muni becomes a gangland boss he's led almost by accident into a life of crime.Restless since his service in the World War Muni leaves his factory job to see the world. On the bum he gets accidentally drawn into a holdup of a greasy spoon diner by another tramp Preston Foster. Foster is killed and Muni is left with the rap for a grand total of about 5.00 and change. Today that would be about 35.00 to 40.00 all told.No first offender status in this state and no one to speak earnestly for him he gets a 10 year stretch for that holdup. Here's where the themes of I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang come into play. The brutal and callous treatment of the prisoners had never been shown so graphically on the screen before although at RKO they were doing a film with the same themes in Hell's Highway at the same time.Muni got an Oscar nomination for playing James Allen in this film but lost to Charles Laughton for The Private Lives of Henry VIII. Still he gives a riveting performance as a man truly a victim of forces he cannot comprehend. Overshadowed by Muni and sometimes overlooked unfortunately is Glenda Farrell. She plays a trampy dame with a heart of pure brass who latches on to Muni who marries her when she discovers he's a fugitive then turns him in when he tries to throw her out. Her part as Muni's unfaithful wife may just have been her career role.Even though the film is black and white the fashions are old prison themes whether it's this one Brubaker or The Shawshank Redemption usually have a lot of the same themes and are eternal. This one is a deserved classic and should never be missed when televised.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie to be a stunning journey into the life of the wrongly convicted. The main characters portrayal of the emotions of someone who has done nothing wrong and must suffer the short end of a corrupt system is breathtaking. I find it amazing that this movie comes from the era that it did. It was very socially critical aware and sought to bring to the publics attention the very things which they were trying to ignore. The camera work in this movie alone makes it worth watching. The camera adds a very cool effect in the action scenes i.e. the car chase at the end and a very somber effect in the scene of hopelessness. I found the use of silence in this film to be quite amazing as well. The scene where the main character is getting whipped and the music drops out and all you can hear is the sound of the whip striking and the painful breaths of the wrongly accused adds a stunning effect and truly heightens the feeling of cruelty and hopelessness that the audience feels. The plot of the movie was very well done and takes you on an incredible journey from hope to despair from rags to riches and back again. I find it very interesting that the characters motivation to be truly great and not just settle back into the normalcy of his life before he fought in the war was what by an unfortunate turn of events led him to the very bottom of the social ladder. I find that this is a very accurate representation of how in American life even to this day trying to be more than people expect of you and break away from the norm to forge your own path is looked down upon and often punished despite the 'American Dream' of individuality and independence. The scene that I found the most moving in this film was the very last scene where the main characters fades into the darkness and all you can hear is him exclaiming 'I steal.' The irony that an honest man who up until then had never committed a dishonest act and was driven by the very system which was supposed to correct improper behavior to committing crimes in order to survive was truly emotionally cutting. I think that this film besides being an amazing tale of woe and fortune was very important in its time for exposing the corruption of the chain gang system.".

I find it very interesting that the characters motivation to be truly great and not just settle back into the normalcy of his life before he fought in the war was what by an unfortunate turn of events led him to the very bottom of the social ladder. I find that this is a very accurate representation of how in American life even to this day trying to be more than people expect of you and break away from the norm to forge your own path is looked down upon and often punished despite the 'American Dream' of individuality and independence. The scene that I found the most moving in this film was the very last scene where the main characters fades into the darkness and all you can hear is him exclaiming 'I steal.' The irony that an honest man who up until then had never committed a dishonest act and was driven by the very system which was supposed to correct improper behavior to committing crimes in order to survive was truly emotionally cutting. I think that this film besides being an amazing tale of woe and fortune was very important in its time for exposing the corruption of the chain gang system.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Little Caesar director Mervyn LeRoy's riveting preCode prison melodrama I Am A Fugitive from A Chain Gang protagonist James Allen's appetite for a hamburger lands him in the worst place on eartha southern chain gangbecause his hunger prompted him to participate as an accomplice in the robbery of a shortorder restaurant that yielded only five dollars! Scenarists Sheridan Gibney Howard J. Green and Brown Holmes derived their sizzling screenplay from Robert E. Burns' autobiographical account of life on a Georgia Prison chain gang. Indeed the author remained at large while Warner Brothers Studios produced this landmark film about social injustice that gave Georgia a black eye. Actually the title of the Burns autobiography carried the name of the state where he served time.Paul Muni was ideally cast as Robert Burns and he makes a highly sympathetic hero who pays the price for his splitsecond lack of poor judgment that sent him to jail. Allen was one of the thousands of troops that survived the First World War to return home a changed man. He tells his priest and his family that he does not want to go back to his old factory job even after his boss meets him at the railroad station and gives him his job back. Instead Allen wants to go into construction but the market for construction workers is extremely tight and our hero finds himself moving from one job to another until he meets a shady character in a flophouse. I Am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang qualified as one of the earliest films to expose the legitimacy of the United States legal system. Indeed as TIME magazine reported in 1932 Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy sued Warner Brothers Pictures Inc. and Vitaphone Corporation for 1000000 each for vicious untrue and false attacks in movie. In the film Burns breaks out of prison and heads north to Chicago. Five years later he has made quite a name for himself as a respectable business man in a bridgebuilding firm. Bridgebuilding itself serves as a metaphor in this instance.Things sour when a dame Marie Woods Glenda Farrell of Gold Diggers of 1935 discovers his closely guarded secret. Marie blackmails him into marriage but he falls in love with another woman Helen Vinson of They Call It Sin and begs for a divorce. Ultimately he is shipped back to Georgia. During his first stint on the chain gang Allen learns to keep his trap shut when he gets whipped for calling the chain gang warden a skunk for wanting whip a man who is nearly dead from exhaustion. When Allen brings up the idea of escape the convicts tell him the slang phrase for it is hanging it on the wire. They explain that anybody who breaks out has to contend with three things first the chains second the bloodhounds and third guards who would rather bring you back dead rather than alive. Later he entreats the AfricanAmerican inmate to smash his ankle chains to loosen them so he can eventually slip out of them. Among many memorable scenes is the barbershop scene. While the barber is shaving Allen a policeman enters the shop and describes James Allen to the barber. Allen demands a hot towel to cover his face. As he is leaving the shop later and trying to hide his face from the cop the barber inquires if the shave were close enough. Plenty replies Allen and vanishes into the evening. The ending is a corker.I Am A Fugitive from a Chain Gang is one of the greatest social problem movies to ever illuminate the silver screen. The film received nominations for Best Picture Best Actor for Muni and best sound. According to All Movie the publication of Burns' book led to the abolishment of that system and an erasure of Burns' sentence. A film not to be missed. The Burns autobiography was later remade in 1987 as an HBO telefeature The Man Who Broke A 1000 Chains with Val Kilmer playing Burns.".

There is no question that both films are masterpieces of their type with Mervyn LeRoy pulling together a lot of periods and kinds of milieu into a coherent and fast narrative for the later one. But I think both films owe their critical success to Muni's presence on screen a true Brando or Gable kind of figure with a short list of films to show for his abilities. Watch these both. If Scarface is more dazzling almost to the point of being dazzling for its own sake I Am a Fugitive is more moving and Muni makes us really feel for his situation or series of situations as the film proceeds.The story is based on an autobiographical book written by Robert E. Burns a man in prison at the time of filming and one sign of the success of LeRoy and Muni combined is that Burns managed to be released in the film's wake. And to some extent that was the goal of the filmnot just the fate of Burns but the public awareness of the cruelty of parts of the American justice system. There are no secrets about the agendait is announced in large type at the start of the moviebut it worked. And works to this day. Of course O Brother Where Art Thou 2000 owes a lot to this movie but the humor in the original is incidental or meant to give life to the characters not as a way of making the film especially funny. The drumbeat of horrors makes laughing very temporary and the social realism strikes me 70 years later as more or less real.Jaded and brilliant critics like Pauline Kael might refer to this kind of socially concerned film as naive but the movie strikes me as necessarily simple rather than blind or stupid in any sense. And it isn't that watching it is simplethere is so much going on a lot of characters including as series of women who come and go with surprising rapidity. It's more that the point is simplechain gangs are cruel. And not unusual back then. On the level of filmmaking the film is sophisticated rising above its message if necessary.There is one last element worth mentioning and that has to do with it being made two years before the Hays code got modified and enforced to its famous repressive heights. This allowed the key amazing beautiful ending to survive into the theaters. If you haven't seen it I can say no more but it's the kind of ending that the censors would have abolished along with some of the rest of the movie for its frank violence its suggestion of sexual indecency etc. So for another great example of precode brilliance look here. A masterpiece for its time and for ours.".

It adds a load of suspense to the scene and to me seems very artistic for it being made so long ago in fact despite the film's age it still holds up very well today. Unlike many old movies there are few poorlydone special effects or outdated techniques to distract from the movie in the ending but even that looked better than most movies from that time period that I've seen.All in all if you're a fan of prison movies or just classic cinema this is definitely a film you need to see  and the fact that it was based on a true story should be all the more reason to watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Allen Paul Muni a decorated American Sergeant in the First World War decides he does not want to return to his prewar job as a shipping clerk. From a window above his desk he can see a bridge being built which fires his imagination as he had formerly served in the US Army Corps of Engineers. He decides to leave his small New Jersey town to explore a position in engineering. But if there were a postwar economic boom it doesn't find Allen who cannot hit upon permanent employ despite moving throughout the Northeast and Midwest. The situation is so bleak that the veteran cannot even sell his war medal to a pawn shop which has many. Allen ends up in the Deep South. In a flophouse he meets Pete Preston S. Foster who tells him he knows a diner where he can freeload a hamburger. After the meal and without Allen's knowledge Pete pulls out a pistol and sticks up the counter man and forces Allen to pick up the five dollar take. Nearby cops rush in and shoot Pete to death and arrest the bewildered Allen. The hapless man gets ten years hard labor in a chain gang Georgia where he is harshly treated and poorly fed. Like other prisoners he works long hours and is even shackled to his meager bed at night. After a year Allen helped by another prisoner engineers an exciting escape through the woods with bloodhounds in close pursuit. He changes his name to Allen James and heads north to Chicago where he finds meaningful employment as an engineer in a construction firm. Building roads and bridges he rises up the corporate ladder. Unfortunately for Allen he meets wicked woman Marie Woods Glenda Farrell who recognizes his ability to earn a good salary. Reading his mail Marie discovers Allen's past as a convict. Although they marry the two are not a good match and Marie is even promiscuous. Later Allen tells Marie he wishes to leave her for Helen Helen Vinson a society lady who is a good match. Of course Marie squeals to the authorities. But as Allen is a good citizen the state of Illinois does not want to extradite him to Georgia. Besides as he has already been rehabilitated why send him back him to prison? After a federal controversy a southern representative arrives at Chicago and convinces Allen to volunteer to be extradited to Georgia where he will supposedly be paroled after serving just 90 days on easy duty. If this settlement looks too good to be true well it is. The Georgia authorities renege on their promise and Allen is back in a chain gang.Allen again escapes dramatically this time driving a dump truck with the body in the up position and ironically dynamiting a bridge. This last action destroys Allen's chance of returning to respectability however. He is free but is also on the run. At the end Helen asks him How do you live? Allen replies I steal!This powerful drama exposes the brutalities of the chain gang system. It features crisp dialog realistic scenes and such tight pacing that over a dozen years of Allen's life is covered in 92 minutes. As the perplexed Allen Muni was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor losing out to Charles Laughton The Private Life of Henry VIII. Muni born at Lemberg in the AustroHungarian Empire did win the Oscar in 1936 The Story of Louis Pasteur. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang was based on a true story and subsequent book by Robert Elliott Burns who in real life did receive a pardon of sorts in Georgia a commuted sentence and restored civil rights. Note that Burns did really steal the 5.29 in order to eat he died at age 63 in 1955. Because of the book and film many Southern chain gangs were abolished. In 1987 another similar movie was made with Val Kilmer The Man Who Broke 1000 Chains.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a great movie that shows the injustice that can happen in the world no matter how fair we try to make the justice system. It just shows that sometimes innocent people get convicted and the court system doesn't always catch it. Paul Muni did a great job as the main character James Allen who was a return soldier from WW1 who wanted to live to be more than some guy who worked in an office of a factory. Even though times were hard and many didn't understand why he would give up his secure job to search for a fantasy job of building things he still persevered and traveled around finding little jobs to help him get to the next one. Being wrongly convicted of a robbery he was sent to work in a chain gang. The movie really shows the cruelty and horror of being wrongly convicted but also of what really happened in the chain gangs. You had to even ask for permission to wipe the sweat off your forehead or else you would get beat. Or even at a person the wrong way could cause you to get whipped. These things really did happen and Hollywood did a great of revealing it especially since the movie was based on a true story. I have to say that the cinema photographer did an amazing job in this movie. There were really some great shots such as the scene were James get whipped just how you never see him actually get whipped but instead you as shown the shadows of what is happening and the reactions of his fellow chain gang members. The moral of the movie is great as well with the fact that a member of the chain gang can escape from prison and make a name for himself as a well respected individual in the community.".

	schema:reviewBody "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is one of those movies that really made me mad. Not because it's a bad movie but because it's a very good movie. This movie really pulls you into the story so that when something bad or unfair happens you feel like it's happening to you. There are many instances in this film where you just want to jump into the screen and change things around so they'll work out for the better. But if everything worked out for the better I don't think this movie would be as effective. This is a movie that really puts you into the environment. Most of the film has this very dark claustrophobic feel to it and it really gets under your skin. Whenever there's a prison scene and they show how much time has passed through a shot of a calendar passing through the months you feel it. Another thing that makes this film so effective is the sound. For an early talkie this movie really goes all out. With a soundtrack of gunfire explosions smashing rocks rattling chains and moving vehicles it really makes the movie much more effective. Even the moments with no sound are very effective because it gives the audience a chance to breathe and take everything in. I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is one of those movies that shows us a very painful reality. A reality that is very cruel and sometimes very unfair to the innocent. By the end of the movie you might be very mad but in a good way. Being mad is a good sign because it shows how engaging this movie really is. This movie is amazing from beginning to end. It may be dark and unfair sometimes but so is reality.".

Having visited India I know that this movie displays a very tiny facade of what Indians think would be appealing about their fascinating country. The Bollywood film Ek Dhun Banaras Keeqv never leaves the realm of comely mass entertainment.So in great wonderment I saw only the most beautiful facades of the oldest holy city on river Ganges a sadly polluted river shown here as clean as a mountain stream. There is no reality street life in this movie we are forced into the unreal world of a film as if ordered by the city's Tourist Development Agency.'Ashmit Patel'qv's prettyboy face is directed like a southAmerican music video with all smiles and no substance. There was no acting demanded of him. He would do well selling deodorant in France.The story wants to be spiritually deep and socially conscious by juxtaposing two stylized lovers from different castes. The potential conflict are undramatically produced after we are given about twenty minutes of showing the couple at Banares' famous temples and river banks looking at each other in unspontaneously staged settings that really irks everyone who want to be swept away by a movie's illusions instead of watching a long toothpaste or chewing gum commercial. This is a good travel promotion or a boring music video and one can only wonder what audience it was made for. If it is shown to Indians they must be proud of a movie of aesthetic beauty that shows their country without problems except the unfortunate castes system. Shown to western audiences it become a romantic travel film and as we have seen accepted both quite favorably by IMDb users of Indian decent and Westerners alike.Besides a cast of pretty people even Babaji the spiritual teacher floats about with the neatest beard and most perfect robes in white and red the film wants to teach basic Hindi and Buddhistic values. It even forewarns its audiences at the beginning that it does not want to promote superstitions but in almost every scene the accoutrement of superstitious beliefs are shown ornaments mystic sculptures flower petals strewn about chants and incense. Even the character played by the beautiful 'Urmila Matondkar'qv indulges in dreamy superstitious rituals. I respect all belief systems but if a director forewarns of something he is supposedly not wanting to promote and we see it all over his film we have a choice to either believe that he does not notice ritualistic superstitions any longer due to his cultural blindness or that he really beliefs that his message has transgressed superstition. And it is exactly this message that one would have liked not to see running into sturdy road blocks.Namely the endeavor to transgress a banal and forbidden love story without careful exposition and fall into the trap of cinematographically created ambiance that actually overpowers the actors. Pretty pictures are nice if you can not travel to the heart of the holy city but in this case the story suffers and certainly takes away from the filmmakers ambitions.And the story is the ageold apparent conflict between science and religion. Do we get enough information and exposition to learn something new or even care to contemplate this important topic? No. Is Banares well photographed? Yes the parts that are devoid of real street life and real people who normally bring life to the temples. Is there a tension between the lovers? No. Are we happy for them falling in love because we feel their hearts? No. Is the parentchild castes conflict melodrama powerful enough to move us? No. Are ageold chants well produced like a music video? Yes excellently. Does the movie do justice to the promos and hype about the alleged conflict of religious beliefs and modern science or its presentations of the philosophy of love or even as found in romantic love? Nothing deep there. Is the storytelling moving the film forward? No it stops too often to dwell on its on pretty pretensions.It's eye candy at best and the two protagonists do not connect except as another daft acting job. The dying dad at the beginning gives much story away but even he looked pretty healthy as if there was no makeup designer on duty that day. Melodrama yes.

The reason being it seemed most films were dramatic for the sake of drama and in the process they sacrifice the purity of the message. That didn't happen here. The film has a subheading of 'A Mystical Love Story'.. And thats exactly what you get. When I weigh everything up other comments posted here my own experience then I come to this conclusion I'd say This film achieves what it set out to achieve  The story doesn't falter in its culmination. I felt quite satisfied at the end and not just tantalized by some overdramatic cheap thrill with no lasting message.".

Specially Urmila did wonderful job she got the suitable role and did it well. Ashmit impressed me. Dimple Raj Babbar and Nasseruddin had done hundreds of such role so played their part with ease and positive impact. Super natural subject line is always hard to present but direction and script really are praise worthy. Music is very touchy and blended nicely with scenes and situations. Movie is very lucid though slow unlike todays funky movies. Story is gripping and dialogues related to spirituality are admirable.".

The movie as a whole is so enlightening and floods the viewer with positive energy through its religious significance. Also the movie was very well directed with its setting acting and song choice. It has the power to suck you in whether or not you are the religious spiritual type. I may be a little biased toward the movie moreso than not having parents from Banaras.

Good producers and directors can't compete with this banchods or stoop down to their level hence the good movies like Banaras are few and far apart. The majority of Indians are ashamed of these maggots who are on the top because they are promoted by the Suvvar Rats of the Media who are also born to Rats. This is a movie that is a glee to watch. The cast is commendable with a good piece of acting by Urmila As Shwetambari. The story is not contrived but down to earth. This movie has a message of love and respect for the higher being. Ashmita Patel has the serene look needed for the part. Benares is the religious capitol of India that people from all walks of life come to purify their soul.".

There was a similar line you could pull with the movie Mohabbatein in the relationship between Sharukh and Aishwaria. The songs were beautiful. Ashmit is a very bad actor so is Urmila. When she dances she makes movements with her head and her mouth I have seen in a lot of her movies before. Only the words 'what the hell is she doing?' come into my mind. Naseeruddin had a very small role to make things up with the other bad performances.In the beginning you can see Raj Babbar on his death bed. This gives a lot away from the story. That is a pity.

It is this friendship which slowly evolves into something deeper that truly motivates the protagonist in his pursuit of a better life.The Man Without a Past strikes us because unlike other films involving amnesia it makes us hope M won't recover his memory what he experiences throughout the movie the people he meets that's what really matters. It's a little bit like a road movie they never end with the characters reaching their destination only this time the voyage involves the mind and the spirit. It's a similar voyage the director asks the audience to join as he artfully explores human life and its chances of improvement.Moving and reminiscent of Italian neorealism De Sica Rossellini Visconti The Man Without a Past is a flawless reflection on how happiness is to be found anywhere no matter the circumstances.".

It permeates Christian values without sermons priests or any religious hard sell a small poster of Christ in a booth of the Salvation Army is an exception. Philosophically it presents Tabula Rasa or a clean slate to begin life anew. The film tends to be absurdist not even a moan emanates from brutalized victims of violence broken noses are twisted back painlessly victims of violence emerge from shadows to mete out justice. The film recalls shades of the brilliance of Tomas Alea's early Cuban films and the humanity of Zoltan Fabri's Hungarian cinema.   The film presents entertainment of a kind that would be alien to Hollywooda cinematic essay on human values that seem to be a rare commodity the world over. There is no sex there is no need for it. The poor who live in garbage bins and in empty containers are rich with pockets full of kindness helping each other without any expectation of a reward. The rich and powerful the exwife and her lover the policemen the hospital staff the official who rents out illegal living space seem bereft of true feelings or any human kindness. The poorer sections of society the electrician the restaurant staff the family who nurses the main character the Salvation Army staff do good to others care about others and expect nothing in return.The film is an affirmation of Christian values without preaching religion. The main female character in love with the man is ready to sacrifice her love because she genuinely respects marriage vows and even brings a train schedule to send off her lover to his wife. The art of giving is sanctified. A man who employed workers believes in paying his workers even if it meant robbing a bank to do so. A lawyer argues a case well because he likes the Salvation Army. Symbolically even half a potato among six or eight harvested is given away to some stranger wanting to eat it and avoid scurvy! Again symbolically there is rain on a clear day to help grow the few potatoes...The film provides humour of a quaint Finnish variety. A timid dog that eats leftover peas is called Hannibala male name one can associate with a king or even the cannibalistic Hannibal Lectereven though the dog is female. There are swipes taken against the government and its associated machinery antiquated laws North Korean buying Finnish banks retirement benefits strikes and strikers bank staff corrupt banking practices.Trains play a crucial role in Kaurismaki's screenplay. It begins and ends the film. It also punctuates the film when the past is revealed briefly.There are possible flaws in the filmthe blue tint when the children spot the injured man. The unexplained Japanese dinner with Sake and Japanese music on the train. The significance of the cigar in the script is elusive. The choice of songs however good seem to be haphazard.The script is otherwise brilliant. In glorifying the detritus of society Kaurismaki seems to affirm there is indeed a link between the tree and falling dead leaf with reference to a comment by a character in the movie. The train moves on. Forward not backwards! Minimizing the world into a man a woman a dog and trains Kaurismaki serves a feast of observations for a sensitive minda tale told with a positive approach to move on and seize the day. It is a political film an avant garde film a comedy and a religious film all lovingly bundled together by a marvelous cast.Finland should thank Kaurismakihe is her best ambassador. He makes the viewer love the Finns warts and all!".

	schema:reviewBody "This Finnish film may not be for everyone. Though nominated in 2002 for an Oscar for best foreign film I don't think it got much play in the US. It's a quiet movie about a guy who is beaten in a park in Helsinki right after getting off a train. The hospital thinks he's dead but he staggers out gradually recovers and can't remember a thing. He meets a number of people most of whom help him in some way or another. He meets a Salvation Army woman and a relationship develops.It's hard to describe this movie. The dialogue is often funny but delivered absolutely deadpan. There is no excitement but a rich development of story and relationships through incidents that happen to the lead character or that he causes to happen. The two leads Markku Peltoa and Kati Outinen are adults and look it. There's no Hollywood handsomeness about either of them. The structure of the movie is a gem of economy.

	onyx:emotionText "This Finnish film may not be for everyone. Though nominated in 2002 for an Oscar for best foreign film I don't think it got much play in the US. It's a quiet movie about a guy who is beaten in a park in Helsinki right after getting off a train. The hospital thinks he's dead but he staggers out gradually recovers and can't remember a thing. He meets a number of people most of whom help him in some way or another. He meets a Salvation Army woman and a relationship develops.It's hard to describe this movie. The dialogue is often funny but delivered absolutely deadpan. There is no excitement but a rich development of story and relationships through incidents that happen to the lead character or that he causes to happen. The two leads Markku Peltoa and Kati Outinen are adults and look it. There's no Hollywood handsomeness about either of them. The structure of the movie is a gem of economy. One scene ends and the film moves briskly on to the next scene. No extended unnecessary character development. No superfluous dialogue. It may sound pompous but this movies creates at the end a nice feeling of mature contentment.";

It's a Finnish film which is unusual to start with at least here in the U.S. because we don't see too many films from Finland. It's a black comedy meaning deadpan looks with subtle comedic lines. In English it's titled The Man Without A Past.The main actor Markuu Peltola is perfect for this movie with one of the most deadpan faces you'll ever see. He is amazing to watch and Kati Outinen as his love interest is similarly strange and fascinating. Part of their charm are their unusual looks. This is not a romance between people who look like your normal handsome film stars. Simply this is just something very different from anything you've seen a combination of drama comedy and romance with some of the strangest dialog I've ever heard on film. If you appreciate dry humor and a bizarre but touching story you should see this.".

It is really amazing that we have not seen other Finnish works before.  This kind of offthewall story which has a wonderful basis of humanity underneath the more real than life characters clustered around a site with little or no conveniences of modern living in their sea container households.  The odyssey of M who wanders through his voyage in search of himself only to be reconciled not with his long suffering and long awaiting Penelope but with a frustrated but goodhearted Major Barbara.There are lots of puns visual and otherwise with the threads of incompetent cops doctors nurses employment office workers interwoven with a comical wannabe badguy overseer a rock'n roll Salvation Army band a torchsongstress SA Major and the philosophical hero who honestly can't remember.Check this one out without fail.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first Aki Kaurismaki film that I have seen and it is the second film in a trilogy. I definitely want to see the first one now and I plan on seeing the third whenever it comes to my neck of the woods. Film is a very simple story of a man Markku Peltola who while waiting for a train goes to a park and falls asleep on a park bench. Three thugs come along and beat and rob him. He is so beaten that when he wakes up in a hospital he has amnesia. We never do find out his name! He leaves the hospital and has no where to go. A very poor family living in a metal container take him in and try to help him. He goes to the Salvation Army for free food and an opportunity to work small jobs and its there that he meets Irma Kati Outinen and is attracted to her. The film follows this man as he romances Irma and works odd jobs. Its all presented in a very dry and droll comedic fashion. All the characters are very emotionless no matter what the circumstances are and in some ways its reminiscent of the films that Jacques Tati use to make. In one scene in a bank a robber enters and shoots a broken security camera and the teller and our protagonist all act very calm and very polite. At the heart of this film is even though the characters are very quiet they are very helpful of one another and seem to care for each other. I have heard that all of Kaurismaki films are like this and its been nicknamed Aki's world. Kaurismaki is a very unique filmmaker and the way he presents his characters is in contrast to the bleak area that they live in. Even though the film and the characters are laid back in their attitude the romance between the man and Irma shouts of passion. Their affection and fondness for one another doesn't need words. It rings loud and clear!".

He meets and falls in love with a Salvation Army worker and this relationship in particular made the film seem like an old 50s melodrama.

It is weirdly reminiscent of watching a Keatonesque silent film but with dialogue. I thought of Samuel Beckett as I watched this and understood why he liked Buster Keaton so much he represented humanity's eternal struggle to be seen and heard while he was surrounded by unending chaos cloaked as 'civility'.The brilliant Finnish writerdirector Aki Kaurismaki satirizes just about everything here and does it so well that you'll miss a lot if you blink too much.This is essentially an absurdist black comedy but it's so much more. The acting is so unusual and so remarkably deadpan that it becomes a testament to controlled cinematic mayhem. Markku Peltola the unknown 'M' who literally rises from the dead and Kati Outinen as the stonefaced Irma are both wonderful but then again so is the entire cast. How Kaurismaki manages to sustain this straightfaced sendup for 100 minutes is astonishing. You just don't see this kind of stuff very often.Kaurismaki is up to a lot of mischief with this film. With the exaggerated aloofness everywhere on display he must surely be having fun with widespread perceptions of Scandinavian 'iciness'. I'm not sure what the Finns thought of this film but it's deeply appreciated and endearing for someone in faroff Canada we're a country of stereotypes too.Kaurismaki doesn't miss many satirical targets the rigid stupidity of corporate and government bureaucracy religion Salvation Army's newfound rock band with boyish faces singing rollicking songs with absolutely no facial emotion the 'sanctity' of marriage and I loved this the lunatical excesses of capitalism a bank so 'downsized' that its alarm systems no longer work it's left with one employee and it's being sold the next day  to North Korea.When you can sustain this lunacy and still make some important statements about the nature of kindness identity and human dignity then you've pulled off a great work of art.

	schema:reviewBody "MAN WITHOUT A PAST THE Aki Kaurismki  FinlandFranceGermany 2002.This second installment in Aki Kaurismaki's projected Finland Trilogy is a heartwarming fable about a man Markku Peltola who loses everything including his identity. After M as he is referred to for the rest of the film dozes off on a park bench he is awoken by a trio of thugs who brutally beat him up steal his money and toss his wallet and identity papers into the trash bin. In the hospital he is pronounced dead by the doctors but by some miracle he springs back to life but with no memory whatsoever of his past or his identity. Now a penniless amnesiac he has to build his life from scratch. Without knowing a single person and without a single person knowing him he must try to survive but he soon acquires a melancholy dog named Hannibal and falls in love with Irma a lonely salvation army soup kitchen volunteer. Of course his past does catch up with him but it only works to point out what's really important in his future life.Kaurismki usually champions the outcasts of society and here it's no different. He once said I make films for the unemployed but since they don't have money to buy cinema tickets I generally have no audience. Of course Kaurismki has a huge audience by now but no matter how simple and accessible the story in the film might look he still manages to blend romance quirky comedy and social commentary seemingly effortless into the film's narrative. Most of the humor doesn't come from any written gags or jokes but springs from the absurdity of the situations all in Kaurismki's typical deadpancomedy style complete with nods top '50s Bmovies rock'n'roll rhytm music as it's called by M fairytale romance and an incomparable soundtrack featuring British beat combo The Renegades. I just love the music in this film! Time and place hover between Helsinki in the '30s and the present. Despite the idiosyncratic setup and the strange unreal dialog it's incredible how very real all these characters feel. Deep sentiment but every inch of it sincere. I can't get enough of this film no matter how often I've seen it. Camera Obscura  910".

The performances from the actors seem very contrived and wooden devoid of any actual emotion which gives the whole film a very lighthearted feel working hand in hand with amusing traits that most of the characters possess.  This coupled with a jaunty soundtrack and some brilliantly written dialogue Leave my metabolism out of this puts a smile on the audience's faces.  But then you realise you're smiling and considering the subject matter the whole film becomes insanely surreal.One reading of the film could say that the lighthearted treatment is actually a representation of the love and community spirit that is thematic in the film.  The vagrants work together even the landlord is prepared to do anything for a modest fee and they can always rely on the kindness of strangers or the Salvation Army.  This sense of community culminates in the film's ending.Maybe if Markku Pelota was all alone without a memory then the film would be a lot more disturbing.

There is an honor in just getting up in the morning. The people here are either honest and generous  even the local cop who exploits the poor  or crippled participants in the machine.

The music itself is highly stylized and like the film is an abstraction of deep rich emotion. It is played here by a Slavation Army band our hero brings to musical salvation.

Some films or TV shows have shown the homeless as being almost saintly. Next while the title character cannot remember who he was once he finds out he was neither a monster nor a saintand I was REALLY expecting this to happen.What we have left is a clever film about a guy who cannot remember who he is and so he sets about creating a new identity for himself instead of just sitting around waiting for his past to return. Along the way he meets some really interesting characters such as the guy in the bank and the amazingly complex Anttila. Not a great film but so smart and refreshing it is one of the better films you could watch.The film is rated PG13 because it has one brief scene of violence when the lead is beaten savagely by a gang but other than that there's nothing offensive about the film and is acceptable viewing for teens.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact that I'm already quite familiar with Scandinavian cinema I must admit that I had never seen a Finnish movie before. I didn't even have one on my list of movies that I definitely wanted to see. I like Finland and its people but I never thought that there was one of them who had ever made a movie worth noticing. Well I was wrong about that. Aki Kaurismki's The Man Without a Past is certainly one of the better movies that I've seen lately.It all starts with an unknown man who arrives in Helsinki and who gets severely beaten up. It's so bad that he almost dies in hospital but somehow he manages to survive and only moments later he escapes. The next time we see him again he's lying on the shore of a river unconscious. A family of homeless people takes care of him and when he wakes up again he can't remember anything. He doesn't know who he is what he's called what his job is... nothing. Because he isn't able to get a job or an apartment because he isn't able to give his name he starts living in a container on the outskirts of the city where he gradually starts to take up life again. He meets a girl that works for the salvation army and falls in love with her. But when he is arrested at the scene of a bank robbery and the police starts looking for his real identity his name and past are revealed turning his actual world upside down...I must say that I was very surprised by this movie. As I already said I'm familiar with Scandinavian cinema mostly Danish and Swedish but this was something completely different. Scandinavian movies are almost always excellent drama's but this movie was even further away from being a feelgood movie than those others. And yet it wasn't. Through all the misery you also get to see a glimpse of happiness of hope and of true love. So this movie really leaves you behind with a double feeling. Should you feel sorry for this man or should you be happy? I guess the last option is the best but that's only my personal opinion of course. And that duplicity can also be found in the fact that the dramatic scenes are combined with some fine sometimes absurd humor. You even start to doubt whether it's appropriate to laugh or not. Is it OK to laugh with these situations that these people get in? Once again I think it is but watch it and decide for yourself.The acting in this movie may appear a bit weird to many. The actors seem to be a bit slow in all their movements and talking but somehow that only adds to the tragedy of the moment. It's as if you get the chance to fully understand the moment. And it has to be said despite the fact that these people sometimes appear to be a bit emotionless they certainly are not. I guess it's also important to know that most Finish people always try to keep a certain distance are a bit more reserved and are less open about their emotions certainly when you just get to know them. I've studied with them worked with them and been to Finland so I know what I'm talking about.In the end this is a very touching drama. The music and the humor make it all a bit more bearable to see how these poor people have to fight for their existence but it never takes away the fact that you are confronted with their actual situations. I really liked that a lot and that's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve anything less than an 810. I'm already looking forward to other Finnish movies.".

Mies Vailla Menneisyytt is a film about the troubles of an ordinary man who is left to fend for himself after being beaten by hoodlums.In this film Aki Kaurismaki has continued his passion of portraying underdogs as his genuine sympathies are for them.According to a shocking survey some nouveaux riches people of Finland raised their objections about this film by stating that it does not represent Finnish realities as their country is not like a poor society.It would really be nice if these people could somehow be induced to appreciate this film's humor which is not at all slapstick and comes through observation of daily lives.A good film is hardly devoid of a sensible message.This film's message is clear and simple.It is better to forget one's bad memories and not know anything rather then trying to pretend to know everybody.".

The good thing I found about this movie was No romanticism of misery no enlightment of the tortured hero no sobstuff love story no superflous aloof intellectualism at all. At least not in an obtrusive or overly serious way. But in a way that it sometimes shocked me  sometimes made me laugh sometimes grin. I was never bored.

	schema:reviewBody "Caught this at the Cork Film Festival. I had high hopes for it as I generally have an affinity for Scandinavian movies but this surpassed all expectations. Basically the story revolves around a guy who loses his memory after a random assault and tries to build some sort of framework for an existence where he has no identity. The episodes which follow involve his relationships with a variety of characters in the community in which he settles. These are filled with a deeply satisfying blend of rich humour and an analysis of the national psycheculture. The humour is by turns deadpan mildly satirical and sometimes just downright absurd and gutwrenchingly funny. At all times it is extremely goodnatured and the director has a composer's touch for hitting the right note. I might be getting it all wrong because I brought a couple of friends along and they fell asleep! I urge you to go along though and see for yourself at the very least I promise you a very different night at the movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a disaster of sorts in that it failed miserably at the box office perhaps due to its very strong Jewish content. Nevertheless for the Jewish audience it is a fantastic comedy where we laugh at ourselves. There are some flies in the ointment. As always the Jewish boy in question can not have a Jewish girlfriend. Hollywood does not accept the fact that Jews marry Jews and Alby  a rather fat Elliot Gould!! is no exception but his shiksa is worth her weight in gold. A Jewish mother would kill to have a daughterinlaw as caring as Elizabeth is to her diabetic shlemiel of a son. Margaux Hemingway may she rest in peace  is wonderful in this role. We lost a terrific actress here. The Family is a pastiche of all the stereotypes we Jews love and hate so well the rich uncle who is a tough businessman with a heart of gold and his bitch of a  wife and useless son. The usual hangerson and assorted nebbishes who work for him are there  God this fits my family to a T !!! The scene at the synagogue is wonderful and the Lubliner Rebbe is well interpreted by the great Zvi Scooler. The celebration at the Rumanian restaurant is word for word exact of whatever we had in the 1950's. Shelly Winters is a great actress her role is a treat to watch. Her outburst at the restaurant is the hit of the show. When we heard the audience gasp 99 Jewish I felt that the movie was an effective comedy  but I also knew that a 99 gentile audience would not see the humour and sadly I was right.This is a marginal film and must be accepted as such but that is too bad because there is enough in there to amuse everybody. Elliot Gould and his friend Nick played by my favorite cromagnon Burt Young are a pair of shleppers that you have to love  that piss scene is wild.  The scene in Uncle Benjamin's house with the plastic on the chairs must be preserved in a Jewish museum  that is exactly how we were!!! Sid Caesar is Uncle Benjamin and is a delight. His acting ranges from shtick meshuga to Shakespearean pathos. Anyway grab a copy at the local Blockbusters or whatever and invite the family and...enjoy!! To hell with the bad reviews  what do they know ?????".

	schema:headline " Jewish Travails in Brooklyn and Manhattan";
	schema:reviewBody "OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE is probably not well recalled by most people today but the film is only twenty two years old and certainly captured a spirit that is rarely seen in American films. For all the so call liberalism of the American cinema certain aspects of ethnicity are quietly buried. Anti  Semitism was attacked in GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT but the antiSemitism under scrutiny was a social form you can't join certain clubs you can't get certain jobs you can't register in certain four  star hotels which is annoying but somewhat bearable compared to European or Middle Eastern versions. Except for one notorious incident the Leo Frank trial and lynching in Georgia in 1915 it is rare that the degree of antiSemitism in this country has gotten so hot as to make Jews literally fear for their lives. In the case of the Frank affair the AntiDefimation League of B'Nai Brith was created. But that was the real highpoint of rabid antiSemitism going so far.One of the misguided ways that Hollywood has acted to reduce the tension is to ignore or make fun of it or concentrate on other side issues. So if we see Jewish lives at home it is done in a funny manner. For example in MY FAVORITE YEAR Alan Swann the famous movie star is invited to a Jewish home for dinner and he is well treated but the family act like a bunch of clumsy oafs in their reactions to the polished if drunken Swann. Most of the time Jews don't act so stupidly but not in Hollywood comedies.OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE tried to mingle the comic with the dramatic in a study of religious bigotry and financial muscle. Alby Sherman Elliot Gould is a coffee shop owner in Brooklyn who has been saving his money and planning to buy a fancy eatery on the east side of Manhattan. To do this he is dependent on the good will of his Uncle Benjamin Sid Caesar who has made a good living in the clothing trade. Benjamin is very fond of Alby looking at him as the son he always wanted Benjamin has a wife and son but the son is a smirking nonentity and certainly not one to have a wife and children. However Benjamin is very conscious of being Jewish and he wants Alby to marry a Jewish girl. Alby is currently shacked up with Elizabeth Margaux Hemingway who is a shiksa a nonJewish woman. Ben is not happy about this and basically lets Alby know that if he wishes to get financial assistance from his uncle he has to drop Elizabeth.To his credit Alby does not do so  he tries to find alternatives to going to Ben even toying with a loan shark. Ben in the meantime presumes to meddle further by confronting Elizabeth and asking if she really wants to hurt Alby or sacrifice their love to enable him to succeed. Ben of course does not see his meddling in a bad light. He even has a replacement for Elizabeth in mind  Alby's distant cousin Cheryl Carol Kane a schoolteacher who lives with her elderly father and appears to be demure and quiet.The film follows the twists and turns of our hero and his family and Elizabeth. We see a world that Jews are fully aware of where members of families know each other's business whether they should or not and where diplomatic maneuvering is as vital on a small scale as the same maneuvers would be between nation states.The film had many funny moments. One I cherish is meek little Cheryl finally cutting loose with the wrong person. Another is when Alby is desperate enough to make a late night phone call from Time Square turn down the silent request of a derelict for some change and get a commentary on his generosity he never expected.But to me the most interesting part is watching Sid Caesar's performance. Usually playing comic roles such as in THE BUSY BODY or in Mel Brooks' SILENT MOVIE Caesar has always showed how to exaggerate successfully for a laugh. Only he would introduce a drunken woman to a dummy as his friend Matthias Kreplach the millionaire in THE BUSY BODY. But here despite some mild comic touches his dealing with the Japanese businessmen most of his performance is serious. In fact OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE was Caesar's best straight performance in a motion picture. The scene when he finally collapses and explains why he relied on Alby towards the end of the film was a small marvel as he literally collapses in tears admitting to decades of personal disappointments.Aside from that the performance of Margaux Hemingway haunts me a little. Made less than a decade after her first film LIPSTICK she should have been having a first rate career. In many ways OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE represented the highpoint of her career as most of the other titles were far more obscure. She seemed to have the world open to her in 1984 and few could tell that it would be over so badly in twelve years.For her the glimpse into Jewish life and real problems and for Sid Caesar's best dramatic work I give OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE a 10.".

Anyway It all goes down hill from there... the cast although usually talented fail to deliver in this one they simply sleepwalk through a cookiecutter Hollywood plot doing the minimum to earn their keep.

I witnessed this egregious error in a Brooklyn theater back in the day. I swear if the director or producer had been present they would have been ripped apart literally. Anyway It all goes down hill from there... the cast although usually talented fail to deliver in this one they simply sleepwalk through a cookiecutter Hollywood plot doing the minimum to earn their keep.

	schema:headline " Sid Caesar Is Extraordinary";
	schema:reviewBody "So OK this is not a great film but there are several excellent moments here and at the end you feel you have watched something worthwhile.Elliott Gould stars as a luncheonette owner making a living in Brooklyn. He has a doting mother Shelley Winters a domineering uncle Sid Caesar and a nonJewish girl friend Margaux Hemingway. He's also overweight diabetic and Jewish.While this seems a lot like Woody Allen territory and their are plenty of comic moments there's a dark underside of otherness here that gives depth to this film a serious took at perhaps passing as a White American but being always aware of otherness.Of course all of Gould's extended family here are Jewish stereotypes the language the gestures the work ethic etc. Gould straddles the fence White but Jewish Brooklyn but with an eye toward Manhattan. In the Orthodox wedding scene Gould wears a baseball cap over his yarmulke. His best friend Burt Young is Italian. His employee Robert Gossett is Black.There are two surprising and extraordinary scenes in this film both quite memorable. One has Gould wandering New York in the wee hours and making a call from a phone booth when he is approached by a speechless derelict gesturing for smokes. He tries to wave him off but eventually hands the old man cigarettes after the old man has urinated on him a slight twist to doing a good need and getting urinated on for doing it.The other is the engagement party scene where Caesar pontificates about the upcoming marriage of Gould to his cousin Carol Kane unaware that Gould has no such intentions. Caesar thinks the marriage will take place because of a loan he's giving Gould to buy a Manhattan restaurant. He's also gloating for keeping Gould in the fold i.e. marrying a Jewish girl.But Gould rebels stands up for his love for Hemingway and hands back the check. Caesar tries to bully him and slaps him in front of the astonished guests. Gould does the unthinkable. He literally strikes back reducing Caesar to a tearful rage that ends in a bear hug of anger fist pounding and paternal love. Extraordinary. It's all one scene no cuts no editing.Costars include Francine Beers as Ruth Lynnie Greene as Cynthia Jerry Lazarus as Caesar's weird son Zvee Scooler as Rebbe and Lou David as the loan shark.Not for all tastes but this is a surprising film and worth seeking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not being Jewish myself I would guess traditional Jews will find this plot a bit simplistic and secularist. For most of the audience it is an entertaining movie. It is hard to see Elliott Gould as overweight but in this file he plays an overweight neurotic and diabetic middle aged ma who falls for a pretty young woman from Philadelphia of Irish descent. His extended family lives in the secular World and does not. His mom runs a deli with a black man working there and his best friend is an Italian American. His uncle is a successful businessman who wants his nephew to marry a Jewish woman. However he finds that he loves his nonJewish woman and also wants to open his own restaurant in Manhattan. He is trying to be his own man and no matter how polite he is about it it inevitably leads to family conflict. His uncle is pressuring him to marry a Jewish woman that he does not love. In the end he makes his stand and wins. An entertaining movie but in real life the pressures may be too great and maybe tradition is not all bad if you look at the points that the movie Avalon made. It is romanticized in this country to be completely independent but for most people tradition s also security.".

	schema:reviewBody "I accidentally watched this on TV the other day while I was in the kitchen cooking and all I could think of the whole time was how in the hell did Elliot Gould ever become a popular actor? He has no charisma is not goodlooking is unfunny in the extreme and sorry his success seems to prove the old adage that those of the Judaic faith run Hollywood. There is just no other explanation for this rotten rotten rotten movie its insular context and endless slew of Jewish in jokes. I read the reviews above and gather that some other sons of Abraham enjoyed the film because it reminded them of their own families. Well good for you but doesn't change the fact that the movie stinks to high heaven. I actually went to a Jewish high school and so I got many of the jokes  they still weren't funny.First of all both he and Margaux Hemingway were extremely long in the tooth to be believable as a starcrossed couple kept apart by meddling relatives. He was 46 when he made this film and though Marguax was 16 years his junior typical Hollywood disgusting age discrepancy favouring the man she looks frumpy and tired in this role. She also shpeaks with a weird teethshucking shound that is very dishtracting and the horrendous script is rendered even more ludicrous by her line delivery. I am amazed by the person who stated above that she was a great actress. Not sure how to type that sound Scooby Doo makes when baffled but please imagine it here. Even so Hemingway is a million times more desirable and charming than Gould's Alby and so yawn this film falls squarely in the category of wishfulfillment fantasies written by directed by and starring shlumpy unattractive males who are inexplicably the objects of desire for rapacious insatiable nymphomaniac and much betterlooking females. There are a LOT of films in this category many of them by Woody Allen and I hate all of them.When was the last time you saw a movie about an overweight middle aged woman wearing horrible clothes who has to beat off the attentions of some hot young guy? Or how about the one about a shy inexperienced nerdy female teen who is won over by the school hunk who always saw her inner beauty? What's that...never? Correct! It's not weird when you read the credits and realize who is writingdirectingproducing these movies. Hint it's not middleaged women. Poor Carol Kane did her best with the insane material I guess but I was literally agog watching her slither around like a pussycat in the seduction scene. WTF??? It made no sense whatsoever and most importantly wasn't in the least bit funny. Gould just sat there like he was on 20 mg of Valium and gave her zero nada zilch to work with. To say she was chewing the scenery would be a massive understatement.I won't reveal what happens in the end because a it doesn't matter and b see a.I am flabbergasted that this film was ever made am not at all surprised that it was a box office dodo and fervently wish that all copies of it could be destroyed so no one ever has to see it again.

	schema:reviewBody "The original Forrest Gump came out in 1979 when Hal Ashby's Being There was first released. A quietly brilliant hilarious heartwrenching and heartwarming motion picture that showed how great Peter Sellers Oscarnominated was and how limitless his range was. He stars as a gardener at an old mansion in Washington D.C. who has never been outside of the owner's small piece of property. When the owner dies he has to leave the only home he has ever known. Sellers has no knowledge of anything except what he sees on television and he has a strange sort of childlike innocence that endears him to all he comes into contact with. After a minor accident Sellers is taken to the home of a ridiculously wealthy political lobbyist Melvyn Douglas in his second Oscarwinning performance who is literally being kept alive as he has a rare form of cancer. Douglas immediately takes a liking to Sellers and so does his muchyounger wife Shirley MacLaine. Sellers is now in the spotlight though as he gets to meet the president Jack Warden and slowly starts to gain popularity and political support from those around him. Of course Sellers does not realize any of this as his understanding of such things are beyond his somewhat limited mental capabilities. A simply brilliant film that is carried by Sellers' amazing personal best performance. Everyone else is adequate but this is Sellers' show. Douglas won the Oscar mainly due to sympathy votes but surprisingly Sellers would die before Douglas as he passed away less than six months after receiving his Oscar nod of a massive heart attack. As good as Dustin Hoffman was in Kramer vs. Kramer I still wish that Sellers would have won the Oscar for this role which is one of the finest performances ever throughout the entire history of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "To see me as a person on screen would be one of the dullest experiences you could ever wish to experience  quote from Peter Sellers.Peter Sellers had many quotes like this in which he spoke of his near selfhatred hated seeing himself and that when he was not doing comedy he was dull and unfunny. That makes his portrayal of Chauncey Gardner that much more amazing because he portrays a very simple man totally comfortable within himself.Being There is a great film. It deals with a simple premise  if you act in a certain way people will make unquestioned assumptions about you. Chauncy is slow witted and has the mind of small child and all that he knows in gardening. However he dresses in nice suits has impeccable manners and is not shy so he is accepted into social circles.

	onyx:emotionText "To see me as a person on screen would be one of the dullest experiences you could ever wish to experience  quote from Peter Sellers.Peter Sellers had many quotes like this in which he spoke of his near selfhatred hated seeing himself and that when he was not doing comedy he was dull and unfunny. That makes his portrayal of Chauncey Gardner that much more amazing because he portrays a very simple man totally comfortable within himself.Being There is a great film. It deals with a simple premise  if you act in a certain way people will make unquestioned assumptions about you. Chauncy is slow witted and has the mind of small child and all that he knows in gardening. However he dresses in nice suits has impeccable manners and is not shy so he is accepted into social circles. When he speaks of gardening his ramblings are mistaken for metaphors and he is instantly considered an economic genius.This is wrapped around a beautiful film in which Chauncey wanders from one circumstance into another never changing his demeanor never faltering.

Since then no other comedian has captured the raw talent of comedy that Sellers could create. The silent comedy and the physical comedy that Sellers made was not only timeless but funnier than most of the comedy we see in film today.

I sat through 'Being There' chuckling at Seller's wonderful 'Zenlike' performance enjoying its gently satirical look at the vacuous nature of political debate safe in the knowledge that I was in on the joke Chance is an idiot but the real idiots are almost everyone else in the film who see profundity when they're given pap. And then in a scene that completely flips the film on its head Chance walks on water! That scene is the cinematographic equivalent of staring at one of those stereograms when the hidden 3D image suddenly leaps out at you. It's a shocking moment beautifully handled and you're immediately forced to question everything you've seen in the film and your assumptions about it why does Chance have no concept of time? Is it because an eternal being wouldn't need one? When Eve makes a pass at Chance is he being tempted by and tested against original sin? Was the Washington Cop who we assume is calling in a report of a simpleton on the loose actually compelled to do exactly what Chance told him to do? Does Chance speak Russian? How? Is this because all the tongues of man are as one to him? Does Chance have the power to decide when the time is right for Ben to die? Did the 'old man' meet a similar fate and does Chance lay his hand on the old man's forehead to see if he is cold or to bless him?If we accept that Chance has indeed revealed his divinity to us then the whole film flips once more and takes on a far darker aspect. Is the decline in the Presidents powers linked to the rise of Chance? Is his TV broadcast the modern equivalent of the 'sermon on the mount'? And crucially is all his talk of gardening a chilling metaphor for the immanent fate of mankind?A shepherd might be content to tend his flock but Chance is a gardener and he might have a great deal of pruning and weeding to do before Eden  his garden  is restored to its former glory. A great film that fully deserves its high ranking. 910.".

Chance Gardner played charmingly by Peter Sellers  I think that is what the reviewer wrote stumbles his way into the upper crest where he is mistaken for someone with deep knowledge of the world. Other reviews point out this movie is cynical characterization of self absorbed people in politics and media. As a kid I didn't get that and now on further reflection what I liked about this movie was how these people where drawn to Chances innocence. In some ways Forrest Gump tried to attempt to tell this story line but only manages to rehash old stereotypes. Being There depicts in clever real characters who use a veil of politeness to cover up a cynicisim they have of their world and their own power. But for a kid and maybe why it has a cult following is because the heart of the show whats addicting about is no matter how self absorbed we become our best nature is drawn to a simple life absent of complications. After watching the movie again the dark comedy is more apparent but I am happy to say that in the Life and death of Peter Sellers Sellers himself interpreted the character as I thought of it when I was kid. Gardner is a man who is sublimely content with no past and no future and therefore no worries. As a kid I kind of new that as innocence. So if you rent this movie don't just see it as a black comedy but also see it how a kid might and for that matter how Peter Sellers saw it.".

I am constantly debating with myself whether Dr. Strangelove or Being There was Sellers' best work. Being There is very enjoyable and I never seem to get tired of it.

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Sellers last and arguably his greatest performance. He died aged 54 in 1980 the year the film was released. This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I taped it some time ago from television and recently saw it for the third time and it keeps fascinating me. The film has a beautiful dreamlike atmosphere  dark moody absolutely mesmerizing! Many of the proceedings might be a little improbable but it shouldn't be viewed to rationally.The plot is quite simple with Sellers playing the main character Chance or Chauncey Gardener who becomes homeless when the master of the house he lived in and for whom he maintained the garden dies. He is a grown man with the mind of a small child who lead a cocoonlike existence during his whole life isolated from the outside world. His sole interests are gardening and television which he frequently expresses with I like to watch. After a small accident with a limo he winds up staying at the mansion of a rich tycoon Melvyn Douglas and his wife Shirley Maclaine who are close to the president. He befriends the couple and slowly becomes acquainted with the higher circles in Washington. Because of his slowly mannered way of speaking his politeness neatness and impeccable dressing he is somehow mistaken for some lost professor. In a hilarious meeting when he first meets the president he's asked for his opinion on the weak state of the nation's economy. Off course he doesn't know anything about the subject so he starts reflecting his visions upon gardening Spring and summer fall and winter it's all a cycle and everything starts to grow again which are conceived as brilliant metaphors for explaining economic cycles. Chauncey Gardener is so disarming with his simplified views of life he is celebrated as some kind of genius. His response to he question What newspapers do you read? is I only watch TV which instantly turns him into a hero for admitting he gets his information solely from television and in the eyes of the general public makes him the most honest man linked to The White House in a long time.The reputation of this film has risen steadily over the last years and rightfully so. Jerzy Kosinski's novel is transferred to the screen into a dark literally downlit and sombre comedy by director Hal Ashby who managed to make an expertly paced film consistent in tone and mood. The film boasts great performances by veteran Melvyn Douglas and Shirley Maclaine who even does a masturbation scene! But it's Peter Sellers who enters the pantheon of the alltime legendary performances with a simply magnificent portrayal of Chance Gardener. For long this was his pet project and for over nine years he tried to get it filmed. When it was finally greenlighted he painstakingly researched and prepared for the role. The voice in particular demanded his attention as he listened to his own voice on a tape recorder and endlessly compared one sound to another. Forget about comparing his role to Tom Hanks with Forrest Gump the other mindless observer of American society. It doesn't even come close. Tom Hanks got the Oscar but Peter Sellers gives his character an unmatched complexity in a far superior film that if anyone should get the Oscar he should he was nominated though. Even after repeated viewings it not only holds up it reveals something new and adds a new layer. A rare achievement. In a few weeks time I'm in NorthCarolina and hopefully will manage to make a visit to Asheville and get a chance to visit the Biltmore Estate the estate of the Vanderbilts where most of the film was shot. A beautiful movie something to behold.Camera Obscura  1010".

Like Ruth Gordon in Harold and Maude Peter Sellers as Chance the Gardner tells us a few truths that stand at the center as well as quite outside the box of our daily lives. Obvious and unique. Contradictions coexisting in perfect harmony. Peter Sellers is superb without ever betraying the grayness of his existence. It took me a while I must confess to settle in. I had seen the Goeffry Rush film about Sellers's life and it implied an effort to take those thoughts and images out of my mind and allow Chancey without Sellers to take me away. He did he took me away completely. What a remarkable piece of acting. A special mention should go to Melvyn Douglas as well. Moving and powerful at the end of a legendary career. Highly recommended.".

What gave me the biggest pleasure was Ashby's subtle portrayal of his own politics. Sellers' character's rise and rise is set against in the beginning at least images of the socially deprived. In most of Ashby's films there is a strong sense of the antiestablishment but what is brilliant in this movie is that Ashby gets inside the establishment to ridicule it and yet at the same time bring across a strong sense of humanity in the richer character's isolation and loneliness.Politics or not Ashby's perfect pacing bring the best out of Sellers whose film career Strangelove aside was hit and miss. This movie is definitely a hit from the most underrated film director Hollywood has ever had the arrogance to forget to miss.".

There are films where nearly every frame is beautiful and Being There is one of those films.As a piece of writing the screenplay for Being There Kosinski's only film work is surprisingly effective and does not suffer from any major flaws. The film like the novel it is based on moves at a natural yet surprisingly swift pace and the film never plods. It is a joy to see the thematic content of Being There unfold so I won't go into any detail on that but it is handled beautifully and the film has extraordinary depth.This film is a beautiful intelligent goodnatured look at human nature. It's a unique and special film that stands out as one of the best films ever made for its inventive editing outstanding shot composition fine photography and especially its brilliant lead performance.1010".

However Being There is my favorite movie ever.There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said before about this movie. But here we go...Peter Sellers' performance as Chance the gardener is truly a master at work. We see Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman do their performances as simpletons and mentally handicapped persons and they just seem like cartoon characters. Sellers' Chance is a perfect performance balancing Chance's wonder confusion and ignorance without ever making a cheap or obvious joke. His timing his facial expressions and his moments of silence maintains a wonderful and memorable character that never loses his substance. Sellers keeps his game face of near blankness without ever collapsing into cinematic clichs in this area.I have read a few reviews of this film and I am always amazed that no one ever mentions the tears in Chance's eyes when Ben passes. Am I dreaming when I see them? Tears in his eyes is a hint that Chance is growing that since the passing of the old man where Chance was literally numb to grief he suddenly is struck with emotion. God I love that.Peter Sellers and Shirley McClainsp? together on screen remains one of the most beautiful onscreen couples I think. The class the sensuality and the simple beauty between them makes them so very charming. Even with Sellers' failing health they both look very beautiful together.And the ending. Again many different ideas on what it means if anything. Personally...I think it shows that Chance is not subject to many things in this life just because of his isolation from so much of it and his simple ignorance to these very basic realities. Maybe it just shows that he is a kind heart and nothing can defeat him? I dunno.I have tried to write something a little different here on my first review. Maybe I'll get better at it eventually.".

Having now also seen 'Being There' Sellers' secondtolast film I am convinced that I'll be seeing a lot more of his work in the near future. Though it is not in fact Sellers' final film 'Being There' is often described as the comedy star's swan song since the last film before his 1980 death 'The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu' was generally poorlyreceived'Being There' traces the story of Chance Sellers a simpleminded gardener for a wealthy old man. For as far back as he can remember Chance has made his home at the old man's house spending his time tending to the roses and the other flowers. The maid Louise looks after all his needs. He has never left the house and he has never travelled in an automobile. Everything he knows about the outside world has come from television and whenever he is not gardening he simply likes to watch. However when the old man dies Louise leaves the house and Chance is left to fend for himself.Chance's absentminded wanderings about a city he doesn't understand ultimately lead him to the home of wealthy but terminallyill private citizen Benjamin Turnbull Rand Melvyn Douglas and his younger wife Eve Shirley MacLaine. Chance's spluttered selfintroduction of Chance the gardener gives him the prestigious title of Chauncey Gardiner and his quietspoken nature is mistaken for wisdom. During a visit by the President of the United States Jack Warden his simple gardening anecdotes are interpreted as discerning metaphors of the current state of the nation's economy. In the garden growth has it seasons Chance explains. First comes spring and summer but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and summer again. When the President quotes Chance's wise words in an address to the nation he becomes something of a celebrity even appearing on television himself where he expresses the need for a capable gardener to tend to the country's needs. Despite his highprofile the FBI and the CIA are completely baffled as to how they could have absolutely no background information on Mr. Gardiner and they bicker about how only a cleverlytrained secret agent could keep such a ghostly past. Only one man Benjamin Rand's doctor Richard A. Dysart begins to suspect the truth behind Chance's simplespoken demeanour though he keeps his suspicions quiet when he realises what a profound positive effect Chance has on those around him. The dying Benjamin Rand is given the strength to pass peacefully into death and his wife Eve is given somebody who would stay with her in her most painful hours.The very final shot of the film has evoked countless heated discussions since the film's original release. What could possibly be the meaning of Chance walking on the surface of the lake? It is quite obviously a Biblical reference to Christ but what does it mean? Is Chance the saviour that so many of the film's troubled characters have been searching for? Does the man's simple innocence uncorrupted and unbiased offer him a certain grace? Is Chance able to walk on water simply because nobody has told him that he cannot? Or perhaps there is a more prosaic explanation. It is not inconceivable that there are stepping stones hidden just beneath the surface of the water and as it had served him well countless times before could sheer chance simply have prevented his falling into the lake? 'Being There' is a thoughtprovoking film and also a clever satire of American politics and the media. Sellers is brilliant as Chance the gardener though his character remains pretty much the same throughout with very little personal development at all Sellers' performance never loses steam. A strong supporting cast helps make an somewhat improbable premise almost believable and I was particularly impressed with Melvyn Douglas as Benjamin Rand and indeed he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. This is an enchanting film and very much worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "The slow and illiterate gardener Chance Peter Sellers has spent all his life inside the house of Mr. Jennings in a poor area of Washington D.C. His only contact with the outside world was through television. When Mr. Jennings dies the house is shutdown by the family lawyer and Chance is forced to leave the place. While wandering on the streets a limousine hits his leg and the owner Eve Rand Shirley MacLaine invites him to go to her house to be treated by her husband's doctor and avoid any trouble in the hospital. She misunderstands his name and calls him Chauncey Gardner. When the simple Chance is introduced to her husband Benjamin Rand Melvyn Douglas that is terminally ill with anemia he becomes his friend and Ben interprets his wordings as metaphoric transforming Chance in adviser of President Bobby Jack Warden and prominent figure in the world of economy and politics.I must confess that this is the first time that I watch Being There and my first thought was that Forrest Gump is visibly inspired in this movie. Peter Sellers is once again fantastic in the role of a man that does not know that he does not know and therefore is capable to achieve everything. The fortyfive years old Shirley MacLaine is still an extremely beautiful and seductive woman in this film. Melvyn Douglas has a topnotch performance in this movie unfortunately one of his last movies. Jack Warden is hilarious in the role of an annoying president. The situations are surrealistic but seem to be realistic and indeed it is a great joke with politicians and their cynical world. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Muito Alm do Jardim Far Beyond the Garden".

However all of the elements that made the first three enjoyable to watch simply weren't there. In fact the only thing that Eat Out 4 EO4 had in common with the first three EO's other than some of the cast members was bad acting.In the first three episodes of EO I could look past the terrible acting because I liked the story lines of Nice Boy Next Door gets the Alist Hunk because what's important was what was inside or because true love won out. In some cases it was that the Boy Next Door got to play with the hot straight guy in others it was the Alist guy dumps another Alister with a shallow personality for a Boy Next Door who had charm and a wonderful personality. You always had somebody you were routing for to get the great guy.However in this last installment the couple you thought would grow old togetherZack and Casey broke up. Why??? Because the Boy next Door Casey didn't feel he was good enough for the Alister Boyfriend Zack and because Zack found somebody he thought was cuter. Their relationship didn't seem to be in trouble. It might have gotten into a bit of a rut but every relationship slides into a routine. That is not cause to break up at the first site of a hot hunk.This film fed into the stereotype that gay men are only into the physical aspects of men and that they could never have a lasting relationship because something new and hotter would eventually come along.Yes yes this is a comedy but the only thing that made the first three entertaining except the cute guys was the story line.I left the movie feeling that I no longer liked the Casey character because he had so little self respect and self esteem that he gave away his boyfriend because he didn't think he was good enough. I also ended up hating the Zack character because when Casey said he wanted to break up with him because Zack liked the new guy he never once protested. He immediately went on to make out with the new guy. So why would I ever watch another sequel that involved these two characters? After bashing the film for all of the bad things there was one little part of the storyline that I did like. Transsexual and the straight guy infatuation and buddy romance felt real and the Trans girl was a real beauty. Unfortunately she was not enough to carry the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hated the original Eating Out. Unfunny and stupid full of annoying characters. However I loved part 2 and 3. These were funny had plenty of male nudity and man on man kissing. What happened here? This follows gay lovers Zach Chris Salvatore and Casey Daniel Skeleton going to drama camp. There gay Benji Aaron Milo falls for Zach but pretends he's str8 so as not to hurt Zach and Casey's relationship...which is already falling apart. Then hunky Beau Ronnie Kroell falls for Casey...and loves sleeping in the nude. Str8 guy Luke Garikayi Mutambirwa falls for Lily Harmony Santana...but she's in the process of turning from a man into a woman and Luke is scared to ask her out.OKthis was just dreadful. Boring and stupid full of unfunny humor and boring drama. The movie just drags on and on and on. Most of the acting isn't bad but Drew Droege was VERY annoying as Dick Dickey. On the up side the cast was young and appealing there's plenty of hunky shirtless guys plenty of hot guy on guy kissing a pretty damn explicit sex scene between two hot guys where actor Milo bares his attractive body and some full frontalscourtesy of Kroell and exporn star Steven Daigle who looks GREAT for his age. There's also a musical number which is full of energy and quite amusing. But the boring script and unfunny comedy makes this a chore to watch.

	onyx:emotionText "I hated the original Eating Out. Unfunny and stupid full of annoying characters. However I loved part 2 and 3. These were funny had plenty of male nudity and man on man kissing. What happened here? This follows gay lovers Zach Chris Salvatore and Casey Daniel Skeleton going to drama camp. There gay Benji Aaron Milo falls for Zach but pretends he's str8 so as not to hurt Zach and Casey's relationship...which is already falling apart. Then hunky Beau Ronnie Kroell falls for Casey...and loves sleeping in the nude. Str8 guy Luke Garikayi Mutambirwa falls for Lily Harmony Santana...but she's in the process of turning from a man into a woman and Luke is scared to ask her out.OKthis was just dreadful. Boring and stupid full of unfunny humor and boring drama. The movie just drags on and on and on. Most of the acting isn't bad but Drew Droege was VERY annoying as Dick Dickey. On the up side the cast was young and appealing there's plenty of hunky shirtless guys plenty of hot guy on guy kissing a pretty damn explicit sex scene between two hot guys where actor Milo bares his attractive body and some full frontalscourtesy of Kroell and exporn star Steven Daigle who looks GREAT for his age. There's also a musical number which is full of energy and quite amusing. But the boring script and unfunny comedy makes this a chore to watch. If it weren't for the hot guys sex and full frontals this would be unwatchable. I can only give it a 2.";

But they're just getting progressively worse and worse. The formula is getting entirely repetitive and in this fourth installment the repetition is literal with the constant redoing and redoing of a scene from The Taming of the Shrew. It's like the film is on its own internal loop. A character has a breakthrough in one scene and in the next they're right back where they started as if the first scene never happened. I struggle through one scene and I literally have to stop the film to gather myself up enough to get through the next one. The mancandy is great but I can see screen caps on the Internet. I know the next film is already in the can but if there's going to be a part 6 then Brocka needs to take a break regroup and rethink his approach.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think this film is a pretty good follow up to the last 3 Eating out series. This film is a typical gay cheesy guilty pleasure film but trust me these kind of films are also needed in addition to some serious thoughtful cinema. Sometimes asa viewer I don't want to think too much and just want to be entrained. And this film very successfully did that. And not just entertainment this film has a pretty good helping of eye candy as well which by now you have started to expect from the eating out films.In this series the gang heads out for a special thetarical camp headed by experienced Dick Dickey a weird dude who hasn't had sex for 7 years now. He has one rule hat there will be no sex on the camp for the duration of the camp which in turn only builds up the sexual tenion. Casey and Zack are going through a rough patch in their relationship. The situation worsens when Zack has instant attraction for another camper Benji. Benji initially comes out too strong towards Zack but he pretends to be straight the moment he figures out that Zack has a boyfriend. The duo are signed up for a Shakespeare modern twist on a story where they are supposed to pplay gay lovers. The film focuses on how both casey and Zack have to come to terms with the fact that there relationship is almost over and is time for them to move on. We also have Jason  the straight director who is starting to fall for Lilly the transgendered girl. Of course the film ends with everything fit and fine in place new friendships relationships made and a hot sexy camp finished.As said above the film is an over the top raunchy comedy which tickles your humour cells in the right places. There are so many places where I just burst out laughing. It will be very difficult to put them all here but trust me they were funny. Most actors in the film are supposed to look smoking hot which they do. As far as acting is concerned they fit well in the realm of this movie but the real test would come if they did something more outside this to explore their acting abilities. The surprise part of the film was Lilly's character. I am glad that the filmmakers decided to keep this angle as well because not many people have dealt with this subject.This film is a total guilty pleasure whose aim is just for fun with its many witty one liners.".

I'm not quite sure what happened with the fourth installment though. Eating Out All you can eat left me starving for more. I was so sexcited for the 4th installment and unfortunately it was a huge flat plain pancake for me. No syrup to sweeten the taste. Chris Salvatore and Daniel Skelton just don't have the presence of the original male cast that were used in parts 1 and 2. They are like splenda to sugar sure some say it's just as sweet with no calories but really it just leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth and sometimes it's best to just have sugar cause it's sweet and adds flavor to the dish. Sure Chris Salvatore is cute but there are a lot of gay men that are cute that can act and singsorry Chris but you're not great at either. Daniel Skelton is nowhere near as adorable as Jim Verraros and Jim was actually funny and had presence. Now lets talk about the absence of Rebeka Kochan. Q Allen what were you thinking? She has made the series a gay monumental landmark. Without her this series would simply not be as entertaining. She is hysterically funny wonderfully attractive and provides the type of camp that can actually cause you to laugh out loud. Without her part 3 would have went off our plates straight to the garbage pail. I always look forward to watching Tiffany and her crazy antics. Even her lines in this movie were not done as well. I think Chris is adorable but it's time for a new cast with the exception of Rebekah of course. It's also time for funnier scripts. I think the formula of 1 and 2 worked and should be kept and perhaps making the scenes hotter would help. Its important too that the cast be a small intimate group of talented hotties. When you add too many people like in drama camp it simply does not work and this movie is proof of that. I say cut the cast down to Rebekah and rebuild from there! I want to see Eating Out 5 Decadent Desserts with a hot cast and an amazingly funny script. Please Q Allen Brocka sorry if I misspelled i know you can do it! Scrapt whatever script you are currently in and lets start fresh!! Eating Out 6 Tossed Salads May be in the future but for now all that remains to be seen. I just want to say if drama camp was any proof of what's to come I think I'll be skipping supper all together.".

I am biggest tiffiny fan and almost everyone will agree that 3 part of series is the best because of tiffiny and that factor is missing in this part and in last one also  open weekend. So yes director of this movie is an idiot or must hav left his brain somewhere else wen he was directing this movie. Yes this movie is homoerotic movie. And lastly may be you will find make over of crew highly disappointing. But I wouldn't completely agree to this one. In fact I believe deniel casey has improved a lot. Now some positive part. The theme of this movie is amazing! !!! Its very romantic with Shakespeare touch to it... OK many guys find the ending of movie ridiculous or dissatisfying  alert spoiler ahead. Just because at the end zack not going with casey doesn't make the movie bad. In fact it is the heart of the movie.. love isn't all about holding tight.. its also about letting go and sacrifice. I love the part when casey let go of zack even when zack assure him that he wouldn't cheat because he knew holding zack back wouldn't be correct thing to do.. This movie is one of its kind.. many believes that casey in this movie is a low self esteem guy but thts not true.. many heterosexuals can also corelate with that feeling of insecurity when your partner is way hot than you. People gets disappointed when they see one side of the movie that love is weak in front of looks but they don't see the other side that love is way to strong when it come to sacrifice. Apart from love between homosexual and all homoerotic things this movie has a very unique storyline of love between a straight guy and a transsexual and feelings of a transsexual.. missing this movie could be your big mistake... and for those who still think the ending is dissatisfying please watch the last part  open weekend you will be satisfied.".

She really does act like real . Watch her film the Gun Hill Road. You will really like this Watch  Dirty Love  by Chris . It really touches you If you really want to compare it to 1st and 2nd I say this one has a story while the other ones are kinda about sex attraction and a little cute actors faces. I must say nothing compares to the part of JIM Verraros. He is talented Give this one also a small chance Casey Daniel Skelton and Zack Chris Salvatore both attend a film camp called Dick Dickey's Drama Camp. Their relationship is placed in jeopardy when Zack is teamed with Benji Aaron Milo to produce The Taming of the Shrew. Real hot and cool oneYou may be addicted to the sequel If that is the case then just see this".

Why is this hotel completely vacant and the beach mysteriously deserted? After the initial disappointment the secretive director of the hotel Carlo Savonarola shows them to their rooms but soon the wailing sound of the wind blowing and the echoes from the empty corridors that bring chills down the spine will demand answers. Is this situation linked somehow to the grim history of this hotel moreover what lies hidden behind the thick stone walls of the nearby abandoned convent which dates back to 1749?";

Mansion of the Living Dead is one of the worst movies Jess Franco ever directed. The plot had potential but it's not handle well. The pace is very slow and even the sex scenes drag a bit. Also the make up of the monks is awful!But the movie also have some good things like the beautiful paradiselike beach which gives the film a certain atmosphere very creepy in some scenes. Also good is lead actress Lina Romay looking very hot especially in the scenes where she walks completely naked through the hotel. From the boring sex scenes I can't believe I just say that! to the embarrassing attempt to create a story make this movie one of Franco's worst. Not recommended at all. Check out Macumba Sexual 1983 or Gemidos de Placer 1983 instead.".

And there was a man Antonio Mayans I believe talking often to some girls and there were scenes of various sexual intercourse although I found the atmosphere in the film very serious and unpretentious.There is one very interesting scene where a couple of girls are lying on the beach and suddenly a meat cleaver flies through the air thrown from a hotel window high above and lands in the sand just beside them. I was intrigued by that scene quite intimidating.Only Franco Oasis of the zombies and D'Amato Porno Holocaust Erotic nights of the living dead could make movies with this kind of enchanting atmosphere.

Before anyone thinks I'm just Franco bashing I'm not I've now seen over 60 of his movies so think I've seen enough to have a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about I even like some!For anyone not very knowledgeable about his work the Franco process of filmmaking seems to go something like this1 He sees someone else's film.2 He quickly rehashes it adds in some godawful ugly sex scenes all of which takes a couple of days and hey presto a week later the film's released!And that's about it. I've yet to see an erotic moment in any of his films though the moments in this one are probably the least annoying of his I've seen and most of the naked women he's used aren't all that attractive either although again to be fair the women in this movie are about the best I've seen in a Franco film so no real reprieve there.Personally I prefer it when he leaves out the sex altogether but even then as is the case with 'Mansion of the Living Dead' he's so ham fisted in his approach that he generally ruins any element of horror there might've been.Having said all that this is still one of my top 10 Franco films which to be fair says a whole lot more about his other films than it does this one as it's at best only decidedly average!As a side note on the region 1 DVD release of this Mr Franco has some very derogatory comments to be made about a certain George A. Romero which I have to say are completely out of order not to mention contradictory his comments about them being slow! especially when you consider the movie Franco was rehashing here was 'Tombs of the Blind Dead'  itself a great movie which would never have existed had Romero not redefined the zombie moved it into modern times and made it into what it still is today! And that's without even getting into comparing the talent of the two men which is never going to be in Franco's favour! It basically just sounds like sour grapes as Romero had something which still eludes Franco today  an idea!Shame on you Jesus!".

Romero which I have to say are completely out of order not to mention contradictory his comments about them being slow! especially when you consider the movie Franco was rehashing here was 'Tombs of the Blind Dead'  itself a great movie which would never have existed had Romero not redefined the zombie moved it into modern times and made it into what it still is today! And that's without even getting into comparing the talent of the two men which is never going to be in Franco's favour! It basically just sounds like sour grapes as Romero had something which still eludes Franco today  an idea!Shame on you Jesus!";

Like most Franco films this one has a good deal of atmosphere and some genuinely strange moments and lots of nudity but not much gore. I also found the story to be well done and an interesting take on the older Blind Dead series. Franco also has some interesting things to say in the commentary on the Severin Films version relating the dead monks in the film to his view of the Spanish Catholic church  an insightful view in fact reflecting popular attitudes in Spanish Catholicism that define monks and priests as theoretically saintly figures that are also motivated by the needs and failings that drive ordinary men. I also agreed with Franco's commentaries on George Romero and his zombies unlike a previous reviewer. I admire Night of the Living Dead for its innovative approaches but I have always found the zombies to be very boring because in moral and intellectual terms they are complete ciphers. I've seen NotLD in at least four different decades  and I will see it again I'm sure  but I'm not a fan of the zombies. The living dead in Franco's film although they could be more welldeveloped are much more interesting. Kind of like the zombie hero in Jean Rollin's Zombie Lake who has some kind of moral sense despite his deadness.".

Carlos believes that if Candy is in fact Irina her kiss to him can set their souls free no longer to serve their dark lord.Well that's what I got out this Franco flick. When he sets up the first scene as we see these undead monks chanting a rather harmonic tune the wind ever present you kind of get an idea that something within the atmosphere of this place in unstable. He is able to display this by showing the wind as it generates a type of rage also arranging the furious sound of wind on the soundtrack. It only happens when the girls make the unfortunate mistake of nearing and entering the abbey. This is a place of unrest and I felt not of our realm. I was a bit miffed with the subplot regarding Olivia but I think she's kept by Carlos as a reminder of what causes such discomfort the desires of the flesh and a longing for lustful embrace. Maybe that's why he mistreats her. She's an outward expression of what torments him from the inside.I love the location and the desolation. Something about the absence of people creates a sense of foreboding. Where is everybody? Such a beautiful place remains so unoccupied. What gives? That worked well for me as did the way Jess creates the atmosphere around the abbey. Many might find some of the Inquisition monks very similar to the Blind Dead Templars.There's lots of naked flesh drooping breasts which hardly ever remain covered and lesbian activityLina is a wild cat in this one even proclaiming how she likes treehugging at one time spitting out a hair caught in her teeth.If you do not like Jess' camera work or the way his female characters walk around naked desiring sex stay far away.".

It's all in Spanish and the closest thing to Spanish I can speak is a little Latin.  No problem I'll fast forward to the Templars.Yeah right what Templars?  The movie starts out with some eeeeeevil cultists meandering around a ruined church carrying torches.  For all the world they look like Ku Klux Klansmen.  Then onto something completely different as four female friends check into a rather large resort that seems to have no guests and only one guy staffing it.I'd be alarmed wouldn't you?  They apparently aren't as they start having all sorts of graphic for a movie of this calibre lesbian sex.  Quite a bit of nudity.  Easy on the eyes as well.  Anyhow some other mysterious guy shows up has sex with two of the four women then has a couple discussions with them.  Is the the one that threw a meat cleaver at them when they were doing some nude sunbathing?  What's with that creepy little guy spying on them?  All negated as one of the women who was hiking around some church ruins is killed by a death cult of some sort that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the promised Templars.  More chicanery occurs before the main character is raped and...something.  She shows up offs the other two females.  The Klan is defeated ? by a giant cross then walks off as the movie ends.  I think my copy is missing a minute or two because the ending as such is terrible there are no credits yadda yadda.The movie itself is dull.  There're none of the promised Templar knights just some Klansmen with really dry skin.  There's no gore no violence and the filmmaking is inept.  Several scenes last entirely too long several closeups are impossible to make out the absence of any type of music in many parts is annoying and the death cult appears from nowhere.Since the nudity and lesbianism is the only reason a male would want to watch this film it'd be more recommended to pick up some sort of porn. Recommendation to avoid this film even from a completist point of view.".

Enjoying the opportunity for a slew of topless antics they become unnerved when despite them appearing to be the only ones there a series of accidents almost ends up murdering them. Deciding to stay they are unable to find anyone there except for cryptic owner Carlos Savonarola Antonio Mayans who no one of them trusts. When they realize that they're being slowly disappearing one at a time around the hotel grounds they get suspicious that something is happening to them and when they realize that there's a coven of Satanic worshippers planning on sacrificing the group for it's ceremonies they try to hold off the deadly rituals.The Good News This here was a pretty enjoyable entry that did have some good things going for it. One of the better elements is that location provides a lot of great atmosphere to be had. The desolation of the area is fully captured well and makes for some great moments. The early walks through the grounds trying to find the main entrance which is cleverly hidden away from the facility's entrance beyond a walkway that's quite expertly placed to make the most of the atmospheric possibilities it has. The rest of the hotel grounds with the layout of the walkways to the flower pads and the interior of the buildings are all very welldone making for a unique look that works well and gets some good moments off in the beginning of the film. There's also some good stuff to be had from the cult's rituals and looks as well which is quite nicely supplied here by the excellent makeup. Their decaying faces giant robes and skeletal features make them quite imposing and then there comes the rituals that they partake in. The sacrificial room where they show the different sacrifices is a perfect setting for the deadly actions to follow and it makes the sequence standout a little more than it normally would which is a great sign and is also responsible for one of the only true gore scenes to be involved in the film giving it extra points. Even more so is the later scene where the ceremony involves the large group involving the others invoking the outsider to come into their ranks being a rather impressive scene. The last plus here is the film's sleaze and nudity which is the overall best part of the film as a whole. There's a ton of this in the film which is a welcome sight as this provides a ton of different memorable moments. From the different lesbian encounters that feature them going all the way and showing everything possible to the topless actions and the encounters with the chained woman in the SM gear it gets a lot of great nudity into the film that definitely works well in here. By featuring everything possible in the scenes it makes the film quite enjoyable and makes the film that much better. With a couple of nice scares thrown into the mix and a fun ending these here are the film's good points.The Bad News There wasn't much really wrong with this one. Much of the film's problems are a part of it's funereal pacing. This one here is one of the slowest moving horror films around practically moving along at a snail's pace for the duration of everything and tending to take it so long to get anything out that it becomes dull after a while. From the endless scenes of them frolicking in their rooms or on the beach or the antics of the others around the hotel interacting with them leaving the film to feel quite overlong and actionless at times with much in the way of action in the beginning portions of the film taken up with nudity and their involvements to get into those situations and it can lead to monotonous moments at times. The fact that the cult doesn't even make any mention or appearance until after an hour which is barely worthwhile and makes it quite hard to really get into. The other flaw to this one is the confusing plot which makes little sense. There's not much given as to how the different elements come together what the purpose of everything means and all together nothing here makes even the slightest bit of sense and comes off as quite confusing. A little bit for any of these elements would've made a big difference. These here are the film's big flaws.The Final Verdict While it's not the fastest moving film around there's enough going on so it's not a complete failure overall. Really look into this one if you're into the previous entries in the Blind Dead saga or a fan of Franco's more modern stuff while those who prefer films laced with energy should heed caution.Rated URR Full Nudity several Sex Scenes Adult Language and Violence".

These here are the film's big flaws.The Final Verdict While it's not the fastest moving film around there's enough going on so it's not a complete failure overall. Really look into this one if you're into the previous entries in the Blind Dead saga or a fan of Franco's more modern stuff while those who prefer films laced with energy should heed caution.Rated URR Full Nudity several Sex Scenes Adult Language and Violence";

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a curio. Spanish Director Jess Franco has created a film inspired by The Blind Dead a collection of skeletal cadavers from Amando de Ossorio's carefully crafted horror quartet. Reputation has suggested this might even be a fifth entry in that series but I'm not sure Franco has ever made that claim. The scene that opens this film features a group of cowled monks making their way into their monastery bathed in scorching sunlight to the incongruous sound of dubbed hollow wind. This reedy sound effect accompanies any scene that promises danger.Next a giggling gaggle of chirping 30something good time girls are tottering on high heels up the stone steps to the hotel they are to make their holiday home for the next few days. Amongst them is Candy Coaster AKA Franco favourite Lina Romay in a silvery blond wig. They can't wait to 'pick up some guys and have a good time' and yet as soon as the doors are closed to their widely scattered chalets graphic lesbian activity ensues.As they sunbathe nude on the shingle a meat cleaver is thrown from a balcony at the hotel narrowly missing them. But this doesn't deter their frivolity Who wouldn't want to murder four hotties like us?. The hotel proprietor shady Carlos Antonio Mayans who is responsible keeps his eyebrowshorn wife chained on a bed and appears to be in the thrall of a greater power. Perhaps this power he is 'from another world' saps any sense Candy possesses one minute his chained wife is explaining that he probably wants Candy to take her place  the next Candy is in his arms falling for his promises.One of the girls wanders into the ruined monastery next door to the hotel and things take on a creepier tone. Despite the mournful tolling of a bell the bell she sees is stationary as she enters modulated chanting fills the soundtrack and that is the last we see of her. The next to be plucked from the group actually comes face to pastyface with the Monks. Her ensuing gangrape is protracted and horrifying. Somehow even more horrifying is the next scene where we catch up with the comedy hijinks of bungling oddjob man Marleno 'hilariously' serenading Candy in the hotel garden  in view of the ordeal we witnessed previously such frivolity seems tasteless. Pretty soon it's back to the notsosoftcore lesbianism between Candy and Caty Elisa Vela the only two girls left. Nothing like a bit of nookie to take your mind off disappeared friends in an empty hotel where the proprietor wants to kill you.Some of the Monks are grinning and skeletal another appears to have his human face coated in porridge SPOILER  revealed to be Carlos and another is entirely humanlooking. Cursed by a former victim Irina they have since been denied eternal rest until they find love. Carlos believes he has found this in Candy and as they kiss he crumples to the floor an empty cloak. Candy doesn't like it and runs off.I enjoyed this. The four women holidaymakers are a discreditable gang their slow realisation that they are the only guests in the huge hotel hilariously slowwitted. And yet there is a consistent storyline here not always the case with Franco. And more importantly 'Mansion of the Living Dead' works as a horror film for the sense of unease grows palpable. It probably won't please those expecting an addition to the delicately builtup Blind Dead story to which this is best thought of as a homage not a continuation but to those familiar with Franco's style this is pretty good.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Mansin De Los Muertos Vivientes aka. Mansion of the Living Dead of 1985 is supposed to be cult director Jess Franco's take on Amando De Ossorio's GREAT 'Blind Dead' franchise IMDb even lists it as a Remake of the original La Noche Del Terror Ciego aka. Tomb of the Blind Dead of 1970. However this has about nada to do with De Ossorio's wonderful cycle which ranges among the most popular and influential Eurohorror Cult productions from the 70s. I am great fan of Jess Franco especially of his earlier works and had Mansion of the Living Dead been directed by someone else it might not have its certain undeniable charm  then again it is not really imaginable for anyone else to come up with an outrageously nonsensical production such as this one.Four young women from Germany one of them played by Franco's reallife wife Lina Romay come to a Spanish beach club for vacation. In typical Francomanner they are all nymphomaniacs with strong exhibitionist and lesbian tendencies. After one hour of walking around naked and making out with each other one of them disappears when going out to take photos... People who are not in favor of Jess Franco's cinema will probably think of this as the worst film ever made however the film's incredible weirdness and lack of any logic whatsoever are also the elements that make it fun in addition to its primary quality the constant sleaze and female nudity.Basically this film is about 90 per cent sleaze and soft porn and 10 per cent weird and really REALLY nonsensical Horror. Amando De Ossorio's original Blind Templars were among the creepiest creatures ever in Horror cinema the villains in this sleazefest are a bunch of ridiculously looking monks some of which have extremely ridiculous skullfaces. The original blind dead also drank their victims' blood in order to gain eternal life whereas these guys are fans of gangrape instead. In typical Francofashion all women are naked for about 95 per cent of the screen time one is for all her screen time actually which is especially welcome from the darkskinned Elisa Vela who goes by the name Jasmina Bell here and Lina Romay who has gotten a little chubbier. In typical Francofashion they are all bisexual nymphomaniacs who thrive for every man and have nonstop sex with each other when there's no man available. Also in typical Francofashion the film includes some seriously demented perversions. A guy keeps his wife on a leash in a room and always brings her food which he positions out of her reach in order to torture her for example  and she actually gets sexually aroused by this treatment! Which director except for the weird mind of Jess Franco would come up with demented stuff like that? As in all Franco films the cinematography is pretty well done.Overall the film is very amusing in the beginning mainly due to the lack of any logic and the fact that Jess Franco obviously doesn't give a crap about it. However it gets pretty tiresome towards the end and the conclusion is about the most senseless thing I've ever seen. This film may be enjoyed by my fellow Franco fans and it is recommendable to anyone who wants to see 96 minutes of boobs and weirdness disguised as Horror. If you want to watch a GOOD film by Jess Franco stick to older productions such as The Awful Dr. Orloff The Diabolical Dr. Z or Venus in Furs. This film may well be described as utter crap however I cannot deny I somehow enjoyed it. No doubt Amando De Ossorio's Blind Templars would be ashamed for their sleazy descendants.".

If you ever wondered what sort of movies Ed Wood would be making would he still be alive today all you have to do is pick up any random Jesus Franco movie.By credit this movie is a remake of the 1971 Spanish horrorclassic La noche del terror ciego but quite frankly this movie has very little or nothing to do with that movie. Seriously don't watch this movie expecting an horror for this movie is more all about its nudity and lesbian fondling than about any horror. As a matter of fact there aren't even scares or graphic killings in this movie. Just a couple of hooded men standing around and occasionally not so graphically raping a girl.As always the story is an absolute mess and very little in the movie is making sense. The way the entire movie is progressing is laughable and just very far from convincing. It has some really stupid characters in it that you just don't ever care about. Jesus Franco doesn't seem to be able to see and fill up any gaping plotholes or he just simply doesn't care about it. Either way it's a bad thing.And yes well then there are some of the sex sequences that literally come out of nowhere often and show absolutely nothing. I don't even think that the lovers of softcore porn flicks are going to get excited by anything that gets shown or done in this movie.Again Jesus Franco uses his own wife Lina Romay in the movie as the main lead. Like all of the other girls she spends most of her time walking around naked in the movie. The girls in this movie are either being naked having sex with each other getting raped by a man or talking each others head of like a bunch of annoying loud naive helpless chicken.I must say though that I still enjoy watching older Franco movies better than the newer ones that he is still making this present day and age. At least these movies still had a bit of style over them and got shot at location instead of in a studio or in the garden of one of the castmembers.Trademark bad Jesus Franco stuff.310httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The structure of  the film is something to be marveled at. It is so delicately built that every frame even every prop serves a purpose for either characterization or as link between gags or both. Even the tilt of the abandoned ship serves toward the end of the movie.   The film is so beautifully shot that it has an idyllic quality.  It also has a really great plot and even greater sight gags.  And Lloyd's acting is beyond praise.  The film itself is a masterful blend of great comedy and sentiments.  Definitely one of the best silent films ever made.".

This is not because it is a bad film in fact it's one of his better ones but because it represents a style of film that is based almost completely on physical humor whereas his best films also included significantly more plot exceptional cinematography and a lot of heart. Among my favorites is THE KID BROTHER. It is very funny at times but all the humor takes a back seat to the plot involving Lloyd falling for Jobyna Ralston as he had in many previous films. The camera work is just unbelievable and just goes to show that just because this is a silent film doesn't mean it wasn't a very artistic film. A funny sweet beautiful and memorable film! And because of it's gorgeous and beautifully crafted scenes it's highly reminiscent of the best of Chaplin's fulllength films such as CITY LIGHTS. This film certainly has a lot of heart and will shock anyone expecting slapstick.So is THE KID BROTHER or THE FRESHMAN Lloyd's best filmit's hard to say. The FRESHMAN is more enjoyable and funny but there is an elegance to THE KID BROTHER that help it transcend the genremaking it truly a work of art. As for me I love them both and recommend you see them soon!".

Lloyd has a character that is well suited to his style and he adds some impressive stunts as well.As The Kid Brother Lloyd's character is the putupon son of a tough sheriff with two older domineering brothers. The story has Harold involved romantically with Jobyna Ralston who comes to town with a traveling medicine show that the sheriff is trying to shut down. There is also a large sum of money that has been collected for a new dam and entrusted to the sheriff. There is a lot going on and Lloyd's character faces challenges and difficulties both from his family and from the villains in the medicine show.The efforts of Lloyd's character to win the respect of his family give the plot some depth that complements the comedy and melodrama well. The action sequences often combine stunts drama and visual comedy at the same time and there are just enough thoughtful moments to keep the important characters from becoming flat. Constantine Romanoff makes a memorable villain and the lengthy showdown in the old abandoned ship is a wonderful set piece with lots of interesting details.It's well worth watching a number of times in order to catch and enjoy everything that Lloyd and the rest of the cast and crew have packed into less than an hour and a half of running time. How fortunate it is that this and Lloyd's other gems have finally come out on DVD for all of us silent movie fans to enjoy.".

Whenver something has to be done he's left out of the picture while his father assigns his brothers to the task.But the funniest scenes have to do with him trying to outwit and pull fast tricks on his brothers in a series of sight gags. They're perfectly willing to bully him whenever a show of muscle is involvedparticularly when impressing a girl they all have a yen for.There are too many sight gags to enumerate here and they all involve physical dexterity and timing of the highest order. A particularly demanding set of stunts are performed in the latter half of the story when our hero must board a ghost ship to retrieve money his father has been accused of stealing. The scenes involve a monkey in a sailor suit and a vicious villain out for the kill in keeping hold on stolen money.All of it is photographed with great style and there's an emotional attachment to the romantic angle involving the girl JOBYNA RALSTON so that the hectic comedy is anchored by a story that keeps the comedy on firm ground.Summing up A delightful physical comedy wonderfully photographed and played by an excellent cast with Lloyd at his alltime best.

Still it's not quite as renowned as other Lloyds  such as SAFETY LAST! 1923 or THE FRESHMAN 1925  which actually makes its discovery as an unequivocal gem not only in the pantheon of comedy but among the finest productions of the Silent era all the more sweeter! The plot was admittedly borrowed from the famous Silent melodrama TOL'ABLE David 1921  which I've never watched myself  but like THE GENERAL it seamlessly mingles dazzling comic invention with a serious a sure indication of this is the fact that it dispenses entirely with Lloyd's typically sarcastic title cards compelling and exciting plot line in this case Harold again like Keaton's rejected soldier has to prove he's the equal of his stalwart family by standing up to the villain  a sinisterlooking medicineshow strongman  and recover a cache of stolen money thus righting a wrong done his father largely at the instigation of his eternal rival  the longlasting family feud had also been utilized by Keaton for one of his most beautiful films OUR HOSPITALITY 1923.It's quite futile to mention individual gags from the film because it has a plethora of them all being incredibly clever apart from hilarious and are milked for all they're worth  generally so as to play up to the resourcefulness of our hero. As a matter of fact the film rarely pauses for breath between one setpiece and the next  while the last halfhour largely confined to an offshore boat is thrillingly packed with intense action and suspense as it speeds towards a happy resolution of all its various plot strands. Jobyna Ralston is once again Lloyd's leading lady here actually this proved to be their last collaboration.I've failed to mention before now the invaluable contribution which the scores by either Carl Davis or Robert Israel have contributed to these Silent films but Davis' sterling work here composed for Kevin Brownlow's Photoplay reissue of 1990 is particularly effective. By the way the film was started by Lewis Milestone but had to step down from the director's chair due to a contractual dispute it was taken over by Ted Wilde but even he was replaced by J.A. Howe at some later point after he was struck by an illness this led to the film's shooting schedule extending to a sixmonth period  but all these various calamities thankfully didn't affect the ultimate quality of THE KID BROTHER one bit! P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "Monday May 21 700pm The Paramount TheaterProduced in what collectively became the greatest year of the silent era Harold Lloyd considered The Kid Brother 1927 to be lacking sufficient action and humor. In reality his tenth of eleven silent features was the synthesis of all his acquired talents. It was Lloyd's greatest success in blending his trademark gags with welldeveloped characters and a thoughtful engaging story. The story of an introspective and bullied younger son who surprises everyone with his true strength suggests numerous popular sources including Hal Roach produced The White Sheep 1924 Henry King's Tol'able David 1921 and to some degree even Cinderella. Young Harold Hickory lives in a motherless home with his father the town sheriff and two terrorizing older brothers. The bucolic country setting recalls Grandma's Boy 1922 but is far more beautifully realized. To survive the dominance of his larger and stronger brothers a multitude of gags cleverly demonstrate Harold's mental superiority over them as the films greatest source of humor. When a travelling medicine show rolls into town Harold and Mary Jobyna Ralston in her final appearance with Lloyd the pretty daughter of the deceased owner share an instant attraction and a fear of the two thugs who have taken over the show. Constantine Romanoff as the murderous strong man is nearly as frightening in this comedy as the villain of Tolerable David Ernest Torrance. Harold's hometown rival Hank Hooper Ralph Yearsley who also starred in Tol'able David is larger stronger appropriately oafish and the perfect foil for several amusing confrontations. Hiding aboard an abandoned ship in the final reel Harold puts a pair of shoes on the medicine show monkey to draw the strong man away. The monkey waddles up the stairs and on deck with the strong man in pursuit. The Kid Brother is a seamless wellbalanced combination of humor romance and peril. It is atypically coordinated Lloyd. The pleasantly sentimental story is complimented by excellent casting and production design. What Lloyd saw as insufficient humor was actually a lighter treatment increasingly reliant and more fully demonstrating his acting abilities something many comics lacked in what is without question his best work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chaplin had City Lights. Buster Keaton had The General. Though Safety Last may be more iconic indeed one of the most iconic movies of all time I think The Kid Brother 1927 is the best expression of Harold Lloyd's brand of silent comedy warm peppy and breathless in pace.This has to be one of the most tightly constructed movies ever. Other commenters have brought up how every shot gag and character is woven into the plot. There is not an extraneous shot in TKB. The gags are also uniformly excellent not a dud in the bunch. More than his other features Lloyd and his collaborators balance comedy and drama with seemingly effortless grace. Even when the story has brushes with dark material ex. lynchings stalking it does not feel jarring.The character types who appear again and again in Lloyd's comic universe are here perhaps in their purest form Jobyna Ralston as the love interest is at her most sweet and charming in her last appearance opposite Lloyd Walter James who appeared as the intimidating father of Buster Keaton's love interest in Battling Butler the year before is gruff but noble as Lloyd's estranged father and the villains by God the villains are terrifying here! The climactic chasefight in the sunken ship succeeds not only due to the great choreography and Lloyd's physicality but also Constantine Romanoff as the brutish Sardoni. When he throws Harold across the room you can practically feel the bruises forming before he even lands!TKB also showcases Lloyd not only as a comedian but as a performer in general. As an actor he is the polar opposite of the reserved Buster Keaton not to say Keaton is inexpressive he was anything but but Lloyd plays far more extroverted types gogetters. Some say he mugs but I think his expressions are among his best traits a little exaggerated but hilarious. He oozes screen charm all jaunty youthful energy so perfect for the optimism of the 1920s. Despite being in his thirties when this movie was made Lloyd could still play eighteen and does it so well channeling the insecurities that come from feeling you don't measure up to everyone else trying to find yourself. He plays the emotional scenes well nothing as powerful as the weeping scene in The Freshman but still impressive.Overall this is a masterpiece. Tight funny and with a happy ending which may or may not have you crying a little. What else could you want from a comedy?".

As has been noted by others the basic plot is hardly original in many ways a rerun of what we have seen before with Lloyd in 'Grandma's Boy'. This is a far funnier motion picture though and the gags always feel like an organic part of the tale and character progression whereas the earlier Lloyd film is more a series of skits. At 'The Kid Brother''s most amusing Lloyd's two nightgownclad brothers try unsuccessfully to hide when he brings a girl home unannounced at night. This subplot becomes even funnier when morning comes round and they keep trying to romance Lloyd's new girlfriend unaware that she has already left and it is just Lloyd left behind the bed sheets hanging in his quarters. The film is also blessed with some excellent camerawork for the era a crane shot that travels up a tree but if there is one aspect that lets the film down it is an overreliance on dialogue with the title cards breaking up the intimacy of the action on more than one occasion. Most of 'The Kid Brother' is very good news though spinning a tight and cohesive narrative a la 'The Freshman'. Lloyd is also as great as one would expect though a monkey in the final quarter pretty much steals the show.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't go wrong with selfconfidence. This was Harold Lloyd's recipe for life and the same holds true with the characters he plays. The best example of this is Harold Hickory in The Kid Brother.Harold is the youngest of three sons in the allmale Hickory clan who keep order in the town of Hickoryville. Harold desperately wants the approval of his father and brothers but can't quite manage it. A new reason to shine comes in the form of beautiful dancer Mary Jobyna Ralston who rides into town with a medicine show. When Mary's partners steal the town treasury it's up to Harold to save the day.The Kid Brother isn't as iconic as The Freshman or Safety Last but it's right up there with the first and a good deal better than the other when it comes to showcasing the full range of Lloyd's cinematic talents. There are stunts and thrills and a big scary finish to keep an audience gasping between laughs but the true beauty of the film is how well it sets up the sentimental side of Harold which is where movie clowns often fall short.Right away we are told Harold is a bit of a town joke born on April 1 The stork that brought him could hardly fly for laughing. When we first see him watching his father and brothers easily lift a great trunk Lloyd's face reflects pride and chagrin. He can't measure up his eyes tell us.You're too modest but I like you for it. That's Mary talking to Harold but it could as well be us for the way we are introduced to him. There are many laughs in this film but what makes The Kid Brother stand up so well 90 years later is the craft of the production.Even if he didn't take a director's credit giving it instead to his ailing collaborator Ted Wilde and journeyman J. A. Howe Lloyd's touch is both unmistakable and deft. An opening scene of a derelict boat on a sunburnished bay not only introduces the dreamy pastoral quality of the entire film but sets the scene for where it all comes to an end desperately and triumphantly in 90 minutes.That final battle in the Black Ghost is a masterpiece of pure cinema and so is a scene of Harold waving goodbye to Mary by climbing a tree that never seems to stop rising  without the camera ever losing Mary in the everdeepening background. Likewise Harold gets maximum use from the intense physiognomy of costar Constantine Romanoff who plays the heavy Sandoni but could just as easily be Nosferatu for the way he is shot. He presents a horrific adversary yet he's not only overcome but literally becomes a vehicle for Harold's final triumph.The Kid Brother doesn't have the greatest gags of silent cinema. Harold's rivalry with an annoying neighbor who tries to steal Mary away is more trope than plot point. The crisis of the stolen money is kind of introduced out of left field. But craft and charm count for a lot in comedy and so does timing all of which this movie gives you. I never laughed once when I watched the scene where Harold's two brothers are caught out in their nightshirts by a sudden visit from Mary but I never stopped smiling. It's not just some good gags but the way the camera moves from room to room and the way light and shade are used to suggest lurking menace just before the tables are turned yet again and Harold escapes fraternal punishment.You watch other Harold Lloyd films and get blown away by the skill the comedic chops and the acrobatic daring he brought to the screen. The Kid Brother has a quieter subtler power that only builds with repeat viewings. If it's not quite a masterpiece it shows how a great screen comedy can be made.".

Turns out it was also Lloyd's favorite not to mention the last with the lovely Jobyna Ralston who would go on to star in Wings which still isn't out on DVD! Grrr!. I'm going to miss her in Speedy. I noticed that between The Circus and The Cameraman this film completes a kind of Silent Film Masters Monkey Trilogy pairing Lloyd with a bothersome but resourceful capuchin in the climax. Lloyd's trademark gogetter attitude is never more evident than in this film where his character really does have something to prove. It's quite heartbreaking when his father refuses to let him help find the bandits telling him It could be dangerous not realizing that the resourceful Harold will probably be more helpful than both Leo and Olin combined. Harold's journey to prove himself becomes quite compelling and his relationship with Mary Ralston is that much more romantic for it. In several scenes he manages to outsmart his gigantic stupid brothers by using his wits and ingenuity while also warming up to Mary while the brothers run and hide. Those scenes show just a few of the film's many lengthy gagfilled set pieces as the film is loaded to the brim with spectacular gags. The climactic ship sequence must be at least 20 minutes long as Harold and the villain who has already murdered his own partner battle each other over every inch of the ship.KEVIN Many silent comedies include some sort of mistaken identity. From Keaton's The General to Lloyd's own Safety Last there is often some variation of a nobody being mistaken for a somebody. And so it is here with our penultimate Harold Lloyd silent comedy where Lloyd plays the black sheep in a family of prominent lawmen until Mary Ms. Ralston one last time mistakes him for the real sheriff. Similar to The Freshman Mary becomes supportive of Harold midway through the film and it's through her support that he finds the courage to get back the stolen money when the town arrests his father for losing it. The extended scene on the boat is an effective mix of comedy and suspense as the bag of stolen cash changes hands from Harold the malicious robber and a monkey. So now Keaton Chaplin and Lloyd have all done comedy scenes featuring monkeys. I laughed every time Harold outwits the robber and at the same time I was scared for him because we just saw the robber murder his partner over the money which makes Harold seem even more heroic when he finally wins out.Last film viewed For Heaven's Sake 1926. Last film chronologically Metropolis 1927. Next film viewed Speedy 1928. Next film chronologically The General 1927.The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through year by year one film at a time. We also write a short review for each and every film. In this project we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period the films of the era and each film in context while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies most of which we never would have watched otherwise.".

The timing and the slapstick elements aren't the best example of the particular time period and also most certainly so wasn't the directing that was even below average in parts. There was lots of running and jumping but quite frankly it didn't all made really much sense at times. I prefer a Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton or Laurel  Hardy movie over this everyday. Thank goodness that in the end the movie still turns into a great and fun slapstick. Of course in between the movie also features some great creative and fun moments.The story is just great and solid. Something that really wasn't common for '20's comedies. It's a sweet story that knows to create a balance between the silly humor and the romantic aspects of the movie. It are the romantic aspects that really makes this a sweet and irresistible movie to watch.I liked it though for other reasons than its comedy.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

There was lots of running and jumping but quite frankly it didn't all made really much sense at times. I prefer a Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton or Laurel  Hardy movie over this everyday. Thank goodness that in the end the movie still turns into a great and fun slapstick. Of course in between the movie also features some great creative and fun moments.The story is just great and solid. Something that really wasn't common for '20's comedies. It's a sweet story that knows to create a balance between the silly humor and the romantic aspects of the movie. It are the romantic aspects that really makes this a sweet and irresistible movie to watch.I liked it though for other reasons than its comedy.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

Basically in the farming town of Hickoryville the Hickorys are a respected family but patriarch Sheriff Jim Hickory Walter James and his strong sons Leo Leo Willis and Olin Olin Francis have little respect for the youngest son the bespectacled clumsy and nave Harold Harold Lloyd. He is often neglected by his family given the domestic duties and not included in important matters either at the farm or in the town. One day when Jim Leo and Olin go to an important town meeting Harold is left alone for amusement he puts on his father's gun and badge. He is mistaken for being the sheriff by ruthless traveling medicine showman 'Flash' Farrell Eddie Boland he talks Harold into permitting him strongman Sandoni Constantine Romanoff and dancer Mary Powers Jobyna Ralston perform. Mary is trying to avoid the unwanted attentions of Sandoni she and Harold spend some time together and they become attracted to each other. When Jim finds out Harold authorised the medicine show he orders Harold to shut down the performance Harold tries but ends up being tricked and tied up. Harold's sworn enemy town bully Hank Hooper Ralph Yearsley pelts him and accidentally starts a fire that consumes the medicine show wagon. Harold invites Mary to spend the night at his family home he does not get permission to do so from his father and he uses hit wits to overcome his bigger brothers however Mrs. Hooper and her son Hank show up and take her with them. The next day the town is celebrating as Jim is handing over funds raised by the residents to help build a dam to a state official however the money is gone. Jim strongly believes Farrell and Sandoni are responsible but Sam Hooper Frank Lanning accuses Jim of the theft. Jim sends Leo and Olin but not Harold after them when they return emptyhanded Jim has been tied up and there is talk of lynching. Harold confesses to Mary his unintentional deception he is not the man she thought he was but she tells him he has faith in him. Hank accuses Mary of being involved in the robbery Harold fights back when some men grab her only to have Harold knock him unconscious and set him adrift in a boat. Harold wakes up when the boat reaches an abandoned beached ship aboard the ship he finds the real thieves. Sandoni and Farrell argue over the division of the loot with the strongman eventually disposing of the medicine man then Sandoni spots Harold and chases him all over the ship. Harold eventually manages to outdo the strongman and races back to town with his prisoner and the money to save his father. Jim is impressed with Harold saying Son you're a real Hickory Hank stands in the way of him and Mary walking away but Harold musters up the courage to fight his nemesis and beat him up. I had only previously seen Lloyd in the famous image of him hanging from a clock from Safety Last! he is a very good physical comedian I will admit I did not follow all elements of the story but it did not matter as the slapstick and sight gags were funny it is a worthwhile silent comedy. Very good!".

It would be their last date on screen before Jobyna would retire a couple of movies into the talkie era because of an unfortunate lisp but if anything it's a fitting and memorable farewell. Aside from the romance The Kid Brother also has more than a handful of laughs up its sleeves and while I'm not a big fan of the movie's switch to elaborate stunts in the third act the majority of the film showcases a somewhat restrained and down to earth tone that is both laughoutloud funny and charming at the same time.".

I thought it was interesting how the whole movie felt like it could have been conceived by a slapstick loving version of Joseph Campbell with a daddy complex. It's such a naive and fun take on the hero's journey. I guess today's lovable goof would need to have some vaguely creepy or sexual element a la The 40 Year Old Virgin or something. I say this because I just don't see audiences these days going in for something as innocent and bighearted as the conceit of trying endlessly to please one's father. It's a weird thing to be sure especially when tied intrinsically to a romance angle wherein he can only become a man by winning the admiration of a very gorgeous lass at the same time as his dad but that's what kept me invested I guess. It's almost too personal to just be comedic. It's also got a surprising number of good looking shots. I don't know why gags like tears turning into rain or a pig wearing a bowler hat on its back are so freaking funny and bizarre either. I also don't know if it is just a century's remove that made the last third a bit tedious but it didn't ruin the overall film for me and I quite liked getting to see the twerp becoming a dude!".

But he turns out to be very shrewd and smarter than his whole family. In a stunning and breathtaking finale he prevails over a tough conman and finally is able to make himself respected for his father Jim the sheriff. From what I can tell this is Lloyd's alltime best hence his ambitious glassed character has fully developed and is absolutely convincing. In contrast to his former Lonesome Luke a rather rough and harddriving character the new bespectacled Harold now being a believable human being is charming and extremely hilarious. You cannot refrain yourself from laughing out loud when Harold disguises himself as his father to kid his narrowminded brothers. Although the feature includes many individually hilarious scenes Lloyd artfully interwoves a thread of pathos as well. Amazingly romantic scenes are always combined with great gags Harold falls in love with bittersweet Jobyna Ralston and you probably will too because that beautiful girl has zing!and climbs a tree towards the top in order to watch his beloved disappearing. Being lost in thought Harold who is enchanted by the girl's grace finally falls off the tree. Describing sight gags is a lost art hence you are not capable of pointing out the extent of wit and creativity of a certain idea therefore I better throw in the towel and you should start watching Lloyd's topnotch gags. While one is touched by Harold's romantic love story the real treat is watching the potent and stunning finale which never takes a breath. Incredibly Lloyd is able to provide countless bellylaugh scenes as well as impressing the audience with genuine and deeply moving sentiment. His feature has just about everything one could ask for in a comedy It is funny exciting and even romantic. The astonishing carrer of Lloyd represents Hollywood's ideal. He developed a craft and in my opinion perfected the art of silent comedies. Comedy can be manufactured as television has proved but great comic personalities cannot Leonard Maltin. Lloyd's film is unique because Lloyd is unique. Sympathetic that I am to movie buffs who adore comedies of the fifties sixties etc. I nevertheless cannot help feeling that early silent comedies are the richest comedies in the cinema's history worse still they have become mediums of a neglected art. Regarding The Kid Brother it is safe to say that this masterpiece with its brightest moments shines like a comic perfection that will glow forever. Let us keep alive his films for generations to come hence he deserves being honored.".

Dharmendra is cast in a role of a young man when he's already 60 and Karisma plays his sister while she could well be his daughter if not granddaughter. Akshay Kumar is the ordinary guy who sings songs for his beloved and is there to fight for her whenever necessary.

His films like Aaj Ka Arjun1990 Kundan1991 Insaniyat Ke Devta1993 Shaktiman1993 Lal Baadshah1999 have failed to create an impact critically and commercially. Maidaan E Jung is another one of his crass action films. This movie contains lots and lots of typical melodrama which is extremely irritating. The villains are extremely crude and unrealistic. The action is typically overdone in B Grade style. This is one B Grade flick that can be avoided this is what the public did in 1995 when this trash released and bombed at the box office.The film tells the story of sinister and evil Amrish Puri who controls the lives of the innocent villagers. The villagers are upset and they are forced to believe that Amrish Puri is their leader and they must be his slave. Dharmendra is the main hero and he is first loyal but later against Amrish Puri. He saves Jaya Prada from getting molested by Gulshan GroverAmrish's son and marries her. Akshay Kumar is completely wasted in this movie he is just used to fight the villains and dance in the pathetic songs of the film. Dina Pathak who usually has a larger role to play the grandmother is used to just offer some melodrama in the film. Dharmendra attacks and finally after lots of nonsense wins the battle against the evil Amrish Puri.The script is so lousy that it feels like some 4 year old child wrote it. The main story is typical but horribly handled the whole concept of revenge is dragged by useless comedy and songs and this becomes a pain to watch. Direction by K.C Bokadia is awful and this makes his earlier filmsalso crappy look good. This is his worst film till date and Lal Baadshah was somewhat better than this. There is no proper flow in the film and it becomes irritating to watch a movie with no proper story. If not the story people might think the performances will impress? The people are completely wrong if they are in this impression.Veteran actor Dharmendra is wasted in a typical action hero role. He speaks in the same drunk style delivering dialogs his expressions are alright making his performance fairly OK. Akshay Kumar is wasted and his role is small he is just there to fight and save his love from getting molested and sing songs with her. I don't understand why Akshay would choose this film and this is again another wrong choice by him. Manoj Kumar is wasted in a pathetic role that lacks potential. Karishma Kapoor is the typical heroine who is only used in songs and scenes where she has the hero that he is wrong. Amrish Puri is average and his villain act is weak here. At least he doesn't overact but this is nothing compared to his Mogambo Khush Hua act. Gulshan Grover irritates as the crude son of the evil villain. Overall the performances disappoint.On the whole Maaidan E Jung is a crass B Grade film which fails from every aspect. If you want to watch a couple of awful action scenes in a typical good vs. evil movie set in a village this is your cup of tea.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not so much to say about this film except it has two sides  tedious and fun. It is a nice film but in some places it does get abit dull. Nice storyline and plot about some villagers who are at threat by their leader Data Guru. No one dares speak a word against him except from of course Dharmendra and Manoj Kumar. Manoj Kumar is killed by Gulshan Grover while saving her from rape. Dharmendra is introduced in the film with his pure jatt background  singing in a farm whilst on a ford tractor and drinking fresh cow's milk. He is first shown as a tru follower of Data Guru untill he finds his true identity and seeing this as a threat Data Guru shoots him but Dharmendra is back on his feet to sort business. Akshay Kumar and Karishma play their 'love' scenes and Karishma plays Dharmendra's only loving sister whilst Akshay is actually the son of Data Guru and brother to Gulshan Grover! Not such a nice performance by the pair except from a nice little song in the jungle  judge for yourselves! Dharmendra livens up the screen with his big presence while the comic duo Shakti Kapoor and Kader Khan play tricks on each other.".

A cameo appearance by JLo Jennifer Lopez at the end of the film does not legitimize the film. As for the music it starts out okay at the start of the film but then goes from bad to worse. The dancing is okay but disappears by the end of the film. A song entitled 'Puerto Rico' which I guess was sung at a Puerto Rican festival in New York City feels more like a commercial than a movie. But the film fails to promote anything but garbage.There does not seem to even be a plotand as someone has suggested I would not even bother to write what may be a plot quoting the suggestion on an envelope. It would be a waste of an envelope that can be betterused elsewhere. If there is a script it certainly must be brief and threadbare. Did anyone ever both to do any research at all on Puerto Ricans? If so the research findings do not find their way in this film. In fact this film appears to be a poor remake of West Side Story gone bad the Jets and the Sharks even get lost.The film is more like a nightmare on UpperWestSide's Main Street. And the script is filled with a Caucasian's misconception of what the writer blindly sees as a Puerto Rican Yellow Brick Road. The script needs lots and lots and lots of work. And the actors and dancers are like a Peter Pan that just does not know how to fly. Also the film's creators need to rewrite a morebelievable if not moreauthentic workable kind of formula. Do not even listen to or watch the dialog or music from the film. Or at least take two aspirin after you get a migraine headache. Do your homework or go to Puerto Rico to learn about what it really is to be a Puerto Rican. All you will get from the film is plenty of chaos confusion noise and static. The film is so awful that it deserves a zero but the lowest rank is 1 out of 10. Due to 'extreme awfulness' the film is not recommended. Keep the adultsand the childrenhome.".

This is the worst movie for someone who eats movies for breakfast and the best movie for a reggeton dancer. And since I'm caught right in the middle i justify my grade. The music is very cool comparing to the movie I've actually paused the movie in mid action to look for the OST online  The one thing you can't say about music is that it S.U.X. because it doesn't. Just because some of us you don't line one king of music. This doesn't mean that if this movie was about heavy metal you would have seen a rating of 1 and a post saying that the music is bad not from me at least. My advice to all of you is watch the movie and if you don't like it grab a camera and do your own.".

You want to talk about doing a cameo for a checkat least Chris Brown was in Stomp the Yard for more than 2 minutes. Oh don't blink or you will miss J Lo and Marc Anthony's ultra quick cameo towards the end of the film. The acting was mailed in by some of the cast and one of the scenes between Rob and his father in one scene gave you no cause to feel for Rob being upset that his father was never around. It is also interesting that almost everyone in Puerto Rico spoke perfect English and there is a scene that takes a dig about that. For those expecting to see a long version of a music video. Sorry that movie doesn't do that in fact most of those dance scenes happen ultra early and you never see them again. The music was enjoyable and actually got me interested in learning more about Reggaeton. So I don't feel like my 2.50 was wasted on a film that won't be showing this time next week at my theater.".

Or walking past a group of people having mindless chit chat. Now imagine you're not watching a movie and instead picture every character on screen as some annoying clueless person you know in real life. And there you have it For starters the performances are so amateurish that one might think this was the first time any of them had ever been on the big screen. There is also no real acting going on here. It seems as if the actors are simply saying their lines without any real emotion. The story begins with RobOmarion a young aspiring rapper who lives in Harlem with his mother Tanya.Kellita Smith. After getting into trouble with local thugs his mother sends him to Puerto Rico to live with his estranged father Roberto a musician played by Giancarlo Esposito. Rob meets his brother named Javi Victor Rasukand the two quickly bond over their love of music. Javi introduces Rob to raggaeton a mixture of hip hop reggae and Spanish beats and they soon decide to create a demo. Rob meets the lovely CC Zulay Henaoan aspiring dancer and the two quickly take a liking to each other. Pretty soon Rob javi and CC head to New York to pursue their dreams but they quickly realize that the price of fame can be costly.One of the things that makes this film so bad is the horrible acting and dialogue. Unfortunately these actors just don't have anything good to work with here. I often wondered whether Chomski was trying to capture the essence of urban street life. Although not a bad idea this concept would've been great with stronger dialogue and better character development. The majority of the film is very similar to other films of its kind which makes the plot seem very bland and formulaic. I could not understand why veteran seasoned actors such as Kellita Smith Giancarlo Esposito and Malik Yoba would agree to star in an atrocity of a film. What a complete waste of good talent !!! Victor Rasuk Raising Victor Vargas Lords of Dogtown has done better acting than this and unfortunately Zulay Henao Fighting barely acts and comes across as just another pretty face with a great body.Last but not least Chomski's terrible sense of direction doesn''t help either. Watching The Mayor Yoba frantically run from the cops as Rob helps him get away is dreadful to watch. Not to mention Rob going against ex crewgang members after returning to New York. Horrendous !!! Chomski makes an attempt to wrap the film up neatly with ending it at the Puerto Rican Day parade. JLO whose also the producer of the film makes an appearance.".

In fact it's rated so low that it can be found on the website's Bottom 100 list! Owch!! However after seeing it I just felt that a lot of people are being really really rough on this little film. Now perhaps my perspective is different from mostafter all I'm a 45 yearold White guyhardly the typical viewer for this reggaetonrap movie!! However I saw some things about the film that I likedthough I'll also admit it had a few shortcomings.Perhaps one of the biggest reasons I enjoyed the film is that I've been to Puerto Rico a couple timesthe last time being just a few months ago. A lot of the scenes in the film were very familiar because I saw the same places when I visited. It's funny but the basketball court and cemetery near the two old forts in San Juan really are NOT that close to the neighborhood in which the family livesbut I can understand a bit of artistic license. I also liked hearing the music. While I am FAR from a reggaeton fan I sure heard a lot of that music and it was nice to hear it againit's hard to hate that infectious beat.The story is about a young punk from New York that nearly gets himself killed for hanging with the wrong crowd. Overstaying his welcome his mother sends him to his estranged father in Puerto Rico to liveat least until the heat dies downotherwise he might be a dead man. Once in his new home he forms a quick relationship with his stepbrother and they find a common bond through their love of music. Eventually they create their own demo tapea fusion of reggaeton and rap. The two guys and their lady friend eventually are discovered by a record producer and things look great. But a few problems develop along the waythe girl's exboyfriend is nuts and the producer is not quite as nice a guy as he seems. Will they make it or die trying? The film is not especially deep. The main characters could use a bit more depth and likability. However the story is fastmoving and never boring and the music very nice. I particularly liked the ending at the Puerto Rican Day parade in New York. Light and enjoyable fluff.By the way I was unfortunate enough to have seen this on VH1. There were tons of commercials and I think they cut the heck out of it so perhaps the version I watched was a bit different and had a different flow than most others sawthough this wouldn't account for THAT big a difference in scores.By the way this is about the third or fourth film from the Bottom 100 I have seen that's about Black culture with Black actors that made the list but seemed MUCH better to metoo good for this infamous list. A couple other films I felt were unfairly maligned were I Can Do Bad All By Myself and Phat Girlz. All three were decent entertainment. Sure they had a few faults...but not anything THAT significant.".

So during 2008 after a very busy first half of my junior year of high school my mom rented this movie and my sister offered for me to watch it. I'll tell you how forgettable this movie is. I don't even remember what was the first scene. And I was in and out of it during the movie. I was so bored out of my mind. The only thing memorable about it was the music for I LOVE music. But the scenes were too short for my liking the plot was in pieces the acting wasn't good but not great either. I will say that Omarion looked sexy in this movie but even he couldn't save it. 3 out of ten.".

So during 2008 after a very busy first half of my junior year of high school my mom rented this movie and my sister offered for me to watch it. I'll tell you how forgettable this movie is. I don't even remember what was the first scene. And I was in and out of it during the movie. I was so bored out of my mind. The only thing memorable about it was the music for I LOVE music. But the scenes were too short for my liking the plot was in pieces the acting wasn't good but not great either. I will say that Omarion looked sexy in this movie but even he couldn't save it. 3 out of ten.";

Hence the title Feel the NOISE.Anways I enjoyed seeing such a positive and inspiring movie when so much else out there is so depressing. I thought it was a lot better than You Got Served because it covered something outside of the usual Street Kid Makes his way with Hip Hop Dance. Reggaeton is totally different. Plus if you don't listen or never have listened to Reggaeton it's a great way to hear some great music. Side bonus CC's really hot!

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest YES we have seen this plot before with inner city struggles and the rise to fame. But THIS time it has a different flavor especially with the Reggaeton  Rapping element added. Omarion Grandberry plays a troubled teen Rob with super stardom aspirations who has to go live in Puerto Rico with his estranged Father Roberto and his new wife due to a run in with some gang members.It's a movie about pain redemption finding yourself and ultimately going for your dreams against the mounting odds against you. It's a HUMAN story filled with real life situations that a lot of us in the inner city have gone through ARE going through or know someone with the same struggle. Most people won't be able to swallow this movie if they think it's a super sappy romance or an edgy rap battle movie with NOTHING but dancing  breaking. This is NOT You Got Served! XDOmarion is convincing as a rapper and in the sideplots you can feel his grief and anger towards his Father and his overall frustration at being thrust from his hometown into a new environment that seems foreign to him. Not to mention Zulay as Cici doesn't hurt as the gorgeous and talented eye candy who is seeking to fulfill her dancing dream. As time goes on he is enveloped in the culture and we see the bond between him and his stepbrother and a loveinterest grows. The kissing scene  love scene was rather awkward to me and I didn't feel the chemistry but other then that the dancing was bomb the grainy lens and visual effects were minimal yet appropriate and pretty soon you'll find the storyline just sucking you in from scene to scene. Not to mention THE BEAUTIFUL scenic landscapes that are Puerto Rico! But I definitely recommend this movie! Really. Ignore the bad reviews. Most of them are tactless and rushed. 'FTN' possesses a plot that HAS been seen before but with the rich acting and lovely castchoices in this movie MORE than make up for that. Besides it's Omarion's debut role by himself on the big screen. You can't miss that!".

	schema:headline " Outstanding Performance by Major Actors";
	schema:reviewBody "Marlon Brando proved his stature as one of the greatest movie actors over and over again  from A Streetcar Named Desire through On the Water Front all the way to The Godfather. In the light of his marvelous performance as Napoleon I. in Desiree it seems surprising that this movie doesn't quite get the same attention as those others he starred in. Desiree seems even more underrated when you take into account the great acting of Jean Simmons Desiree Clary Merle Oberon Josephine Beauharnais and Michael Rennie JeanBaptiste Bernadotte. All four main actors deliver powerful performances giving the viewer a real sense of the powerful personalities they embody.The story is that of Napoleon however seen through the eyes of his first fiance Desiree Clary daughter of a wealthy Marseilles merchant whom Napoleon leaves to wed Josephine Beauharnais. The Beauharnais's political connections facilitate the military leader's rise to political power but Napoleon dumps her for Marie Luise of Austria when it turns out that Josephine is unable to bear children.Meanwhile Desiree marries JeanBaptiste Bernadotte one of Napoleons most distinguished generals. Thus Desiree remains in Napoleon's orbit and the Emperor repeatedly distinguishes her amongst the ladies of his court making it clear that his love for her never fully died out. When the Swedish parliament offers her throne to her husband Desiree follows Bernadotte to his new country. But since she's unable to adapt to the stiff protocol of the Swedish court Desiree returns to France just in time to see Napoleon make the tragic mistake of leading the grande armee to Russia.Marlon Brando masterfully conveys the image of a charismatic leader who believes himself chosen by destiny to fulfill a task of truly historic proportions. In every scene Brando's Napoleon commands attention and obedience by way of natural authority. From the moment he enters the Clarys' family parlor and seizes control of the evening conversation all the way through his bitter discussions with Bernadotte about the latter's acceptance of the Swedish crown to his acknowledgment of defeat after the Battle of Waterloo  Brando shows us a dignified determined and at times dangerous leader.Just one  hilariously funny  example There is a scene in which the court is rehearsing for the 1804 coronation of Napoleon and Josephine in Notre Dame with the future Emperor not present. Napoleon's sisters refuse to carry Josephine's train and bicker about their brother's not bestowing enough honors and titles upon them. All of a sudden Brando's voice is heard May I be of help in this difficult and strategic operation? and the entire court bows down in deference. As Marlon Brando walks through the ranks of the lickspittles everything seems in perfect order. He IS the Emperor in the same way that he just IS the godfather. And it's that natural authority that Brando conveys throughout the film.Simmons's Desiree on the other hand is charming. The character is not designed to have the same powerful screen presence  though it lends itself to the movie's title  but nonetheless Desiree is an interesting character in that she exhibits human growth. The character starts as a nave flirtatious teenager infatuated by the bovarisme of romantic novels she's just as overjoyed at commanding the attention of a general as she's heartbroken on finding out that Napoleon is going to marry Josephine. She then moves on to becoming the traditional mother figure as she has a son with Bernadotte a desirable woman willing and able to bear responsibility but without any greater intellectual ambition. And she finally reaches a stage of intellectual maturity which enables her to convince the Emperor in a grand though highly fictionalized scene that it is better to surrender to the allied forces than to shed more blood in a futile attempt to save the bits and pieces of his shattered empire after the Battle of Waterloo. It is this development that is mirrored in Simmons's performance at all stages.Oberon and Rennie as Josephine and Bernadotte are congenial counterparts  though their characters have considerably less screen time and are of lesser importance to the plot. Particularly Oberon's air of desolation in the scene in which she speaks with Desiree about Napoleon's decision to marry Marie Louise is impressive. So too are the aforesaid discussions between Bernadotte and Napoleon. Brando's Napoleon commands the scene here too but there is an authentic sense that Rennie's Bernadotte is doggedly refusing to give in to his former commander's demands.Desiree is an underrated movie especially given the comparatively low IMDbrating which remains mysterious to me. The performance of Brando is outstanding those of Simmons Oberon and Rennie are remarkable as well. It goes without saying that the costumes are lavish and the cinematography impressive. A top movie in the genre of historic drama.".

	onyx:emotionText "Marlon Brando proved his stature as one of the greatest movie actors over and over again  from A Streetcar Named Desire through On the Water Front all the way to The Godfather. In the light of his marvelous performance as Napoleon I. in Desiree it seems surprising that this movie doesn't quite get the same attention as those others he starred in. Desiree seems even more underrated when you take into account the great acting of Jean Simmons Desiree Clary Merle Oberon Josephine Beauharnais and Michael Rennie JeanBaptiste Bernadotte. All four main actors deliver powerful performances giving the viewer a real sense of the powerful personalities they embody.The story is that of Napoleon however seen through the eyes of his first fiance Desiree Clary daughter of a wealthy Marseilles merchant whom Napoleon leaves to wed Josephine Beauharnais. The Beauharnais's political connections facilitate the military leader's rise to political power but Napoleon dumps her for Marie Luise of Austria when it turns out that Josephine is unable to bear children.Meanwhile Desiree marries JeanBaptiste Bernadotte one of Napoleons most distinguished generals. Thus Desiree remains in Napoleon's orbit and the Emperor repeatedly distinguishes her amongst the ladies of his court making it clear that his love for her never fully died out. When the Swedish parliament offers her throne to her husband Desiree follows Bernadotte to his new country. But since she's unable to adapt to the stiff protocol of the Swedish court Desiree returns to France just in time to see Napoleon make the tragic mistake of leading the grande armee to Russia.Marlon Brando masterfully conveys the image of a charismatic leader who believes himself chosen by destiny to fulfill a task of truly historic proportions. In every scene Brando's Napoleon commands attention and obedience by way of natural authority. From the moment he enters the Clarys' family parlor and seizes control of the evening conversation all the way through his bitter discussions with Bernadotte about the latter's acceptance of the Swedish crown to his acknowledgment of defeat after the Battle of Waterloo  Brando shows us a dignified determined and at times dangerous leader.Just one  hilariously funny  example There is a scene in which the court is rehearsing for the 1804 coronation of Napoleon and Josephine in Notre Dame with the future Emperor not present. Napoleon's sisters refuse to carry Josephine's train and bicker about their brother's not bestowing enough honors and titles upon them. All of a sudden Brando's voice is heard May I be of help in this difficult and strategic operation? and the entire court bows down in deference. As Marlon Brando walks through the ranks of the lickspittles everything seems in perfect order. He IS the Emperor in the same way that he just IS the godfather. And it's that natural authority that Brando conveys throughout the film.Simmons's Desiree on the other hand is charming. The character is not designed to have the same powerful screen presence  though it lends itself to the movie's title  but nonetheless Desiree is an interesting character in that she exhibits human growth. The character starts as a nave flirtatious teenager infatuated by the bovarisme of romantic novels she's just as overjoyed at commanding the attention of a general as she's heartbroken on finding out that Napoleon is going to marry Josephine. She then moves on to becoming the traditional mother figure as she has a son with Bernadotte a desirable woman willing and able to bear responsibility but without any greater intellectual ambition. And she finally reaches a stage of intellectual maturity which enables her to convince the Emperor in a grand though highly fictionalized scene that it is better to surrender to the allied forces than to shed more blood in a futile attempt to save the bits and pieces of his shattered empire after the Battle of Waterloo. It is this development that is mirrored in Simmons's performance at all stages.Oberon and Rennie as Josephine and Bernadotte are congenial counterparts  though their characters have considerably less screen time and are of lesser importance to the plot.

	schema:reviewBody "I have commented before on the paucity of American films dealing with the history of Canada and Mexico our next door neighbors. We are easily receptive to films made here or in the British Commonwealth about the history of England and then we have a tendency to enjoy films about the history of France. But then it is spotty. Films about Germany deal with it's military history or the Nazis how many Americans would sit through a film about Goethe or Schiller  a few years back a film about Beethoven appeared and was not a box office favorite. It gets weaker too when we edge to Scandanavia. Ask how many historic films deal with Sweden which once was the dominant power in Eastern Europe I can only recall two historical films made in America Queen Christina and Desiree. The former showed Greta Garbo finally playing a Swedish person of importance as the 17th Century ruler who abdicated in 1655. The latter dealt with French people surrounding one of the world's most fascinating men Napoleon Bonaparte. But Napoleon was Marlon Brando and the film followed the career of one of the women in Napoleon's life who ended up not in bed with him but with one of his rivals. Desiree Clary Jean Simmons had dated Napoleon when he was a young officer but his career and ambitions took him away from her. However she met a rival of Bonaparte Jean Bernadotte. Bernadotte who would eventually rise to be one of the Emperor's Marshalls and a persistent critic was sent into ambassadorial exile in 1809 to Sweden taking his wife and son with him. As French Ambassador to Stockholm he ingratiated himself into the affections of the childless King of Sweden as well as the people. In 1811 shortly before his death the King of Sweden made Bernadotte his heir  and the Swedish public acclaimed the decision. It turned out to be very wise Bernadotte had grown disgusted by Napoleon's continuous warfare and once he became King of Sweden he joined with the Russians and Austrians and Prussians in working for the end of Napoleons wars. As a result in 1815 the Congress of Vienna accepted Bernadotte's title as King and even granted him territory all of Norway taken from Napoleon's faithful ally Denmark. This forced union lasted until 1905 it was peacefully settled. But the family of the Bernadottes still are the reigning family of Sweden.The film is lopsided. Simmons plays her role well enough but it is not really developed as an independent character. Her husband is played by Michael Rennie and he does what he can to show his growing disenchantment with his rival. Brando is superb as Bonaparte  witness the scene where to satisfy his sisters who resent having to hold the train of their sisterinlaw Josephine Merle Oberon in a touching and sad performance gives them silly titles that they are so happy to get as awards for holding the train. But such scenes are rare. The film is not as static and dull as Sacha Guitry's 1955 film Napoleon but it has an improbable script. While I will note that Napoleon did more than anyone to spread the ideals of the French Revolution around Europe and the world he never mouthed a statement that he sought to create a United States of Europe as Brando at the end of the film tells Simmons. More likely he wanted a United States of Napoleon though one where there was more opportunity for everyone to move upwardly than in the 18th Century courts that existed. It is a colorful film and the performances are not bad especially Brando and Oberon but it ain't French history. But I'll give it a 6 for a brief window into Swedish history.".

Of course history teaches us about the rise and fall of Napoleon. And it comments about his numerous affairs of which Desiree was the first.

And when the Swedish Royal House of Vasa is destined to die out the Swedish Parlimament elects Rennie to be the heir apparent. That does put him on a collision course with Brando who expects a little loyalty from his marshals. Rennie however sees his duty lies with the Swedish people.Caught between both men and the politics of two countries Jean Simmons gives a fine performance as a woman with more strength than she knew. The Swedish Royal line today is descended from their child who became King Oscar I of Sweden in 1844. Despite fine performances by Brando Oberon and Rennie Desiree is first and foremost Jean Simmons film.Desiree got two Oscar nominations for Costume Design and ArtSet Design for a color film.

Marlon Brando and Michael Rennie just added to the enjoyment. I vowed at the time that I first saw the movie should I have a daughter I'd name her Desiree and I was blessed with a beautiful dark haired baby girl and her name is Desiree. She just turned 22.".

In Desiree Brando plays Napoleon Bonaparte and once again he's paired up with Jean Simmons the title character. Yes we all know Bonaparte married a woman named Josephine not Desiree so what's the story about? Daniel Taradash wrote a very interesting script with exciting passionate characters. The film lasts decades starting from Bonaparte's introduction to Desiree before he changed his name through the memorable Battle of Waterloo. As famous a figure as he was the film actually focuses on Desiree the woman torn between Bonaparte and JeanBaptiste Bernadotte. She's vivacious loving strong and smart. It's easy to see how the two very powerful men fell in love with her.The Oscar nominated costumes designed by Charles Le Maire and Rene Hubert are exquisitely beautiful and Alex North's theme is very nice. But with all the lovely elements in this film the best is the sparkling chemistry between Brando and Simmons. There's a magnet between the two it's incredible. If only they made more movies together or better yet enjoyed a long loving Hollywood marriage! Alas Jean was married at the time and I never read anything about an affair between them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Desiree is first and foremost historical romance not history and as such deserves to be cut some slack. Directed by the ever reliable Henry Koster who one year earlier had helmed the movies' first Cinemascope production The Robe it boasts a widescreen panoply of exquisite costumes sumptuous sets and gorgeous scenery guaranteed to give its customers an eyeful.The screenplay written by Oscar winner Daniel Taradash From Here to Eternity which follows the title character's infatuation with a young Napoleon Bonaparte from the tail end of the French Revolution to her complete rejection of him after his Moscow defeat is presented as a series of sporadic vignettes which move slowly sometimes tediously toward its final conclusion. And yet if you are able to accept the lack of action scenes and concentrate on the characters the film can be highly enjoyable.Despite what the star billing implies Marlon Brando's Napoleon is not the main player here the story is seen almost exclusively from Desiree's point of view but he is far and away the most interesting. Eschewing the great French military leader's putative habit of tucking his hand in his vest he is nevertheless able to capture the essence of the man with true conviction. With lowkey wellarticulated diction he presents his Napoleon as a driven individual with a penetrating brain tremendous powers of concentration unflagging energy and the ability to impose his will whenever it suits his needs. Less specifically he suggests a man with high standards noble ideals a love of France and a sense of honour. Assuredly a remarkable performance as far from Stanley Kowalski A Streetcar Named Desire as you can get.Desiree as played by Jean Simmons has more screen time than Napoleon and that may be the picture's weakness. Her story that of a young woman first introduced as a maid working in the family textile shop who becomes captivated by a young Napoleon he initially wants to marry her for her dowry to finance his own military ambitions is discarded by him and on the rebound marries one of his generals to become queen of Sweden is not particularly remarkable. Only when her path crosses Bonaparte's does the picture come to life. Yet Simmons as always fills her role beautifully with simplicity and charm. She was one of those young actresses of the '50s who could always be relied upon to bring her best to every part she played. Her long list of impressive credits which includes Hamlet The Robe Guys and Dolls Elmer Gantry and Spartacus is enough to put today's onehitwonder Oscar winners to shame.The cast is rounded out by Michael Rennie as General JeanBaptiste Bernadotte and Merle Oberon as the Empress Josephine. Both add dignity in their small but decidedly secondary roles.Despite the slow pacing patient viewers will be rewarded with a terrific payoff in the film's final eight minutes. It is the touching bittersweet scene during which Desiree and Napoleon meet for the last time and while not historically accurate it makes for great and moving drama. Napoleon has just recently escaped from Elba and is attempting to mobilize troops for one final effort to regain power in France. By now he is a humbled man the confidence and swagger he so readily exhibited during his initial rise to prominence eroded. Yet in retrospect he is able to justify all his actions In real life he was a great administrator as well as a great military leader. rightly or wrongly and laments the betrayal of those he considered his closest friends. Though beaten he still expects strict adherence to military protocol as when he surrenders his sword Please don't hold it like an umbrella.. Desiree though no longer enraptured by his charms cannot help but feel a rekindling of admiration for him and a pang of regret.Marlon Brando reportedly once said that he took on the role of Napoleon for laughs. I very much doubt it. He is just too good. I think he was trying to get back at critics who refused to picture him as anyone other than Stanley Kowalski.".

Made in the dark years before the feminist movement indeed in the worst days of the feminine mystique the film makers seem to assume that the ideal woman is warm impulsive kittenish flirtatious and yet nonsexual. Desiree is forever stuck at the end of childhood. She lives through great events but her womanly nature makes her ignore everything but her own physical comfort. She is Scarlett O'Hara without the suffering cruelty or ambition and Natasha Rostov without the fellowfeeling patriotism and mystical sympathy for others. It's odd how you feel enchanted by her and yet you feel disgusted with yourself for wanting a girl who remains infantile in so many ways. Truly a guilty pleasure.Some of the things Desiree says in this movie are beyond belief. For example after she becomes Princess of Sweden her husband suggests that she needs some tutors and she cries I haven't learned anything since I was ten! And like who is supposed to stand up and cheer? You could be the worst sexist pig in the world and this movie would make you feel like Anna Quindlen.Or take the scene where the Swedes arrive in the middle of the night and tell Marshall Bernadotte a superb Michael Rennie that he is now in line to be King of Sweden. Bernadotte tells Desiree his wife to hurry up and get dressed. Put on anything you understand? And she wails no no I don't understand anything! Some other comments have said Jean Simmons is whining in this movie. But it's much worse than that. She's really pure feminist Kryptonite! The whole point is that men find her irresistible because she always always plays dumb and does nothing but bleat about being hungry tired or confused.Problem is Jean Simmons is just so natural and so attractive that it sort of goes down easy. You really do find yourself wanting to hug her every other scene if you're a man anyway. If you're Anna Quindlen you probably just want to slap her. She's the feminist antiChrist.At least she's not a blonde!".

She had a very remarkable life and it SHOULD have been an exciting film though I found the movie to be very mannered and subdued...too subdued. As a result it is not an especially exciting film...and it should have been. It follows her from her first meeting Napoleon and moves up through he ascending the thrones.Dsire Clary is played by Jean Simmons Napoleon by Marlon Brando and her husband by Michael Rennie. The film is also sumptuous to look atwith lovely sets and in full Cinemascope color. What it does not talk about at all are the marital infidelities by Napoleon Josephine as well as Dsire's husbandall which could have made the movie much more interesting. So it's pretty but sanitized...and a bit dull because of this. It also just never sparked my interest at all and much of it is because the film is too episodic. Her life might better be told as a miniseries instead.".

Her character never really developed past girlhood. There was no chemistry between the two and the story just meandered along. Michael Rennie as Bernadotte had little to do.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film a number times over the years. Now it's available at YouTube. Previously I assumed Desiree was a purely fictitious character. Boy was I wrong! There's a lengthy article on her on the web. JeanBaptiste Bernadette also was a real person who did marry Desiree. In the middle of the Napoleonic wars he did switch from being a marshal under Napoleon to the heir apparent for the Swedish crown! Most of the things Desiree is pictured doing are reasonably historically accurate aside from accepting Napoleon's sword as a symbol of his surrender to the allies. Actually the real Desiree initially was engaged to Napoleon's brother Joseph who then switched to marrying her sister opening the door for Napoleon to become engaged to Desiree. He rather soon broke this engagement when he found Josephine who provided him with several advantages but could not produce an heir despite having 2 children from her guillotined husband. Interestingly Josephine's granddaughter later married Desiree's son who was king of Sweden!..... One problem with this screenplay is that Desiree is not really a very interesting person aside from her beauty and connection with Napoleon and Jean Bernadotte. A number of reviewers complained that Jean Simmons as Desiree was too often whiny or infantile. Well it happens that this was the way the real Desiree was. So I don't think we can fault Jean......Several reviewers criticize Marlon Brando's portrayal of Napoleon. Marlon rather looked like Napoleon. We was 5'9 compared to Napoleon's 5'7. But Napoleon actually was a bit taller than the average Frenchman at that time at 5'5. But  some of his guards were considerably taller making him look short. Whether Napoleon was deliberate as Brando portrayed him or quick and flashy I don't know......Merle Oberon makes a beautiful Josephine who doesn't have a lot of screen time.. Michael Rennie makes a tall Jean Bernadette who was considerably older than Desiree. There seemed to be little passion between them.....The screenplay is mostly an indoor affair with no direct contact with soldiers in battle. In one scene Napoleon is ready to begin the Russian campaign. In the next scene he's back home defeated. The film lacks any real action or passion. But I do commend it on it's relatively strong historical accuracy  being based on the novel Desiree.".

	schema:headline " Trigger Happy";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a tense little war drama from Columbia. The production values aren't much but they really don't have to be. Released in 1952 and directed by Edward Dmytryck it deals more with the personal than the patriotic. It is a WW2 drama that tried to find an audience during the Korean War. That couldn't have been easy.It deals with the interpersonal relations between eight war weary GI's stuck up on the line in war torn European town. The lead is an expat New Yorker named Bonar Colleano. He isn't well known in the states but he was a big star in England during the war. Always playing the wise cracking Yank. His colead is Lee Marvin. He plays the squad leader and the glue that keeps these dogfaces together. The cast is rounded out by Arthur Franz Dickie Moore and Richar Kiley. None of them big names in 1952 but all of them up to the job.We find this beat up group jammed in a cellar while one of them is pinned down in a foxhole by a German machine gun. The squad is told they will be pulled off the line and they have to decide if or how they are going to rescue their buddy. Each squad member faces his own moment of truth. Some show bravery some cowardice some indecision and one is just trigger happy and about ready to go over the edge.I like this movie but it does have a couple of problems. I mentioned the production values. It's a little set bound  almost like a stage play. Most of the action takes place in the cellar and the exteriors are stock WW2 war torn European street. The dialogue does get a little corny in spots. But the main problem I have with this movie is the basic premise. I can understand an isolated group of guys faced with the prospect of being pulled out of combat having mixed emotions about putting themselves back in harm's way to rescue a comrade but that's the dilemma. How could they in good conscience leave him behind? Besides this is an experienced infantry squad loaded with weapons. How could they not figure out a way to successfully assault a single machine gun nest. Despite these criticisms the movie holds up well. The characters are human  not cartoons.It's hard to find but if you're a war movie buff keep looking.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a tense little war drama from Columbia. The production values aren't much but they really don't have to be. Released in 1952 and directed by Edward Dmytryck it deals more with the personal than the patriotic. It is a WW2 drama that tried to find an audience during the Korean War. That couldn't have been easy.It deals with the interpersonal relations between eight war weary GI's stuck up on the line in war torn European town. The lead is an expat New Yorker named Bonar Colleano. He isn't well known in the states but he was a big star in England during the war. Always playing the wise cracking Yank. His colead is Lee Marvin. He plays the squad leader and the glue that keeps these dogfaces together. The cast is rounded out by Arthur Franz Dickie Moore and Richar Kiley. None of them big names in 1952 but all of them up to the job.We find this beat up group jammed in a cellar while one of them is pinned down in a foxhole by a German machine gun. The squad is told they will be pulled off the line and they have to decide if or how they are going to rescue their buddy. Each squad member faces his own moment of truth. Some show bravery some cowardice some indecision and one is just trigger happy and about ready to go over the edge.I like this movie but it does have a couple of problems. I mentioned the production values. It's a little set bound  almost like a stage play. Most of the action takes place in the cellar and the exteriors are stock WW2 war torn European street. The dialogue does get a little corny in spots. But the main problem I have with this movie is the basic premise. I can understand an isolated group of guys faced with the prospect of being pulled out of combat having mixed emotions about putting themselves back in harm's way to rescue a comrade but that's the dilemma. How could they in good conscience leave him behind? Besides this is an experienced infantry squad loaded with weapons. How could they not figure out a way to successfully assault a single machine gun nest. Despite these criticisms the movie holds up well. The characters are human  not cartoons.It's hard to find but if you're a war movie buff keep looking.";

	schema:reviewBody "Producer Stanley Kramer and Director Edward Dmytryk deliberately chose a cast of unknowns who later did move on to varying degrees of success in the film industry most notably Lee Marvin for the cast of Eight Iron Men. It's a tense situation for this squad in some small town on the Italian front in World War II. One of their number is pinned down by a machine gun and it's wearing on the nerves of the other seven. Especially when they get orders to pull back and leave him until replacements come.The film shows the tension on all of them. Lee Marvin with his war experience in the Pacific Theater is a natural as the concerned sergeant. Other good performances are from Arthur Franz Richard Kiley Nick Dennis and most of all Bonar Colleano whose career was mostly in the United Kingdom. This was one of the few American made films for the New York City expatriate.Eight Iron Men is based on a flop play on Broadway by Harry Brown which ran only 23 performances in 1945 and featured Sam Levene and a most unknown Burt Lancaster. Obviously someone named Harry Cohn didn't want to pay Lancaster's going rate in 1952 to get him for the screen version. Even without Burt Eight Iron Men is a well made war drama and should not be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "An example of that now nearly extinct oxymoron the quiet war movie. These were inevitably adaptations of plays. The theatre in the olden days before television 247 news cycles etc. once prided itself on being able to respond to current events and the significance of contemporary history. The WPA Theatre Project produced the Living Newspaper during the New Deal. After every war there were plays dealing with that war but unrecognizable from war movies because of the confined spaces of a theatre. The post WW1 period was particularly rich in war plays. This was the height of theatre and I guess the masterpiece of this genre was R. C. Sheriff's Journey's End.American Lawrence Stallings What Price Glory? and others also wrote plays in the genre. Playwrights responded to ww2 in much the same way. Again the restrictions usually dictated a one set play with maybe some change of scene in act two and perhaps a small adjunct set to play out some subsidiary action. These were later translated into films. EIGHT IRON MEN was adapted from a play and reduces the agonies of fighting a war to something like real time and a single human life. The classical unities of time and space are nearly totally observed. Remarkable for a war film. A eight man squad led by Lee Marvin Sgt. Mooney is quartered in the basement of a ruined house. A three man patrol comes back minus one man who is trapped in a bomb crater being swept by a fearsomely placed machine gun.The squad is due to be pulled back after 17 days on the line but are under orders not to go and rescue the pinned man. Captain Trelawny Barney Phillips aware of the heavy casualties of his unit doesn't want three men killed trying to save one I came up here with a company and I'll be lucky to leave with a platoon. The tension builds as it becomes closer to the time to move out and leave one of their buddies behind. That's it. Basically one set with brief forays into another set depicting a rubble strewn street being periodically swept by machine gun fire. There was some attempt at opening out by literally visualizing the suberotic sex fantasies of the men particularly Bonar Colleano Collucci Tonight I'll be whistling at every dame in the country. You can't keep a healthy guy like me stuck away like this for too long  I go crazy  I get hair on the palms of my hands  the beast rises in me. but almost all of the tension is provided in the dialogue between the men.' The conclusions reached reflect the hard bitten cynicism of men at war of being used by fate and of the connecting sinews which build between men at their extreme.EIGHT IRON MEN is no masterpiece but it is very effective drama just don't expect any of the usual visceral thrills which accompany most action oriented war films. There are no villains. The German's are never seen. The Captain is neither a sniveling coward nor a vain martinet who gets his men killed for his greater glory. Though he is aware his 'efficiency' is being scrutinized by higher ups he shows some repressed satisfaction at the recovery of the missing man. This is not the kind of film where the more knowledgeable in the audience can guffaw Aw real people don't act that way.This is merely a crumb in the vast shitcake of the continuing cruelty of a mankind which seems eternally waging war with itself. Its unfortunate that not only is there no more theatre like this but there are no more films like this nor even TV like this not since the 50s actually. It has all been replaced by 247 news and a whole host of too highly paid self advertising jackanapes entertainers under the guise of political pundits.".

One of the squad members Pvt.Smalls George Cooper end up stuck in a bomb crater with his fellow GI's tying to get him back not knowing if he's either dead or alive to safety and risking the entire infantry company by doing it.Realistic and gritty war drama with Lee Marvin in his first staring role as Sgt. Mooney as he together with the rest of his squad are willing to risk their lives to save the life of a fellow GI. Pvt. Smalls turns out to have been fast asleep with a twisted ankle and a shot of morphine in a shell crater and totally unaware of all the commotion that he caused. Defying orders from their commanding Officer Capt. Treiawny Barney Phillips Sgt. Mooney's squad refuses to withdraw giving the Captain fits with him on the verge of having courtmartial Mooney and the rest of his men if he didn't comply. It turns out that squad members would rather spend the rest of their live in the brig knowing that they did their best to rescue one of theirs a member of the Eight Iron Men then live the rest of their lives as free men not knowing that their inaction was the cause his death.There's a somewhat comedy bit thrown into the story about a fruitcake that's to be split up between the GI's and the last piece after the other even were given out to the men in the squad is left for Pvt. Smalls. That causes a lot of tension with the men not knowing if Smalls is even alive to eat it and at the same time wanting to eat the goodie themselves. We also have the usual goofoff of the outfit Pvt. Collucci Bonar Colleano who likens himself to be a modern day Casanova with the ladies. Since there's no women in the deserted burnt and blasted town we have a number of dream sequences put into the film where loverboy Collucci has all the beautiful dames that he can or even and that may be asking a bit too much of Colluccican't handle. Collucci is such a great lover in his own mind that he's even able to steal away the girl that fellow GI Pvt. FergusonJames Griffithhad just married in his dream! Thats something which I doubt that even the great Cassanove would be able to do on his best day or night.Sgt. Mooney and a number of his men going out to fetch the missing Pvt. Smalls are pinned by German machine gun fire and forced to retreat back to their defensive position. Just when he and his men are about to give up on ever finding Smalls Pvt.

Brown would later write one of the more classic episodes of Combat. Dmytryk noted for his action sequences was smart enough to concentrate on the play's extremely clever repartee between the members of an infantry squad who are marking time in the ruins of a destroyed town in Europe late in WWII. Squad leader Sgt. Mooney Lee Marvin has somehow managed to keep his group intact up to this point of the war. His goal of leaving the town with all seven of his men is threatened when the squad's most inept member Private Small George Cooper gets himself pinned down in a shellhole a few yards away from a wellprotected German machine gun nest. With orders to pull back the squad is torn between disobeying or abandoning their buddy to the Germans. Their decision is further complicated by not knowing if Small is still alive. Once this situation has been fleshed out Dmytryk builds up the tension as it becomes closer and closer to the time they must leave.By the end of the film you feel like you know all the six of Mooney's multiethnic squad members. There is a comedian Nick Dennis a hothead Richard Kiley a pragmatist Arthur Franz a cub scout Dickie Moore a warweary dreamer James Griffith and a dame obsessed gold brick Bonar Colleano. Much like Das Boot and Cross of Iron the members of the squad have shared so many intense experiences that they have become closer to each other than they ever were to their own family members. This makes their choice even more difficult.Like the best antiwar films Eight Iron Men is full of hardbitten cynicism as a group of humans try to maintain their dignity in an insane environment.

	schema:reviewBody "Eight Iron Men is a war film filled with familiar facesboth of actors whose faces you'll recognize but not their names as well as a few folks before they hit stardom...as well as one guy who used to be a very big child star back in the day. The plot is simple. While a group of eight G.I.s are hunkered down in the remnants of an Italian town one in the group gets pinned down by a German machine gun nest. The rest of the company want to try to rescue him...but they are ordered by the Major not to attempt this as he doesn't want to lose additional troops.The most interesting cast member is Lee Marvinplaying pretty much the sort of guy he really was during WWII. He's great...and it's one of his earliest roles. Additional interesting cast members include Bonar Colleano Dickie Moore and Richard Kiley. Colleano is a familiar face and he was an American living in Britain so whenever a British film wanted a stereotypical American they'd cast Colleano. Moore was a HUGE child star and member of Our Gang. And Richard Kiley later went on to great fame playing many roles on TV and Broadway. What these men and the rest of the cast have in common is that they weren't yet stars and were excellent at playing average Joes.The net effect of this film is an interesting psychological portrait of ordinary men stretched to the limits. You can see the best and the worst of some of the guys...but most just wanna protect their tushes and survive the see the end of the war. Overall it's a nice little low budget filmexcelling with realism and full of grit.".

What these men and the rest of the cast have in common is that they weren't yet stars and were excellent at playing average Joes.The net effect of this film is an interesting psychological portrait of ordinary men stretched to the limits. You can see the best and the worst of some of the guys...but most just wanna protect their tushes and survive the see the end of the war. Overall it's a nice little low budget filmexcelling with realism and full of grit.";

Our heroes need to contrast dark and light traits in humanity. Do they follow orders and abandon the sap or do the decent thing ignore the orders risk life and limb and try and rescue a guy who many of them think isn't worth the effort. The idea is sound but though much of the dialogue is interesting for the most part there is a palpable lack of tension. Richard Kiley as Carter should play a critical role but his lines are pretty lame and he is unconvincing. Verbal sparring between him and Lee Marvin is so one sided you're never sure what Carter is thinking about. The ending is also lacklustre almost as if there should have been another scene and they forgot to record it. Worth seeing for the performances of Lee Marvin and the sadly shortlived Bonar Colleano and for the curious daydream sequences but saving Private Ryan it ain't!".

Another key to Monsoon Wedding's success was how the camera told as much story as the actors and dialogue. Lingering shots on a character who doesn't seem part of the action revealed so much more than dialogue could.And the most amazing thing  this film was made in 30 days!! Couldn't believe it. Fantastic production values mind not like many other Indian movies I've seen. And downtoearth realistic not like Bollywood. Yes there is singing and dancing but in context not every five minutes!

Yeah I was confused sometimes about who's related to whom but from the rebellious teenage boy dreaming of being a chef to the bride with a secret lover to the Houston engineer come home for an arranged marriage to the complicated intrafamily obligations and past positive and negative interactions to cousins aunts and uncles who genuinely love each other  all are fully realized and completely believable being both very individual and very universal. Only a smidgen of a coincidence in the last moments of a too neat happy ending for a very sympathetic character mars the story but understandably the audience cheers at the end. A bonus is the wonderful use of Indian music  I have zero idea if it's folk or Bollywood music they're singing but the soundtrack is exotic and exuberant as the characters use it to liberate thoughts and feelings within the structure of wedding rituals with dancing as well. Stay through the credits as the ritual continues. I'm ready to go see it again any time I'm feeling down. originally written 3112002".

	schema:reviewBody "In Delhi the wealthy father of the bride Lalit played by N. Shah prepares an elaborate wedding. We meet his extended family arriving from as far as America for the wedding beginning with a formal engagement party 4 days before. Several subplots are followed Additi the bride has chosen an arranged marriage instead of waiting for her married lover to leave his wife. Ria her cousin has never married and is being pestered by all concerned. We learn that Ria's father Lalit's big brother has passed away and so Lalit is her fatherfigure as well. Dubey the wedding organizer becomes smitten with Alice Lalit's maid. As the days pass family joys and family secrets are revealed.I cannot praise this movie enough. First of all kudos to N. Shah for a sensitive complex portrayal that never for a moment feels like acting. Without handheld camera pretensions Monsoon Wedding nonetheless feels more like meeting a family at a big affair than watching a movie. It is real and intimate yet magical. All the performances are good Rajat Kapoor as an uncle with a secret is particularly powerful and bears a striking resemblance to a younger Donald Sutherland.We see Indian society as India sees it. My coworker Sreeman tells me that everyone attends neighborhood weddings that an average wedding has 800900 guests and his had 1200. Traditionalism matters but modernity matters as well. At one point Lalit and Dubey argue over the wedding tent should it be white the modern Western way or should it be colorful? Lalit demands color and Dubey orders the old kind. The struggle between modern and traditional ways is one of the primary undercurrents of the film embodied by Additi's choice in fact we meet her married lover as the host of a TV talk show discussing traditional versus modern ways.Another undercurrent is finding love impediments to love and choices about love. Additi Dubey Ria and another cousin Rahul all have barriers to overcome before they have a chance at happiness.But the main theme is family and this huge chaotic family is a wonder to behold. You can't always tell who's related to whom but you get the sense that they can't either and coming from a large extended family myself I know that's how it is. Family is everything to Lalit yet he communicates harshly with a son he doesn't understand and calls nephew Rahul idiot. Yet his love and devotion are clear and he is the real hero of this film coming through for everyone and stretching himself to the limit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching this beautiful film for the third time. The first time I saw it I really liked it. The second time I got more out of it and I liked it even more. I just finished watching it with the director's commentary and I can honestly say I had no idea how good this film actually was! It was shot entirely on location in just 30 days on a very low budget with a cast of 68 and only a handful of them were real actors! A great deal of actors who were originally cast in this movie pulled out at the last minute or didn't even bother to show up I guess that is the beauty of this movie though. Nair wanted to capture the essence of the Punjabi people in a true setting. She didn't want to go for the big elaborate sets where people spontaneously break out into a big song and dance number like you see in a lot of Bollywood movies. Nair wanted her characters to start singing because that is what they do. One of her comments compared Indians to the Irish as two cultures who love to use song. Throughout the whole movie you get such a feeling of reality as if you are a voyeur who is really looking into these people's lives. They are lying naked and vulnerable before us. The character of Alice really stood out for me. Tilotama Shome's talent radiated from her and I found myself wondering what other films she had done. In Nair's commentary the answer was revealed ZERO. Shome was an English Literature student in Delhi University. The scene wear Alice is pretending to be a bride like a child playing dress up is so simple yet so powerful and beautiful. I have a few reviews stating that Tilotama was miscast as the maid. That she was to elegant and self aware to play such a character however that is exactly what Nair wanted in the character of Alice. Nair wanted to make a statement about people. Our beauty and presence comes from within our soul not from our lot in life. Tilotama Shome can have a brilliant career ahead of her if she wants it. It is also worthwile to mention two more exceptionally powerful performances by Vijay Raaz who was a struggling actor before this movie as Dubey Alice's love interest and Shefali Shetty as Ria who has a dark secret that can ruin the binds of family These three performances were outstanding but the entire cast was incredible. This movie is definitely worth seeing but I really have to recommend you watch it like I did  more than once. It really is worth it.".

I had heard good things about it so I picked it up.I had no idea what to expect but between this and 'Bend It like Beckham' I think my new addiction might just be Indian cinema.  'Monsoon' is the story of a family celebrating the arranged marriage of their only daughter to a welloff and hot young man who has been working for the past few years in the States and came home so his parents could pick him a bride.  The bride is trying to get over a recent indiscretion with a marriedand famousman by throwing herself into the marriage though it seems pretty clear she would rather be anywhere else.  The film gives a fascinating overall view of the amazing intricacies of a traditional Punjabi weddingfour days of festivities!!while deftly presenting several dramatic and touching stories from the obnoxious wedding planner falling for the maid to the cousin who is trying to deal with having been abused as a child only to end up facing her abuser at the wedding.  The cinematography is gorgeous a lot of handheld shots give a strong sense of realism and what a color palette! Over the weekend I rented this I watched it three times and I'm going to have to buy my own.  Definitely an A picture.".

Indian Punjabi weddings are like that loud and colorful people coming in from practically everywhere weird uncles and aunties who just don't know how to mind their own business cousins coming in from abroad who have no clue whatsoever IITian settled abroad. This movie never fails to entertain me i must have seen it 20 times but every time i find something new in it. The most disturbing part was the issue of incest brought up. A lot of people feel it's uncommon in India but the sad reality is it's not. It's very common the thing is people hardly come out it's under the covers and we have to accept this reality. The wonderful part was a lot of people got to know about the issue and took notice. My father cries every time he watches the movie esp. the scenes related to Shefali. I loved Naseer's character he was like just another father cribbing over money spent on he marriage at the same time being the happiest man on earth and going to every extent to ensure a great wedding. Every character in the movie was well sketched in terms of having their own unique characters Dubeyji being this harassed wedding planner in love with the house maid that aunty from Australia who has her own story to tell the brother being a little anti social and a bit feminine according to the father which was really cute the relationship the mother who smokes in the loo the young cousin trying to impress the boy loud uncle. Shefali's character was beautiful her past and her present just gets twisted when the uncle enters the household and how she tries to protect her cousin. I have always liked movies which show strong human tendencies  human relationships and this was one of them. This movie was a huge hit abroad as well just because people could relate to the movie. It is everyone's story me ur's anyone's !".

And not just me! Many of my friends who spent a considerable time in Delhi at some or other point of their life agreed with me on this point. In the words of one of my friendsMonsoon Wedding is a documentary about Delhi.. For me it was thrilling to view the places near Jama Masjid where once I spent many afternoons at my friend's home and surely nor far from where Dubey's residence would be! after so many years. But then what can I do? We are like that only.This movie has some of the best Indian actors such as Naseeruddin Shah Khulbhushan Kharbanda and Rajat Kapoor in it. But the guy who beats all of them and steals the show is our Dubeyji Vijay Raaz. I had noticed him first in the movie Jungle where his portrayal of an almost silent had he taken Omerta by any chance? banditgang member was excellent but in Monsoon Wedding his portrayal of Dubeyji beat all these firstrate actors. I've been a great fan of Naseeruddin Shah for quarter of a century now but in this movie my vote goes to Raaz.The most striking feature of this movie is Mira Nair's ultimate attention to detail. I think this is also a major factor that adds such authenticity to the character of Dubey!. From the Hindu ritualistic redthread worn by Shah on his wrist it must be put for the movie Shah being a Muslim in real life or was it that his reallife Hindu wife made him wear that! to the pair of shorts worn by Raaz Nair  Co. has painstakingly paid enough amount of attention to details. A Dubey would surely dress talk and carry himself the way depicted in this movie. His choice of profanities are the most authentic that one would hear on the streets of Delhi. Alice and Ria also put very powerful performances!This movie took me back to Delhi and to the corridors of the Univ. I and Nair much before I for that matter! once walked on. Anyone who loves or plans to fall in love with Delhi should watch this movie because as Mauz once said Who would go away Mauz leaving the labyrinths of Delhi behind? Kaun jaye Mauz Dilli ki galiyan chhod kar?.Notes The following is in response to some of the comments by Western reviewers.1 Just because he addresses his nephew as idiot the bride's father is not mean and abusive this is just a term of endearment. I guess this is just a matter of cultural difference things that are accepted in the Orient may be completely offensive in the Occident and vice versa. This reminds me of the autobiographical note by the Egyptian born Nobel laureate Prof. Ahmed Zewail whose toally accepted and used in the Arab world figure of speech I will kill you terrified a classmate at Caltech or was it Berkeley?.2 Some people thought that the two guys sharing a bed when the young girl offers a kind of striptease show to the Australian guy was a hint at homosexuality it was not! I don't mean that homosexuality does not exist in India but it's quite common in India for people to share a bed when there's a shortage of beds especially when a number of relatives and guests come down for say a wedding to stay overnight and then mostly younger members of the family are pushed to share beds.. Note Robert de Niro and Hervey Keital slept on the same bed in Mean Streets but they were not gay either!3 Would the maid and the wedding planner be allowed to dance with the upperclass family? My Answer is I think yes! Most of the Punjabi weddings include Whiskeyalcohol in the menu at least for the important guests and once you have alcohol in your veins Universal Brotherhood Bhaichara in Hindi prevails. I in spite of not being a Punjabi or a Native Delhiite took part in such wedding dances myself at times and had seen with my own eyes such situations.".

Then there's a relative who is a pedophile and who has hidden behind a benevolent facade only to pry on the little ones of his own people. This is the first time I have seen such frank treatment of a troubled family who is very happy on the surface.The acting is first rate with outstanding performances by Mr. Shah as the father of the bride and his daughter Ms. Das. Not only that but Ms. Das has one of the most beautiful faces in the Indian cinema and certainly deserves to be seen anywhere with those gorgeous eyes of hers.The weakest part I thought was that of the romance of the party planner and the maid. I mean HELLO Ms. Nair do you think for one nanosecond this uppity family would have allowed the maid and her newly found love participate in the wedding party? I don't think so!The color of Delhi's streets the magnificent wedding costumes and the glorious background music are used with knowledge and a sure hand by Ms. Nair.

With all the melodies and enchanting choreography in the Hindi films her choice of a mediocre ChuiniriChuniri number is not only sad but shows immaturity in her knowledge of Hindi films.

Add to this a shifty contractor with a crush on the maid and the whole thing screams 'vibrant'!Of course at times this is all it seems to scream  and that's a bit of a problem because it is hard to really be consistently engaged by this rather freewheeling affair. The various strands vary from the amusing to the interesting to the inane. The problem is that the film goes for a collection of characters and story lines all around the one wedding and not all of them work as well as one another. It was still pretty interesting and become more cohesive towards the end but I was not as drawn in and impressed as I had expected to be  to be honest Die Hard was on the other channel and it was a real effort to ignore the luring calls of that great movie and stick with this.However what the film does manage to do pretty well is deliver a very vibrant film which for the majority of its running time gives a lively and busy impression of this part of India and is enjoyable mainly because its energy and pace. It is a little bit inconsequential for large parts and it made it difficult to stay with but the final third gets better and becomes more meaningful and involving. The film was billed as a Bollywood film but it is not really what I expected from a film placed in that band  however I was actually happy that the film ran under 3 hours and wasn't heavy with the usual songs that all sound the same to me. The cast also do better than the usual Bollywood lot and deliver the best they can with the material. Standouts for me were those playing the bride the bride's father and Raaz's PK Dubey  funny and sensitive!Overall this is a Bollywood movie for those that dislike Bollywood movies. The ensemble approach produces a sense of fun and a good but prevents it getting involving until the final third when I suppose it does come good. Despite these problems it is still colourful and fun and worth watching once for what it is.".

The same car gets wrecked about 6 times again and again. The one liners are a riot. The acting script and plot is too funny to even consider it legit. I'm surprised this didn't make the Rolling Stone 50 top cult film list. The music and score has that 70's whawha bowchickabownow sound right up until the end that is when it suddenly turns Gospel with Rosy his old lady and the doctor driving off into the night singing Oh Happy Days.

With the exception of Milland the acting is lousy and the script has howlers that you just can't believe ex when Grier's girlfriend first sees him with Milland's head she says Honey I know you don't like answering questions but HOW did this happen?.  Basically this is a very bad movie but in a good way.  The scenes of Milland and Grier arguing are truly funny and there's a very long at least 20 minutes but fun chase with tons of police cars chasing GrierMilland on a motorcycle.  Not even remotely good but fun.Another great line from Grier's girlfriend  Do you have two of anything else?".

With the exception of Milland the acting is lousy and the script has howlers that you just can't believe ex when Grier's girlfriend first sees him with Milland's head she says Honey I know you don't like answering questions but HOW did this happen?.  Basically this is a very bad movie but in a good way.  The scenes of Milland and Grier arguing are truly funny and there's a very long at least 20 minutes but fun chase with tons of police cars chasing GrierMilland on a motorcycle.  Not even remotely good but fun.Another great line from Grier's girlfriend  Do you have two of anything else?";

Yes every scene with the creature either looks like Rosey Grier with a plastic head on him or Ray Milland uncomfortably close for closeups.  But the film has a certain charm that is undeniable due in large part to its dated 70's style its corny almost pathetic dialogue its incredibly cheap sets and special effects and of course the entire premise about this two headed monstrosity.  Milland and Grier manage to keep straight faces throughout the picture as do the other thespians concerned.  No small feat believe me!  The chase scene of 14 police cars chasing the two headed man on a motor bikewhich last over 15 minutes is the centerpiece of the film and sets the mood pace and credibility of the film.  If you get a chance see this film and its trailer which is almost as good.".

That's funny. This is your classic blaxploitation film with most of the white guys being shown as villains in the film but just from a comedic angle. There are plenty of solid films of this nature but this is not one of them. This only serves to garner some stupid laughs from a stupid script. One of the worst parts of the film has to be the never ending chase. For what seems like and eternity Grier is chased by the cops on a dirt bike.

	schema:headline " One of the weirdest silliest and most underrated bad movies of all time!";
	schema:reviewBody "THE THING WITH TWO HEADS first of all is a comedy. It's is obvious that everyone involved in the making of the movie was well aware of what they were creating. This isn't an earnest cautionary tale like THE MANSTER nor a sensationalistic exploitation sleazefest like THE INCREDIBLE TWO HEADED TRANSPLANT. It is a movie that was created most likely when some filmmaker friends got drunk one night and started throwing the most absurd ideas they could conjure out on the table.To many seeing a Hollywood legend and legitimately great actor like Ray Milland reduced to starring in schlock like this XTHE MAN WITH XRAY EYES and FROGS in his later years must be sad but I don't agree. Milland chews the scenery with such relish I can't help but think that he had a ball making these movies. I can picture him sitting with his agent and saying Hey I won my Oscar I'm getting older I might as well have some fun. While Milland and Rosey Grier are far from Abbott  Costello or even Martin  Lewis the two have a certain odd chemistry that works well especially since their characters are supposed to be from completely different backgrounds.

Grier is no actor but that actually works in Milland's favor as virtually his entire performance is from the neck up.The movie does work as a bizarre allegory for racial relations but mostly it works as a goof. It barrels along at a breakneck pace with subplots involving everything from a twoheaded gorilla escaping and going on a rampage to or our heros infiltrating a BMX bike race while being chased by what appears to be the entire LA police department.If you're looking for logic or intelligence keep looking.

	onyx:emotionText "THE THING WITH TWO HEADS first of all is a comedy. It's is obvious that everyone involved in the making of the movie was well aware of what they were creating. This isn't an earnest cautionary tale like THE MANSTER nor a sensationalistic exploitation sleazefest like THE INCREDIBLE TWO HEADED TRANSPLANT. It is a movie that was created most likely when some filmmaker friends got drunk one night and started throwing the most absurd ideas they could conjure out on the table.To many seeing a Hollywood legend and legitimately great actor like Ray Milland reduced to starring in schlock like this XTHE MAN WITH XRAY EYES and FROGS in his later years must be sad but I don't agree. Milland chews the scenery with such relish I can't help but think that he had a ball making these movies. I can picture him sitting with his agent and saying Hey I won my Oscar I'm getting older I might as well have some fun. While Milland and Rosey Grier are far from Abbott  Costello or even Martin  Lewis the two have a certain odd chemistry that works well especially since their characters are supposed to be from completely different backgrounds.

I painted my macaroni red and glued it into a heart with Love Thy Neighbor etched underneath it in black crayon. My parole officer was so proud. Racism never pays and neither does beating your exwife over the head with a steel pipe. My favorite scene is the helicopter chase. It is in no way hokey or prolonged. TWO HEADS is the second greatest movie of the 1970s I would say the greatest but that title belongs to MITCHELL.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a documentary I recently watched called The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made this exploitation curiosity is proudly ranked 3 but even though it's a generally dimwitted and inept production I cannot possibly refer to it as one of the worst movies ever. It offers incredible amounts of fun laughter disbelief and astonishment and the film is unquestionably a delight for every cinema fanatic who's remotely into bizarre horror stuff. Veteran actor Ray Milland stars as the genius but slightly power mad greedy and discriminating scientist who managed to sew an extra head onto a gorilla's torso without killing any of them. So now Dr. Maxwell Kirshner thinks he masters the entire transplantation business and intends to use the method on himself. It's understandable why Maxwell is in a hurry seeing that an aggressive type of cancer is slowly rotting his entire body from the inside out. So basically he worked out the whole biggest breakthrough in the history of medical science only to save his own ass! The plan now is to recruit a convict on death row transplant the Dr.'s head on his body and wait approximately 30 days for the head to adapt to its new host before removing the convict's original head. Tiny little problem however the only available prisoner on death row is black and the old chauvinist doctor is quite racist. The con Jack Moss is also innocent of the crime he's on death row for and intends to use the additional 30 days to prove this regardless of the fact there's the cranky head of an old racist scientist breathing down his ear. The Thing With Two Heads is a clumsy mad scientist movie with heavy ambitions towards Blaxploitation cinema. Apart from the obvious thematic plot of a stereotypical black tough guy sharing the body with a stereotypical white racist there's also the extremely groovy soundtrack. The sight of the twoheaded person  I have no idea why they refer to him as things since he's clearly a person  is just plain laughable. The plot subsequently evolves into a strange type of action movie with Jack Moss escaping from the operating table to prove his innocence. There's a seemingly endless motorcycle race with numerous police vehicles fourteen to be exact getting wrecked and loads of crazy stunt work to admire. It's quite fun and all at least for a minute or three but surely they could have come up with something better than a 20 minute chase? Especially with this film's original concept? Either way in spite of all its shortcomings and missed potential The Thing with Two Heads is an interesting cult product from the early 70's and definitely recommended to tolerant fans of the genre.".

This film from AmericanInternational is a strange melange of genresbeing a horror Blaxploitation action comedy all rolled into one. And sadly it really does none of these genres very well.It begins with a rich racist doctor Ray Milland announcing that he's dying and only has a couple weeks to live. It seems that his body is dying and he has a crazy notion to graft his body onto a donor body AND eventually have the donor's head sliced offplacing him in total control of the body. Considering that this is illegal and immoral they decide to find a guy on death row. But the only available donor is the very large and very Black Rosey Grier. This is a serious problem not just because the head and body would not match but because Milland plays a very very racist man and he's not happy when he awakens to see his new body! Rosey isn't particularly thrilled by the new arrangement and instead of just sitting by passively until they saw his head off he decides to run away in order to prove he isn't a murderer as well as to get someone to remove Milland. In this escape scene the film degenerates to amazingly low levels of entertainment. The getaway seems to last almost a third of the film and looks more like an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard or SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT with its ridiculous police chase. It begins with GrierMilland AND a Black doctor jumping on the back of a mountain bike in a race. Grier's riding ability is better than that of anyone in the race as the others just keep falling off the bikes again and againleading to Grier et all actually winning the race!!! Then cops begin to give chase and in the process 14 police cars are totaled and the guys escape!! Talk about ridiculous! There's more to the film than this and it actually is occasionally funny I love the line the girlfriend says when she asks if they have two of EVERYTHING but in spite of this it still really stinks. But if you are a bad movie fan you actually might like it because it's THAT badso bad you will laugh along with itparticularly since the film never really takes itself very seriously.".

The difficulty of pinpointing what exactly the filmmakers were going for here has lead to the film acquiring a mixed reputation but it is a decidedly different scifi tale at least. As mentioned the comedy angle does not take off until rather late in the piece around halfway in and it is furthermore a good thirty minutes before the transplant takes place with the film going into glorious detail regarding its head grafting pseudoscience and how host bodies need to learn to accept newly transplanted heads before the original heads can be removed and so on. This early part of the film also features a twoheaded gorilla wonderfully crafted by Rick Baker. It is really only as the comedy angle starts to warm up that the film loses its way with prolonged racing and chase scenes when the better moments are the ones in which the Thing interacts with others including the African American's girlfriend curious if he has two of anything else !. If not a film that be unreservedly recommended the movie's strangeness alone might make it worth a look for some.".

Roosevelt Grier's career was hardly given a boost either.Ray Milland is a racist scientist who is slowly and inexorably dying of cancer. But whatever else he is he's a brilliant scientist who is experimenting with transplants in fact he's already created a two headed gorilla.The trouble with the experiment is that when the head from an old sick body is attached to a new body before it gets acclimatized to the new body the old head has to stay for a bit to keep the body alive.

If he wasn't so racist Milland might actually think of some tremendous advantages that Rosey Grier has.In any event Grier who expected to be off this mortal coil is just as unhappy having Milland right next door. Nevertheless he's going to take this second chance to prove he's innocent.Most hilariously bad scene in the film is Grier and Milland stealing a motocross bike and wrecking a race and demolishing 14 police cars in the process. I guess the cops were just freaked out by chasing a two headed man. In any event the town no doubt was named Keystone.Along for the ride is Don Marshall who Milland crapped all over when he took a job at Milland's place of transplanting business.

The mysterious woman shares her memories with the wife and gives her somewhat contradictory advice about how to deal with her complicated love life.La Femme De Nulle Part 1922  The Woman From Nowhere  is confirmation of the great and refined film style that can be seen in the films of Herr Louis Delluc. Alas there are very few such films as the great French film director died very young.On this occasion Herr Delluc constructs an exemplary oeuvre of early silent virtuosity typical of his exceptional work. La Femme De Nulle Part has a strong and imaginative film narrative wherein Herr Delluc uses numerous flashbacks to represent the different points of view of the three main characters. The mysterious woman's flashbacks illustrate the good times she had in the villa many years before. The wife of course must deal with her own adultery and we are also shown the doubts and sorrow of the husband away in Genoa on his business trip.The film is about loss and missed opportunities and skilfully uses outdoor scenery to help create an atmosphere of larger than life romance. Frau ve Francis as the woman from nowhere gives an appropriate performance under the supervision of Herr Delluc her husband.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must get to know an unknown Teutonic rich heiress.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

I also felt that Moss added another good performance that was similar to her soldier yet woman role from Matrix. The thought of not only oxygen but LIFE on Mars had not really been touched yet but it worked out greatly..think about it the actors can actually do their thing without having to wear a bulky space suit the whole time...it adds a lot of fast moving action and real drama to the movie. I also love Sizemore's performances. I guess if you like the actors and are open to a new kind of scifiaction plot you at least should give this movie a shot. I loved it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I avoided most of the Mars movies when they came out in the past 4 years because the reviews were mostly bad and none of the trailers inspired me. I eventually caught MISSION TO MARS on TV and I was glad I didn't see it at the movies or even rented it. But now I rented RED PLANET last night and I have to say that I liked it a lot. It's much better than the hokey De Palma movie. There are a lot of weaknesses in it but even with all it's faults the whole package worked.The problems with RED PLANET Val Kilmer is miscast. He doesn't seem interested in the story and his acting is lazy. He looks like a lost surfer dude on Mars. They should have hired another actor instead of Kilmer. Some characters were weak Stamp and Bratt. The designs of the ship's interior were a tad cheesy. The dialogue was sometimes terrible. And the story had some major holes in it like the idea that the ship's censors didn't detect the breathable atmosphere on Mars.But aside from those problems the rest is fun. It's a straight forward science fiction story. If you don't like that kind of story you'll certainly won't like this. It reminded me of ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS or PITCH BLACK in the way it respected the scifi themes and elements without watering them down for the audience. Tom Sizemore and CarrieAnne Moss are excellent in their roles. Some of the cinematography is excellent. And while the fx are uneven sometimes spectacular sometimes obvious the overall look of the film is always credible. And the ending is thrilling.If you like straight forward science fiction films like me you'll enjoy this movie.".

The movie is called Red Planet not Who are the People Who are Going to Mars to Save Earth? and we join the action in media res which means in the middle of things so character development is not stressed in the beginning.  Good grief.  People throw around scientific cinematic and character development flaws with the movie instead of trying to enjoy the suspense of this movie.You are stuck on the planet Mars.  No food or water.  Someone on the crew is already dead and another is a little sketchy.  You have a limited time to get off the planet your friendly neighborhood military robot has decided to play Seek and Destroy and something mysterious is happening on the surface of Mars involving tiny bioluminescent aphids.So imagine all of that and you will get an idea of what the writers and director wanted to recreate for the audience.  I liked this movie.  I recognize there are flaws in the movie and possibly the acting but honestly I thought it was a great premise.  Reminded me of the Greek myth of Jason and Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece.I would give the movie 4 stars out of a possible 5.  Before you write and tell me how inaccurate or misguided a moviegoer I am realize I have read the classic scifi adventures from the likes of Heinlein Clarke and Bradbury.

The others make it to the home base that had been built previously only to find it destroyed and all supplies gone. About to die of oxygen starvation Kilmer opens his mask to find they can breath. So the rest of the film is their dealing with one difficulty after another not the least of which is an ice storm with 115 mph winds and minus 53 degree temperature. One by one they expire but Kilmer gets to a 50yearold Russian module that had failed to fire and with a juryrigged old radio and 50yearold modem is able to download instructions to launch the ship.  He gets into orbit CarrieAnn retrieves him they finally kiss!Kinda cheesy in many places most of the science is very shaky some of the funny lines are clever others are stupid but as a SciFi film not to be taken too seriously it is fun entertainment especially on DVD with a good sound system. The Dolby 5.1 surround channels are used very well and the several blasts and explosions are very energetic. CarrieAnn only does one nude shower scene and it is near the beginning about 8 minutes into the film.".

If you are looking for mystique try Mission to Mars but if you want action or thrills then go with Red Planet.Set in the mid twenty first century Earth is dying and humanity has turned to Mars as a potential replacement. An unmanned terraforming experiment has been attempted according to the introductory narration Months later it appears to have failed so a group of astronauts are sent out to investigate. They are surprised and excited to discover not only breathable air but the existence of life on the barren cold red world. When their space craft shuts down however not only are they stranded but they become threatened by the malfunctioning of their navigator droid 'Amee'. These few individuals must survive to carry the news back to Earth which proves that man can live on the Red Planet.I think the story works decently as a nifty scifi thriller. Mars in this film looks quite convincing because the terrain closely resembles the photographs taken by the Pathfinder in 1997. The color scheme is made up of browns and tans rather than the over saturated red from Mission to Mars. Ret Planet was received better than Brian De Palma's movie and I can see why. Although neither of them are examples of great filmaking I would recommend them both.".

Last year we had Pitch Black which i thought was okay.........and we had Red Planet.Red Planet came with a reasonably large budget a really superior cast to Mission to Mars and absolutely great special effects.  The main story line in itself is not ground breaking but the sub plots within the film give the film its real grip!A crew of 4 astranauts and 2 science officers agree to board a mission into building a new home on mars through the aid of making it a breathable atmosphere through the aid of planting algae.Then in comes your usual suprises the spacecraft that their in hits critical conditions causing them to land on Mars earlier than they wanted to and therefore building a storyline of what they are going to do to get back to earth.The sub plot involving the crews relationship between pentigill who was a last minute choice for the mission is excellent.  Simon Baker plays the character excellently and you never know wether to trust him or hate him. The special effects on the robot AMEE were outstanding aswell this created the suspence part of the film.I gave this film 910 because i love scifi and i thought that it was well acted and had a really decent storyline.".

While that's not a bad idea I have enjoyed several films in that vein such as Independence Day films can become too dependent on that and that's when the fun drains away.Red Planet is a film that has solid special effects but also a strong story and good characterizations. It was the second film released in 2000 to have Mars as its backdrop the first being Mission to Mars. Mission to Mars despite having top starsmaster craftsman Brian DePalma directing and phenomenal special effects was a little too pat and resorted to cliches Not that I blame DePalma he did the best he could with the script he had and the film wasn't bad at allI didn't know anything about the plot and I think that helps with a film like Red Planet. It allows suspense to be created from the series of crises that spring up on the astronauts and that's a benefit. But I will say this the marketing campaign for Red Planet advertises this as your typical good guys versus evil aliens action fest. It is not. This is a more intelligent and stylish film than given credit for. It owes more to 2001 and The Black Hole or even the classic Republic serial Radar Men from the Moon than Alien. It is about ideas not effects and I LOVE films like that.I know a great many people will hate this film. That is because popular culture has brainwashed people into thinking mass entertainment revolves around effects only. There are some flaws mostly in technological probability and pacing in the first 20 minutesbut writer Chuck Pfarrer and director Antony Hoffman remember that great scifi is also about the story and characters and the result is the best scifi film in recent years.12 out of 4 stars".

The characters in here are neutral not really likable good guys but not bad guys either. Also to the film's credit the profanity is pretty low at least compared to most films today. Val Kilmer CarieAnne Moss Tom Sizemore and Terrence Stamp are recognizable names in here. I don't know if this film ever got its just due. It's better than the ratings you see here on IMDb.".

Guess the scriptwriters forgot that the entire reason for sending the crew was because the readings from the sensors said the O2 was dropping.  Hmm Mars inflicted amnesia?This goes on and on.  The escape aboard the Russian rock carrier was the only really funny part of the movie.  It takes an incredible amount of work to get a ship to have enough power to get into orbit wo killing everyone aboard. 1960 rockets killed the test animals inside..  So here we've got this old clunker that allows humans to withstand orbit velocity!   The air available in the spacesuits is also funny.  Early in the movie Gallagher has no air left.  All gone.  By the end of the movie he has enough to fly off into space.  The trapeze 'rescue' by Bowman at the end also makes a mockery of the laws of physics.PLEASE save time and money and take a nap instead.

The senior member of the team is fatally injured. With limited air supply they head for the prebuilt habitat. They arrive and finds it in ruins. Soon out of air all hope seem lost. But there are good news and bad news. The good news is that the atmosphere is mysteriously breathable. The bad news is that the team's robot AMEE on loan from the marines suffered damage in the landing too and turned to military mode. And she thinks the ground team is the enemy.Comment A really good scifi thriller movie where there are so few and only minor scientific goofs that it doesn't annoy or interfere with the story. In fact in some aspects it is really good. Also a lot of the scenery is really beautiful and given just enough time and space in the movie to show it off without making the movie dull. I also think there are some nice special effects and the use of them is just about right. And the sound effect when Gallagher first removes his helmet are really nice too. About the actors all more or less known they all do what are expected of them without making a star performance. Best is Sizemore who plays the only character with the right amount of attitude. There are one final thing i don't know if it is intended or just coincidental. In the movie there are two old probes one miraculously functioning it is American and an old that is malfunctioning. Of course it is Russian. I really hope there is no intentional meaning behind that fact.810".

I can still recall certain elements of Forbidden Planet' after almost 50 years and of course Alien' Blade Runner' and 2001.' Some of the Star Wars' visual noise sticks with many people. I even remember some elements from Mission to Mars' that I expect to keep forever like that amazing shot where we zoom into a ship through the window and then  in the same motion  around the astronaut and engaging in what he is doing. This outKubrick's Kubrick. Also our tour of the spinning disk.This film has many of the right pieces but none of them are used to effect. There is no impression made at all. The only setup that comes close is the scene where exploding bugs stream out of a body but it is not rooted in any imaginative context. Kilmer is not a bad choice his Doc Holliday and to a lesser extent Jim Morisson were lasting impressions. And not too many actors can actually do that. But here he is a man without tools. I wonder why any decisionmaker would invest in Ms Moss. She's as talentless as Sharon Stone.Creating that coherent alternative vision vision is the job of the director. I am convinced that there are at least a dozen directors who could take this same script and basic effects and make a killer film. Tony Scott for instance.

I just saw this film at a free sneak preview and although I already decided I wouldn't pay for it if I had to I figured what the hell.  They were giving out free soundtracks and TShirts to those that came so I was already in pretty good spirits about the movie.So the movie started so far so good.  My friends are asking me if I wanted to leave.  It was only 10 minutes into the film not enough time for me to detect anything wrong with a film...for me anyway.  About 30 minutes into the film I realized why it was free.  An hour and a half into the film I realized this thing was never going to end.  I was just waiting for it to end so I could leave.  Whatever the makers of Red Planet were trying to make fell flat halfway into the movie and shortly after that I realized it died and was never going to come back to life.  The rest of the movie wasted time and failed to excite or entertain me.I'm usually very patient with films so don't gang up on me and tell me that long films with very little action bore me because it's not true.  If Red Planet had something to say I'd be very interested and enthused.  Red Planet was lacking plotwise and although the characters received a lot of screentime I never really understood who they were.  I think they were trying to develop the characters after years of scifi films that go for the effects and overlook the characters.  Despite their efforts they failed.  On a technical note Red Planet is superb.  The effects and photography are very good and the aura of sound will knock your socks off!  However effects and sound are not essential to storytelling.  It's interesting that CarrieAnn Moss was in this film.  She hardly does anything and her lack of humor is never really explainedI don't know how I could've missed an explanation but I did.  Also she was in The Matrix another effects and sound bonanza.  However The Matrix had developed characters and it had a plot which is what made it work.I wouldn't call Red Planet a terrible film.  It's technically superb and they did try to make a good film.  And even if nothing happens in a film that doesn't bother me.  The problem was they forgot a plot and didn't know how to develop the characters.  Without those essential elements in a film it can make a film with a promise a long boring failure.".

Set in 2057 a divers team of astronauts travels to Mars to investigate human living conditions on the Mars because Earth becoming unlivable for human beings. But the conditions get bad and bad for them when they lands on Mars including a bad spacecraft's equipment and increasing tension among the crew members. Although the script of the movie is good yet there are certain things are unexplained. But as the movies is based on just images and articles provided by NASA one should clearly understand the idea. Recommended for those who love to watch sciencefic adventure and action. I give Red Planet 8 out of 10.".

The toughasnails damnmyordersI'llsavemycrew captain is a womanCarrieAnne Moss from The Matrix.   The grayhaired old scientistan underused Terence Stamphas turned to philosophy and religion where in the old days he would have been a hardheaded skeptic that role is left to biologist Tom Sizemore. The premise is that by the year 2057 Earth is so badly polluted that we are seeding the sands of Mars with algae to produce oxygen so that humans can colonize the red planet don't algae need water to live?but the algae have suddenly vanished from our telescopes.  So Commander Bowman and her crew are sent to investigate.  While she orbits in a crippled spaceship the five men including pilot Benjamin Bratt and Simon Bakerthe obligatory Guy From Brooklyn land on Mars in a suspenseful crash scene. I won't give away what they find but I will say the solution to the mystery is more like something out of a good science fiction novel than a Hollywood scifi movie.  There is life on Mars but it's not a typical movie monster.  But there is the expedition's robot AMEE which is damaged in the crash landing reverts to its original military programming and starts stalking the men like a rogue lion.  This leads to scenes reminiscent of another Val Kilmer film the underrated The Ghost and the Darkness. The premise may be farfetched but I thought the execution and resolution of Red Planet were exciting and  satisfying.  And yes guys CarrieAnne does get one brief gratuitous shower scene.  I haven't seen Mission to Mars so I can honestly say that this is the best Mars movie I've seen this year.".

This film is one of a dozen which depicts what will eventually happen to the inhabitants when those mistakes catch up with apathy. The year is 2025 AD and Earth has sent it's first planetary probe to the Red Planet. It's mission to discover why it has refused to sustain an artificial atmosphere. A team of six including a multifunctional multipurpose mechanical robot named 'Amee' is selected and sent. However as the ship approaches its destination an unexpected solar flare disrupts the carefully planned mission forcing the five man crew to eject prematurely to the hostile lifeless planet. Now begins an immediate and desperate objective to stay alive. Val Kilmer is Robby Gallagher the Machnical Systems Engineer who proves that when machines go bad it's important to have someone who knows how to fix or combat them. Benjamin Bratt is Lt.

Terence Stamp plays Dr. Bud Chantilas an engrossing astronaut who expects more out of the mission than mere science. Carrie Moss is Kate Bowman and Simon Baker is Chip Pettengill. The film is believable enough and the space crew's enemies are not confided to those expected. One they brought with them. The further one proceeds into the story the more harrowing the dangers become. ".

	schema:reviewBody "It is so easy for people to find excuses not to think.  Case in point people who see this movie all the way through and think it is a scifi film.  Obviously they weren't paying attention.  Just as the original Alien was not scifi it was horror and Aliens was not scifi it was action Red Planet is not scifi its a suspense thriller.This movie when viewed as a suspense thriller  which is what it is after all is great.  SciFi is merely a subplot here.The photography was brilliant and conveyed the vast emptiness of an alien desert beautifully.  Acting was great and the direction and timing was perfect  a great suspense thriller.It is just disturbing to me to see so many people call this scifi. Independence Day is scifi.  This is not.  If the action took place in a forest and they were being hunted by a bear trying to reach a helicopter no one would call it a nature film.  It would be called a suspense film. Seeing a space ship and technology and yelling scifi is a poor excuse for thinking.In any case nothing presented in this film is science fiction. Spaceships that travel to Mars in 6 months are not science fiction.  A spacestation is not science fiction.  Advanced robotics are not science fiction.  This is all real science.  Transporters and warp drive they are science fiction. Death Stars and Lightsabers they too are science fiction.  Films like Star Wars and Star Trek require an active suspension of disbelief.  There is no need for that here.  Everything presented in this film is possible with today's technology.  Was Deep Impact a sciencefiction film?  No.  It was a disaster film in the same vein as Towering Inferno or Earthquake.SO STOP CALLING IT SCIENCE FICTION AND WATCH THE FILM FOR WHAT IT IS A SUSPENSE THRILLER!!!!!!I just would really wish that people would stop making unqualified remarks. It is so easy to rip apart something you don't understand instead of taking the time to actually delve into the subject matter and give it fair analysis.  That said if you want to see a good suspense thriller this is it.  If you want to watch a good scifi movie check out anything written by Asimov or Bradbury.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this film Brenta engages a minimilistic realist tone to explore the alienation felt by the character to stunning and hypnotic effect.

The film's plot could on the contrary be easily shifted in any other environment  only the personal story of the main character Barnabo is inherited from the book. I don't know whether the director's purpose was to be realistic but honestly I suspect that on the contrary this film is just a missed attempt at poetry.

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone looking for a runofthemill film won't like this movie but it has long been one of my favorites and has become something of a cult classic.This was the same period when Sam Peckinpah was bathing movie theaters in Max Factor blood with his edgy oaters and some may have expected Paul Newman and Lee Marvin to deliver a gritty contemporary Western of that genre. Instead director Stuart Rosenberg Cool Hand Luke with Newman and Voyage of the Damned with Marvin walks us slowly and comfortably in wellworn boots through this quirky buddy film based on the novel Jim Kane by TexanArizonan cowboy and author J.P.S. Brown himself an interesting character.These two cowboy pals have unwisely agreed to transport rodeo cattle for sleazy oddball Strother Martin and Martin's shifty flunky Wayne Rogers who's equipped with a superb twang and the ugliest pair of highwater bellbottom pants in cinematic history. Both Martin and Rogers are all hat and no cattle in Texas vernacular but Newman and Marvin don't figure it out until it's too late.Blessedly both Newman and Marvin range far from the tough cynical personas that made them famous. Newman is a simple minded cowboy and Marvin is a pompously loquacious but harmlessly unhinged sidekick whose subtle paranoia is almost as interesting as his 1940s suit tie and fedora. Marvin's narrativelike observations and expansive body language rival his superb comedic efforts displayed in Cat Ballou.The modern cowboys are on what could be an allegorical tale of the last cattle drive at the ragged conclusion of America's hippie era. They are not driving beeves to the rail yards at Fort Worth for a hungry young country but punching stringy calves that will be roped at rodeos across the nowtamed Southwest. We're given an early clue that Newman might not be a movie cowboy in the John Wayne mold when we see the hectored Newman cajoled for alimony from his parasitic exwife and learn a herd of horses he purchased is infected with a venereal disease.He's still the lonely man of the saddle and lariat but he's living in the 1970s instead of the 1870s. Newman is not only softhearted but softheaded and his uncowboylike response is to be frustrated. This is a very interesting turn for Newman who was so taken with the character of Jim Kane that he purchased the film rights to the book.Characteristically the showdown of this film is not a gunfight between the rascals and the righteous but a comical encounter in a tacky Mexican motel room between the cowboys and their slippery employers. A television set Martin's snap brim hat and Rogers' dignity are the only casualties. We know the Old West is dead because the spiteful gesture becomes the weapon of choice against banal con men that once might have been evil land grabbing ranchers.Watch for superb character actors Richard Farnsworth Hector Elizondo and Gregory Sierra who provide good supporting performances in this film. The talented Terence Malick who stumbled recently in his disappointing Thin Red Line contributed to the script. Also take note of the carefully crafted portraits created by cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs. The final scene replete with a final inane conversation between Newman and Marvin at a tiny Mexican train station is beautiful in the dusty timelessness of the Old West.Not everything is explained in this movie including why Newman hates his nickname Chihuahua Express or the full story behind Newman's comically scary imprisonment. But not everything is explained in life and therein lies a message.Spend a quiet afternoon drinking in this visually interesting and very unusual buddy film whose seemingly disjointed vignettes imitate the goofiness of life rather than imitating textbook filmmaking. For those who watch and listen carefully this film is full of smiles. Newman and Marvin as a Western Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn even seemed to have fun making this movie.".

It works to a degree but unlike the other film the supporting characters aren't as interesting.Still Paul Newman who seems to personify a definition of insanity in that he keeps doing the same thing and expecting different results and his hustling pal Lee Marvin amble along in this film with such a degree of charm you can't help but like them.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not as bad as the previous reviewer would have you believe. It just takes a different kind of mindset to enjoy ityou have to like nonlinearality. You have to be in a relaxed maybe even comingdownoffajag state of mind to appreciate its structure.Paul Newman affable as always in the lead is not placed in any of the more familiar predictable and simplistic predicaments cited by my colleague  though if anything character study would come the closest to describing this film.But instead of an easy situationthe kind that makes us smug to be able to identify quicklyin this picture Newman battles ineffectually against a more subtle and insidious malaise one not often focused on in film in this manner. Its a common problemsomething we all deal with at one time or anotherits that type of confidenceeffacing willsapping egodraining personal economic debt that for many adults never really seems to go away.Just like the rest of us Newman's simply got an ego that wants to assert itselfbut at every turn he's being strung up by the shortandcurlies due to lack of . He keeps trying however. Still we see that throughout the film each new situation somehow gets away from him and leaves him with nothing to show for his troubles. He's just too nice a guy to come out a winner.He always needs more money than he's got and it affects everything he doesprevents him from really enjoying what might be an otherwise pleasant life. In the end he's forced to face that1 his troubles are maybe never going to be conquerable2 there will be a lot more of the same kind of humiliation he's undergone all throughout the moviethroughout the rest of his life and 3 despite this there are still some dividends in life that make things easier to bear like having a best friend a car that runs or just having enough money in your pocket to get a Coke.Its true the movie has an unsatisfying conclusionthe very human plot in this film just doesnt have a happy resolution coincidentally just the way reallife problems dont work out what a concept for a film right?.But the hangdog ending just like the rest of the film is somehow difficult to forget. It has such an unusual lowkey pace and rhythm that it really stays with you. I have seen it come up at least 45 times on the late show and never been displeasedits rather like seeing an old friend.Dont dismiss itits a movie that can cheer you up under the right circumstances.".

You have to be in a relaxed maybe even comingdownoffajag state of mind to appreciate its structure.Paul Newman affable as always in the lead is not placed in any of the more familiar predictable and simplistic predicaments cited by my colleague  though if anything character study would come the closest to describing this film.But instead of an easy situationthe kind that makes us smug to be able to identify quicklyin this picture Newman battles ineffectually against a more subtle and insidious malaise one not often focused on in film in this manner. Its a common problemsomething we all deal with at one time or anotherits that type of confidenceeffacing willsapping egodraining personal economic debt that for many adults never really seems to go away.Just like the rest of us Newman's simply got an ego that wants to assert itselfbut at every turn he's being strung up by the shortandcurlies due to lack of . He keeps trying however. Still we see that throughout the film each new situation somehow gets away from him and leaves him with nothing to show for his troubles. He's just too nice a guy to come out a winner.He always needs more money than he's got and it affects everything he doesprevents him from really enjoying what might be an otherwise pleasant life. In the end he's forced to face that1 his troubles are maybe never going to be conquerable2 there will be a lot more of the same kind of humiliation he's undergone all throughout the moviethroughout the rest of his life and 3 despite this there are still some dividends in life that make things easier to bear like having a best friend a car that runs or just having enough money in your pocket to get a Coke.Its true the movie has an unsatisfying conclusionthe very human plot in this film just doesnt have a happy resolution coincidentally just the way reallife problems dont work out what a concept for a film right?.But the hangdog ending just like the rest of the film is somehow difficult to forget. It has such an unusual lowkey pace and rhythm that it really stays with you. I have seen it come up at least 45 times on the late show and never been displeasedits rather like seeing an old friend.Dont dismiss itits a movie that can cheer you up under the right circumstances.";

Newman is a down but not quite out cowboy and Marvin is his hustler buddy. They try to pick up some quick cash by working a shady cattle deal. Strother Martin and Wayne Rogers are very good as a couple of fly by night businessmen that Newman has the bad luck to associate with. The scene where Newman shakes down Martins character is hilarious. Another great scene is when they tell some Mexican cowboys that they came to Mexico to buy some chili peppers. This is a true to life modern western with no six guns but its fully loaded with charm and real world insight. Great movie!!!! Good acting and writing throughout.".

As a study of such an everyman character Newman's performance is in my view superb. Marvin's performance on the other hand is a little subdued and below par but still there is a good chemistry between him and Newman in some scenes.

	schema:headline " Two Characters in Search of a Screenplay.";
	schema:reviewBody "The players in this comic character sketch deserve better than they got. First the story is confusing. Paul Newman as a naive cattle buyer in Mexico working for Strother Martin and Wayne Rogers is able to keep track of all his expenses in a little notebook but I got lost in the negotiations. Lee Marvin is Newman's pal guiding him through the vending process showing him around and exchanging philosophical wisecracks with him.Second the situations in which this richly talented pair of actors find themselves are just not very funny or engaging. At the end of each scene I kept waiting for the payoff and there simply weren't any. The movie itself abruptly ends in the middle of a conversation that I thought was part of the plot development. A freeze frame leaves the two men lounging at a deserted railway station with nothing to say no place to go and no money to pay for getting there. Everything is left hanging.And the two principal characters aren't particularly endearing. Newman is a somewhat shy but highly principled buyer. He brings the right kind of physicality to the part  his expressions and gestures  but he tries for a suitable vocal frame that just isn't there and he comes out sounding like an adolescent on a secondrate TV sitcom. What smiles there are in the film come exclusively from Lee Marvin. All right he's played sleazy characters before but he's introduced to us lying in bed in a shabby Mexican hotel his trousers down around his rear end suffering from a horrific hangover. And he underplays it this time. Well underplays it for Lee Marvin anyway. You'd be doing me a favor he tells Newman if you'd just put a bullet through my head. When he tries to wash his face he reaches blindly for the soap and grabs a pigeon instead and his hands and fingers flutter alarmingly as if at the approach of death. Newman and Marvin work well enough together. It's just that they're given nothing much to do nor has the dialog any sparkle.Many of the scenes just look pointless. They herd the cattle to Hermosillo and at night Newman claims he hears someone nosing around the animals and cursing. He borrows Marvin's Luger steps into the bushes and fires a few shots into the air. The next day Marvin lets one of their vaqueros sniff the barrel and remarks that it's just been fired within the last few hours. What's the point of the scene? To scare the vaqueros into thinking that they'll be shot if they try to run off with a cow or two? If that's it it gets as lost as the rest of the script. If this is an attempt to coast along on the notion of bringing Newman and Marvin together  as Newman and Redford had been together in the blockbuster Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  it doesn't work. Butch and Sundance had a story to tell and a gotohell anachronistic wit in its script. Stuart Rosenberg's direction Cool Hand Luke is pedestrian here.The photography by Laszlo Kovacs is colorful and evocative. The score by Alex North and others is all over the place  Carole King Burt Bacharachish a wistful solo harmonica and Dixieland. The meandering script is by John Gay and Terry Malick. Meanders aren't in themselves to be objurgated. Malick wrote and directed Badlands an episodic film filled with non sequiturs that was in its quiet way superb. But again while Badlands had a beginning a middle and an end Pocket Money seems all middle. Everyone here seems to have enjoyed themselves on a Mexican vacation but the resulting film has only a slight charm.".

I like Rogers but I didn't buy into his performance for even one second. The cast was not enough to save this Turkey in any manner.The dialog was horrible. The story just never seemed to developnor finish. There were 3 scenes with women. Only the scene with the ex wife did anything to advance the story and that scene was lame.Cinematography? Mostly too washed out. There was one scene in the moonlight that was hilarious. We see him in what appears to be moonlit moment. Cut away then right back to him and the lighting looks like midday.Carole King did the opening song. I suppose her singing would have fit with what they wanted this movie to be. The rest of the score was interesting but incongruent. Sometimes sounding like Mike Post sometimes western some times folk or Mexican.I gave this 2 stars.

	schema:headline " Pointless But Pleasant Pairing of Paul Newman  Lee Marvin in a Contemporary Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman pairs up with Lee Marvin in Cool Hand Luke director Stuart Rosenberg's lightweight but quirky contemporary western comedy Pocket Money with Strother Martin Wayne Rodgers and Hector Elizondo. This curious character study concerns a nave but honest smalltime livestock wrangler played by Newman who heads down to Mexico to round up rodeo cattle for a couple of shady types. Along the way our simpleminded hero hooks up with his harddrinking American friend played by Marvin who hangs out below the border. Together they encounter a series of hardships as Newman rounds up his cattle and brings them north to the border. Newman and Marvin make an odd couple in this innocuous movie that benefits from Laszlo Kovacs's firstrate cinematography. Pop music star Carole King warbled the title tune that came out on the flipside of her 45 RPM release of Sweet Seasons. The key to understanding Pocket Money which is entertaining but uneventful is the writer. Terry Malick before he acquired a reputation as an avantgarde director of Badlands Days of Heaven The Thin Red Line and The New World penned the screenplay for this aimless but amiable saga from John Gay's adaptation of fifth generation Arizona cattleman Joseph Paul Summers Brown's novel Jim Kane published in 1960. Malick's screenplay ends suddenly and leaves you wondering what happened after watching this twosome tie into some nutcases for 102 minutes. Newman plays the kind of character who sometimes has to turn around in a complete circle before he can make up his mind about a decision. He speaks with a peculiar lisp. Indeed he isn't the brightest bulb but he is hopelessly honest to the point of lacking tact. At a carhop hamburger restaurant Kane's exwife tells him that he is a 'baby' in a none complimentary tone and that she cannot afford to hang out with a 'baby.' You know when he is heading for trouble long before he realizes that he is knee deep in it. This movie drips with dramatic irony. No Pocket Money isn't a mainstream movie and it certainly doesn't qualify as 'an important work of cinematic art.' Jim Kane Paul Newman discovers as Pocket Money opens that the 30 Appaloosa studs and mares that he has rounded up must be placed in quarantine for six weeks because they have dourine the equivalent of venereal disease for horses. Kane has a bank note due but the banker has enough faith in our hero to give him an extension with neither an argument nor a lecture. Okay he does give Kane some advice that he should have bled his livestock before he crossed the Mexican border with them. Kane appreciates the advice. Kane's Uncle Herb Fred Graham of Arizona Raiders offers to hire him to do his stock auction bidding while Kane waits for the quarantine to elapse. Kane knows nothing about bidding and turns down Herb's solid job offer of work. Kane gets a tip in a bar from a questionable friend named Stretch Russell Wayne Rogers before starred in TV's M.A.S.H. about a cattle deal. Stretch introduces Kane as 'the Chihuahua Express' to an Amarillo rodeo buyer Bill Garrett Strother Martin of Cool Hand Luke who needs 250 twoyear old rodeo cattle. Uncle Herb doesn't think favorably of either Stretch or Garrett and warns Kane that they may be crooked. Kane ignores Herb's advice and follows his first impression. Garrett gives Kane a wad of cash and a bank draft and they agree to meet in Hermosillo Sonora. Kane drives across the border in his pickup truck. Kane looks up his old friend Leonard Lee Marvin of The Dirty Dozen and Leonard tries to keep his friend out of trouble while in Mexico. Leonard arranges a deal between Juan Hector Elizondo of Cuba and Kane for stock pens to hold the cattle. Kane and Leonard tool around in Leonard's old 1960's red Buick convertible make the rounds to find suitable livestock and haggle with the owners. At one ranch Kane meets a woman named Adelita Christine Belford and they walk around a sunset but nothing appears to happen romantically between the two of them. At one point Kane argues with a Mexican worker Chavarin Gregory Sierra and fires him. Later when Kane and Leonard come back to Leonard's hotel room Chavarin jumps Kane and they tangle briefly doing more damage to the furniture than each other. Chavarin happens to be related to the local police chief and the authorities put Kane in jail when he refuses to pay off Chavarin. Leonard bails his buddy out of a Mexican hoosegow by selling Kane's pickup truck. Afterward Kane learns from Stretch that Garrett wants him to bring the cattle in a different way. Kane warns him that the Mexican authorities there will impound his cattle for ticks. Stretch assures Kane that Garrett has a fix put in and Kane will encounter no problems. Guess what happens? Altogether Pocket Money is just small change. Newman is excellent as an eccentric cattleman with an impeccable reputation and Marvin is subdued as his pal with some really strange ideas such as selling colored salt. Veteran western stuntman Richard 'Diamond' Farnsworth has a brief walkon role when he informs the Newman character about his diseased horses. Where'd you get those horses from a cathouse? Director Stuart Rosenberg and scenarist Malick never really let us in on the sly joke that this movie constitutes. We sit back and watch these guys and a lot of other guys make fools of themselves. No Pocket Money possesses a plot but it has no point. You feel like you've been cheated for caring about a couple of fellows who get screwed in the long run.".

The script is by Terrence Malick yes that Malick it was his first official Hollywood gig after all so he had to pay at least one due and it offers some keen oneliners some that are very subdued in the sense of humor and an opportunity for an actor to play it how he will. It's also akin to what's weaker about Malick a little flimsy and aimless on plot and more about atmosphere of the situation. If Malick were directing it it might resemble one of those mythic modern westerns. Under director Stuart Rosenberg of Cool Hand Luke who isn't an eccentric geniusartist filmmaker like Malick but a sturdy craftsman it's a lot more simplistic and ultimately isn't about much except two skickers looking to buy some cows and get paid the money deserved.But as it stands Paul Newman and Lee Marvin even without the greatest material can act the pants off of it and Newman somehow makes his character amiable and cool when not seeming to have it all upstairs except for livin' in the moment kind of thinking. Marvin fleshes his character out a bit more than Newman perhaps because frankly he's more of the comic relief however in slight and clever ways watch as he is washing up and almost uses a pigeon to dry his face or his rambling dialog when he and Newman are sitting atop the train. By the time it ends we might not feel like it can go much else and it ends on a somewhat though surprisingly good ambiguous ending. But there's also the feeling that a lot has gone on a lot of wheeling and dealing and almost nearing insight into the condition of greed and doublecrossing in men. Almost.

Where's the humor andor intrigue with that plot line? When the only semi interesting part of the film is Elizondo  Sierra two US citizens of Puerto Rican descent playing smarmy Mexicans you've got real problems in a movie with 2 stars as big as Newman and Marvin.

Rancher Jim Kane Newman is having some seriously bad luck and is broke. However a guy with a shady reputation Strother Martin wants to employ him to go down into Mexico in order to buy some cattle. Once he arrives in Mexico he meets up with his old friend Leonard Marvin and the two try to purchase cattle. However LOTS of complications arise and a seemingly simple job turns sour.Pocket Money is a very slow film that appears as if it was made up as the movie was being filmed. Sure it might have had more to the script than that but it sure didn't look like it did. But with some actors especially Paul Newman I can live with this. Certainly not among the actors' best but a decent timepasserplus you get to see Lee Marvin riding a horse while wearing a suitand you can't see that every day.By the way a couple songs including the title song are sung by Carole King. I really don't think these fit the movie well as her style of singing and voice seem odd in a film set in Arizona and Mexico among cattle.".

The live and acoustic performances were fun to watch and the parts where the recording process was shown were very informative and interesting. Some of the video quality was not very good but the graininess and rough sound only made it all the more real. There was some humor and weird behavior by people but the seriousness of the rest of the videos more than balanced it out. One listen to the commentary though was enough for me it was basically the band members laughing and cracking jokes.

On the contrary this was a superb film that has for those willing to look beneath the surface a much deeper story to be told.Simply put the film is not 'feelgood'. The subject matter is disturbing and challenges one's view of religion and belief in the existence of God and Satan.As we are taken through the film the director immerses us in the world Maya Larkin played very well by Winona Ryder a person who has previously been demonically possessed. She discovers that a semifamous author Peter Kelson played by Ben Chaplin is about to become the antichrist incarnate and obviously sets out to prevent this event.The plot develops slowly but inevitably. Excellent use of sound and lighting create a chilling atmosphere in which it becomes difficult to separate reality from the horrors which the victims have to face. As we approach the climax of the film things start happening faster and faster and the plot becomes intentionally a bit confusing. As an audience we are made to empathize with the lead characters as they realise time is running out and their course of action remains unclear and that all they can do is ride along and try to figure out what is happening before it is too late.The themes drawn upon in this film are very similar to those in End of Days but with far more emphasis placed on the psychological drama  more like Stigmata  than on the action and special effects of End of Days making Lost Souls in my opinion a far better film.Be prepared for a major plot twist at the end. The director does not state the obvious yet we are given clues throughout the film many of which make little or no sense at the time they are portrayed but which snap into place if you get the ending. The sudden conclusion and lack of any final explanation communicate the intent clearly enough and left me feeling a bit blown away  although in my opinion left most of the audience feeling confused and let down expecting more and wondering what happened.If you can appreciate a well crafted and subtle film and prefer a movie that makes you think and does not necessarily have happy messages then you should enjoy this film. It forces you into thinking about it and by no means classifies as light entertainment. If you go to movies to be entertained by action and easy to follow plots then stay clear  this film was never intended to appeal to most people.Personally I have seen far too many of those films in recent months and found Lost Souls to be remarkably refreshing.".

Hollywood disappoints yet again!Winona Ryder plays a troubled young woman who believes that Satan is planning on being reborn in human form and kicking some Christian ass. Ben Chaplin plays a crime writer who Winona thinks is the Devil in waiting. Instead of just shooting him and doing the world a favour she forms an uneasy relationship with him. What exactly she plans on doing is hard to say. That's the whole problem with this movie. The 'Se7en'esque visuals are more important than a decent script. The characters motivations don't really make sense and as soon as the plot looks like it's going to go is some kind of interesting direction it doesn't. After a certain point you give up even caring what happens surely a bad sign in a movie where the whole fate of mankind is at stake?!Ryder used to be effective as alienated teens back in the late 80s in favourites like 'Beetlejuice' and 'Heathers' but lets face facts movies like this and 'Girl Interrupted' show how limited her range really is. She hasn't grown as an actress and is basically just not believable.Ben Chaplin showed some flair for light comedy in 'The Truth About Cats And Dogs' and had a few outstanding moments in Terrence Malik's wildly uneven and overrated 'The Thin Red Line' but he fails to interest here. Ryder and Chaplin don't show any on screen chemistry or rapport and this sinks the movie even further into terminal boredom. The talented character actors in the supporting cast  John Hurt Kevin Baker Hall Elias Koteas John Diehl  are all wasted by the dull and cliched script. Add to that one of the most anticlimactic endings in recent memory and you've got yourself one lame thriller that is a real lost opportunity.If movies about Satanism demonic possession Occult conspiracies andor TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt are your scene avoid this snoozefest and go straight to 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Exorcist' both stylish AND genuinely scary classics. After that try the hugely overlooked 80s supernatural Demi Moore flick 'The Seventh Sign' and the more recent Christopher Walken vehicle 'The Prophecy' or the fantastic Spanish comedyhorror 'The Day Of The Beast' both from the mid90s. These movies all feature more intelligence originality and suspense than 'Lost Souls' could ever dream of having.".

The cinematography alone should warrant a rating of at least 5. This is a subtle religious horror flick that I have to assume people rejected because of the lack of scares and gore. However the performances direction and cinematography are all top notch. Though Lost Souls was marketed to look like a demonic scarefest I would compare this film to the likes of The Exorcism of Emily Rose. In fact I would not be surprised if the makers of that film borrowed quite heavily from this one both in style and effects. The premise is relatively simple A small religious sect believe the coming of the antiChrist to be near sitting dormant in a human body. The biggest praise that I can bestow upon this film is that over 12 years later this film still looks like it could have been made yesterday. In fact it looks uncannily more modern than a large majority of recent horror efforts. Lost Souls simply does not age. Another popular factor in why this movie is so poorly rated and received is the fact that audiences just did not like the ending. I feel sorry for those that do not. The ending is original and though it did not satisfy blood thirsty Hollywood horror fans it is very much appropriate for this film. To put it simply without spoiling anything faith is the central core to Lost Souls those with it and those without. That is what this ending plays off of and I think it's perfect. Please do not let any of these negative reviews divert you from seeing this film. This is not End of Days or Stigmata. Lost Souls is not camp in the slightest. It is a dark beautifully shot and well acted film that is significantly ahead of it's time. 710".

You don't know anything about the characters or what's going on and that makes it a little frustrating but you can forgive the movie for that. Unfortunately the movie becomes less scary the more the silly plot and characters gets revealed. Probably the silliest moment comes when Winona tells Ben that he fits the profile for the antichrist because he's never been baptized. It is hard to see how Winona Horowitz could say such a thing with a straight face.Apparently the first time director is a great cinematographer. That is usually not such a good thing. Yes Stanley Kubrick did make the transition but most cinematographers are too concerned with the lighting and have no idea how to direct actors. That turns out to be the case here where everybody is just doing monotone line readings.I confess my love for Winona but even her presence only makes the film barely watchable and not quite enjoyable or fun.".

It leaves room for a sequel Lost Souls 2. Winona Ryder and Ben Chaplin are the two main characters. It is difficult to imagine Winona Ryder as a champion of Christ to save the world from the new Devil. There is no room for chit chat for movie watchers.

This no doubt explains why in Kaminski's LOST SOULS the cinematography seems to be the most important aspect of the production . Things like narrative drive  performances etc seem to have been sacrificed in order to bring moody  atmospheric sepia stained cinematography to the screen . I will give Kaminski some credit because he has made a brooding film even though audience members might spend the first third scratching their head asking themselves where this is all heading  and the editing is very good with a very impressive scene where street lights reflect upon Peter Kelson's car windshield as he drives under them Like nearly every single horror movie ever made it's the gaps in logic that lets the film down . Maya Larkin washes her hands in a public toilet  hears a sound behind her and calls out if anyone is there . Duh  it's a public toilet and members of the public use public toilets so why should Maya be concerned that someone might be in a cubicle ? It's almost like the character knows she's in a horror movie . Likewise why should the audience be concerned that Peter Kelson has a rude Jewish woman as a neighbour ? If he had a polite easy going Jewish neighbour I think that would be something out of the ordinary ! And the movie is full of these scenes that are somewhat bizarre where common sense prevails  I mean a bunch of priests being allowed to turn up at an insane asylum in order to carry out an exorcism ! Credible when you think about it ? I don't think so There's also two additional problems with the movie  neither of which have anything to do Kaminski . First off is you're reminded of other movies that feature Satan in all his forms and alas some of them like THE OMEN are far better than this but it's no better or worse than END OF DAYS either . Secondly much of the premise revolves around how seriously the audience can swallow the idea of Satan coming to Earth . Nigel Kneale used this plot in a brilliantly inventive way in QUATERMASS AND THE PIT but the concept used here is laughable if you're an atheist or the satanic equivalent of one and hence the film lacks credibility".

	schema:reviewBody "Maya Larkin is the assistant of an exorcist priest. One day she deciphers what she thinks might be a code in the revelations of one of the possessed victim she interacts with. A code that may lead to unveiling the identity of the man about to become the antiChrist.I remember seeing this movie at the time it came out and being terribly disappointed and frustrated because there were flashes of brilliance beneath all the crap. The perspective of seeing the first movie directed by one of the greatest cinematographer of our time Janusz Kaminski was enticing for any film buff. Furthermore it was around the turn of the new millennium and so a lot of horror and occult movie fans were waiting to see a great film tackling those genres. It just seemed... topical. Unfortunately we were treated to several attempt who all flopped and Lost Souls was one of the worst tries.At the heart of every movie is a story and here the writers have done an awful job. A bunch of amateurs wouldn't screw up this bad. Who opens up a movie with a fictional quote from the bible? What kind of awful writer can't come up with genuine material from such a huge book? But here the writer have come up with an awful story that goes like this. Satan is going to possess a man born of incest on his 33rd birthday. Wow. The central character in the story is Maya Larkin played by Winona Ryder. I was never a big fan of Ryder but recognize her appeal as a generation X icon. But this role probably was the final nail to her declining Alist status. Larkin is a poorly written character that doesn't make any sense. She doesn't act like a real person nor does her presence around people of the church feels remotely believable. I think Ryder could have done better here but certainly she started at a disadvantage due to writing. Opposite Larkin is Peter Kelson a writer who specializes in demystifying the mind of serial killers. This secondary character is less sketchy and comes alive thanks to actor Ben Chaplin. At the time the movie was shot Chaplin was an unknown actor. This was on the heels of his role in the acclaimed Thin Red Line. I must say that Chaplin's performance is one of the few redeeming qualities of this movie. He is always believable and his acting in the final scene is what makes Lost Souls still memorable to this day. Surrounding these two characters are a bunch of nonsensical characters who act pretty like pawns. Most are played by crappy actors although we get two amazing veterans as well in key roles. Philip Baker Hall and John Hurt are wonderful actors but here they had nothing to work with. Their characters are sketchy incongruity abounds and it looks like they mailed their performances. Aside from Chaplin's performance the other saving grace of this film is the cinematography but here we have a mixed bag. Many scenes of exteriors and interiors have a jawdropping beauty and ethereal quality to them. This movie it must be said has aged very well in this respect. There's a timeless quality to the cinematography that is certainly due to director Janusz Kaminski. One of the main person responsible for the look of several Spielberg movies among others. Many scenes are delightful and atmospheric. However this is a mixed bag. Every scene where tension should be present pretty much flops. For instance all the exorcism scenes are awful. And seem to come straight from a FOX occult show like the XFiles using black and white image and devoid of absolutely any impact. You never feel scared. Worse it doesn't even feel tensed. As a viewer you just sit there and remotely watch was is happening. Kaminski is also totally unable to film kinetic scenes. Any scene where a car bumps into something or people draw knives or guns is sketchy unfinished amateurish and devoid of any life. Much has been said of plot twists within the film. You can read about those in the Lost Souls forum on IMDb but really none of the theories hold of to any scrutiny. What we have here is not ambiguous writing with possible twists but just plain bad writing. The final scene impacted me as a viewer but can't save a movie that has a nonsensical plot that isn't even remotely based on genuine religious history. It's just made up stuff by awful writers turned into a movie y a first time director who was way over his head. It's still heartbreaking because there are things Janusz Kaminski obviously excels at but the overall direction of a film was too much at this point. Maybe a more solid script would have helped him. Since then Kaminski has been back to his cinematographer gig alongside Spielberg. He never directed a movie again but here we are ten years later and it appears his next directorial effort is in production. Hopefully he learned from the previous experience!Avoid Lost Souls at all costs or skip to the final scene.".

The central character in the story is Maya Larkin played by Winona Ryder. I was never a big fan of Ryder but recognize her appeal as a generation X icon. But this role probably was the final nail to her declining Alist status. Larkin is a poorly written character that doesn't make any sense. She doesn't act like a real person nor does her presence around people of the church feels remotely believable. I think Ryder could have done better here but certainly she started at a disadvantage due to writing. Opposite Larkin is Peter Kelson a writer who specializes in demystifying the mind of serial killers. This secondary character is less sketchy and comes alive thanks to actor Ben Chaplin. At the time the movie was shot Chaplin was an unknown actor. This was on the heels of his role in the acclaimed Thin Red Line. I must say that Chaplin's performance is one of the few redeeming qualities of this movie. He is always believable and his acting in the final scene is what makes Lost Souls still memorable to this day. Surrounding these two characters are a bunch of nonsensical characters who act pretty like pawns. Most are played by crappy actors although we get two amazing veterans as well in key roles. Philip Baker Hall and John Hurt are wonderful actors but here they had nothing to work with. Their characters are sketchy incongruity abounds and it looks like they mailed their performances. Aside from Chaplin's performance the other saving grace of this film is the cinematography but here we have a mixed bag. Many scenes of exteriors and interiors have a jawdropping beauty and ethereal quality to them. This movie it must be said has aged very well in this respect. There's a timeless quality to the cinematography that is certainly due to director Janusz Kaminski. One of the main person responsible for the look of several Spielberg movies among others. Many scenes are delightful and atmospheric. However this is a mixed bag. Every scene where tension should be present pretty much flops. For instance all the exorcism scenes are awful. And seem to come straight from a FOX occult show like the XFiles using black and white image and devoid of absolutely any impact. You never feel scared. Worse it doesn't even feel tensed. As a viewer you just sit there and remotely watch was is happening. Kaminski is also totally unable to film kinetic scenes. Any scene where a car bumps into something or people draw knives or guns is sketchy unfinished amateurish and devoid of any life. Much has been said of plot twists within the film. You can read about those in the Lost Souls forum on IMDb but really none of the theories hold of to any scrutiny. What we have here is not ambiguous writing with possible twists but just plain bad writing. The final scene impacted me as a viewer but can't save a movie that has a nonsensical plot that isn't even remotely based on genuine religious history. It's just made up stuff by awful writers turned into a movie y a first time director who was way over his head. It's still heartbreaking because there are things Janusz Kaminski obviously excels at but the overall direction of a film was too much at this point. Maybe a more solid script would have helped him. Since then Kaminski has been back to his cinematographer gig alongside Spielberg. He never directed a movie again but here we are ten years later and it appears his next directorial effort is in production. Hopefully he learned from the previous experience!Avoid Lost Souls at all costs or skip to the final scene.";

His name was mentioned by a patient in a mental ward who was subject to an exorcism that went wrong and left Maya's tutor Father Lareaux on death's doorstep. Now Maya is going after Peter hoping to find him before Satan does.One of the reasons I like Lost Souls is sort of a matter of personal taste. I've always loved Winona Rider she has a great screen presence and her body of work shows a wide variety of faces. One could argue however that this is her most superficial role but even so she is not a lazy actress. Too bad the script didn't give her quite enough of a character.There are three things that Lost Soul could use a brain an energy boost and perhaps another ten to fifteen minutes in running length. The ending is rushed and is about as anticlimactic as cinema can get. When I see this kind of thing happen sometimes I want to think that maybe there was a longer ending planned but something went wrong in the editing room.None of us can ever know.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best epic superproductions of all time with a beautiful cinematography a majestic score and a solid and dynamic direction. Still many people have put it down as a folly with no real depth or substance and others for its historical inaccuracy. Yes it is not one hundred per cent historically accurate but then how much do we really know about an 11th century warrior when very few written documents of the era survive today? We only have a few of the old cantigas poems to be sung and the Poema de Mio Cid at the Spanish national archives. Many Spaniards tend to put this great film down only because it was made by a bunch of American and Italian philistines with no knowledge of the legend at all but for the only purpose of creating an epic to rival with BenHur and Spartacus. That is a childish way to see it. At least we should be grateful that someone came up and took the challenge of making such a film in the first place. That man was Samuel Bronston. This selfmade movie mogul not only had the confidence and charm to persuade other people to lend him huge sums of money but he also got Franco's ultraCatholic fascist regime to approve the making of a film about their national hero where the main character was to be played by a foreigner who was also a Protestant. Of course Bronston succeeded easily through bribery in a corrupt country as well as through the willingness of Franco to allow American business to settle in Spain and help revive its obsolete economy. Franco would use El Cid to promote Spain around the world as a touristic destination during the Sixties. Bronston wanted to make an unique epic a high quality production with sheer spectacle and credited with some historical veracity. So he hired the best people he could think of cinematographer Robert Krasker who used the radical and innovative Technirama70 format that magnified the endless open spaces of the Spanish plateaus Miklos Rozsa for the score his last great triumph which should have won him another Oscar and Anthony Mann who had cut his teeth making Westerns with James Stewart. Finally as technical adviser Bronston hired the illustrious Spanish scholar Ramon Menendez Pidal the greatest living authority on El Cid at that time. Don Ramon was also of great assistance to Rozsa during the composer's careful and thorough research on Spanish medieval music. Rozsa visited the libraries and archives of old monasteries and was given special access to documents dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. Not many film composers would have gone through such painstaking research work but Rozsa was a perfectionist and probably the greatest composer of all. When we think of the leading male stars in Hollywood at that time Heston had become world famous and highly bankable after the huge success of BenHur and the Oscar it won him. So he was the ideal man for the role. Bronston wanted Loren because of her fastgrowing popularity as well as by the the fact that hiring her would please the Italian investors and that would mean more money into the budget. Then enter the British and what a fine supporting cast they are the smokyvoiced Genevieve Page as Urracait is the Spanish word for jackdaw by the way who always reminds me of Lauren Bacall the gentlemanly and selfcomposed Michael Hordern as Rodrigo's father the handsome blueeyed John Fraser as the arrogant but vulnerable prince Alfonso Gary Raymond as prince Sancho Douglas Wilmer as Rodrigo's Arab ally and finally the recently deceased excellent Czeckborn character actor Herbert Lom as the blackclad villain a role initially offered to Orson Welles and who turned it down when he learnt that audiences wouldn't see his masked face. The great Orson needed the money very much to finance his own projects but sometimes his ego was bigger than him. El Cid was a huge boxoffice hit all around the world and made Bronston a very rich man. The profits of the film were used to start preparing The Fall of the Roman Empire but then the refusal of Heston to work again with Loren they detested each other set in motion the snowball that would sweep the Bronston empire. Although three more epics were made the exotic and spectacular 55 Days at Peking the splendid but failed The Fall of the Roman Empire that bankrupted Bronston and the minor and much cheaper The Magnificent Showman which was his swansong he never again reached the heights of greatness and success he had reached with El Cid. And then think that the tournaments and battles you see here were staged for real with real armours swords catapults and everything and thousands of people taking part entire companies of the Spanish army and entire villages of civilians were hired as extras. Today you will never get that in a film too costly and too complicate to coordinate. And of course all of the Health and Safety rubbish laws that there are nowadays... If you play knights of the Round Table you can cut yourself mind you. So enter CGI.But at least we have El Cid in all its glory. And please let them not make a remake! Let them not destroy the old magic and beauty of cinema.".

Bronston wanted to make an unique epic a high quality production with sheer spectacle and credited with some historical veracity. So he hired the best people he could think of cinematographer Robert Krasker who used the radical and innovative Technirama70 format that magnified the endless open spaces of the Spanish plateaus Miklos Rozsa for the score his last great triumph which should have won him another Oscar and Anthony Mann who had cut his teeth making Westerns with James Stewart. Finally as technical adviser Bronston hired the illustrious Spanish scholar Ramon Menendez Pidal the greatest living authority on El Cid at that time. Don Ramon was also of great assistance to Rozsa during the composer's careful and thorough research on Spanish medieval music. Rozsa visited the libraries and archives of old monasteries and was given special access to documents dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. Not many film composers would have gone through such painstaking research work but Rozsa was a perfectionist and probably the greatest composer of all. When we think of the leading male stars in Hollywood at that time Heston had become world famous and highly bankable after the huge success of BenHur and the Oscar it won him. So he was the ideal man for the role. Bronston wanted Loren because of her fastgrowing popularity as well as by the the fact that hiring her would please the Italian investors and that would mean more money into the budget. Then enter the British and what a fine supporting cast they are the smokyvoiced Genevieve Page as Urracait is the Spanish word for jackdaw by the way who always reminds me of Lauren Bacall the gentlemanly and selfcomposed Michael Hordern as Rodrigo's father the handsome blueeyed John Fraser as the arrogant but vulnerable prince Alfonso Gary Raymond as prince Sancho Douglas Wilmer as Rodrigo's Arab ally and finally the recently deceased excellent Czeckborn character actor Herbert Lom as the blackclad villain a role initially offered to Orson Welles and who turned it down when he learnt that audiences wouldn't see his masked face. The great Orson needed the money very much to finance his own projects but sometimes his ego was bigger than him. El Cid was a huge boxoffice hit all around the world and made Bronston a very rich man. The profits of the film were used to start preparing The Fall of the Roman Empire but then the refusal of Heston to work again with Loren they detested each other set in motion the snowball that would sweep the Bronston empire. Although three more epics were made the exotic and spectacular 55 Days at Peking the splendid but failed The Fall of the Roman Empire that bankrupted Bronston and the minor and much cheaper The Magnificent Showman which was his swansong he never again reached the heights of greatness and success he had reached with El Cid. And then think that the tournaments and battles you see here were staged for real with real armours swords catapults and everything and thousands of people taking part entire companies of the Spanish army and entire villages of civilians were hired as extras. Today you will never get that in a film too costly and too complicate to coordinate. And of course all of the Health and Safety rubbish laws that there are nowadays... If you play knights of the Round Table you can cut yourself mind you. So enter CGI.But at least we have El Cid in all its glory. And please let them not make a remake! Let them not destroy the old magic and beauty of cinema.";

If I'm going to watch a movie with a lot of sword fights oppressed peasants and corrupt kings I want it to be a swashbuckler preferably one starring Errol Flynn. Swashbucklers bring a lot of humor to otherwise unbearable dramatic situations.El Cid presents unbearable dramatic situations and it is not a laugh riot. I saw the threehour plus uncut version and never felt tempted to laugh once. This is the Middle Ages without Monty Python without the levity of an Errol Flynn  Olivia De Haviland romance or comic relief of a Little John.Boy oh boy was this grim. And long. You could have almost filmed the entire film with three colors white black and red. Lots of red.But El Cid did to me what it wanted to do. I really believed in Rodrigo and Jimena as starcrossed largerthanlife lovers. I really believed that the little girl who leads them from her well to her farm house lived a thousand years ago. I really believed that something like the mouth of hell itself was opening up as Ben Yusef invaded. I really believed in Rodrigo's relentless nobility and heroism. Neither Charlton Heston's strangely artificial looking hair nor the obvious nonArab status of a couple of the Moors Douglas Wilmer who later played Sherlock Holmes was one especially unconvincing Arab interfered with my willing suspension of disbelief. I cried. Several times.There's a lot to cry about. In almost every scene someone is either crying usually Sophia Loren or gritting his teeth often Charlton Heston but others grit their teeth a lot also. Actually Loren doesn't so much cry but rather huge luminous tears quiver poised on her lower eyelid. In her final scenes the teardrop dancing on her right eyelid is so huge black and luminous it begins to look like a second pupil. If the sound of horse hoofbeats does something for you you will love this movie. There are many horses. Many many many. And they are always thundering off to somewhere more often than not over cobblestones. Lots of horse hoofbeats on this soundtrack. Some viewers found the plot hard to understand they perhaps saw the cut version. Having seen the uncut version I found the plot entirely comprehensible. El Cid is like a ballad. There is one grim faceoff after another escalating in gravity in which the hero proves that he is growing into his own heroism through every choice he makes. Each choice is harder than the last one until his final choice which is truly impossible but which he fulfills anyway. If you like medieval ballads you may love this movie. It has the same grim beauty and power and inexorability the same insistence on throwing whatever is divine in naked human character up against the impossible demands of earthly life. For such a long movie there is scant dialogue. With few words people prove their true character through their actions just as characters in ancient epics did.One viewer complained that this movie bore no relation to the real El Cid legend. If that is true the movie is all the more remarkable. The filmmakers managed to create from scratch a convincing and moving medieval narrative.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a movie El Cid grows on you. At first it is the story of a relatively ordinary man whose trip to his wedding is interrupted by a battle between the Moors and the Christians of 11th century Spain. But this is no ordinary man. Or perhaps he is an ordinary man who is destined to do extraordinary things. Early on he is forced to kill his fianc's father as a matter of family honor thus earning the enmity of his fianc who nonetheless cannot stop loving him however hard she tries. And much of the story is devoted to the doomed nature of their love as historical events continue to overtake the plans they would rather make. And with each new episode El Cid's stature grows from warrior to hero to legend to mythic figure. Even in exile he has a following. And if the script is not true to history this film still does a great service to the memory of a great man who put God and country ahead of himself. Something extra must be said about the crowd scenes. There were real people out there not multiple CGI images made to look like the hordes that are a part of all epics. Over 30000 costumes were made for this movie and General Franco donated the Spanish army to fill them. The difference is stunning and sobering. There is a reality to the battle scenes that simply doesn't obtain in later movies such as Gladiator or Lord of the Rings. Now that old films such as this are so readily available in various formats we are presented with the dilemma of deciding which ones should occupy our bookshelves to return to again to remember a detail or to reclaim the feeling that the story may create. In terms of the greatness the mission and the struggles of the human spirit this one's a keeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1961 Anthony Mann's epic tale of the Spanish hero El Cid burst across the wide screens of theatres. This was the kind of film that 70mm was made for. Charlton Heston is Rodrigo de Bivar and Sophia Loren is his legendary love Chimene. Their course of love will not be a smooth one. When he kills her father as a matter of honor she vows vengeance and sets in motion the series of events which will forever change their lives. The Christian Spaniards are ruled by local kingdoms each vying for rule of the nation. When one king challenges El Cid's monarch Heston volunteers to fight to the death to determine the fate of the city of Calahorra and at the same time vindicate himself of the treason he was accused of by Loren's father. This fight for Calahorra is one of the most memorable action sequences ever committed to film. It opens with Miklos Rozsa's heraldic fanfare as the two knights take their places on the jousting field. The two kings watch from either side. The ensuing duel is brutal with a predictable but decisive outcome. The lovers are eventually married but only to be separated again as El Cid is called to protect Spain from the marauding Moors swarming across the Mediterranean from Africa. The Spanish Moors join with the Cid to take the city of Valencia where the enemy will attack. It is here that one of the great battle scenes takes place actually filmed in the shadow of the walled city of Peniscola on the coast of Spain. The two armies charge eachother in a cacaphony of horses shouts and Rozsa's rousing musical score. The sky is darkened by the thousands of flying arrows streaking across to the enemy. This is the kind of movie that they just don't make anymore. What a pity! The final sequence shows the eerie onslaught of the Spanish army lead by the fallen El Cid strapped to his steed and causing the Moors to flee in terror at his seeming resurrection. Rozsa's organ music swells as El Cid rides into the sunset along the deserted beach and into immortality. In the mid 90's after many years of not being available El Cid was shown again in its 70mm splendor. It was then released on video. The superb Criterion laserdisc version contains the full Technirama letterboxed image and a restored multchannel soundtrack in Dolby Digital. An excellent supplementary section has interviews with Charlton Heston and others. Heston says that El Cid would have been an even more enduring classic if William Wyler BenHur had directed it. However Anthony Mann has nothing to be ashamed of. Aside from some wooden acting and some scenery chewing here and there the richness of the story and the elaborate production design paired with the fine performance of Heston and Miklos Rozsa's impassioned score surely place El Cid  in the Hall of Fame of great film epics.".

So many of the minor characters were so good Douglas Wilmer's Moutamin brilliant and Genevieve Page a wonderful Urraca there was a subtle performance for you just a trifle not quite appropriate in her very obvious affection for the younger brother  a trifle suspicious but she played it perfectly.

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching this oeuvre and I am reminded of the immortal words of Leonard PinthGarnell There that wasn't so good was it? Not exactly magnificent.I will confess this though at one point I actually was enjoying the picture. You see I had gotten it on DVD from Netflix and last week I watched the first disc's worth which ends at an intermission I'm not sure if there was originally an intermission there it seems a little odd for the intermission to be twothirds of the way through the film. I stopped there and only watched the rest of it tonight. At that twothirds point where I stopped I actually rather liked the movie. But now having seen the rest my opinion is decidedly lower.What I liked was the rather interesting lovehate story between the lovers. I found myself trying to apply the situation to my own life how would I feel if my beloved who I hope will someday be my wife killed my father? What would I do? Could I still love her? I couldn't come up with a clear answer to this very difficult question and so I was quite intrigued to see how the movie would handle it. This whole subplot was by far the best part of the movie.But the problem is it is a subplot. And after that twothirds point it gets pushed aside and ceases to matter. And the main plot is too poorly realized to be of much value.And this is where I assert that the film is simultaneously too long and too short. Too long because the pacing is not exactly brisk and the whole thing runs over three hours and it feels like it. Again I had to watch it in two sessions to get through the whole thing. Yet too short too! Because the whole story covers such an epic sweep of time and events that the film can't get it all in and so it hops around sporadically episodically. Suddenly you have to figure out that oh wait it's ten years later now! Wait what happened to all that stuff that was going on ten years ago? The movie has no answer it has to move on because we still have a lot of story to get through! So the film feels simultaneously interminable and rushed. I sat through the whole thing and there's still gaps in the plot that I can't quite figure out.But the final kiss of death is when the movie is over and you realize that it's all a huge steaming pile of baloney. Go read the wikipedia article on the real El Cid and you'll discover as I did that except for some of the broadest outlines of the story it's all Hollywood nonsense. The real El Cid wasn't this noble selfsacrificing saint he was a selfserving conqueror. He didn't desperately take Valencia in a noble quest to save Spain he did it to gain a principality for himself. He then proceeded to rule over it peacefully for five years until he died peacefully the whole heroic ending of the film is a tissue of whoppers. Heck they couldn't even be bothered to get his children right he had three children none of whom were named Elvira or Sol.Well still I gave it four stars. The scenery was nice especially some of the authentic medieval castles. The battle scenes were suitably epic. And again I did like the subplot.But on the whole feh. And the ending is just laughable nonsense.".

Travelling through Spain he approaches a well one day where a leper nearby is crying for water. El Cid offers him first drink at the scoop. The leper thanks him and calls him 'El Cid'. When Rodrigo Charlton Hestonasks the leper how he knew it was him the leper replies that it could only be El Cid who would offer a drink of water to a leper. At that moment Chimene Sophia Loren turns up leading a packhorse and accepts that her life can only be complete with El Cid and they ride off into the sunset together.

Charlton Heston as Rodrigo combined courage and strength with humility and heart as it has rarely if ever been done on the screen. The story is unforgettable and all the more so because there actually was an El Cid 1000 years ago. It is long but goes by fast with nonstop dramatic tension. At the center of the story are two immortal themes one about a man who had to put duty to his nation before the person he loved the most and the other about the faith that by uniting people of diverse backgrounds good can triumph over evil. This wonderful movie has been around for almost a half century and I hope like the legend of El Cid it will live for another 1000 years.".

And who else to play the legendary and noble Spanish hero than CHARLTON HESTON. He's magnificent here playing his central role with an almost Shakespearean grandeur as do some of the other cast members including HERBERT LOM JOHN FRASER and GARY RAYMOND.So is the epic sweep of the tale and the intimate love story that begins when he is on his way to wed SOPHIA LOREN and finds himself asked to assume the mantle of leadership against the Moors in 11th century Spain. He makes the journey from peacebroker accused of treason to the King's fighting champion and later from exiled hero to legendary martyr.Aside from the brilliant cinematography authentic looking locales and colorful costumes Miklos Rozsa's score adds a great deal to the intensely dramatic intimate scenes as well as the epic battles all the while suggesting some Spanish motifs amidst the heraldic fanfares and love theme.CHARLTON HESTON makes an impressive figure of El Cid especially good in the final moments as the wounded leader who knows what he must ask his wife to do so that his followers do not lose heart after his death. RAF VALLONE as Count Ordonez GENEVIEVE PAGE as Princess Urraca JOHN FRASER as Prince Alfonso and GARY RAYMOND as Prince Sancho are all remarkable effective in strong supporting roles. In lesser roles HURD HATFIELD and FRANK THRING bring their own brand of authority to minor parts.Anthony Mann and his assistant directors have done an outstanding job on all of the battle scenes and he never falters in telling the tale in strong dramatic terms. There's an intensity in the scenes between Loren and Heston after he has been forced to kill her father for humiliating his own father in front of the court. Whatever friction there was between Heston and Loren on the set works for them here because her animosity toward him is a chilling thing to watch.The DVD has been wonderfully mastered and all of the Miklos Rozsa score sounds better than ever with Overture Intermission and Exit music reminding us all what a treasure he was as a film composer.".

	schema:reviewBody "El Cid is the story of the legendary Rodrigo Diaz who lifted his country with valour and integrity to drive the Moorish invaders from Spain.I think the best thing i can say about this film is that even tho it's nearly three hours long i never once look at the clock. It's a thoroughly engaging picture that boasts all the great hallmarks of a sweeping historical epic. The colour the costumes the scope and the attention to detail from director Anthony Mann are first rate and par for the course is the suitably rousing score from Miklos Rozsa. Big square jawed bronzed beefcake Charlton Heston takes the lead role as Diaz and firmly cements himself as the go to guy for gargantuan epics. Support comes in the form of Sophia Loren Genevieve Page Raf Vallone John Fraser excellent and Gary Raymond also excellent.The story is an excellent one because Diaz was such a fine character from the annals of Spanish history uniting the sulking Christian kings of Spain whilst simultaneously lifting the people of the streets off their knees and getting them to believe in the cause. Yet it has to be said that El Cid is far from the perfect historical epic movie even allowing for the usual hollywoodisation of facts one can't quite get past the fact that El Cid comes across as a glamorised glory tale without any hindrances. Surely here in the 11th century El Cid's path would of been fraught and sodden with a great deal more death and destruction? it takes away greatly from the films end because the build up of Cid's heroism actually didn't contain a great deal of hard work.Still it's a wonderful film that ticks all the boxes for genre staples and as churlish as i may be as regards the assumptive nature of El Cid's story being told here i'm still the first to start cheering and thumping my chest as the credits role not even Sophia Loren's pout can distract me from the bravado warmth washing over me 810.".

The Cid the very embodiment of the chivalrous knight. On the way to his wedding to the tempestuous Chemene played by the neverlovelier Sophia Loren he captures two Moorish emirs who have been involved with the burning of a Spanish village. Rather than release them to the custody of King Ferdinand for hanging he spares their lives and is accused of treason. When Rodrigo's father objects the father of the bride besmirches the honor of the family and Rodrigo is forced to fight the father of his love and reluctantly kill him. While she plots to gain revenge on her former fiance he becomes the King's champion and in the King's favor demands and receives Chemene's hand in marriage. She can't bring herself to thoroughly hate him  talk about conflicted. Still things go from bad to worse when Ferdinand dies and he divides his kingdom among his children Sancho Alfonso and Urraca in reality Ferdinand had five children. When Sancho decides he wants all or nothing he arrests Alfonso and sends him to prison but El Cid rescues him believing it morally wrong. As a result civil war breaks out but before things get really awful the devious Urraca arranges for Sancho to be assassinated. At Alfonso's coronation a suspicious Rodrigo forces Alfonso to swear an oath that he had nothing to do with Sancho's death. Enraged Alfonso takes the oath and then exiles El Cid but the knight proves to be so popular among the people that an entire army is raised to follow him. When the evil Ben Yussuf a nearly unrecognizable Herbert Lom invades Spain El Cid fights bravely to take Valencia despite Alfonso's tendency towards utter idiocy and it is from there that the knight literally rides into the stuff of legend.Gorgeously photographed in Spain and Italy with one of the most beautiful scores by Miklos Rosza this is the kind of epic that has recently made a comeback thanks to CGI. No CGI here however  there is literally a cast of thousands and LOTS of horses in medieval armor whacking away at one another. The story is at times convoluted and the dialog a little over the top it is nonetheless truly enjoyable a forgotten epic that in a kinder world would be considered up there with Lawrence of Arabia and BenHur. It is difficult to find nowadays and the rental copy I saw on DVD had a terrible soundtrack. Still it is worth seeking out.Incidentally on a personal note I originally was interested in the movie because my family is descended from the great Spanish knight.".

This was not obvious to me as I found the battle scenes very exciting and very well executed but the late MR. Heston stated that had the directing duties been undertaken by David Lean who was his preferred choice the movie could have been really great rather than just adequate Hestons own words.

The story of El Cid's battles against the scimitarbrandishing Moorish Lord which for some reason I was under the impression Herbert Lom had played was quite well donebut what did I know? I was only 17. What I also had no clue about was that within my own lifetime my country and indeed the world would be fighting radical Islam which Spain had been conquered by and subjected to for 400 years! Who do you think the blackturbaned Moorish were? We need to revive that classic and watch it through 2006 eyes. There's a lesson in there. Who will be America's Cid? I have not been able to find this movie on DVD but will read other comments here and see if I can come up with a place to purchase a good one. It's a classic. The scenery is lovely although it was probably filmed on backlots and in Italy! the music is beautiful costuming was very well done and the movie was just enrapturing. My favorite line is still a battle cry today among the Spanish For God for Country and for the King! Por Dios por la patria y el Rey!".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being my fourth time watching this film I'm not sure I've ever seen it in the correct 2.351 aspect ratio and in fact the VHS copy I've owned for some 17 years showed a few distracting instances of pan  scan  which I was too naive to notice when younger I have to say that I hadn't viewed the film in 13 years at least!. Frankly because of that factor alone I would have preferred not watching it at all  had I not wished to complement the film I had watched the day before i.e. Vittorio Cottafavi's THE HUNDRED HORSEMEN aka SON OF EL CID 1964! While initially I felt that director Anthony Mann who made some of the most remarkable noirs and Westerns in the previous two decades had effectively sold out in making 4 bigbudget Hollywood spectaculars in a row  the others being CIMARRON 1960 THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 1964 and THE HEROES OF TELEMARK 1965  I was keen to revisit EL CID after reading film critic David Thomson's essay on Mann counting it among his finest achievements in A Biographical Dictionary Of The Cinema.Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are arguably at their most handsome as the legendary Spanish warrior and his bride I'd even argue that Heston's role here is his best ever  certainly more mythical than his Oscarwinning turn in BENHUR 1959. The great cast also features Raf Vallone as the King's lieutenant and an admirer of Loren's but who eventually repents and becomes Heston's ally John Fraser Gary Raymond and Genevieve Page make an usually 'modern' and therefore very interesting royal triumvirate Massimo Serato as Heston's jovial righthand man as well as the likes of Hurd Hatfield Michael Hordern playing Heston's disgraced father and among the Moorish lines Frank Thring Douglas Wilmer whose loyalty to Heston for having spared his life reflects not only on the characters' respective codes of honor but also on the depth of the writing itself and Herbert Lom as chief villain Ben Youssef creating a memorable character out of only a few speeches and in spite of being garbed from head to foot in the typical Muslim outfit!.The famous oneonone duel between Heston and Christopher Rhodes and the sprawling battle sequences  courtesy of the great cinematographer Robert Krasker who had done similar duties on HENRY V 1944 and won an Oscar for THE THIRD MAN 1949  are stirring even when viewed at a disadvantage to which one should add the softness of VHS when compared to DVD and the somewhat faded colors!. The magnificent score is unmistakably the work of celebrated composer Miklos Rosza who was virtually a fixture for this type of film. As I've mentioned the impressive script is highly literate and the plot so completely absorbing that the first half actually flies by the latter stages feel a bit choppy because it zips through the Cid's career suddenly appearing already a renowned conqueror  older bearded and with a scar across his face! but this is made up for by the climactic struggle  capped by an unforgettable and truly haunting finale. The scene where Heston and Loren share a romantic idyll inside a barn while in exile only to be met by swarms of followers as soon as they emerge is as moving as the famous chorus of I'm Spartacus! in Stanley Kubrick's SPARTACUS 1960 ironically enough that particular film was begun by Anthony Mann but was summarily fired for his overly slow progress rather than any intrinsic dissatisfaction with the work he was doing! by its starproducer Kirk Douglas who ended up falling out with Kubrick himself  but did get to work with Mann eventually on THE HEROES OF TELEMARK.Interestingly producer Samuel Bronston's most notable spectaculars were all directed by Hollywood veterans Mann helmed this one and later THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE both of them among the best epics ever made period! Nicholas Ray made the flawed but reasonably impressive KING OF KINGS 1961 and 55 DAYS AT PEKING 1963 while Henry Hathway was assigned to the inflated and undistinguished CIRCUS WORLD 1964.

To avoid being separated Sandy escapes with flipper to a deserted island.When he arrives at this island it is his home. but little does he know that a British mother and her 2 children will be dumped off at this island by 3 murderers who recently escaped Prison. It will take all of his and flipper's wits and abilities to help the helpless family and to thwart the killers' plans.This movie will forever stick to my heart like glue. I've been watching it since i was 4 years old. the music is good no matter how old and out of style it may be. even if i'm taking a girl out for a walk the song Imagine sometimes pops into my head.Another cool thing to comment on is that there is Advertising inside of the movie. How is that? the characters talk about the movie Mutiny on the Bounty Which is a real MGM film. they also Talk about Showdown in Samoa but that's not a real film perhaps it was a project MGM was working on but abandoned halfway through.Bottom line this movie is worth your money and 2 hours or so of your time.

	schema:headline " Better than the first Flipper movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I discovered the existence of the two Flipper movies quite by accident after a childhood of Flipper TV reruns. It has been a pleasant discovery.The first Flipper movie tells us how boy and dolphin became friends. That bond became the foundation of the popularity of the Flipper franchise. In this the sequel movie we see further evolution of the family structure that was not finalized until the Flipper TV series was filmed in the summer of 1964. Flipper's New Adventure FNA was filmed due to the success of the first Flipper movie only one year later in 1963 but was held back for release in the early summer of 1964 as an intro to the TV series that was screened in the fall of 1964. Whilst the first movie featured all of the Ricks family members and was a little slow in getting to the dolphin rescue story FNA quickly zeros in on the two stars of the first movie Luke Halpin as Sandy Ricks and the dolphin  actually dolphins as Flipper. The producers were keen to cash in on Halpin's emerging teen idol status he was 16 when FNA was filmed as he grew up and so Sandy is the central character in FNA as opposed to a major character in the first movie. Halpin wore nothing more than just a pair of cut down blue jeans shorts for 90 of FNA cementing his signature look that became an integral part of the TV series and defined Halpin permanently ultimately to the detriment of his postFlipper career. The FlipperSandy bond is now front and center  first with Sandy running away from his Florida Keys home when a family friend advises of an intended forced removal of he and his pet dolphin. This is no ordinary running away  it is a potentially life threatening journey in a small skiff across the Atlantic to the Bahamas. Flipper of course saves the day.The bond continues as Sandy's paradisaical island retreat is soon visited by fleeing murderers and then a welltodo British family on a sailing voyage. When the crooks cast ashore the mother and daughters they are helped by the SandyFlipper duo  sometimes in ways that defy reality. The crooks are all gradually captured by the guile and tactics of Sandy and Flipper. Unlike the first movie the sequel moves at a much quicker pace and involves action more likely to appeal to older children and early teens.As touching as the first Flipper movie is FNA was voted as more enjoyable by an extended family group of children aged 5 to 11 that we showed both to over a family reunion weekend. It more easily commanded their attention despite being the longer movie. Sandy's consistent loyalty to Flipper the beauty of the Caribbean island the budding romance between Sandy and the youngest English castaway and the determination he had to both help them but prevent outsiders from finding him and Flipper all add together to make this a halfway decent kids movie.Halpin comes across as more confident and independent his underwater skills are superb and he handles the vagaries of girls and a foreign accent with all the puzzlement you'd expect of the 1314 year old boy he is acting as. His penultimate scene with the injured Flipper is quite moving. FNA also transitions to the family dynamics seen in the TV series by replacing the more austere Chuck Connors with the friendlier telegenic Brian Kelly as the father Porter Ricks. The FNA Porter Ricks is now a Park Ranger in training and no longer a fisherman and the motherwife has now died.Some trivia arising from FNA 1  Right after the final scene in FNA was shot in 1963 MGM had NBC shoot a pilot episode for the TV series that would follow in 1964. In the pilot Tommy Norden makes his first appearance as the younger brother Bud. This pilot became Episode 3 SOS Dolphin in Season 1 and wasn't screened until quite a few months later in the midst of the other Season 1 episodes filmed in 1964. The age gap is quite noticeable in the case of Luke Halpin. 2  The onscreen romance between Sandy Ricks and Penny Hopewell had a sense of realism to it because it had become a real life romance between Halpin and the well known English actress Pamela Franklin complete with Halpin later traveling to England to visit what he admitted to an interviewer when he was in his early 20's was his first girlfriend. 3  Before FNA was released and just days before Halpin's 17th birthday he appeared on the famous To Tell The Truth TV show. The producers would try to hide someone of rising fame with two other decoys leaving the celebrity panel of four to ask a series of questions of all three contestants in an attempt to uncover who was the real person. During the questioning Halpin revealed that he was closer to the main dolphin in the first movie Mitzie than he was to the main dolphin in FNA Suzy describing Mitzie as more affectionate.Since showing the movies to my kids they are thoroughly enjoying the TV series on Hulu. FNA cemented the SandyFlipper bond and neatly transitioned the franchise into the popular TV show that remains in syndicated reruns some 50 years later.".

Sandy's consistent loyalty to Flipper the beauty of the Caribbean island the budding romance between Sandy and the youngest English castaway and the determination he had to both help them but prevent outsiders from finding him and Flipper all add together to make this a halfway decent kids movie.Halpin comes across as more confident and independent his underwater skills are superb and he handles the vagaries of girls and a foreign accent with all the puzzlement you'd expect of the 1314 year old boy he is acting as. His penultimate scene with the injured Flipper is quite moving. FNA also transitions to the family dynamics seen in the TV series by replacing the more austere Chuck Connors with the friendlier telegenic Brian Kelly as the father Porter Ricks. The FNA Porter Ricks is now a Park Ranger in training and no longer a fisherman and the motherwife has now died.Some trivia arising from FNA 1  Right after the final scene in FNA was shot in 1963 MGM had NBC shoot a pilot episode for the TV series that would follow in 1964. In the pilot Tommy Norden makes his first appearance as the younger brother Bud. This pilot became Episode 3 SOS Dolphin in Season 1 and wasn't screened until quite a few months later in the midst of the other Season 1 episodes filmed in 1964. The age gap is quite noticeable in the case of Luke Halpin. 2  The onscreen romance between Sandy Ricks and Penny Hopewell had a sense of realism to it because it had become a real life romance between Halpin and the well known English actress Pamela Franklin complete with Halpin later traveling to England to visit what he admitted to an interviewer when he was in his early 20's was his first girlfriend. 3  Before FNA was released and just days before Halpin's 17th birthday he appeared on the famous To Tell The Truth TV show. The producers would try to hide someone of rising fame with two other decoys leaving the celebrity panel of four to ask a series of questions of all three contestants in an attempt to uncover who was the real person. During the questioning Halpin revealed that he was closer to the main dolphin in the first movie Mitzie than he was to the main dolphin in FNA Suzy describing Mitzie as more affectionate.Since showing the movies to my kids they are thoroughly enjoying the TV series on Hulu. FNA cemented the SandyFlipper bond and neatly transitioned the franchise into the popular TV show that remains in syndicated reruns some 50 years later.";

But he hears some folks from the Miami Seaquarium are going to take Flipper and so he runs away and finds a nice island off the Florida coast to live or at least until the Seaquarium folks go away. Of course if Luke had made that phone call to Brian Kelly playing his father for the first time he and Flipper would not have been around to help Tom Helmore's family who are stranded on the same island. He's been kidnapped for the use of his boat by three escaped convicts and they strand Helen Cherry and daughters Francesca Annis and Pamela Franklin on the island Luke took refuge on.Here's where it gets really dumb. These three are fugitives being hunted by law enforcement and they hit upon the brilliant scheme of holding Helmore and family for a getaway insurance. So they go back to that island and take them all save Halpin whom they don't know about.

Then taking the advice of priests the zameendar engages in bizarre sexual rituals with his women. In term of performances Roopali Ganguli the first wife steals the show. Roopali brings the first wife's mischievous pranks and her wisdom with a certain class and frivolity while Soha does it by bringing out the naivety and innocence of the second wife. However the dubbed voice hinders her performance. Jackie Shroff is adequately frightening as the evil Zameendar. Yet he also brings a human quality in the scenes where he questions his actions.

However in trying to remain true to their artistic goals the makers of this film have had to eschew a lot of compromises that usually make such works palatable to larger audiences. Kudos to them for that and I just hope that the existing market is mature enough to encourage such a film by providing enough viewers for it.Now the qualifications that one needs to be satisfy to be able to enjoy this film are a bit narrow these include a good knowledge of idiomatic Bengali and slang as well as enough idea of the society of feudal Bengal to understand the cultural and class stereotypes and unspoken attitudes. Apart from this the viewer would need to be able to sit through potentially offensive incidents and dialog instead of running away crying 'help p0rn'! To give an idea a parallel may drawn  only regarding the use of sexual situations and dialog  with Clerks II ...it will offend a lot of people who can not see past the profanity into the profound that it shapes. This means that the film watching experience of such a viewer would have to be a bit wider than most people who satisfy the first criterion.The acting performance of Roopa Ganguly is worth mentioning for making great use of a very fulfilling role. Among the other leads Jackie Shroff did a pretty good though it is a long way from understated and the castings of Abhishek and Soha work great not least because of their looks. It's a bit funny how they both manage to evoke memories of their illustrious parents in many of the scenes...one is unlikely to forget that ABJr has his father's eyes after this film. And you'll want to go watch Devi again just to check if there's something in Sharmila's gestures that has not been reused by Soha here. The rest of cast does pretty well too. The editing is taut as with all Rituparno's works. The cinematography is good and even though in some scenes the underlining gets a bit too vivid the music is mostly unobtrusive leaving the dialog room to breathe. And the dialog is what makes this film work. As mentioned before it is very much rooted in Bengali colloquialisms and cultural references. And this is also what makes the film weak for nonBengalispeaking viewers...generously helped by the dismal subtitling. The nuances are hard to translate to begging with but it's even harder to worse job than is done here see below.Minor spoilers through quotesOne major gripe remains the quality of subtitles though which is surprising a big problem with so many Indian films. Even if you leave aside inane translations that rip out every nuance from the dialog e.g. 'dhoNra saap dhoNra saapi thakbe'  'a poisonless snake will always remain so' is subtitled as 'our husband is a poisonless snake...' they even manage to screw up the subtitling of the English dialogs!!! Those are more jarring since often the English narration happens with little action on the screen which makes it hard to ignore the subtitles. And the sad part is that so little of it comes from typos! Which means that this is meticulously created nonsense not a result of carelessness. Here are a few gems onerous  'honorous'??? excess  access intent  intend saw  so 'i thought to see great things'  'i thought the secret things'Also who knows why they have to translate 'barbaric ritual' to a 'powerpacked ritual'? Audience sensitivity? I suppose that the Bengali audiences watching without subtitles are unlikely to understand the spoken English  while you are asking for trouble once you write it out in the subtitle? Perhaps it all comes from an underpaid frustrated subtitlewriter trying to extract revenge or maybe to covet glory by adding an extra comical layer to what is left to itself just a nuanced multilayered intelligent provocative powerful and yes funny film.".

Probably that is why I went for this movie with my parents which made me very uncomfortable later on! even tho it was rated A. Antar Mahal is a rude awakening to the sexual secrets a traditional zameendar Bengali shares. From the cinema pov the movie is very good. It has a good story that is supported by a good crisp screenplay. The cinematography is good and the characters have been played really well by the actors. the entire movie is shot within a bungalow most of it in a bedroom but it captures your attention and doesn't let it wander at all. The pace is fast especially for a Bengali movie. All in all it is good cinema. Spoilers contained from here onI felt very queasy after the movie. It is a little hard to swallow a movie as graphic as this. when i say graphic i dnt mean the body parts in a sex scene cos there is none shown but in the way it has been subtly portrayed. I personally found the goddess sculpting scene very offendingyou will know what I mean when you watch the movie but that is my view. What led to the queasiness of the movie was not the sex scenes but the circumstances faced by the protagonists. whether it was a woman forced to sleep with 5 priests or have sex with her husband in front of one I found it a little too much to take in one movie itself. So if serious movies which revolve on such topics are not your type you get easily offended by sex scenes or you are in mood for something funny and light this movie isn't for you. But you must watch it once at least...".

Even if that means bringing Morgan's wife Ann Harding into the picture. And When Ladies Meet watch out. A later version was done by MGM but with more of an emphasis on the mistress than the wife. Joan Crawford had Myrna Loy's role and Ann Harding's part was done by Greer Garson. Robert Taylor played Montgomery's role and the difference between the two films is the quality of their performances. Taylor had developed a real gift for light comedy but for Robert Montgomery this kind of part was what made his reputation. Frank Morgan was far better than Herbert Marshall because he played the role as the two timing rat he was. You watch Marshall's performance and you'd think he was the wronged party. As for Morgan no one loved him more than I in the role of the inept bumbler he usually played but parts like in When Ladies Meet and also in Hallelujah I'm a Bum do show him to good advantage in other kinds of roles. It's hard to choose between Garson and Harding though. Both of them have the best part in the film and both make equally good use of it. Each are the best in their respective casts.Eliminated from the second version is a great deadpan performance by Sterling Holloway as the allergy prone golf caddy who destroys Montgomery's game as he's playing with Harding.The original play ran on Broadway for 191 performances in the 19321933 season and starred Walter Abel Frieda Inescourt Herbert Rawlinson and Selena Royle. Ironically all of these folks had substantial film careers but could never be classified as any kind of box office. When Ladies Meet is witty and bright and a great example of the sophisticated type comedy that's just not being done any more.".

Ann Harding may have stolen the show because she had the stronger role I guess she was a bigger star than Myrna Loy at the time. Myrna Loy did a superb job with the role she was given by her MGM bosses. I never saw Myrna Loy cried in movie before so she cried in this movie I was take aback I said Man she is good she was very believable. I won't spoil it for you but if you can get a copy buy it. I am looking for one myself. Robert Montgomery proved to me that he is a fine comedian and a fine actor because he more than held his own with the likes Ann Harding and Myrna Loy but the stars of this movie are Ann Harding and Myrna Loy. This Movie is a Classic I can't stop watching it.".

	schema:reviewBody ".....that you can't help but like. Whether it's her unusual beauty her sensuous speaking voice her obvious intelligence  all together she has enormous appeal. She was extremely popular in the early thirties before fans tired of her stiff upper lip portrayals and they found favourites with more down to earth appeal. Her best known film is probably The Animal Kingdom and the cinema rivalry in that film between Harding and Myrna Loy was such a hit that they were paired again in When Ladies Meet a scintillating comedy adapted from Rachel Crothers play.Mary Howard Myrna Loy is a best selling author who is seeing a lot of her publisher Rogers Woodruf  for business purposes!!! Her dizzy friend Bridgit Alice Brady tells her she should go for it after all his wife is an awful dub!! He's a married man  I know the best ones always are!! Unbeknownst to everyone they are having a very secret affair. Her new book is very close to her heart  it is about a woman having an affair with a married man who wants to confront his wife and have a heart to heart talk  her lover is against it much the same as her real life situation.Meanwhile Jimmie Lee an annoying Robert Montgomery who spends a lot of his free time proposing to Mary who rejects him just as frequently starts spending time with Claire Ann Harding Roger Woodruf's wife who is more darling than dub!!! Knowing that Mary is staying at Bridgit's for the weekend he accidentally on purpose brings Claire for a visit. Even though their friendship is platonic for a gag Jimmie suggests they give the impression that they are... .... to make Mary jealous I'm dust under her feet  not the cream in her coffee!!! Claire throws herself into her role with great gusto  JimmyJimmy did I leave my handkerchief with you when we were waiting to be alone!!!The film only picks up when Ann Harding appears  even though she didn't appear until almost half an hour into the film. MGM was just starting to realise what they had in Myrna Loy. Even though she is the second billed actress  she is the main character. But Ann Harding was a real delight I agree with some of the other reviewers she steals the movie with her elegance and sophistication the scenes between her and Myrna Loy are riveting to watch. The first half hour was pretty talkie without much being said. Robert Montgomery who has never been a favourite of mine played his usual type shallow playboy who never seems to have employment he is supposed to be a reporter and he occasionally mentions deadlines but never meets them!!!! Frank Morgan plays Rogers Woodruf the publisher both women seem to be crazy about. But apart from Alice Brady as balmy Bridgit together Ann Harding and Myrna Loy wipe everyone else off the screen. The conversations they have When Ladies Meet make for essential viewing.Highly Recommended.".

I was a bit cold on the filmand thought it should have been much better considering the starfilled cast. However when I saw the 1933 version today I really appreciated it. This leads me to wonderis the original version that much better or has my taste just changed over the last few years? I am not sure whichbut I can highly recommend this earlier film.The film is about adulterya common topic during the PreCode era up until mid 1934 when the new Production Code tightened the moral code within Hollywood's films. At first it appears to actually endorse it or take a judgment neutral viewas Myrna Loy and Frank Morgan prepare to run off together even though Morgan is married. However Loy's friend Robert Montgomery inexplicably loves her and wants to split the pair up because he feels this relationship is wrong. So he connives to have Loy meet the wife Ann Harding. What happens here is what makes the film so goodthe women don't know who the other one actually is and they become friends. Only later do they discover the truth. I loved this final portion and I'd say more but I don't want to ruin it. Suffice to say it handles this moral quandary in a responsible and satisfying manner.Aside from a few quibbles such as why Montgomery wants Loy is she shows such selfish behaviors I really enjoyed the film. Fine acting and a nice script make for an adult film that really is as good and hardhitting today as it was back in 1933. Well worth seeing.".

What makes this one work so well is the perfect casting Robert Montgomery is excellent as a guy who wants to prove to the girl of his dreams that she's wasting her time on a married man Frank Morgan Myrna Loy plays the girl whose warped morals send her down a somewhat destructive path and of course Ann Harding is the other lady she meets whose marriage and home are threatened by it all. There are superb supporting performances too including Alice Brady as a largerthanlife busybody who serves as a hostess of sorts and we even have Sterling Holloway in an amusing golf course scene. Despite the talkiness of the script which betrays the story's stage origins there is a lot going on with all of them experiencing epiphanies about where they are in relation to each other and what they want from life. But I would say the best part is the scene where Loy and Harding sit down to talk about a chapter that Loy is writing for a book. The chapter is about the affair the main character is having and what she would say to her lover's wife. Of course Loy is writing about herself and at this point she doesn't know Harding's true identity and Harding hasn't figured out she's the wife in the book. There is just such a great deal of irony and it's like a scene in a therapist's office in a way with the women probing into their own consciences about what love means or what it could mean.".

Sound complicated and sleazy already? You're starting to get the picture.Bob Montgomery plays a real airhead here and I had no patience with him. He is in love with the Myrna Loy writer character who is having the affair with the married man and is low down enough to bring the publisher's unsuspecting wife to the trysting place of her husband and his paramour knowing that eventually there will be a major confrontation and people he supposedly likes will be hurt. I usually love Bob Montgomery but he really tried my patience here with this character. He behaves like a spoiled kid who whines because he can't have a lollipop he's always wanted. I also usually love Myrna Loy but her character here was an idiot. I kept talking to her through the screen Wake up! You know you don't really believe all this 'live and let live' nonsense you're spouting. Yes I know I'm losing it talking to dead actors on a screen but hey it takes all kinds to make a world. Ann Harding was the only one who showed some dignity in this story and I enjoyed her performance. One wonders how her character was so stupid to marry this publisher in the first place though.Comic relief was also supplied by fruitcake Alice Brady and her everpresent obvious lover the piano player Walter played delightfully by an actor named Martin Burton who had me giggling like crazy would love to see more of his work.7 out of 10.".

Yes there may be too much talk in this film but nearly all of it is intelligent and insightful. The long conversation between Loy and Harding in the middle of the night is unlike anything I personally have seen so far in old Hollywood  not a dialogue scene meant to advance the plot or lead to a dramatic confrontation just a calm honest talk between two women who reveal their thoughts and feelings.

In order to make Ms. Loy jealous Mr. Montgomery persuades Mr. Morgan's wife Ann Harding as Clare to pose as his love interest Mrs. Clara Clare. Loy's socialite friend Alice Brady as Bridget Drake offers advice and plays host to the cast at her country home. Rachel Crothers' sophisticated stage play retains a few amusing elements after all these years. Would like to have seen more of Ms. Brady with companion Martin Burton as Walter Manners.

	schema:reviewBody "Why is it that these days the term sophisticated comedy is synonymous with something that isn't at all funny? Back in the seventies Norman Lear made TV sitcoms more sophisticated by making them socially relevant. This became all the rage. As a result there hasn't been a genuinely funny American sitcom since Green Acres. Thank goodness for the BBC with such gems as Keeping Up Appearances. When Ladies Meet goes even beyond these doldrums however. I can't see why it's classified as a comedy at all. While it's not a tragedy in the Greek sense where everyone is dead by the end it certainly deserves to be classed as a drama rather than a comedy. Sure there are some funny lines mostly provided by Luis Alberni and Alice Brady but they are much more like comedy relief than any kind of main flow of the story. I wouldn't even say there was much of a happy ending although the finish is ambiguous enough that one can easily be imagined a very trite one at that.Myrna Loy monopolizes the show and handles this meaty role quite capably although I much prefer her in comedy roles particularly as the unparalleled Nora Charles in the Thin Man series which are genuine sophisticated comedies by the pre1971 meaning of the term.Frank Morgan plays his brother Ralph staid and serious. In fact I had to look back at the credits more than once to make sure it was indeed Frank and not Ralph. There is nothing in his performance of the bubbly bumbling endearing character that he has played in so many other movies notably The Affairs of Cellini and of course The Wizard of Oz. Robert Montgomery plays a conservative stuffy Family Values type once again quite out of character for the sprightly devilmaycare youthful adventurer that he has played so often in film. In fact I found his stodginess to be quite at odds with his young age and rather unbelievable. He plays a typical hypocrite who sees nothing the least bit wrong with men having multiple extramarital affairs but feels it is absolute anathema for a woman to even contemplate doing so. His character is abrasive and unpleasant throughout. He is thoroughly detestable.The story is perhaps sophisticated for its time but is barely so today. While these issues must still exist in our modern world it is hard for me to believe that they would be handled with the same Biblical Victorian attitudes that calcify the plot and especially the dialog in this movie. At least one would hope not.An interesting story well developed well acted with almost no surprises. And definitely not a comedy by the definition something that will make you laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can see how this film could be tossed into the Violent Action or confusingly written low budget categories but I found it to be a cut or more above those types of films because of its feel. It seemed to me more like a long waking nightmare than an action yarn. It was personal. Where Dirty Harry or Arnold type films tend to try to inject societal relevance this is about what is happening to one lone guy's little world. It seems to start the usual way in the big city but the road trip begins immediately after the cops vs bad guy shootout. Then it is just him against the darker side of the world.Odd to say it but it had elements in it of a gentle thoughtful road film like Wild Strawberries. But these gentle experiences were incessantly subverted by the nightmarish downward spiral that was this day or so in the life of the antihero lead. Dr. Borg could not find an experience or place that could distract him for long from his regrets. Boomer's problems were less existential. He could not find a safe place even to sleep. One thing led to another and every time it couldn't get worse it did. Sustaining that through the length of the film in writing and directing is quite an accomplishment and it all goes to Wiper. The other actors did a sturdy to inspired job of playing it on the money and not ruining the vibe.I think of it as a Film Noir and it reminds me of an Edmond O'Brien character running afoul of Communist spies and their thugs. Constantly on the run both to and from never knowing what is around the next corner.Without giving anything away the other element running through the film is an amazing tale of ultimately redemption involving Boomer and Cleveland. It is of course given the necessary weight by the usual brilliant performance by Andre Braugher.Much of the film had a claustrophobic quality to it another departure from a typical action film. I don't say this often but being in black and white would have taken as much away from this film as it would have added. It is pretty darn good the way it is. And it does not remind me very much of any other film I have ever seen. It is coming from another place entirely.".

It seems to start the usual way in the big city but the road trip begins immediately after the cops vs bad guy shootout. Then it is just him against the darker side of the world.Odd to say it but it had elements in it of a gentle thoughtful road film like Wild Strawberries. But these gentle experiences were incessantly subverted by the nightmarish downward spiral that was this day or so in the life of the antihero lead. Dr. Borg could not find an experience or place that could distract him for long from his regrets. Boomer's problems were less existential. He could not find a safe place even to sleep. One thing led to another and every time it couldn't get worse it did. Sustaining that through the length of the film in writing and directing is quite an accomplishment and it all goes to Wiper. The other actors did a sturdy to inspired job of playing it on the money and not ruining the vibe.I think of it as a Film Noir and it reminds me of an Edmond O'Brien character running afoul of Communist spies and their thugs. Constantly on the run both to and from never knowing what is around the next corner.Without giving anything away the other element running through the film is an amazing tale of ultimately redemption involving Boomer and Cleveland. It is of course given the necessary weight by the usual brilliant performance by Andre Braugher.Much of the film had a claustrophobic quality to it another departure from a typical action film. I don't say this often but being in black and white would have taken as much away from this film as it would have added. It is pretty darn good the way it is. And it does not remind me very much of any other film I have ever seen. It is coming from another place entirely.";

Thus a better way to die than the reality of being shot in an alley  being dispatched at the end of a spiraling sequence of events leading to an inevitable showdown. It doesn't look like the sort of film where the director was made to change the ending but I'd have preferred him shot at the end to complete the circle.

On asking him what was it like he said just watch it and see. So I did and found it highly enjoyable.Scott Wiper is a young actor writer producer director and has gathered himself a cast that would be at the top of any hollywood directors wish list. Joe Pantaliano Lou Diamond Phillips Natasha Henstridge and Andre Braugher.  All involved in this movie are showing the acting talents that they are capable and are clearly having fun and this fun exerts itself over the viewer.Scott Wiper is Boomer a chicago cop who becomes disenchanted with the big city life after a bust.  He embarks on a road trip to get to former girlfriend who still loves him in the picturesque village of Cedar Falls. Then all hell breaks loss...This film is notable for a few things. Wiper as lead actor writer and director Joe Pantaliano in a typically strong performance as a bizarre onearmed detective named Flash and how wiper has managed to create a movie that looks big budget on an obviously low budget. The fantastic locals and the brilliant action scenes hint at a director who could accomplish big things given the time and the money.At times i was thinking that Boomer's day couldn't get any worse but this helps us in feeling more sympathetic towards him in his quest to get home.Finally i highly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any self respecting fan of the action genre. A definate winner 8.5!".

The central character is called Boomer and is played by Scott Wiper who is a very talented actor director and writer and it seemed as though he put a lot of thought and effort into this movie which really pays off. The opening scene is one of the best i've seen for a long time and is obviously influenced by the 'Quentin Tarantino' style of writing and filmmaking...which of course is a good thing. I was also surprised at the strength of the cast which includes such hollywood names as Lou Diamond Phillips Joe Pantoliano Natasha Henstridge and Andre Braugher.The highlight of this film has to be Andre Braugher's character 'Cleveland'. Cleveland is a fairly complex character and quite humerous he's an assassin with a good heart and really makes the film much more entertaining as do most of the characters. However I was quite disappointed with some of this film as the big names such as Natasha Henstridge and Joe Pantoliano hardly get any screen time and I was very disappointed as I thought these actorsactresses would be significant characters which they weren't. All in all 'A Better Way To Die is an extremely entertaining action flick which takes you on a rollercoaster ride of action and surprises.".

I must say that she's one of the best serbian actresses. First I suppose that it must be some good drama or comedy but it was an action movie and it wasn't special in any way. There was a lot of blood killings fights explosions in it and of course a fabulous blond played by Natasha Henstridge. What kind of movie would it be if there wasn't at least one beautiful blond in it?! Mirjana played another girl in the movie called Jelisaveta and she had a few lines in Serbian language. It wasn't a big role but I guess the money was good 'couse I can't think of any other reason for her to participate in movie like this one. You can say that the story is a littlebit uncommon there's some mix up about who's Harry but it's adding up to a wellknown story of one INDESTRUCTIBLE man against everyone the Mafia police FBI. And of course he must have some cool phrase like I'll be back or Noone's nervous to follow him along the movie and this movie is full of it. And there's no need to mention illogical and ridiculous actions and plots. The end of the movie seems to be further and further away as we're coming to it and even the writer seems to be out of idea so we can see our hero saving himself from the burning building two times in the same way. So while I'm thinking once again about this movie I'm coming to the conclusion that it's much more worse than not so good movie as I've expected it to be but maybe I have expected too much.".

It moves along at a brisk pace  is never boring although the action scenes are somewhat repetitive  are a little low key don't expect car chases  explosions every five minutes because you will be disappointed if you do. My main problem with A Better Way to Die is that every time it starts to get good the pace slackens  it never quite reaches the dizzy heights of greatness every time it starts to get good the scene just fizzles out into nothing. The fight in the burning barn at the end  the shootouts are average action sequences rather than great ones  as a consequence A Better Way to Die is a touch forgettable it's a good solid film which you can sit down in front of if it's on TV for free  waste 100 odd minutes in it's company happily enough but by the next morning you'll probably have forgotten all about it  I certainly don't think it's worth spending a lot of money on buying the DVD.Director Wiper does a fine job here it looks pretty nice  although the action scenes are distinctly average they are well shot  choreographed. It's just a shame about some of the poor editing during the shootouts was this cut to get an 'R' rating? Is that why some of the shootouts look so choppy? Those outside the UK will have no idea what I'm talking about but while looking at the credits I noticed one of the producers was named Graham Taylor I can assure everyone that it's a different Graham Taylor to the exmanager of Watford Aston Villa Wolverhampton Wanderers  the Graham Taylor who had a disastrous time in charge of England when The Sun likened him to a Turnip when they superimposed his face on one of the vegetables all over their paper after we lost to Sweeden! Swedes 2 Turnips 1 was the headline... Still at least us England fans can look back on it  laugh now then again maybe not.Technically the film is fine it looks nice enough with decent cinematography  production values. The action sequences could have used beefing up a bit I mean one blown up car  a blown up shed isn't much to get that excited about. The acting is fine although there are some fairly experienced names in the cast the likes of Lou Diamond Phillips Natasha Henstridge  Joe Pantoliano they have very little screen time  are more cameo appearances than anything else.A Better Way to Die is a decent little action film it's light hearted  has decent character's  an OK story but it didn't quite reach the heights of greatness for me I'm afraid.

Scott Wiper did an OK acting job considering the limitations of the script. However since he wrote the script he is due for some criticism. While many of the action sequences were done OK there are a few howlers in there. For example car doors will generally not stop large caliber bullets and cars usually don't blow skyhigh when shot unless they are full of explosives The plot involved Wiper's character having the worst day or two ever sort of like Sean Penn in UTurn squared. Fairly early on some of the things made me roll my eyes and wonder if Wiper was quietly trying to turn the film into total camp. He wasn't and that's a problem when the viewer wonders that. Some of the characters were total howlers. But one word of praise Andre Braugher more or less stole the show. I was not familiar with him. IMDb says he was in Glory but I do not recall his part.

	schema:headline " Fairly amateur stuff but not completely unwatchable";
	schema:reviewBody "Scott Wiper. When I first heard his name I immediately thought of it as one of those I have on my mental 'avoid all works by'list. Then I looked him up and found out that I remembered his name from the writing credit for the truly awful film The Last Marshall. Being the forgiving guy that I am I thought what the hey he only wrote that horrendous piece of trash maybe a film directed by him won't be as bad. Well I was partly right. It's not as bad but it is pretty bad. The plot makes no sense on any conceivable level. To give a quick summary bearing in mind that I didn't pay much attention to the first ten minutes of the filmwhich seemed to make no sense and have no clear connection to the remaining 80 but maybe that's just me and little to no attention to the last 1520 it seemed to be about some guy who disappears never to be seen again and the rest of the film has a bunch of people looking for him. The plot goes from unlikely event to unlikely event and it's going to take all of your suspension of disbelief to swallow even half of this stuff. I'll give you two quick examples At one point a character has to hide for some hours... so he does what any of us would do... he climbs down a toilet. Now after those hours have passed he emerges and takes a deep breath. So we're basically supposed to believe he somehow could hold his breath for that long? Another point is when the villains throw not one not two but three grenades right after each other. And at no other point in the movie do we even get a hint that they might have anything other than guns. Seriously those three grenades just rolling into frame... that was a moment ofwhat I suspect is unintentional hilarity. I can't imagine someone seeing that scene and not laughing at least a little. Then there's the repetitiveness the lack of imagination displayed in the writing. Several points in action scenes have tension being broken by the main characters damn wristwatch beeping. Turn the bloody thing off that's what any normal person would do. One guy seems to get shot over and over without ever dying or even coming to serious harm. The acting is pretty bad most of the time and it's clear that most of the casting was done based on physical appearance rather than acting talentmade evident by how small a part Joe Pantoliano has even though he's easily the most talented person involved in the project. The cinematography has its moments but mostly it's just dreadful. Half of the action is nearly impossible to make out as there are too few 'covershots'meaning we don't see the movement we see the beginning andor the end result but not the action itself and half of the stuff is done with handheld camera and in long takes clearly showing the pure laziness of Mr. Wiper. The action is nearly constant but about as unrealistic as the plot. We don't really connect with any of the characters and by the end of the film we just don't care anymore. Too many lazy stereotypes in the place of actual characters and too many plot holes. The dialog varies but the majority of it is poor. There's really nothing memorable or worthwhile in this film and most people should just skip it. I recommend it only to diehard fans of action flicks. 610".

Scott Wiper did a great job putting this film together.  The action scenes were well done and the cast was fantastic.  I was drawn into the movie because of the violent action scenes but it was the dialogue that kept my interest.  The opening scene had some of the most original dialogue I have heard in a long time.  A Better Way to Die had a great plot and I liked the theme of Boomer trying to get out of the police life but constantly being drug back in.  Boomer even had one of the hottest women alive to come home to once he was done with the force Natasha Henstridge so that was a bonus for any redblooded testosterone filled American male!

With that all said let's face the reality that Scott Wiper like Eastwood and Glenn is all sex all the time. The guy has that charisma and a body to back it up even when the script gets a little bumpy. Lou Diamond Phillips whose career also has its hormonal side actually turns in a good performance as the complicated secret agent. Andre Braugher while consistently earnest seemed to be portraying the last six characters I've seen him play. I can understand why this film has gotten a fair amount of notice in the European market.

This movie started strong for me maybe compared to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas minus the drugs meets the second half of True Romance they even throw in a hot blonde to sauce up the mix.

Although the camerawork and locations are nice the style of the film leaves a bit to be desired. Like many films at the time the intertitle cards OFTEN describe action about to happen ruining any sense of anticipation or describe people such as saying one is 'no good' instead of showing that the person is shiftless. Now this is not to say it's a bad filmthis sort of storytelling was common at that time. But it does detract a bit from the film. What IS nice however is the location shoot among the redwoods as well as having a heroine who is not just some whining girl but a woman of action and depth. For lovers of old silents this is great stuff. For those not acquainted you might want to try a few other films first due to the old fashioned even for 1914 style.".

In fact of course as more and more silent films become available this has been shown to be completely false. By 1914 not only were all European countries turning out plenty of fulllength feature but Japan China India and Latin America had all produced features at least of medium length around 40 mins. In the US the MPPC sometimes known as the Edison Trust spearheaded by Edison and Biograph had done its damndest to stem the tide but not in fact with any marked success because the majority of companies no longer accepted its hegemony.So in 1914 there were such films as Joseph in the Land of Egypt Cinderella Home Sweet Home Griffith for Majestic The Wrath of the Gods Rip Van Winkle The Wishing Ring Martin Eden Tillie's Punctured Romance A Florida Enchantment The Sign of the Cross. Many more films run about 4045 minutes and I am sure the list could be extended and will be extended as more and more other features are rediscovered and restored. The question of running time in minutes is a bit illusory because it depends very much on running speed and the way the restoration of the film has been put together credits length of time allowed for intertitles etc. So a film that in its current runs 50 mins and another that runs 80 mins may in fact be pretty much the same length. The original films themselves varied considerably in how they dealt with peripheral or incidental material. In the case of this film a very leisurely six or seven minutes to the visual introduction of all the characters a common enough practice but rarely quite so extended. Most of the early fulllength features relied on traditional material and many were westerns generally westerns of a certain literary turn  so absent from the list above just in 1914 there was The Call of the North The Squaw Mam DeMille's first go at it The Virginian Te Bargain William Hart's first feature and The Spoilers as well as Salomy Jane. So there is nothing whatever exceptional about this film either in terms of its length or its content.The quality of US features was still rather poor. Tourneur's The Wishing Ring is the only one that can bear comparison with Cabiria Italy or The Mysterious X Denmarkor Mute Witnesses and The Child of the Big CityRussia or Engelein Germany or La Fille de Delft FranceBelgium or Le Roman d'un Mousse France.".

	schema:headline " Beatriz Michelena  Girl of Many Talents!!";
	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost Beatriz and her sister both inherited their father's talent as an opera singer and from the time she was a child she was taken on as a member of the Princess Chic Opera Company and given roles befitting her age. Films were an after thought when her husband set up California Motion Picture Company  the CMPC especially for showcasing his pretty young wife's career. Salomy Jane was the first feature and given quite a premiere with invitation only tickets. Viewers were impressed by the beautiful Californian scenery the giant Redwoods rocky bluffs and the wild Russian River. Beatrix also appealed and her husband started to see her as a threat to Mary Pickford.All stops were pulled out to make this a spectacular production  even taking several minutes to introduce all the players. The disreputable Hang Town is where all the characters converge  the villainous Red Pete hanging around his hard working laundress wife only long enough to bully her and take her money. The Stranger Jack Dart House Peters who is on a mission to get the reprobate who ruined his sister and last but not least Salomy Jane and her pa already a marked man a horse dealer who leases a rundown house out of town. Jane has already had to fight off Dart's man and in a very realistic fight scene Dart who is only known as the man kills him in a bloodied fight to the finish. Meanwhile Red Pete has been involved in a stage coach robbery and Yuba Bill the driver who has been shot makes it back to town with a full and vivid description.In the title role Beatriz is fiery displaying her Latin temperament but she is no Mary Pickford and shows by her expansive and flowery gestures that she still has a lot to learn about movie acting. The big plus for the film is the beautiful location shooting the horse chases through the forest the daring descent of the stranger from the bridge into the stream below the sliding of Red Pete down a canyon and the perilous journey across the river on a log by Jane and her man!! All filmed against the panoramic scenery of the Californian forests. Even though this movie wasn't profitable word of mouth convinced Michelena's husband George Middleton that she could be a star of the first magnitude so from then on every film produced was intended as a star vehicle for Beatriz. Unfortunately her ego and demands sent production costs sky rocketing and by 1916 the company was shut down and declared bankrupt. Handsome House Peters was nicknamed The Star of a Thousand Emotions and it was clear in this movie that he wasn't the strong silent type  he had a real personality. He started his career on a high note playing opposite Mary Pickford in In the Bishop's Carriage. Although he said he preferred villains he was typecast as a hero from the start but he didn't have a long career. In 1924 he signed with Universal hoping for a comeback that didn't eventuate and he soon descended into bit parts.Highly Recommended.".

Three horny teenage friends spend most of the film searching for love sex and parties and they find all three in abundance. This film has a magnificent soundtrack of late 50s early 60s classics which was released on blue vinyl in the UK and some way over the top comic sequences which belie its nonmainstream production values this film was made as a GermanIsraeli co productionby director Boaz Davidson. One of the stars Zachi Noy Huey the overweight kid has gone on to become a major star in his home country even starring in a 9th instalment of the series released this year  see the imdb for further details. So besides the music I love the romance I love the comedy and I love the sex scenes which come across as very dirty in certain scenes. The first two sequels Going Steady and Hot Bubblegum are also sheer brilliance the fourth film Private Popsicle is okay but the fifth in the series BABY LOVE is possibly the most awesome teenage film EVER made!! See it if you can find a copy  come on lets have DVD releases please!! Number 6 is total rubblish and 78 and 9 don't seem to have been translated into English yet or released in English anyway.Footnote Lemon Popsicle was remade in the US in the mid80s as THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN which also features a phenomenal 80s soundtrack and is recommended to all!! Any other fans of the series please contact me.".

Well firstly by stating that this is obviously a subjective view.But to the movie.This was released in the UK on video in the early 1980's. It's the story of Benji Bobby and Huey well atleast those were the names in the English translation. This is an Israeli not sure if that's how you spell that but you get the point movie. It tells the story of the Boys search for Love and..... Sex basically. Making the point early on that the two are not necessarily connected.Benji the quiet one falls for a girl who he invites to a party she says no but then turns up with his best friend the good looking' one True to life or what! She eventually succumbs to Bobby's advances and gets pregnant at which point he dumps her. Benji stands by her organising an abortion and paying for it well I never said this was a family film. At which point as soon as they return home .. well check out the end yourself if you can get a copy that is why I don't know but this is almost impossible to obtain a copy of. Other stories revolve around the boys visit to a prostitute their catching of an embarrassing condition And their run in with an Italian nymphomaniac while delivering ice.So basically if you want to categorise this movie it's a sex comedy set in the 1960's. But it's more than that. For a start it has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard and the story and characterisation is in my opinion well up to the standard of Hollywood".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently found out that Lemon Popsicle is considered to be the world's first teen sex comedy. It helped start all those ones in the 1980s like Porky's. Anyways Lemon Popsicle if anything is more of a drama with a few comedic moments. If you know this you will enjoy the film more. Lemon Popsicle stars Yifatch Kitzur as Benji the nice guy Jonathan Sagall is the good looking one who plays Bobby and Zachi Noy plays Hughie the Fat one who honestly is just there for comedic relief. One day a beautiful new girl named Niki moves too town and Benji immediately falls in love with her. But she likes Bobby just because he is better looking. Eventually Bobby gets Niki pregnant and when he finds out he wants nothing to do with her. And Benji being the nice guy pays for Niki's abortion and takes care of her. She invites him to her 18th birthday party and she is in the arms of Bobby leading Benji to be very sad in the end. I definitely recommend this film it is very relatable and realistic.".

First to say I always wanted to watch this film but never had the guts to do so back then. Haven forgotten the title as years passed I'm now 23 years old and just watched it for the first time  and I have to say I'm totally stunned! The story line is very down to earth and pure realistic I would guess about 90 of everyone watching this movie has had some of the same experience in his early teenage years. So don't get it wrong this isn't comedy or a sexfilm at all it's pure drama  and when you know this in forehand you will get what you are searching for. I've read many reviews about people comparing this movie to American Pie and other modern teenagemovies. You shouldn't do that. This film is very far above the ones named and totally in another category  you cannot compare such two extremely different movies with another! As for the acting even though for some scenes you normally should dislike some of the characters you will love them anyway. Reason is that you know what happens is so realistic you could have been any of the characters yourself. And this is what makes the movie worth 10 stars! Open your memorybox and take a timewarp back to when you were 15 in case you were 15 in the early '90s or earlier.".

Hope fluffs the idea off but this only makes Lucy more determined especially when she's working with director Rip Torn and producer John Dehner.There are a ton of characters not in the original play which took place in the HopeBall apartment. The addition of a lot of these people allowed Hope and Lucy to engage in some of their traditional comedy which they didn't do in The Facts of Life and paid dearly for it.This has to be the only film I know where the 'other' woman is the first wife. Marilyn Maxwell who it was reputed Hope was involved with around 1950 and who appeared in The Lemon Drop Kid with him sees her chance back with him as Rip Torn starts to get interested in Lucy.Bob and Lucy get good support from a well chosen cast of familiar faces and Critic's Choice should please their fans.".

The various phases that Lucy goes through in 'finding her muse' are true to life and even somewhat inspiring. The reaction of others  especially critichusband Hope's subtle jealousy  will be familiar to anyone who's ever tried to do creative work.But most of all I love this film because it is often screamingly funny. Some of the dialog with Hope's exwife is very sharp. One of my favorite lines in any movie comes from Hope after breaking the mainspring of his watch Symbolism. I cannot stand symbolism! Hope spends almost the latter third of the film roaring drunk delivering some of his best schtick. His scene in the theater balcony almost made me wet myself when I first saw it and remains a classic slapstick moment. Again all the funnier because it happens in such a believable context. As Charlie Chaplin pointed out when a clown takes a pratfall it's not nearly as funny as when a pompous stuffedshirt does it.If you haven't seen this film keep an eye out for it you've got a real treat in store.

	schema:reviewBody "Mention the name Lucille Ball and what comes to mind for most of us is the zany character in the longrunning 1950s TV comedy show I Love Lucy. But I wonder if Lucy started out with a wish to be a comedienne or if she had her eyes on any other fields of stage or screen. Comedy was part of her early roles but she also had roles in which she sang and danced Dance Girl Dance of 1940. And there can be no doubt about her acting ability from such dramatic and suspense films as Valley of the Sun and The Big Street in 1942 or The Dark Corner in 1946 or Lured in 1947. On the other hand there's little doubt about Bob Hope's aspirations. From his earliest days in vaudeville Hope was a comedian and he would always be a comedian. For all his kidding aside about earning as Oscar Bob knew that he had little chance because Oscar very rarely went to a comedian. He even made his overt desire for an Oscar a part of his long running comedy routines and it was sure to get a laugh decade after decade That doesn't mean that Bob Hope didn't do some very funny movies. But his type of humor wasn't the subtle clever or zany type that usually involved great or very good acting. Clark Gable James Stewart Carole Lombard and Claudette Colbert were some of the very accomplished dramatic actors who could do Oscarwinning caliber comedy in movies. Bob's comedy forte was the oneliner. Or make that a string of one liners one after the other. And in that he often aroused some great laughter. So that brings us to this movie Critic's Choice. This film is meant to be a semiserious movie about Broadway and a critic's life with a comedic outlook. And Lucy plays a serious character a straight man to Bob's wisecracks and oneliners. I think it was intended as a light comedy to begin with sans any zaniness on Lucy's part. The very funny parts are in the last half with Bob. He has some zany scenes himself and a few strings of oneliners that bring out loud laughter. Some examples are This is the drunkenest room I've ever been in. This apartment's all uphill. And I'd just like to be there when we get where I'm going. Critic's Choice is a nice film for an evening of light entertainment and worth watching just to see two of the great comics of all time together.".

Instead of being a bit of a bungler at life and love  which was very likable  he tried to become more suave and sophisticated. Mostly in my view that didn't turn out too well. In fact despite another 8 films before his film career ended this was the last that I felt was good...and I mean darned good. So why does it tend to often get poor reviews? Very simple. While there is humor in it this film is really a drama with the exception of the drunk escapade where it  unfortunately  becomes slapstick. And that's not what most people expect from Bob Hope or Lucille Ball. Nevertheless Hope could be quite good at drama e.g. The Seven Little Foys and Beau James...and is darned good here. And Lucy wasn't really a comedienne but rather a comedic actress...there's a big difference between the two. And here she does very nicely in what is pretty much a dramatic role.As I said there is some humor here but it's mostly a fairly dramatic story line about the wife of a critic who writes a play. Will it be good or bad? Will he or won't he review it? And if he does what will be the consequences? Marilyn Maxwell has a part as Hope's exwife incidentally you might want to Google Marilyn Maxwell  Bob Hope. I kept trying to figure out who the director in the film was...not quite recognizable...turned out to be a very young Rip Torn...and he was appropriately slightly sleazy...and actually quite funny. Jessie Royce Landis was always a welcome addition to any film...and usually as the motherinlaw. John Dehner was good as a Broadway producer. And it was nice to see Jim Backus as a psychiatrist! Child actor Ricky Kelman did a great job here! At least nowadays it's pretty clear why this film gets some negative reviews. It's very sexist. The husbandcritic constantly puts his wife down for her work on writing a play he then savages the play in a review and then puts her in her place  bed after which he reviews their lovemaking. Unfortunately Bob didn't realize the times were changing.It's a mixed bag with some very good acting.".

	schema:headline " This Is Not Really A Comedy  It's More Of A Marital Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "When you watch a film that starred two legends of comedy Lucille Ball and Bob Hope you expect to find a very funny movie. And yes Critic's Choice has some amusing parts to it. As a comedy it's more Bob Hope style than Lucille Ball style. The humour is more subtle and ironic more like Hope than the kind of slapstick physical comedy that Ball was known for  although it does include some physical comedy surprisingly given to Hope in the last half hour or so. But to call this movie a comedy I think is to miss the point. I saw it as more of a drama even more a psychological study of Hope's character. He played Parker Ballantine a fierce Broadway critic for a New York newspaper while Ball plays his wife Angie who gets it into her head to write a play about her early life with her mother and three sisters. If I were to rate this as a comedy I'd probably say that it fell flat  but I was actually quite taken with the story and the character of Parker. He was an unpleasant character. Yes Hope played him with some comedy  but he wasn't a nice man. Once Angie decided to write her play very early in the movie Parker wouldn't let his critic's voice go. He discouraged her he belittled her he made fun of her  and most of it while couched as a comedy was actually rather mean and not funny. When the movie opened Parker was writing a scathing review of a play that starred his exwife who was played by Marilyn Maxwell. That goes almost immediately into his acerbic attitude toward Angie's play. The point gets made in the movie that maybe Parker has a problem  he disses everything that the women who are close to him try to do almost as if he's trying to sabotage them and their careers as if he doesn't want a successful woman in his life. And although there's an attempt to redeem him slightly at the end Parker's most obnoxious scenes come late in the movie at the theatre the night Angie's play opens in New York. Having withdrawn from reviewing the play he shows up anyway  drunk and frankly obnoxious I'm not sure why he wouldn't have been kicked out of the theatre or even why he was allowed in in the first place  tries to kick his paper's reviewer out and when he can't do that goes up to the balcony and causes quite a scene this is where Hope's physical comedy comes in. He then proceeds to write a review of the play anyway and his review is blistering as he writes that the play was written by Angela Ballantine directed by Dion Kapakos and produced by mistake. I must admit that I wondered why his paper would allow a drunken reviewer  even a big name one  to write a review of a play written by his own wife to which someone else had been assigned as the reviewer but maybe that's thinking too much about this.This was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a light comedy  instead I got more of a drama about a couple with some really serious issues in their marriage. And while I wouldn't rate it that highly as a comedy I thought that if you look at it as a marital drama it's actually pretty good. For me the most powerful scene in the movie didn't even involve Ball  it was the very dramatic and even acerbic confrontation between Parker and his son John played by Ricky Kelman  who seems to have irritated a few reviewers but who I thought was actually pretty good playing a kid who had obviously been raised in a somewhat strange environment. The scene was set at home on opening night before Parker's drinking binge. That confrontation aside John's relationship with his mother Maxwell was especially weird  she seems to have been largely uninterested in him and he calls her not Mom but Ivy.There's a decent supporting cast  most of whose names Rip Torn Jim Backus Richard Deacon and even Soupy Sales add to the expectation that you're going to be watching a funny movie. But I would suggest not watching this to get a good laugh even if that is your initial expectation. Watch it as more of a character study of Parker. It works much better that way. 710".

It was perhaps the stilted dialog made nearly unbearable by the fact that it was poorly dubbed into English. Maybe the film would have worked better in black and white or as a silent. Maybe not...The films final sequence stretching over the last seven minutes redeems nearly all its faults. The carefully composed shots alternating between the faces of the stars and a play being performed on stage with a remarkable backdrop of an old Spoletto basilica empowered by moving music brings us closest to the characters. Once again the socalled silent moment dominates the film showing us the director's capabilities in full bloom. The tension is enhanced by an increased tempo in editing leading perfectly to the climax. For what may be a deeply flawed film I feel bad for the people that left early.

Heck Tom Cruise apparently chews the scenery in ordinary life or at least on talk shows.However I found there was a kind of chemistry and disturbing reality in Bardot's portrayal of the sex kitten. She was one moment almost catatonic and another bubbly. But how contemporary to see the star as a kind of trapped animal like a fox with dogs and hunters in pursuit. One could see this movie being remade with Brittany or another of the modern celebutantes in the starring role. Was Bardot playing herself? Well isn't that the kind of truth we look for in art? Malle could have been alluding to Marilyn or any modern celebrity caught in the maelstrom of fame. The relationship with Mastroanni seemed especially perceptive. He wants to protect her but she wants to live and she can't. Certainly think Brittney could relate to this one especially to Jill's own mother selling her out to the press. We've seen that one lately haven't we.Not a fun movie but one that stays with you and that's rare these days.".

The director collaborated with Jean Paul Rappeneau and Jean Ferry in the screen play which might have made more sense in the original version that what it does in the one we saw.The story about the beautiful Jill who at first is seen as wanting to be a ballerina changes without any explanation as this young woman is discovered for the movies something that even for France never occurs in such a quick fashion and we can't buy it. Then at the pinnacle of her fame Jill is thrown into despair as she can't cope with the invading horde of paparazzi that hound her and don't let her live a normal life. Jill runs back home to Geneva to be with her mother and then she turns into Fabio who was seeing her best friend.The film is tedious at best. Marcello Mastroianni and Brigitte Bardot appear to be going through the motions but actually there is no chemistry between them. These two attractive stars seem to have been cast just for their allure to fans but actually they never connect.".

Not a guy but emotion to be able to feel the same way inside as others do. Of course she meets a guy. You expect the movie to continue as a romantic comedy with comedic lines from her roommate and friends and the usual awkwardness when the girl keeps lies from the guy.Instead Wake took a fairly dark turn and meandered through various genres not usually associated with romantic comedy. I was pleased that it didn't take the predictable route but I was also put off by how weird and jarring the film had become.Ultimately the film is a character drama about Carys. In this regard the film was quite good Carys is a unique and original character she has her flaws and she is captivating. Carys' journey to understand herself and human nature is beautiful.Becareful of labelling this as a romantic comedy and be on the look out for odd turns but as a character drama this film can be enjoyed. If you're looking for something different that you can't quite put your finger on then Wake is your choice.".

We were not familiar with Bijou Phillips before this movie but she was perfectly cast as the heroine or protagonist. I'm going to watch for more of her movies in the future.

	schema:reviewBody "I had no idea what to expect from this but I'm familiar with Bijou Phillip's work and although she usually plays trashy characters this one is definitely her best role yet and would love to see her play more of them. There was something different about her she looked fantastic! She comes off as a quirky sweet offbeat woman called Carys pronounced Careriss who apparently has no feelings towards others until she attends a strangers funeral and meets her future love Tyler Ian Somerhalder who's mourning the death of his fianc Anna. Carys lives with her hilarious roommate Lila Marguerite Moreau who has major issues of her own she also shares personal thoughts with her best friend Shane Danny Masterson a funeral director who is accused by Tyler for possibly taking Anna's engagement ring that has mysteriously disappeared off her finger. Meanwhile Carys later discovers that Tyler may be hiding something too.The movie had great chemistry between the characters and I found it perfectly engaging which is rare for me when it comes to these rare types of story lines that sound like it might be awful but completely surprises you in the end. I would definitely call it original something you wouldn't expect in a movie.It pretty much offers everything from plenty of light humor that doesn't overshadow the rest of the film romance with a touch of mysterysuspense. Depending on the way you view it it's actually kind of tragic too because the story deals with the death of a loved one more than once. One thing I would change about the film is a little more emphasis on Tyler's dead fianc Anna maybe some flashbacks of their time together? I think if we met her instead of just hearing about how wonderful she was we would feel more sympathy for Tyler losing her.It's not a sappy PG13 romanticcomedy type although it may seem that way in the beginning with the whole ring thing. Rated R for language although not frequent  more than one fword and two love scenes  one being particularly steamy without nudity. I would say it's something that's worth watching more than once seen it twice and if you don't take the dialog too seriously you will most likely enjoy it too.".

I really liked Carys's hobby  going to funerals I thought it was unusual but also something no one ever thought of before or at least it was new to me. The plot however ... I guess they needed something the movie to revolve around so they came up with the part about the ring. Terrible terrible idea. I was ready to get over it after all I was only 15 min in so I decided to give this movie a chance. Next thing you know the grieving fianc falls for his dead girl alleged friend. Really?!

I really liked Carys's hobby  going to funerals I thought it was unusual but also something no one ever thought of before or at least it was new to me. The plot however ... I guess they needed something the movie to revolve around so they came up with the part about the ring. Terrible terrible idea. I was ready to get over it after all I was only 15 min in so I decided to give this movie a chance. Next thing you know the grieving fianc falls for his dead girl alleged friend. Really?! Also I hated Bijou's poor acting skills Or maybe it was the bad script? I go back and forth on that.

How on Earth could you be flirting with a girl you met at your fianc's funeral? Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. It's not endearing to fall in love with a woman you meet at your beloved's funeral it's appalling. I didn't even bother to continue watching this film as soon as the scene began with Carys and Tyler in a restaurant flirting with each other. I couldn't bear a second more of such a frivolous display of love. This movie insults the very nature of human emotion and the character Tyler seems unmoved by his fianc's tragic death. However if you have no concept of love and the plot of this movie does not offend your ideals of what romance should be then go ahead and watch this piece of trash.".

Fonda was perfect and more on that later. Second this is not about a cowboy freeing a horse who is about to be drugged as some reviewers have said. The horse was drugged from the beginning. Sonny noticed it and that was a contributing factor to his subsequent actions.This movie is about a man who strayed far from who he was and who sought to find himself again. The horse is metaphoric it is drugged exploited and broken just like the man. So the man attempts to find himself as he helps the horse find itself again so to speak. And in the process of trying to report the story the Fonda character attempts to find herself as well for she has become neurotic pillpopping and uptight in her quest to become a star reporter. And of course as they travel the countryside we find America.Back to Fonda. Fonda's casting has always been that of the strong but flawed career woman from Barbarella to Klute to Electric Horseman. She is independent doesn't need a man. As the tough and aggressive reporter in personal crisis she is cast perfectly. St. James has neither the strength nor the necessary equal dose of vulnerability that Fonda can muster. This is about chemistry as well. Redford and Fonda have teamed up before and the chemistry is proved.So this brilliant and simple story illustrates and creatively reinforces the the idea of straying from true nature and the need to find it again.VERY good film.".

The acting leaves little to be desired. The writing is good. The characters are at least average. The music is very fitting.

When he discovers plans are afoot to drug his horse lest it become too adventurous he rides off into the desert followed closely by a reporter named Hallie Martin Fonda. At first Hallie is simply seeking an exclusive story but as you can imagine before too long the sparks are flying. Meanwhile other forces are also after the runaway horseman who just wants to return the horse to nature and himself to a simpler life.The chemistry here between Redford and Fonda is wonderful as they share basically an outdoor camping trip. Apart from that the movie is primarily imparting a message about commercialism in our modern society especially the evils of using both people and animals for profit. I was interested to read that Robert Redford actually bought for himself the horse Rising Star that was used in this film. It isn't any masterpiece but certainly an entertaining movie that points to the beauties of a simple country life.".

Jane Fonda is a reporter who wants to interview Redford but he just blows her off. Redford is basically upset always being told what to do and he steals a 12 million dollar horse that they're mistreating and he's going to take it out and set it free. The company that owns the horse wants to keep it quiet and then wants to send in the police. Fonda tracks him down and joins up with him so she can get a bigger story and of course they have to fall in love. This movie seems to be a cross between It Happened One Night and Lonely Are The Brave. This was directed by Sydney Pollock who has worked with Redford several times before and also with Fonda.".

There are no quick putdowns and oneliners comprised of single syllable words. And when I say adult I don't mean the bawdy toilet film making styles that literally pollute the media air.The Electric Horseman is mainstream cinema from the closing era of the 1970s. When people wearing ties and blouses attended the movie house and did so politely.In this regard The Electric Horseman is a throwback to another era when people had more comport in their personal presentation and demonstrated an amount of civility and societal understanding. Even so corporate greed is exposed in the plot as well as the foibles of a femmereporteress whose hunger for success shows her inner soul to both character and audience appropriately played by Jane Fonda.The stalwart American society is also appropriately reflected in Robert Redford's character who gives us a character who must rediscover his awe shucks self through an act of humanity for the sake of a stricken and exploited living breathing creature that cannot speak for itself Rising Star.Cinematography is professional as are all elements of this film. No performance is overstated save for Fonda but if I know Pollack that was intentional. The feminist climbing the media ladder and forgetting her ideals by breaking the rules for the sake of those ideals is met with the hasbeen buckaroo who has similarly rediscovered who and what he is.The romance is standard Hollywood 101 but though not entirely necessary is still appropriate and in this regard probably satisfying to the audiencemen and women alike.It's not a deep film on a personal level but it is profound on the character level. We sympathize with the characters and identify with them in a detached manner. They are extensions of us or what we might've been were we in those situations.No flashy cuts no CGI no rumbling sound effects no splashy cinema effects of anykind standard lensing tight scripting and solid thesping make this film a sight for sore eyes.Thank you Mister Pollack Mister Redford... and I'd never thought I'd say it but thank you Mizz Fonda.".

I read once that Redford and Nelson sat next to each other on an airplane flight and Redford asked Willie if he wanted to be in the movie.

Instead of hopping up on the horse he deems disrespected Sonny steals him taking to the country. Sonny hope to release the horse back into the wild it's true habitat but has a hard time shaking a news reporter AliceJane Fondawho wants the big story involving his journey evading police and those out to find him thanks to the cereal company he works for whose head is Hunt SearsJohn Saxon.Light and harmless but irresistible thanks to the charming leads and their chemistry on screen. Add some good location work and some good supporting players like Valerie Perrine as Sonny's flighty ex and Willie Nelson as Wendell one of his cowboy buddies.As can happen in these kind of Hollywood romancers on the road regarding a fugitive the media plays a major role in Sonny's rise to fame for doing what he believes is right despite what consequences might occur later.";

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie for the chemistry of the stars  the message that not everything should be subjected to the Almighty Dollar. As others have pointed out the story is a bit too simple but that's OK too. What caused me to lower my rating from 67 to a rating of 5 is the lack of internal consistency. Redford's character is tremendously concerned over the welfare of this beautiful thoroughbred horse  I'm concerned too. The main premise of the film is that the horse's welfare is more important than the money to be made off this animal. The horse has ligament damage in a front leg it's full of water per Redford so Redford saves the horse from exploitation being part of a stage show  being photographed by stealing it. Later to try to escape the police Redford rides this injured horse for about 10 miles it seems at high speed perhaps 2025 mph? over hill dale gullies a bridge through water rock strewn ravines etc. Never mind the lack of reality here that an injured horse would never be able to accomplish this. But how about Redford's feeling for the animal? He's supposed to be so concerned for the horse's welfare but it is he who subjects the horse to the most grueling damage possible! The lack of internal consistency in this film is that the man who supposedly cares the most about the horse is the one who inflicts the most injury to it. And this makes no sense within the context of the film.".

To be honest it rarely breaks out of a trot as it depicts Redford's commercially compromised fading rodeo star's rage against the machine of corporate America as personified by greysuit man John Saxon and his entourage which anger he improbably decides is best channelled by riding his drugaddled horse a former champion itself out of an Expo in Las Vegas out into the Nevada desert to set the poor beast free to return to nature. Fonda is the inquisitive reporter who initially gets under Redford's Sonny Steel character's skin but wouldn't you know it ends up under his covers before the end.That's about the plot only Pollack extends the drama for want of a better word to well over two hours. We're meant to root for Redford's unreliable womanising drunkard of a character presumably cutting him some slack because he's obviously just not found himself yet but Fonda's character Hallie is even more problematic a throwback to the Barbara Stanwyck  Jean Arthur persona of the hardbitten reporter who turns out to have a heart of gold. In truth she brings neither warmth or nuance to the role metaphorically and physically stomping all over the place in her highheel boots. I didn't get much sense of chemistry between the two either despite Pollack's best and worst efforts the latter an undoubtedly blatant attempt to rehabilitate Hanoi Jane by having her heartily sing not one but two American anthems on the roadtrip.In the film's favour it's nicely shot and Willie Nelson's soundtrack songs fit to a T in fact his undemonstrative acting in what was his debut movie steals what little show there is here.

One of the best performances ever by Redford. And one of the best chase scenes anywhere anytime. The best thing about this film is its quiet humour. It keeps throwing out these curve balls just at the right time to surprise you and charm you. In between it takes potshots at just about everyone. First the cowboys and the way they have especially in Hollywood too often allowed themselves to be made into a product  think of Roy Rogers and the Cisco Kid et al all gussied up in the campest outfits you can imagine. Hollywood made the West gay LONG before Brokeback Mountain hit the screen! Next it takes on the big corporations which once again only care about money and don't care who or what they exploit in order to get it. This is in fact the easiest potshot in the film cause there is nothing really new here. And I can't really imagine a corpoation allowing itself to just say goodbye to a 12 million dollar horse. Finally it also takes a shot at the media who are just as bad as the corporations since they ARE corporations usually and the journalists who are almost ready to sell their souls for a good story. Nevertheless with Redford and Fonda it works. The film tends to drag a bit near the end when they are camping out and the requisite falling in love is a bit pat but it isn't overdone and well why not? The entire film is pretty much unbelievable but it IS entertaining and that's all it really expects to be. And above all the chase scene is worth the price of admission.".

Anyway there are myriad examples floating around in the ether. Jim Thorpe All American. There's also the story of a kinda dumb but regular guy who is followed around by a cute sophisticated lady with her own agenda and who betrays him before realizing her mistake. It was a Frank Capra specialty. Meet John Doe will serve.The elements don't quite come together. Redford is not a hick although he tries hard. He's an ex champion rodeo rider but we don't learn anything about the skills that are involved. He's been shat upon by Fortuna and now he's reduced to having his picture on boxes of breakfast cereal boozing it up and riding around on a Las Vegas stage in a phony cowboy suit that's lit up like a Christmas tree. His few friends  all of them good old boys like Willie Nelson  are sympathetic but what can they do except remain loyal? That last bit riding on stage in an electric suit is too much for Redford. He waves his hat at the crowd as he deliberately saunters the horse through somebody else's act out the door onto the street and into the wilderness just him and the ironically named Rising Star.Jane Fonda a TV anchor babe discovers where he is and joins him hoping for a story taking notes filming him secretly. But don't worry. After they've sat around the campfire for a couple of nights and get to know one another and after they've REALLY if improbably gotten to know one another she realizes that the corrupt city values she represents are revolting.The director and most of the others involved have dumbed the story down. The evil guys who represent Redford's sponsors are the kind of people known as suits. They all wear glasses most look effete a few look goofy and whatever the boss John Saxon thinks is the right thing to think. The good people are all rustics. Not only are they spiritually clean they'll give you the shirt off their backs.Redford doesn't help much. He's pretty taciturn  Yup and Nope  and that's okay as far as it goes but when he gets emotional he seems mannered. He's done a lot better than that. Jane Fonda looks pretty good considering her age. When she's wearing a wool cap pulled over her ears and staring wideeyed at Redford she looks like a pretty thirteenyear old with big teeth. But neither is really convincing. You rarely lose the conviction that you're watching two actors perform before a camera.I wonder if they had any trouble marketing this. The intended audience is clearly not urbanites or suburbanites but rather the people who live on small farms or isolated homesteads and who like to hunt. And who do the producers use to appeal to these good folk? Robert Redford Environmentalist Number one and Hanoi Jane. Or  well it's possible the producers were aiming lower than that. Maybe aiming for people who never heard of Redford and environmentalism or Fonda and the Vietnam war. I don't know who they were aiming at but as for me it was an easy bullet to dodge.Willie Nelson has a small part and he's a conundrum. I lost interest in country music years ago in the era of Slim Whitman and Hank Thompson. Proud to be a Okie from Muscogee sealed it. Yet here is Willie Nelson driving a big homemade vehicle that consumes nothing but biofuels. Most of the good old boys were better guitar pickers than they're given credit for but Nelson had a tendency to reach for deep unexpected harmonics. Good man Willie.".

When she's wearing a wool cap pulled over her ears and staring wideeyed at Redford she looks like a pretty thirteenyear old with big teeth. But neither is really convincing. You rarely lose the conviction that you're watching two actors perform before a camera.I wonder if they had any trouble marketing this. The intended audience is clearly not urbanites or suburbanites but rather the people who live on small farms or isolated homesteads and who like to hunt. And who do the producers use to appeal to these good folk? Robert Redford Environmentalist Number one and Hanoi Jane. Or  well it's possible the producers were aiming lower than that. Maybe aiming for people who never heard of Redford and environmentalism or Fonda and the Vietnam war. I don't know who they were aiming at but as for me it was an easy bullet to dodge.Willie Nelson has a small part and he's a conundrum. I lost interest in country music years ago in the era of Slim Whitman and Hank Thompson. Proud to be a Okie from Muscogee sealed it. Yet here is Willie Nelson driving a big homemade vehicle that consumes nothing but biofuels. Most of the good old boys were better guitar pickers than they're given credit for but Nelson had a tendency to reach for deep unexpected harmonics. Good man Willie.";

Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea. In the vein of classic courtroom dramas Sergeant Ryker is an extremely well crafted mystery ably guided by an outstanding cast director Kulik's constant momentum and effective plot twists and turns.This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many name actors and some action sequences. Dillman reprising his role is spoton as the doubting defence attorney whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of Ryker's supportive yet somewhat distant wife played with aplomb by Vera Miles. Rounding out the frontline is Peter Graves for the prosecution and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles.Marvin's interpretation of the Paul Ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he's placed. Marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference to impassioned denial of the charges giving a convincing often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise smallscale drama. It's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the bestever lists of courtroom dramas.However despite its apparent obscurity Sergeant Ryker still remains a taut and compelling examination like a book that you just can't put down.

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever this movie's origins it has Lee Marvin. What an actor. He brings something unexpected to every role almost to every scene.Here he is in a military prison in Korea. He's just been condemned to death as a traitor. His wife Vera Miles has flown six thousand miles to visit him in his cell. He loves her desperately. And how does he show it? He walks up to her puts his nose against hers for a moment or two and then quickly ENGULFS her in these long enwinding arms. A brief declaration of need and he spins away from her abruptly and gets back to his case. The whole scene takes about one minute and Marvin shows he can do a toe dance around anyone else in the film if the material allowed him to. In boot camp we were shown a training film illustrating the mechanics of courts martial. Lee Marvin before he was famous played a sailor who lies on the stand. He nailed the shifty tell perfectly.Not that the other performers are slouchers. They're all seasoned professionals. Vera Miles is pretty and her questions carry an English inflection. The terminal contours drop instead of rising in pitch. I don't mean that to seem complicated. If you hear her ask a question you'll know what I'm getting at. She's very appealing. Peter Graves is tall and sonorous. Murray Hamilton is always a treat even when he's shallow and leering as he is here. He's given one of the better lines roughly Imagine how Don Quixote would have felt if the windmills tilted back. Much of the movie depends on Bradford Dillman who gives the role everything he has but he doesn't bring much to the party. I don't know why. His lines here sound as if they're being recited in an acting class but he was chillingly good as the homosexual child murderer in Compulsion. The dependable and always likable Lloyd Nolan is the commanding general.Despite the difference in their ages both Nolan and Dillman were born in San Francisco attended prep schools and went to exclusive universities  Stanford and Yale respectively. I wonder if they ever discussed the city might they both have had dinner at Jack's Restaurant as Sam Spade did? Dillman and Marvin were both in the Marine Corps Dillman narrowly missed the Korean war and Marvin had part of his buttocks shot off in the Pacific. I wish someone would stop me from carrying on with these irrelevancies.The script lamentably doesn't match the cast. It's hurried and confused. Fifteen minutes into the movie and Marvin is given an angry speech about somehow being set up by a dead officer or something. It's reaches the audience as gibberish because there has been no forewarning. We don't know what he's talking about. A guess is that the editing is so screwed up because this was cobbled together from a twopart TV movie. What's left certainly looks like a TV movie. There are few sets the lighting is flat and the dialog could have come from The Twilight Zone or Combat or Gunsmoke. The musical score also smacks of TV.Buzz Kulik is an efficient and uninspired director. He was my director on the art house classic Too Young the Hero. Despite his inadequacies I managed to give a compelling performance as a drunken hobo the result of long practice. In this film he allows or encourages almost everyone to overact. How DARE you bring your ASSUMPTIONS into my COURTROOM! Something like that.The plot is full of holes some no doubt due to clumsy editing but the fact is that the climax lacks logic. Dillman exposes a security leak that has nothing to do with the case against Marvin  and it gets Marvin off. Problems should always be solved for the rest of us as easily as they are for Lee Marvin in this turbid drama.".

He's just been condemned to death as a traitor. His wife Vera Miles has flown six thousand miles to visit him in his cell. He loves her desperately. And how does he show it? He walks up to her puts his nose against hers for a moment or two and then quickly ENGULFS her in these long enwinding arms. A brief declaration of need and he spins away from her abruptly and gets back to his case.

This sums up the driving force behind the pretentious emptyheaded fumbles this movie attempts to make in an effort to inject it with some kind of profundity the like of which will no doubt appeal to people who have never experimented with thinking before but alas will leave anybody who can spell the word 'wheelbarrow' without spell check smacking their heads off the nearest hard surface with contempt for the foolishness being hurled in steaming handfuls at their functioning brains.They spraypainted Richard E Grant's hair gray for crying out loud.

But since there are clearly people commenting here who insist on overrating this nonsense wasteoftime testament to Madonna's failed education I will withhold that third point.If you like Grant or Hutz avoid this movie at all costs it's like watching them ritually humiliated by an idiot in the crudest and most unfortunate of fashions for a length of time that could qualify for a human rights violation.

	schema:reviewBody "OK so let me just say that I came into this as a huge fan of Eugene Hutz and Gogol Bordello and while I don't enjoy her music I like Madonna's persona and was very excited to see the film.On the upside this movie did have some interesting ideas on well... filth and wisdom sex work and art. Unfortunately the storytelling vehicle meant to get us to these ideas was so appalling that Mr. Hutz had to narrate them to us fairly explicitly. For ideas to work in a film WITHOUT an engrossing storyline those ideas better be pretty profound which these aren't otherwise it just looks like the amateurish work of an angsty teen which this did.To make it all the more disappointing the character set ups were GOOD. I wanted to like and know about each of the three protagonists and their relationships to each other. Unfortunately everything goes downhill after we meet them. Their back stories are only hinted at their motives and personalities onedimensional and their stated relationships lacked the slightest chemistry. The secondary characters were worse. So what happened and who do we hold accountable for ruining this film? Someone was handed a great cast to play exciting characters a nice little premise and some passable thematic ideas and yet it bombed. The real achievement of this film is that it managed to be as unwatchable as it was. The only real reason to sit through this pile is for the the sheer erotic thrill of seeing Eugene Hutz as a male dominatrix and if that doesn't get you rocks off then I'd just skip it all together.".

So I watched Filth And Wisdom with no preconceived notions even after reading so many bad reviews.Now that I've seen it I'll just say that this film makes no effort to force you to think and ask questions but simply lays out the overall message up front then just goes through the motions of showing it. There were moments of potential but at no point did I even remotely wonder how things might turn out for each character in the end. It just didn't occur to me to care enough.In short if you're a fan of Hutz's former roles in acting no less Gogol Bordello you'll probably enjoy seeing Hutz play himself in this role at most which features a scene of Gogol Bordello performing at the end. Filth and Wisdom however doesn't even come close to what you might have walked away with in Everything Is Illuminated. This film is just Madonna's effort to cash in on a new spotlight that no longer shines on her in my opinion.If you have no clue who Eugine Hutz or Gogol Bordello is and can care less on the other hand I advise you avoid this movie all together..... unless you're on a drug that can make almost anything interesting.Either way don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.".

AK played by Eugene Hutz in what I hope is a break through performance is a deeply philosophical Russian in a rock band who gets people to pay him to abuse them. The film is narrated by him as we see what he and his friends are going through. A small scale nothing of a film this is the sort of film that probably wouldn't have been noticed much without Madonna in the directors chair. then again there is something very much alive in the film with great characters  odd relationships and very good music that raises it up a couple of notches.
