	schema:reviewBody "A boy and his little sister are taken by their young uncle to spend their summer holiday at the country house of their grandparents.  They leave behind their father and a seriously ill mother who is hospitalised and awaiting an operation.  This comparatively early work by the great Taiwanese director Hou Xiaoxian has an idyllic look that is utterly deceptive.  Hou is too complex an artist to merely capitalise on the charms of children and landscape.  Indeed although bathed almost throughout in bright sunshine the film has a hard edge with never a hint of sentimentality. Hou always makes his audience work hard at making connections leading to understanding. Here he goes one step further by placing his young protagonists in an insecure world that strains their limited resources of comprehension and understanding.  The small girl understands little so spends her time clinging to a single toy more often than not a pink model of an electric fan.  Between them the children have to cope with barely understood encounters such as a mentally retarded girl who has been seduced by a lecherous birdcatcher and two youths who have mugged and robbed a truck driver.  Even the children themselves are no angels.  The girl irked by being left out of the group of boys' swimming games reacts by throwing their clothes in the river while earlier the boys tease a tortoise by driving a remotely controlled toy car at it.  Even the eponymous Grandpa is not the nice old buffer that the title might convey.  He is a country doctor and something of a tetchy martinet.  Although not overtly unkind he is obviously put out by anything that upsets his routine even to the extent of angrily attacking his son's moped with a bar of wood when he learns he has got his girlfriend pregnant.  Make no mistake the charm of childhood as depicted in a film like The Railway Children or even the wonderment of seeing things through innocent eyes  the marvellous Pather Panchali  are not part of this equation.  Even what seems at first sight to be an idyllic river valley is scarred by an ugly road flyover.  In his completely unsentimental depiction of  childhood Hou has given us a work of piercing observation and integrity.".

Hou shows how the children try to insulate themselves from the outside world but can never quite escape it being compelled to include adult events in their life of which they have little comprehension. TingTing writes beautiful letters to his parents that show a delicate sensitivity but also a lack of understanding of what the adults around him are up to.In typical Hou fashion each character has strong points and weaknesses. The grandfather Koo Chuen a doctor is loving but also harshly judgmental forbidding the children's uncle to marry his girlfriend and the uncle shows an immaturity that belies his age. The children also are complex characters whose reactions reflect their inability to express their feelings. For example when the boys go swimming without her TungTung lashes out by taking their clothes and floating them down the river. One of Hou's most accessible works and one of his warmest Summer at Grandpa's contains a hint of melodrama but it is balanced with Hou's typical sense of the natural rhythm and flow of life.".

The strict imposing grandfather who at first doesn't seem to like the kids I saw this just last week in Ford's Wee Willie Winkie and the crazy lady who later saves one of the children's lives come quickly to mind. A scene where TingTing gives her stuffed animal to a recovering patient of her grandfather's made me cringe a bit. But other than that it's a rather wonderful movie. The two children in particular are fantastic. When TungTung first meets up with local children they have a battle between his remote control car and another boy's pet turtle probably not the best scene to watch if you're a member of PETA however. In another scene the boys race their turtles. And there are more. The uncle kind of the black sheep of the family has a good subplot as well. Edward Yang the director of Yi Yi has a small role as the children's father. It's too bad this of all of Hou's movies is unavailable. I only liked Flowers of Shanghai better. 810.".

Pather Panchali did it for Satyajit Ray Amarcord for Fellini Where Is the Friend's House? for Abbas Kiarostami.  A Summer at Grandpa's seems to be Hou Hsiaohsien's entry into this genre and it fits in with those other great films perfectly. Having just recently seen 6 other Hou films in a retrospective this one does seem to be least like the others in terms of having a coherent narrative and fewer distancing effects.  However this IS like the others in terms of Hou's focus on everyday life on how people live their lives during the periods when hugely dramatic things aren't happening.  From shots like the one of discarded sunflower seeds on a train to the shot of a turtle trying to avoid a toy truck this is a film about the little things in life from a child's perspective.  What's so amazing about the film is that while portraying small everyday events more profound issues about family and death are dealt with in such a complex and subtle way.  The basic premise of the film without giving away too much is that two children go to their grandfather's house to live for the summer while their mother is sick in the hospital.  Clearly the absence of TingTing and TungTung's mother is deeply traumatic for both.  But Hou gets at this sorrow and confusion without ever simply stating it.  The best example of this is the relationship between TungTung and a mentally retarded woman which is one of the most affecting and beautiful relationships I've seen on film and it's all done without a word of dialogue.  This is a hard film to find in the U.S.  But if you ever have the opportunity to see A Summer at Grandpa's do see it. You'll get to experience one of the most deeply moving films about childhood that is out there.".

Earth is probably the more artistic of the two but Arsenal is more complex and it might also be a little closer  at least in places  to a conventional narrative.The first ten minutes or so of Arsenal are quite abstract with a succession of minimontages depicting a variety of subjects. It would be hard and perhaps inadvisable to assign a specific meaning to all of the symbols but they are clearly meant to convey some general ideas that apply to the story that follows which is set in the Ukraine as World War I or the Great War is coming to an end.The war sequences might be the most memorable part of the movie and the chilling laughing gas sequence is a more compelling comment on war than are the great majority of complicated carnagefilled scenes in other movies.The main story starts with the demobilization and it is clearly influenced by Dovzhenko's own perspective. He does his very best to resolve two seemingly contradictory priorities with his devotion to the Ukrainian people and his support for the Soviet state. He uses all his skills with interesting montages and other techniques including some creative camera angles that would even have impressed Orson Welles.As politics not all of it is convincing by any means but as cinema it is quite interesting and at times it provides good food for thought. The specific issues considered in the film may be limited to their own time and place but in asking what is best for his people Dovzhenko also raises some broader issues that allow the movie to retain some relevance in later eras as well.".

Arsenal's narrative only emerges if you concentrate on what you've seeing  comprehending and reassembling the puzzle of the images and movements that Dovzhenko has arranged to create causal and symbolic associations. Dovzhenko's camera is like the eye of God taking in a half dozen settings all of them connected though disparate in space and time.  Dovzhenko also is perfectly comfortable inserting the fantastic a talking horse or a faith in communism that deflects bullets into his retelling of a historical event. I watched the film several times before the plot was clear to me.I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a whole different approach to story telling.  There are many great images and some of the acting is very good the way Semyon Svashenko glances with disgust at one of the Ukrainian nationalists and slowly reaches out to touch his ribbon feeling it's lightness is an example but there is no easy way of getting past Dovzhenko's style.  You have to want to figure out this film. Dovzhenko's narrative technique is as unique as Robert Altman or Tsai MingLiang.".

This film exists as agitprop and while it contains phenomenal and ferocious imagery ultimately the singleminded viewpoint hobbles it as art and undercuts its slight attempts at humanity. While it can be viewed as a Revolutionary piece exhorting a 'proper' spirit of energy knowing it was made by a Ukrainian in 1929 while the Stalinist regime was either plotting or bumbling their way to the Great Famine makes this film deeply questionable in a moral sense. The theme of a Ukrainian learning Revolutionary values in the Great War then returning to destroy the 'corrupt' forces of 'old Ukraine' made me deeply uneasy. That said the imagery and sequences in this quite late silent film are second to none. The toothless laughing soldier is one of the most stunning single images ever committed to film and the general pacing with a deliberate lingering sense of time forces concentration on the setpieces. Much of the film is brutal inhuman and cruel. This is both an accurate representation of the setting itself and of the type of violent usvs.them propaganda produced by the Soviets at the time. I find this film VERY unsettling from a moral standpoint something I don't often find myself saying. But again the masterful and stunning imagery makes it well worth viewing more than once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be discouraged by this Soviet film's age or obscurity  it is one of the finest movies ever made and it stands alongside Carl Theodore Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc as the most modernist film of the 1920's. This is a spectacular visual achievement and its visionary conception of cinema is moderinism that we've still failed to catch up with. Unlike most recognized masterpieces of Soviet silent cinema e.g. The Battleship Potempkin Earth The End of St. Petersburg etc. however Arsenal is a surprisingly approachable film and its strangeness and abstraction are consistently fascinating. Originally intended as a propaganda film Arsenal is the second component of director Alexander Dovzhenko's Ukraine Trilogy and it details an episode in the Russian Civil War 1918 in which the Kiev Arsenal workers aided the Bolshevik army against the ruling Central Rada. Dovzhenko's approach is somewhat similar to Sergei Eisentein in that he relied heavily on montage but his pace was less frenetic and his Expressionism was more exaggerated. As detailed in the film's academic commentary Dovzhenko was previously a political cartoonist and you can see traces of this background in Arsenal. The characters in this film are caricatures sometimes grotesque and sometimes funny. Similarly there is a strangeness and remoteness in Arsenal which makes the film's few intentionally lucid passages quite dreamlike. The DVD commentary is concise and informative and a terrific primer for the first time viewing. If you have any interest in silent cinema modernism or film as art Arsenal is a film you SHOULD NOT MISS.  Was this review helpful?".

The focus in the Kiev Arsenal January Uprising in 1918. Probably the most effective scene is the laughing gas a man artificially laughs while surrounded by all manner of horror a perfect metaphor for the disconnect between the image and reality of war.The only other Dovzhenko movie that I've seen is Earth. I understand that Arsenal and Earth are the second and third installments of his Ukraine Trilogy. I'll have to see Zvenigora as well as the rest of Dovzhenko's movies. Despite the obvious propaganda this is still a movie that you have to see just for the imagery if nothing else. Like Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin it contains some of the most unforgettable images in cinema history. Definitely see it.".

The scenes at the beginning of the film are confusing  we expect the film to be about the mother only to find out she has relatively little to do with the film. By the time the main protagonist Timosh is established a good chunk of the movie has passed. The acting is usually superb but drops when it should be at its strongest. It is hard to take the scene with the laughing gas seriously given how obviously the man is just acting. He doesn't move his arms or his body and seems to only fall to the ground when he's taken off and put back on his glasses a certain number of times. Thankfully scenes at the end of the movie redeem this level of acting. I'm also not sure what genre the director was going for. The military scenes suggested it to be an action movie but besides those I didn't see anything exciting. The movie then tries to be dramatic when one of the characters is about to shoot another in the back of the head but can't manage. This had to be my favorite scene simply due to its originality. Even then during the final few moments when Timosh is being shot at I couldn't take the movie seriously. His inability to die only reminded me of the final scene from V for Vendetta and I found myself comparing him to a Ukranian V with much less impressive equipment. This was the defining moment where the audience has to admit the movie is just too distant from modern audiences to be relatable. Everything it tries to do has already been redone with better filming special effects and actors. It falls flat.".

A film about yes the oppression of the people against the state! Instead of the Russians this time we the Ukrainians becoming oppressed. Mainly set in a arsenal factory !! the people fight the threat of Government interference! Set to a frenetic score Arsenal sure must have kept the editors busy with many crazy jump cuts going at a frenetic pace. What does it all mean? Not 100 sure as some of the obvious symbolism just flew right by me. It's an OK movie if you're into that sort of stuff. You know who you are.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm having a difficult time coming to grips with Arsenal. The film follows a coherent narrative a WWI soldier Timosh returns from the front to his hometown in Ukraine and sides with the Bolshevik workers in his former factory against a nationalistic antiSoviet uprising. However the story lacks narrative logic in a way that bugged me  a train carrying demobilized soldiers stops the train is threatened by nationalist soldiers the train starts again the train has faulty brakes the train crashes  scenes occur without any particular regard to the preceding context or the overall storyline. Add to this a dash of avantgarde styling  images of people apparently frozen in place strange camera angles  and the effect is quite disorienting. Thematically and ideologically though the film is successful. Arsenal is remarkably even handed with regards to the conflict between the nationalists and the Bolsheviks. In one scene a Ukrainian soldier laments three hundred years of Russian oppression to which a Russian soldier quite reasonably asks What did I do? A frustrated peasant attacks his gaunt horse to which the intertitles respond You're hitting the wrong one Ivan. Ukrainian aggression against the Soviets is depicted as misguided rather than malicious. All people not just Ukrainians or Russians are shown mourning and starving at the hands of the Germans and the negligent Tsar at the beginning of the film. Timosh's decision to side with the communists over the nationalists is not divisive in the end he identifies himself as a Ukrainian worker to a nationalist squad whose bullets he miraculously survives. Communism is universal and the Bolsheviks do not deserve to be the target of nationalistic ire stirred by the Imperial era. The metaphor is obvious but is refreshingly unintrusive for a revolutionary film. Arsenal is not easy to watch but has more complexity to it than one might expect from a work of statesanctioned cinema.".

While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finessein some places the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish. Plus and this was truly annoying the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was overthetop. What I mean by zombies is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the Ukranian peasants were the people stand like mannequins in many scenes. And they stand like this unmoving for a VERY long period of time while the evil Capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by. Gimme a break! This movie is a wonderful example of style over substanceand it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction.By the way the DVD for this film is improved somewhat if you leave the audio commentary on. This makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights.".

There's also some awful awful scenes where Dovzhenko seems to think a lot of emaciatedlooking people staring into space makes for great drama.The only ares of Arsenal worth any significant praise are the war scenes which feature the famed and excellent 'laughing gas' sequence and the scene with the horse team rushing to bury their comrade before going back to battle. Other than that there's some captivating editing in the early stages before it becomes laughable later on as Dovzhenko insists on editing every other scene the exact same way.Earth despite being fairly sickening when you understand the aftermath of the actual events it was arguing in favor of was a captivating and intriguing film. Arsenal is much like Aerograd fairly worthless outside of using some interesting editing and forming a different sort of narrative from the norm and even at a mere 70odd minutes a real chore to sit through.410".

The director's technique of filming a lot through windows and at wide angles gives it an almost voyeuristic feel but this doesn't alienate the viewer instead it gives the feeling you're watching real lives unfold a kind of privileged 'fly on the wall' style and the 'sliceoflife' term often used to describe Yi Yi is appropriate. The film manages to balance humor sensitivity and emotion. It's beautifully shot sensitively directed and incredibly well acted by all involved. It sounds like a cliche to say it but it is one of those movies that has everything cute kids family dysfunction reminisces of decisions made in the past regret love hope and beauty.

The reason that they stand out so much is that in the multiplexes in which they are shown the cause of their difference to the family comedies and juvenile violence is by actually having something called 'Character Development'.This would appear to be a foreign issue to the majority of film makes. But luckily for some cinema goers it is not a foreign area for people like Edward Yang. 'Yi Yi' is an exquisite observation of a family in which all the ages are represented at varying stages of life. From the father struggling to retain his sense of thinking that work is still important his wife struggling with the illness of her mother. And his children learning in their own ways about what life has to offer both of which like everyone else in the film are superbly acted.Life rolls through every one of these characters and the annoying stereotypes that to a certain extent ruined American Beauty for me anyway are not here. Every character is superbly drawn and fantastically beautiful. For some people no doubt this film would be hell. Three hours of dialogue and a story which purports to show nothing more than life being lived. It is a great example of the art of writing however that the characters remain with us long after the film has finished.Although the entire cast was terrific one performance for me rose above the norm. It was Issey Ogata in the role of the cutting edge games designer Ota. His speech of our fear of newness when surely every day is unique really did take my breath away. It is a superbly shot film but the editing is excellent. So many times there were crossfertilisation of ideas and story strands. When we could see the same relationship being played out in three very different stages amongst the members of the same family.People may complain that maybe not a lot happens that people don't really go anywhere and nothing is resolved. To me however this is a slice of life. Of all of our lives as we try to make sense not only of those around us but of ourselves. The closest recent film that i have seen to this is 'Magnolia' and while i would certainly recommend that wholeheartedly there have been very few films that i have felt so accurately portrayed people as being people as 'Yi Yi'. This is a film that reminds me of how good films can be. It also reminds me of how lucky I am to be able to enjoy and appreciate being moved by three hours of skill and effort. Simply breathtaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edward Yang's Yi Yi is a film made in Taipei the biggest city in Taiwan and he demonstrates the sadness of the people who work hard but can not find out the meaning of life. He successfully uses many reflectionframes to suggest to people that life is not just working hard and making money. The first reflectionframe happens when grandma is suddenly sent to the hospital. Yang has the camera focus on the hospital windows during the dialogue between NJ and his brotherinlaw ADi so we can see their reflection on the windows. Reflectionframes in each film do not always have the same meanings and they depend on different situations. Therefore I suggest that Yang tried to show that people can see their reflection by windows or mirror anytime but they are too busy to look and see how they have changed.Also they are afraid to face the truth in the reflection because the truth is not what they want. ADi's reflection on the windows shows us his dishonesty. He always has trouble with money and his promise that he will give back NJ's money soon is not true. On the other hand NJ actually does not care much about money. Moreover in this reflection there is one window frame set between them and their reflection is separated by that window frame. The separation suggests that NJ is different than ADi and the value of money is not as an important to NJ as ADi. Also ADi's reflection in the framed window takes up more space than NJ's reflection. Yang may suggest that the majority of people in the big city are like ADi who has the ambition to make a great deal of money. People in the city are unhappy and unsatisfied with the property they have so they spend more time to make more money. However NJ taking up a small space in the framed reflection represents the minority of people who struggle to find work that is interesting to them. Mostly people whose work interest them can not make enough money for their family. Besides Yang can be connected with NJ's reflection which takes up a small and narrow space in the frame. He chooses the work which he is interested but his films hardly make money even through he makes great films. Referencing to Yang's background he graduated from an electric engineering department in good school. He can work in a highly technical company and have a good paying job like NJ. However he predicts that he will be unhappy as NJ is. Therefore he chooses to make films as his job and enjoy it whether or not his film can make money as commercial film. The reflectionframe in the hospital is an ironic NJ is worrying about the situation of his motherinlaw but ADi is worrying about his financial trouble. Because ADi was born and raised by the person who is in the emergency room he should show more worry than NJ but ADi doesn't. This situation reminds me of Noriko in Ozu's Tokyo Story 1953. Noriko shows more care to her dead husband's parents than other members in the family. Ozu is a Japanese and made Tokyo Story half a century ago however Yang is a Taiwanese and made Yi Yi almost fifty years after Tokyo Story. Even through they use different film techniques both Ozu and Yang arouse viewers to balance the importance between money and family.".

It is filmed with straight forward storytelling expertise but it is paced and edited with a higher order of intelligence. The sequence of disparate events as young and old people fall in love and have close calls with death is meshed together with intuitive brilliance.It might somehow not be a great film. It might lack the larger turning point drama to make it stand out and make a viewer stand up. But it's a quiet almost magical film with terrific acting.

	schema:headline " Soap opera in excelsis";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think the term soap opera existed before the widespread growth of TV when it started to be used to define a genre of entertainment that dramatised the everyday lives of a cross section of interrelated characters that could theoretically go on for ever.  The formula for the success of the longest running the British Coronation Street and Eastenders for instance is selfidentification the depiction in a heightened dramatic form of the sort of problems we all live with bringing a degree of comfort and assurance to the audience watching a fictionalisation of its collective angst.  When we liken a finite form such as a film to soap we tend to use the term in a derogatory sense isofar as we see it as dramatising trivia. However we must be careful about this as there have been examples of very high cinematic art that conform to the conventions of soap opera The Best Years of our Lives for instance in the '40s the German Heimat a few years back and more recently Edward Yang's A One and a two.  It is that very element of everyday anxiety viewed with such perception and truth that makes the Taiwanese film so compelling.  Yang has moved away from the youth violence of A Brighter Summer Day.  His middle class family is involved with commerce and careers.  However noone has an easy time of it.  Each member of the family is plagued in their different ways by their inadequacy in coping with the infirmity of their eldest member.  At the same time the father is troubled by his work and the complication of the reappearance in his life of a woman he met many years ago his wife is seeking spiritual advice from a Buddhist guru his teenage daughter becomes the butt of romantic jealousy from the girl next door.  But it is the 8 year old son who seems most able to come to terms with the vicissitudes of life.  He survives the spiteful taunts of his little girl peers and a bullying schoolmaster. His defence is an enquiring mind which he applies to his surroundings with a Kaspar Hauser fortitude and innocence.  We already know that if any of these characters will be a survivor it is this youngest.  Yang shoots the film with an almost Ozulike purity preferring long held shots rather than camera movements although unlike Ozu he does not make a fetish of this. Often we see action through windows but not  at a distance as in Rear Window so everything has an immediacy.  It will need a few more viewings to assess whether A One and a Two is on the same level as Yang's earlier A Brighter Summer Day.  At the moment something tells me that is does not quite measure up to that savage masterpiece.  Its very gentleness could be the reason although I recognise this is hardly a valid argument.  After three viewings it remains for me a rather elusive work compelling in its way but curiously difficult to evaluate.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't think the term soap opera existed before the widespread growth of TV when it started to be used to define a genre of entertainment that dramatised the everyday lives of a cross section of interrelated characters that could theoretically go on for ever.  The formula for the success of the longest running the British Coronation Street and Eastenders for instance is selfidentification the depiction in a heightened dramatic form of the sort of problems we all live with bringing a degree of comfort and assurance to the audience watching a fictionalisation of its collective angst.  When we liken a finite form such as a film to soap we tend to use the term in a derogatory sense isofar as we see it as dramatising trivia. However we must be careful about this as there have been examples of very high cinematic art that conform to the conventions of soap opera The Best Years of our Lives for instance in the '40s the German Heimat a few years back and more recently Edward Yang's A One and a two.  It is that very element of everyday anxiety viewed with such perception and truth that makes the Taiwanese film so compelling.  Yang has moved away from the youth violence of A Brighter Summer Day.  His middle class family is involved with commerce and careers.  However noone has an easy time of it.

In fact we see here a very westernized society in terms of values and living standards both material and moral. The movie develops itself in a succession of apparently incoherent sequences which nevertheless are bound by a conducting wire that has much to do with life in itself concerning a chain of different generations from the dying grandmother to the small boy who is not the less important character here. This succession reminds us of Godard's movies though this one and the sequences themselves are full of meaning. Even the silences they contain are very eloquent sometimes. The scenery is usually very neat clear and quiet in terms of furniture urban views and people and camera movements which doesn't make the story less dramatic at all. Particularly interesting and very well shown is the counterpoint between the love meetings of teenagers and the meeting of the fourtyish couple of the former lovers who meet for the first time again 30 years after their courtship had been broken in dramatic circumstances. Problems concerning the meaning of life and the real nature of love are shown mainly through the very incisive dialogues making us thinking once more that love is a much more complicated thing than romanticism depicts. It has features and ups and downs that remain unexplained sometimes. This movie is one of the most significant ones I have seen in which concerns human nature and its conflict with the values of modern bourgeois society on the one hand and also universal values of all times on the other. We watch here problems of children and teenagers but also of adults either marital professional or spiritual. And all this told in a smooth and quiet way portraying normal people leading normal lives. This movie presents itself indeed like a kaleidoscope of real nowadays life.".

Another major flaw was the way that it spells everything out without trusting to the audience to pick up subtly expressed connections and motivations. Two examples readily come to mind. When the characters one at a time talk to the comatose but offscreen grandmother I realized that this was akin to a form of traditional ancestor worship. Then the main character the businessman says directly that this talking is like praying. A more blatant example was the intercutting and overly obvious parallels between the father's past as discussed in Tokyo and his daughters present back in Taipei. This is where good editing could have made the film more thoughtprovoking less obvious and more interesting.Another problem for me was the fact that I couldn't connect or care about any of the characters. Possibly this was because they had trouble expressing emotion and interacting with each other but I felt uninvolved with all of them. A pretty disappointing feat for a nearly 3 hour family character study. The camera work was also very static and dispassionate. At first views through empty doorways awaiting characters to walk through them and long shots of couples seemed interesting. But their repetition and lack of variation made these distancing techniques become stultifying. This was especially true of the many long takes that occurred towards the end of the film.I also thought the main character showed a fairly limited acting range while some of the crying scenes were given over to poor acting. Overall I was left mostly bored and wishing I had chosen a better and shorter film for the evening.".

It deals with issues revolving around a typical Chinese family in Taiwan focusing on the father his daughter and son. All of this is revolve around a grandmother who is in a coma.The father NJ was a family man who had to deal with pass relationship and his opportunist business partners. He as Ota his Japanese associate puts it A good guy. He is also a rather reserve person holding onto his opinion without making the other person loose face. Finally I felt NJ was loyal both towards his partners and family. To me NJ represented typical Chinese composure and emotion compare to Westerners such as not hugging his wife when she was distraught or not being blunt with his thoughts.TingTing the daughter had to deal with relationship and friendship issues at the same time she seemed to blame herself for her grandmother's condition. I felt TingTing expressed the most emotion in the film due to her role as a teenager growing up.The gem of the film was NJ's 8 year old son. The youngster IMHO sums up what were in other's mind. He was naive determine playful and thoughtful and such a natural in front of the camera! His letter towards the grandmother's funeral at the end well bought tears to my eye. sniffI also like the performance by Ota I love his ways of explaining things. Could this be the Japanese way of doing business? I love the subtle camera work such as focusing on NJ's wife's confession via the table mirror. Or of linking SherryNJ's stories of their childhood relationship to TingTing's relationship with her date Fatty and or with the son's obsession with the school monitor. I also like how scenes were lingered on longer then usual to create more atmosphere and makes the viewer wonder. One thing I did wonder about was the lack of soundtrack throughout the film why?This is the first film I've seen directed by Edward Yang and I was most impressed with it and it has prompted me to check out his previous films.".

The camera is unbelievably static throughout this picture and shot selection lacks the kind of interesting variety necessary to keep a 3 hour film engaging.  Time after time we are shown two people walking and talking at such a distance that we are not even able to see their lips moving or the expressions on their faces. In fact we are rarely shown the actors' faces close up so it is hard to ever get an up close and personal impression of their thoughts and emotions. In terms of filmaking style I would say that this film shares a lot with the work of french director Eric Rohmer.  His films too are extremely talky and feature very static camera work.  His plots are equally uneventful sometimes comically so.  What sets Rohmer apart though is that his films are usually a very palatable 90100 minutes.For a film that has so many boring and mundane elements 3 hours was quite simply too long for me to handle and if I had been the producer I would have sent the director back to the cutting room with orders to cut out th 6075 minutes of flab weighing this picture down.".

In the end the movie suggests there are no trivial moments in our lives even if they seem so at the time  any one person's life is an accumulation of both the trivial and the significant. What makes it worth getting out of bed every day is the fact that we will never live a day exactly like the one before it.The structure of Yi yi mirrors its theme  the film is a gradual accumulation of quiet moments that build toward something deeply moving. We watch the father of the household reconnect with an old flame only to see his disappointment when the realities of his past don't match his idealized memories of them. We watch the mother battle depression and the overwhelming sense that she lives day to day doing nothing with herself or her life. She seeks meaning by leaving her family to spend time at a religious commune but she learns that the answers she's looking for aren't to be found there. We watch the adolescent daughter timidly flirt with sex and dating a young girl only beginning to unearth the complexities of what it means to become an adult. But my favorite character is the 8yearold son who takes pictures with his camera because he wants to show other people what they're not able to see for themselves. He's a little boy who is old enough to understand that there are things he can tell people that they don't already know but he's too young yet to know how to communicate those things. One has to wonder if this character is the young alterego of the film's writer and director Edward Yang.Yi yi isn't flashy. It doesn't intertwine all of these characters' story lines with clever narrative sleight of hand it doesn't pile coincidences on top of coincidences like these multinarrative ensemble films frequently do. It's not histrionic and it doesn't build to some overheated climax. It's not interested in doing any of those things. It unfolds the way life unfolds and it makes us deeply care about these people and even makes us love them in a way flaws and all. It reminded me very much of an Ozu film with its static camera that chooses to sit back and observe rather than tell us how to feel.Yi yi feels like a modest work of art while you're watching it but it lingers in the head and its power builds the longer you have to muse over it. It's the kind of movie I have a feeling we'll look back on in twenty years and recognize as a masterpiece.Grade A".

One has to wonder if this character is the young alterego of the film's writer and director Edward Yang.Yi yi isn't flashy. It doesn't intertwine all of these characters' story lines with clever narrative sleight of hand it doesn't pile coincidences on top of coincidences like these multinarrative ensemble films frequently do. It's not histrionic and it doesn't build to some overheated climax. It's not interested in doing any of those things. It unfolds the way life unfolds and it makes us deeply care about these people and even makes us love them in a way flaws and all. It reminded me very much of an Ozu film with its static camera that chooses to sit back and observe rather than tell us how to feel.Yi yi feels like a modest work of art while you're watching it but it lingers in the head and its power builds the longer you have to muse over it. It's the kind of movie I have a feeling we'll look back on in twenty years and recognize as a masterpiece.Grade A";

	schema:reviewBody "The passing of a great filmmaker is always greeted with sadness. Edward Yang was no exception. One of the most influential of Taiwanese filmmakers Yang belonged to a class of film directors whose films resonated strongly with the society he lived in. He made a number of pictures during the 1990s but his most lasting legacy was Yi Yi a film released at the turn of the century or millennium if you will which through the perspective of a single but extended middleclass Taiwanese family provided viewers with an honest and insightful reflection of living in a modern technological age.Structured around three very important cultural ceremonies namely the wedding the baby shower and the funeral the film brings as many characters as possible to the fore and then breaks them up into smaller units for an indepth study of their lives. This congregation and dissection of characters is the reason Yang's film is essential viewing for anyone who wishes to see a slice of themselves on screen portrayed to a very realistic effect.Expertly developed the elaborative narrative may seem deceptively complex but it is really just a series of simple observations of daily occurrences spliced together on film. Shot with honest objectivity Yang's film sometimes also spotlights on the subjective emotions of certain characters most notably that of Yang Yang a somewhat reserved boy with a camera his schoolgoing sister who discovers the fleeting emotion of love for the first time and their morallyguided father a midlevel boss of a corporation who meets an old flame.Of course in a film like Yi Yi which spans nearly three hours these characters are multidimensionally developed. So much occur in their lives that their ups and downs captured in Yang's film are merely a crosssectional view of their current circumstance. Apart from the abovementioned cultural ceremonies another common point that ties all the three main characters together is the grandmother who suffers a nasty fall and enters into a coma. Interestingly the unresponsive grandmother becomes sort of a human mechanism for catharsis especially for the father and the daughter.Yang Yang on the other hand refuses to talk to his grandmother. He reasons that she is old and would probably know everything he would say so why bother telling her things that she already understands. His relationship or the seemingly lack of one with her would become immensely meaningful towards the end of the film cumulating in Yi Yi's most touching and thoughtprovoking moment  the recitation of a piece of selfwritten text by Yang Yang to his dead grandmother during her funeral.In quite a number of scenes director Yang employs long shots to keep viewers a certain distance away from the characters. Although we could hear the slightly fainter dialogue we are unable to observe the subtle facial reactions that would help us to register the feelings of these characters. In other instances Yang uses mediated images like that of a security camera to capture the movements of the characters highlighting the increase in surveillance in today's society.Yang also makes use of glass panels of windows doors and walls to create a doublescreen effect. These glass panels give an added screen to the lens of the camera further separating the viewer from the actors forcing upon us the role of a contemplative observer as opposed to being a willing participant in the lives of these characters. The dual reflection of objects within and outside these glass panels sometimes produce naturally superimposed images this is most beautiful during scenes shot in the night.I feel that Yi Yi's most important message comes from Yang Yang's camera which is given to him by his father. He takes pictures of the back of people's heads reasoning that these are images that people could never see and explaining that a person's view of the world is always halved i.e. never complete because of this. This change in social perspective from an innocent boy after receiving the camera parallels that of the director's use of the film medium to reveal that life is often treated with so much subjectivity that an objective worldview is sometimes difficult for us to fathom. In three hours Yang conveys that message very convincingly. But three hours is never enough for something that often takes us a lifetime to recognize. There is a word for it  it's called wisdom.SCORE 910 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!".

	schema:headline " Yi Yi not eligible for Foreign Language Oscar";
	schema:reviewBody "Fortunately I saw Yi Yi at this past year's Toronto International Film Festival I would've either had to wait awhile or catch the next train to New York. It was the 37th and final film I saw at the fest and it was my favorite one. I've been recommending it to everyone and I've been following it's progress through this year's award season. Just this past week the National Society of Film Critics named it the best picture of 2000. The critic circles in both New York and Los Angeles have honored it too.However in a search that I conducted on the Academy Awards site for this year's eligible slate of nominees for foreign language film Yi Yi isn't there. There are a record 46 countries with eligible films and from Taiwan it isn't Yi Yi it's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. That could mean there are three reasons for this 1 Crouching Tiger beat Yi Yi when Taiwan voted for it's representative 2 maybe Yi Yi was eligible last year or 3 perhaps Yi Yi was first aired on t.v.which I highly doubt and is disqualified. So I look up last year's slate of eligible films and Yi Yi is nowhere to be found. It looks like it's only chance is in the best picture category but with Crouching Tiger the frontrunner I doubt very highly that the Academy will find a spot for Yi Yi.That's too bad because Yi Yi is a great film that moved and inspired me with it's grace and humility. I would have thought that maybe Taiwan would have played it's cards a little smarter by nominating Yi Yi as it's representative trusting that Crouching Tiger would win a nomination in the best picture category. That way it would be able to boast about it's two nominated films but instead decided to throw all of their eggs in the Crouching Tiger basket.What this amounts to is that I urge every fan of Yi Yi to champion this movie recommend it to everyone to strangers. Write about Yi Yi and email your review of it to other filmlovers. I have an idea take Yi Yi and pay it forward to three other people. When they come back to thank you for recommending such a powerful life affirming film tell them they can thank you by paying it forward to three other people to see and so on.Why am I on such a Yi Yi kick? I think it's because it saddens and frustrates me to no ends when a quality movie gets overlooked and forgotten. Yi Yi is a prime overlooked and forgotten kind of movie I venture to say even for filmlovers because of it's running time and because it's from another country. This movie will eventually find it's way onto video but by then because it hasn't been nominated for anything people might not chance it.Yi Yi A One and A Two is an epic drama with a scope and vision about family life that is so clear that it's observations can translate to anyone. I loved the way the movie branches out and follows the different members of the family and it gives us enough credit that we will make sense and draw our own conclusions and parallels accordingly. The movie doesn't tell us what to think it just shows and reveals the thoughts and decisions and behavior of it's characters. Gene Siskel had a particular fondness for movies that gave us multidimensional fathers. He would have been proud of this film as it shows us a father who is dedicated to his family loves his family and even when he considers what might have been with an old love from years passed I can only reveal that my gratitude for this film deepened considerably at his decision near the end of the film. I also enjoyed how the film showed us this father at work where we see a series of scenes with another businessman from a possible company that the father might merge with. To watch these scenes unfold the negotiating the small talk is to behold a movie that contains insight into aging and wisdom about life. Yi Yi is my favorite film of 2000.".

I found the story of the father most moving as he struggles with behaving decently in a cutthroat business environment and his feeling toward an old flame who suddenly reappears. The loneliness of the human condition and the alienation of modern life can be seen in many shots of family members who despite seeing the other's suffering can't reach out to offer any solace or in a scene of a woman crying alone in a hotel shot through the glass windows of modern office towers. The film is not melodramatic.  It moves at a leisurely pace so that the viewer becomes completely involved in this family's daily struggles.  I highly recommend seeing this movie.".

Eightyear old Yang Yang is having existential doubts. His adolescent sister is going through the throes of puberty and unrequited love. Their father is in a midlife crisis regretting lost opportunities. Their mother in one of the best of many brilliant scenes in the film admits to her husband that it doesn't take her a minute to relate to the grandmother what she did with her day the grandmother is in a coma and becomes the sounding board for all their worries. But if you think three hours seems daunting think again. You don't want these people to go away ever. No moment is wasted no scene rushed. The whole thing is an exquisite patchwork that leaves us drained but strangely uplifted. And if you have a dry eye after the final scene it probably means that you're already dead. Hollywood!  watch and learn!".

Eightyear old Yang Yang is having existential doubts. His adolescent sister is going through the throes of puberty and unrequited love. Their father is in a midlife crisis regretting lost opportunities. Their mother in one of the best of many brilliant scenes in the film admits to her husband that it doesn't take her a minute to relate to the grandmother what she did with her day the grandmother is in a coma and becomes the sounding board for all their worries. But if you think three hours seems daunting think again. You don't want these people to go away ever. No moment is wasted no scene rushed. The whole thing is an exquisite patchwork that leaves us drained but strangely uplifted. And if you have a dry eye after the final scene it probably means that you're already dead. Hollywood!  watch and learn!";

A small group of people have managed to flee from the camps to a new life in the prosperous South Korea. Some of them gather and decide to make an extraordinary and controversial musical about their experiences in the Yodok concentration camp. Despite death treats and many obstacles the musical becomes a tour de force for this ensemble of refugees and for them a possibility opens to talk about their experiences and inspire others to protest the existence of the camps.";

The first section focuses on the artist Ku slowly building a picture of a quiet life in a rural backwater. The second switches tempo with amazing martial arts action focusing on the fugitive Ku and her friends. The final section calms down again as the mysterious Buddhist monk comes into sharp focus and the martial arts become more and more amazing.All this takes place in the most beautiful Chinese countryside sometimes bathed in light the use of sunlight and the monk is particularly impressive and sometimes in dramatic thunderstorms making the film even more of a delight to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "To think that I used to accuse King Hu of doing injustice to the wuxia genre with boring storytelling and slow action I must have been on crack at the timeas his best works completely transcend elements of conventional filmmaking. In A TOUCH OF ZEN It's not the story or the action that stands out although they are part of the system they are secondary to the theme of spiritual enlightenment which is what counts in Buddhist philosophy. When the abbot confronts the East Chamber agent the art of combat is strictly utilized by the abbot to guide the agent to put down his sword and attain peace with Buddha. There is a haunting sight when the bookworm scholar is amused by his tactic which fooled the agents. He thinks he has reached the peak of perfection but then he sees dead bodies lying around who have suffered from his tactic and the only thing on his mind is a woman whom he lusts. As booksmart as he is he still suffers from worldly affair like everyone else. Only at the end when he accepts Buddha is he able to live in peace.Aside from the philosophical points ZEN also scores strongly in establishing mood suspense and fascinating visuals. The Jiang Hu in this film feels incredibly authentic and the rich miseenscene is refreshing compared to the limited Shaw Bros studio offerings. I loved the photography throughout it beautifully captures the spiritual wonder of ancient Orient. In framing still shots King Hu chiefly employs medium and medium closeups mounting his camera at an upward angle so we can always see beyond the characters perhaps to suggest existence of higher wisdom.One observation I would like to propose is that although ZEN is probably a milestone in Chinese cinema it would be a minor masterpiece compared to the best works from 60s Japan. The lush photography and haunting images from KWAIDAN come to mind as a comparison. No doubt King Hu also learned a few tricks from the likes of Kurosawa such as pointing his camera at the sun which occurs frequently in ZEN.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Hsia Nu is not only one of the most remarkable martial arts movies one could imagine but in any sense a most remarkable film. I at least am unable to name many other three hour long movies which I have not found slightly lengthy not to say boring at some stage. Moreover Hsia Nu is the kind of film one definitely would want to watch on the big screen of a cinema something rather rare as far as martial arts films are concerned and generally rare for anything not an extremely expensive superproduction.Its panoramic nature sequences have not only esthetic value but are also symbolically relevant. In fact if one wanted to do this it would be possible to interpret the whole movie as an allegory of human existence. Fortunately there is really no need to get out the heavy guns of symbolism and artistic value to convince oneself that Hsia Nu is a great movie. It is gripping and entertaining amusing and serious and infused with a pathos hardly ever encountered in European or American movies. Pathos of course is something difficult to handle but the director and cast of Hsia Nu manage it very well. The film has its deliberate light moments but it never invites laughter at its moments of pathos.Of course we are talking here about a martial arts movie. And indeed the fighting sequences are brilliantly done  there definitely has been no progress since 1969  but there is not only that. There is in fact not all that much fighting if one considers that this is a three hour film and the fights do not carry the plot. In some sense Hsia Nu resembles more a Japanese samurai drama than what we more customarily associate with the Hong Kong and Taiwan martial arts genre.The plot is very long and complex  though perfectly understandable and even logical  therefore I do not see any real interest in retelling it here. Suffice to say that it contains most principal human emotions loyalty and treason love and revenge hunger for happiness and for...enlightenment. The acting is brilliant and especially a more masterly 'great master' character a monk in Hsia Nu would indeed be difficult to find in any martial arts movie.If anybody is not convinced by the merit of the martial arts genre and just wants to give it a sole and unique chance then this is the movie that might convinced such a snob that cinematographic 'art' is not necessarily grey quiet and slow but can be colourful vibrant and full of pathos.".

King Hu certainly lived up to his name when crafting this piece of art that deserves even more respect and admiration than it has already had.Blending different genres seamlessly together and paving the way for many movies to come everything here is well balanced and thought over. The story that begins as a ghost story starts slowly but rewardingly layering up developing and getting more dimensions moving into Wu Xia styled action and politics drama then leaping into the territory of Seven samurais style tactical warfare depiction finally getting some deeply mystical aspects in the end. Settings and photography are stunningly beautiful and all the visuals are breathtaking timeless.Looks like time simply cannot touch this movie and that's why I compare this one to the works of Sergio Leone. Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Now if only my wish come true and we had some day better than watchable DVD release of this true classic preferably fully restored from original film. One can only hope...This is my truth.

This is a film about about ambition perception personality and what evil might be... it isn't really a standard action movie.The storyline is highly compelling but not rushed the pacing is wonderfully handled moving from the slow almost lazy quotidian existence of the unambitious scholarly protagonist to the fast paced highly dynamic camera work of the action scenes. The shape of the film perhaps the most amazing aspect of this 'masterpiece' starts with the small even petty and slowly ramps through the heroic to the iconic and finally to the divine. Each stage is a brief often profound meditation on the nature of life and humanity of that state.The cinematography is always lavish and startling and as with many of the Japanese films of the time not afraid of a screen beautifully composed mostly of shades of darkness.The martial arts displayed are never exhibitionary nor obviously proficient. This understated quality to the skills is sometimes disappointing if that is why you are watching the film but ends up being the best way to capture the the unknowable skills of some of the characters. As a matter of interest a young Sammo Hung makes an appearance as a bodyguard and there are some other kung fu faces amongst the stunt men.All in all this film is profound and compelling. Well worth a watch".

It is why by exemple we never saw Ninkyo Eiga from Japan but it is the moste populare genre in the 6070 era. When a director like Sergio Leone made too much succes they can't ignore him. But in general they try to put their own idea of the each country's cinematography on the dictionnary. Japan are a zen country who made slow movie like Ozu althought Ozu try to made movie like American with Japanese things.This is why the history of cinema are full of injustice. King Hu are one the great injustice. Yes he made wu xia pian a martial art genre movies. Swordplay movie in fact.But is movies are a perfect mechanic an exemple of editing. Hu made is own editing and like the piano play by Glenn Gould we recognise his style when you pay attention of editing.Hu dont want to use wire or special effect. He want use editing and camera to suggest anythings.A Touch Of Zen are a gem. But i understand it is maybe too much asian for the american country. All the first alf of the movie are talk and slow pacing. But the others alf are action action and action. I dont know who want to watch that. Intellectual who love serious movies will love the first alf but maybe they just think acyion are too stupide. Same thing for the teenager who love action pack.But if you forget all your expectation you will be touch by magic of poetry. Hu made a 3 distinctive parts movie. The first focus on individuality the second on politics and the third on religion.The first hour focuys on a naive scholar who discover strange yhing happen in the village where he live whit his old mothers. Suspens and mystery are the substance of this part.The second show politics manipulation and the substance of war. This is the Hu tradionnal part. We are in Dragon Inn Gate Fate Of Lee Khan or all the politics corruption things. A lot of martial arts.The third part introduce us in the things of spirit. Hu show us a personn face to himself the society and the spiritual....But dont epect the spiritual journey like American movies. It his a King Hu movie. Ellipse and short cut are always where you dont expect and the focus always where you never goes....A great movie.".

If they expect a lot of swordplay go for the Shaw Brothers releases there are plenty of them.Touch of ZenXia Nu is a great piece of 3 hrs Chinese art like the Belle noiseuseLa a 4 hrs French art but not as long or as slow.

It's not like the usual Chinese swordfighting movies there are very few actions here in fact for the first halfPart 1 there is only 1 short action sceneI don't consider this a spoilerat the climatic end which I consider a classic. Here is where the recent bamboo action scenes from other movies got the idea. Bear in mind there is no digital effect at that time. I think Cannes gave it a technical award due to that scene. Those who think that Crouching Tiger or Flying Daggers' bamboo scenes are better they should take a second viewing and try to figure out how those scenes are shot. Those who enjoyed King Hu's or swordfighting films should also watch Come Drink With Me Dragon Inn Gatethe original The Valiant Ones and The Fate of Lee Khan.Too bad the latter 3 are not available in DVD yet and those who appreciate Chinese art must watch his Raining in The Mountain and Legend in the Mountain. King Hu only directed around 15 movies in 30 yearsprobably the least for an Asian director of those times and I recommend the above mentioned 7 to foreigners as I consider them as classics. I will give them a 8 or 9 for IMDb ratings.".

	schema:reviewBody "King Hu's 1971 masterpiece might be one of the most visually striking films I've ever seen. It's also terrifically entertaining both as a martial arts film and as an examination of Buddhist philosophy. The story involves a timid and underachieving painter who gets mixed up with an enigmatic gang of fugitives on the run from a corrupt government. From there the film focuses on the painter attempt's to help the fugitives as well as the involvement of a group of Buddhist monks who are also martial arts masters.The story unfolds in a very organic matter. In a departure from the typical wuxia film the majority of the film unfolds from the perspective of the painter an everyman who serves as a surrogate for the audience. Shih Chun is excellent in this role giving the painter a sense of nervous energy and giving the role a comedic touch without overplaying it the way others actors might. Hsu Feng is also excellent as the female noblewoman on the run managing to be both mysterious and sympathetic at the same time. The abbot played by Roy Chaio is the other standout performance from the cast he's dignified and quietly fearsome at the same time.In addition to these strong performances A Touch of Zen has some of the best direction and cinematography I've ever seen. The only film I've ever seen use light as effectively as displayed here is Barry Lyndon and even then I'd have to say there are more shots from A Touch of Zen that I recall vividly than from Barry Lyndon. The fight choreography is also topnotch the fights in the fort and bamboo forest are justifiably iconic.The prominence of the monks in the story and the focus on Buddhist teachings of mercy compassion and nonviolence also gives the film the kind of depth you rarely experience in an action or adventure film. That said the film never feels preachy and is conveyed in a very organic matter. All of these elements combine to make A Touch of Zen an unforgettable viewing experience and one of the finest wuxia films ever made.".

While I certainly understand how sometimes classics get dwarfed by the films they inspire how insulting is it that hidden fortress is often labeled simply as the film that inspired C3PO and R2D2 I think it is too bad here. Yes Touch of Zen is Ang Lee's favorite martial arts film and was a huge inspiration for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Yes It's true and perhaps the film will find more fans as a result and I think that is great.Touch of zen is cinema in it's finest form. It is three hours long lacks the fancy wire work or CGI of modern Wuxia pan films but still stands the test of time. When you consider that this film was made in 196869 it makes it so much more impressive. The scenery is filled with beautiful imagines throughout the film of rural China. The camera balances light in most impressive ways. The main monk of the film is consistently beaming with natural sunlight which expresses in a beautifully cinematic way his connection to nature. Anyone who used a video camera in intense sunlight understands how hard those shots must have been.If you the kind of Kung Fu fan that was really bothered by the fact that Crouching tiger didn't have a fight scene for 15 minutes don't bother. TOZ doesn't get to the action until 55 minutes in. However the tone of the film requires that we understand a few things about the artist whose eyes the story is told through.SpoilersTOZ is the second only to 36th chamber when it comes to making a Buddhist monks look badass. When the henchman HZU brings his violence onto the sacred ground to capture our renegade heroes he learns he can't defeat the Buddhist monks. There power is too great. He resorts to lying. Begging on his knees to be accepted by the monks Indeed it is there only weakness by the grace of Buddha he wants to help.  Yet still the Buddhist monk doesn't resort to violence. He calls on Buddha and the powers of the universe and the henchmen destroys his sons and then him self.  At least that is my take.End spoilersTouch of Zen is an excellent martial arts film for fans of films like MUSA Hero or Crouching tiger. It must however be viewed as a film of it's period.".

	schema:headline " An adventure of grand proportions.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a special kind of movie since it's being so many different things all at once. It's a type of movie that feels more like an old fashioned Japanese samurai movie even though this movie is being a Taiwanese production.What I especially like about it is that it starts off as something totally different but eventually ends as am adventurous movie with lots of material arts fights in it. It's a long movie about 3 hours so it takes its time to slowly set things up and let stuff develop into something different. This ensures that the movie is always slowly but gradually developing and also never stands still so there is never being an actual slow moment in this movie.As the story develops things also definitely get more interesting and fun to watch. The movie turns into a real adventure in which the main characters are almost constantly traveling and having encounters with people that want to take their lives. This ensures that there is also plenty of action to enjoy in this movie involving sword fights but also plenty of handtohand combat with every now and then Wire Fu effects involved.It's also being a real innovative and original movie at times with some of its editing and camera techniques. In that regard this is also being a real '70's flick a period in which a lot of experimenting with editing and cinematography was going on. Especially the cinematography is great at times and also does a good job at capturing the right mood and brining the environments very lively to the screen.It's just the sort of movie not an awful lot is being wrong with. It does everything well and within its genre it's being a great watch!910 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Once there was a time when I thought Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was the very best martial arts movie man could make. Both visually and storytellingwise it was a joy to watch and the fight scenes were the best ever with their unrealistic features. Once I saw King Hu's martial arts masterpiece A Touch of Zen I was rather surprised since it exceeded in almost every level. First released in 1971 this great film hasn't lost any of its power or splendor which is a fine merit on its own.In the beginning of the movie we follow the everyday life of a poor artist Ku an unmarried man in his thirties who is living in a rather small town with his mother. This first part of the film for it can roughly be divided into three parts plays much like a family drama with some small comic moments. Ku's life gets a little more interesting when he notices strange people walking around town a mysterious man visiting his studio and befriending him and some strange noises coming from a house that is rumoured to be haunted. All this and the love or is it just lust? he feels for a certain woman change his life completely.The next two parts offer a very different experience each providing the story with politics war tactics and a growing spiritual element of mystery through beautiful photography great direction and awesome fight scenes. What really stands out in the martial arts part of the film is how real it feels. I know it isn't real some leaps and moves the characters make just can't be done in real life but the clanging of the steel swooshing of people's clothes when they perform their moves and the sound of footsteps are so impressive that I found myself holding my breath at some scenes. This is also helped by the near perfect choreography. It's nothing like the tricky and lightningfast movements in CTHD and I like this much better. The fighters are really observing each other's moves to know when to strike.I really can't find any serious faults in this movie. Being over three hours long there wasn't a single wasted minute. Any yawning I did was due to the late hour when I was watching this. It is true that the film moves slowly forward but I think it's necessary for the atmosphere to develop. The director really knew what he was doing since all the important scenes have that special quality to them that can only be acquired when superb direction believable acting and a great sense of situation come together. The use of light is especially worth mentioning since it is so well done. The fight in the forest where light shines through the leaves creating a dreamlike scenery in the background has got to be one of the most captivating things I've seen on film.A Touch of Zen is one of my favourite movies. It is very well executed in every way imaginable and definitely among the best martial arts movies. If you like this type of movies where great action is mixed with spiritual elements and a search for peace you must see this beautiful movie. It won't leave you cold.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't think I could be so bored by a martial arts film. How disappointing I was looking forward to finally seeing a film by the legendary director King Hu but this may turn me off any other films of his. The story is a dull one about a fugitive girl an expert in martial arts taught by some powerful monks who moves into a small town hoping to escape her death sentence. Her father had spoken out against a local tyrant and his whole family was sentenced to death. An artist neighbor of the girl falls for her and gets mixed up in the dangers she faces. The martial arts sequences are few and far between in this 3 hours  film and the ones that are there are mostly poor. The editing is so choppy that it's often impossible to tell what's going on. Worse yet a good number of these sequences are at night so you can't see anything. Only the two climactic battles the film is split in two are any good at all and they are kind of similar at that. The only commendable aspect of the film is its gorgeous color cinematography. It is truly exceptional but nothing else about A Touch of Zen is. Think me a rube or what have you but nothing but pseudoprofundity and a lack of technical knowledge.".

	schema:headline " No Ordinary ChopSocky Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "King Hu's Hsia nu which served as the inspiration for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has acquired nearlegendary status in the fortyplus years since it was first made. The film tells the familiar tale of a smalltown man still living at home with his mother in his thirties who meets an attractive woman living in the deserted fort next door. The man strikes up a friendship with her but is drawn into political intrigue when he discovers she is actually the daughter of a murdered ruler on the run from her father's killers. The man draws on his interest in military strategy to help the woman defeat her pursuers.This is no ordinary chopsocky flick as can be seen by the way it polarises opinion between those who praise it as a lyrical work of art and those who complain about not being able to see what's going on during the night fighting scenes. I watched expecting an arthouse flick but was still surprised at how rigidly the director sticks to his artistic vision while making virtually no concession to the action genre. Even the fight scenes  and there are quite a number after the first hour  are out of the ordinary. They do at least boast a type of editing that was way ahead of its time  the film doesn't look at all dated  in the way that we are constantly teased with incomplete shots of the action.The pace is measured to say the least director King Hu seems more interested in savouring the composition of each shot for its own sake rather than developing a character or advancing the plot. The cinematography is superb the composition seductive but as the hour mark passes with little of any substance revealed suspicions of indulgence are unavoidable. The plot isn't complicated but is nevertheless difficult to follow at times I should point out the UK DVD version I watched was approximately 30 minutes shorter than the running time given on IMDb which might account for the gaps in the plot. Ku the nominal hero is an artist an observer who during the course of the film must set aside his passivity and the film calls upon the audience to do the same which is why some might find it challenging to watch without their attention wandering. The film is really three types of story rolled into one  ghost story political intrigue and spiritual enlightenment  and journeys from the mundane Ku's daily routine of setting of to work and unlocking his small kiosk to the sublime the monk's transcendence into Nirvana. It's the sort of journey the viewer needs to repeat in order to appreciate all its subtleties and power but in all honesty if you're like me it's probably a journey you'll only feel like taking once.".

We may find elsewhere similar notions of emptiness as the essence of form but none that sing what it means to be fully vitally empty with the passionate ardor of Zen.The great Sufi love poets like Rumi also approached the mystery of what it means to unveil the world rather than explain it but what awareness graced them was intuitive desert inspired. Tao addressed the reflections of the cosmos in the evening dewdrops what it means to look at a flower looking back at us but that unity of far and close is enclosed in a perfect circle of yinyang. Zen by contrast blossoms in the asymmetry of what spontaneously arises and disappears and what the Zen Masters so eloquently talk about is what they have personally awakened to through their ardent practice of silence. The Enso circle that symbolizes this Awakening is often deliberately painted crude as pointing to the imperfection of form it embraces.So we have here a sweeping affair of political intrigue and unjust persecution in a China of empires. All this is in tacit understanding that these hierarchies will come to pass like their forebears. The film after all opens in a deserted fort in the mansion of a general ruined by civil war. Possibly this depiction of a corrupt aristocracy blinded the censors of the time to what it actually reflected of their own regime. Czech filmmakers were masters of this ubiquity by situating their griefs with Soviet tyranny against a notsodistant Nazi oppressor.But the film is not content with this which after all the Japanese had delivered decades ago in much more refined form. So what is the Zen touch here? Although it's adequate as the former here the film completely breaks apart. It's not enough that the Buddhist monks are made to be little more than godly vehicles who conveniently show up at the right moment to aid the oppressed with their superhuman abilities of kung fu which is after all a valid extension of Zen practice or whatever it is that these monks represent is reduced to the status of benevolent protectors.What is actually surprising is that none of the characters who are met with this way of life are imparted with anything. What perfect opportunity squandered for example to make the young portrait painter realize that 'knowledge' and 'wisdom' are not to be found in books. And how is it that the two fugitives leave the monastery with only the knowledge of deadly kung fu and none of the compassionate mind to control it?It is not surprising then that this kind of film that has reduced everything to appearance and platitude would go on in the end to actually depict nirvana. The image intended to be transcendent transcends nothing not merely because nirvana is a state of mind beyond words but because ultimately there is nothing to transcend. Whatever mock transcendence in the image of the Buddha we find here means nothing.".

	schema:headline " It Hasn't Aged Well";
	schema:reviewBody "With all due respect to the HK Movie Association who puts this movie as 9 on the 100 best Chinese films of the last 100 year I believe this movie is rather dated. As with Lady Snowblood 1973 which I put in my two cents recently they might be at the vanguard of their respective genres at the time but now 30 odd years later they haven't age well at all. This happens I think especially with genre movies where technology plays an important part. Dramas such as Rebecca Hitchcock or Now Voyager Bette Davis which are still some of my alltime faves fare much better because technology won't really make them better they already have great direction story pacing acting etc.I also want to dispute a reviewer from UK who mentioned that this movie is much more Chinese than Crouching Tiger which is too westernized. I can't disagree with him more. Having actually read the wuxia novels that many of these movies are based on I have to say Crouching Tiger beautifully captures the lyricism and essence of the wuxia world without any Western influence. But I digress.The pacing of this movie is really too slow. Fully an hour was devoted to people chiefly of the male protagonist walking around and around in that same little village. An HOUR of nothing much happening to propel the story! As a matter of fact a large portion of the 3hour movie time is eaten up by showing people walking from point A to point B which is totally pointless. The bamboo forest scene will remind many of a similar scene in House of Flying Daggers and is probably its inspiration. Alas it was done much better in the newer movie due to better choreography wire works and kinetic energy that Zen sadly lacks. Same argument for all the other set pieces. The ending is anticlimactic since there is no tension when one party is the living Buddha or something like that. The use of negative film to denote some sort of divine intervention is jarring and a little laughable.During the opening credits it indicates that this movie is based on a book which is written in the Manchu dynasty probably in the late 18th or early 19th century. I don't know of a direct translation of the book but it is available in English with the title Chinese Ghost and Love Stories by Pu Songling I coin him the Chinese Edgar Allen Poe. It is one of the premiere books in Chinese literature. Not all his stories are about ghosts but all have a fantastical element and most have a moral to it. But the book are all short stories and none is long enough to be a novella so stretching a short story to 3 hours entails lots and lots of padding hence all the walking. I haven't actually looked for the story that the movie is based on but I can say for sure that in old Chinese society and in Pu's stories as well no woman who is from a respected family as the female character is would bed down with a practical stranger EVER unless she is a demon or a ghost which does happen quite frequently in his stories and are almost always not a good thing. It probably had happened in real life when there was a strong attraction but she was basically feeling pity for his mother and so decided to give her virginity to him. Yeah I don't think so! The DVD quality from Tai Seng is abysmal which probably also contributes to my discontent. The transfer is horrid pixilated like in a VCD in some scenes looks like it's forever raining in dark scenes some black spots permanently imprinted on the screen throughout the entire movie. The big fight scene that happens at the deserted house at night is so dark that is practically unwatchable. Moreover the audio is muddy and barely audible even with volume turns to the loudest.The Chinese title is translated as Heroine but the official English title is a better description of the movie given the spiritual element in the movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "With all due respect to the HK Movie Association who puts this movie as 9 on the 100 best Chinese films of the last 100 year I believe this movie is rather dated. As with Lady Snowblood 1973 which I put in my two cents recently they might be at the vanguard of their respective genres at the time but now 30 odd years later they haven't age well at all. This happens I think especially with genre movies where technology plays an important part. Dramas such as Rebecca Hitchcock or Now Voyager Bette Davis which are still some of my alltime faves fare much better because technology won't really make them better they already have great direction story pacing acting etc.I also want to dispute a reviewer from UK who mentioned that this movie is much more Chinese than Crouching Tiger which is too westernized. I can't disagree with him more. Having actually read the wuxia novels that many of these movies are based on I have to say Crouching Tiger beautifully captures the lyricism and essence of the wuxia world without any Western influence. But I digress.The pacing of this movie is really too slow. Fully an hour was devoted to people chiefly of the male protagonist walking around and around in that same little village.

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this movie from Netflix. The DVD shows it in letterbox format with bright white English subtitles in the lower black space. The quality of the print that was used to make the disc is good for outdoor action but the action in two long night scenes is so dark as to be mostly invisible.Obviously a lot of people love this film but I'd give it only 7 out of 10 because it's way too long over 3 hours. It was shown in theaters in the early 70's as Part I and Part II on separate days which would be okay except the climactic fight in the bamboo forest which ends Part I is repeated in entirety in Part II. And there are other sequences which could be trimmed back. Towards the beginning for example Scholar Ku makes a long long annoying nocturnal investigation of the spooky old mansion where he lives with his mother finding nothing. Because the print is so dark we see nothing as well. Again in Part II after the heroes have tackled the evil forces of the Eastern Chamber a neverexplained reference to some part of the Imperial Palace I suppose Scholar Ku wanders around the battle site laughing humorlessly over his own cleverness in the ways he spooked the Imperial guard force that came to attack. A little of this stuff goes a long way.Nonetheless it's a good Netflix rental. I particularly enjoyed seeing Pai Ying in a heroic role as Gen. Shih and hawkfaced Miao Tien as the evil Commandant's lieutenant. It was also interesting to see 1970's Taiwanese hero actor Tien Peng often billed as Roc Tien as a handsome official of intermediate strength and skill working for the evil Eastern Chamber people. And I loved Ku's mother.Two other people deserve honorable mention. The Chinese title Hsia N means gallant lady according to the subtitles but lead actress Hs Feng is hard to warm up to and usually seems offputting rather than gallant. She never smiles in this film or shows any emotional content when she fights. The other interesting person is Chiao Hu often billed as Roy Chiao who plays the Buddhist monk that injects the Touch of Zen. Chiao was always a likable actor but he too never smiles or seems like anything but a chilly person here. In both cases however their demeanor is perfectly appropriate to the roles so I didn't mind that.And was that Sammo Hung in a bit part supporting the evil general Hs in the final struggles?".

He doesn't break down crying or screaming  why?! he simply accepts that this has happened and tries to deal with it almost entirely inside his head. he is an introvert speaking softly and politely to those around him. he doesn't ask too many questions because he already thinks he knows all the answers. and these terrible answers are projected to the audience with the use of his powerful blue eyes and his vital facial expressions. There are two scenes I think where the boy looks directly into the camera and makes eye contact with you the audience and I almost burst out crying.. the look of the film was what made the rest so sublime the grays and blues were so disenchantingly beautiful and for you that it's somehow immoral to make a 'holocaust' film as beautiful as this one keep in mind the colors and look reflect only the beautiful mind of the boy. best way i could describe this is a 'dreamy nightmare'. there are no acts of violence some minor but no guns mowing down innocents like Schindler's List just a quiet reflective look at the human condition which makes it especially relevant today especially back here in the States...

	schema:headline " Hauntingly beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "There have been many films about the holocaust but none quite as intimate and personal as Hungarian director Lajos Koltai's Fateless. Based on the semiautobiographical novel by Nobel Prize winner Imre Kertesz Fateless is a hauntingly beautiful film whose narrative unfolds in the form of miniature vignettes rather than peak dramatic moments. The film is seen from the perspective of 14yearold Gyuri Koves Marcell Nagy who spent a year in Buchenwald during the last days of World War II and who provides the narration. Unlike most films about the holocaust it suggests that happiness and beauty can coexist along with deprivation and despair.Marcell Nagy is outstanding as Gyuri the young man who moves from a childlike innocence to worldweariness in the span of one year. With his soulful face and expressive eyes he is almost a detached observer quietly pondering his fate. He is in the Sufi saying in the world but not of it and the film unfolds as in a lucid dream that blurs the lines between appearance and reality. Koltai captures this almost matteroffact quality as Gyuri says goodbye to his father Janos Ban who has been ordered to work in a Nazi labor camp. Because Hungarians did not feel the full brunt of Nazi persecution until the Nazi takeover in 1944 Gyuri thinks his father is just going to have to work hard and that nothing will happen to him. Neighbors and relatives who reassure him that everything will be all right do not further his grasp of reality.When the boy and his friends are detained on a bus on the way to work he learns quickly that his carefree childhood days are now over. Still not comprehending the magnitude of what is taking place he is annoyed but not frightened and does not seize the opportunity to escape offered by a friendly cop. Even when he arrives at Auschwitz he sits on the ground shaven and wearing a striped uniform talking with friends as if he was in a school playground during recess. When Gyuri discovers that he could be killed at any time anywhere he attains a sort of spiritual freedom and his determination to survive is increased. Pretending to be sixteen Gyuri escapes the gas chamber and is sent to Buchenwald and then to a smaller camp.The scenes of murder death and dying at the camps are thankfully left to the imagination and the film focuses on Gyuri's personal reactions to what he sees around him. Koltai a cinematographer for twentyfive years creates a visual cinematic poem in which his color palette is so muted that we experience the mud and the atmosphere of cold and gray almost viscerally. Sadly we watch Gyuri's transformation from the confident teenager we saw at the beginning to an emaciated number his leg so swollen and infected that he can barely walk.

When asked about the atrocities he talks of his happiness. The next time I am asked he says I ought to speak about that the happiness of the concentration camp. If indeed I am asked. And provided I myself don't forget. His happiness according to Kertesz who also wrote the screenplay is not a form of denial but an act of rebellion against those who do not see him any longer as a human being only as a victim.

	onyx:emotionText "There have been many films about the holocaust but none quite as intimate and personal as Hungarian director Lajos Koltai's Fateless. Based on the semiautobiographical novel by Nobel Prize winner Imre Kertesz Fateless is a hauntingly beautiful film whose narrative unfolds in the form of miniature vignettes rather than peak dramatic moments. The film is seen from the perspective of 14yearold Gyuri Koves Marcell Nagy who spent a year in Buchenwald during the last days of World War II and who provides the narration. Unlike most films about the holocaust it suggests that happiness and beauty can coexist along with deprivation and despair.Marcell Nagy is outstanding as Gyuri the young man who moves from a childlike innocence to worldweariness in the span of one year. With his soulful face and expressive eyes he is almost a detached observer quietly pondering his fate. He is in the Sufi saying in the world but not of it and the film unfolds as in a lucid dream that blurs the lines between appearance and reality. Koltai captures this almost matteroffact quality as Gyuri says goodbye to his father Janos Ban who has been ordered to work in a Nazi labor camp. Because Hungarians did not feel the full brunt of Nazi persecution until the Nazi takeover in 1944 Gyuri thinks his father is just going to have to work hard and that nothing will happen to him. Neighbors and relatives who reassure him that everything will be all right do not further his grasp of reality.When the boy and his friends are detained on a bus on the way to work he learns quickly that his carefree childhood days are now over. Still not comprehending the magnitude of what is taking place he is annoyed but not frightened and does not seize the opportunity to escape offered by a friendly cop. Even when he arrives at Auschwitz he sits on the ground shaven and wearing a striped uniform talking with friends as if he was in a school playground during recess. When Gyuri discovers that he could be killed at any time anywhere he attains a sort of spiritual freedom and his determination to survive is increased. Pretending to be sixteen Gyuri escapes the gas chamber and is sent to Buchenwald and then to a smaller camp.The scenes of murder death and dying at the camps are thankfully left to the imagination and the film focuses on Gyuri's personal reactions to what he sees around him. Koltai a cinematographer for twentyfive years creates a visual cinematic poem in which his color palette is so muted that we experience the mud and the atmosphere of cold and gray almost viscerally. Sadly we watch Gyuri's transformation from the confident teenager we saw at the beginning to an emaciated number his leg so swollen and infected that he can barely walk. In voiceover however he talks about the hours between work and the evening meal as one of quiet reflection and about the joy in discovering a piece of meat or potato in his soup. He is also sustained by a friend he develops in fellow Hungarian Bandi Citrom Aron Dimeny who protects him and tries to teach him the skills of survival. Bandi ever the optimist proclaims I will walk down Nefelejcs Street again One of the surprises in the film is the treatment Gyuri receives at what looks like a camp hospital.

The message is even more disturbing when told through the eyes of a young teenager who is caught up in the atrocities of the Nazis and their Hungarian allies.If this film were in English or directed by Steven Spielberg it would no doubt win numerous awards.

	schema:reviewBody "Fateless Sorstalansg has to answer Why make yet another nondocumentary film about the Holocaust? While of course every victim and survivor had an individually horrific experience and are essential witnesses for film viewers what unique viewpoint or story is there to watch that we haven't seen through tears before? It takes quite a while for the viewer to understand that the point of Nobelprize winning Imre Kertsz's adaptation of his debut semiautobiographical novel is to tell the specific story of Hungarian Jews as zero context is provided for the opening anecdotal scenes no dates no background information on where in World War II we are starting from and not even how much time is passing in the first third of the film as the Nazis' net tightens on Budapest's Jews.Perhaps director Lajos Koltai's goal in not providing the kind of context that was carefully established on films where he was the cinematographer Sunshine and Max was to help us understand the bewilderment of the diverse Jewish community observant and secular capitalists and workers young and old and the randomness of what happened to them. Families coalesce in confusion as they are buffeted by scraps of information changing government directives amidst antiSemitism and collaboration by their fellow Hungarians. We're also supposed to believe however that amidst these confusions the young teen protagonist the very expressive Marcell Nagy has extensive philosophical discussions with his play mates and the girl next door who he of course has a crush on about Jewish identity. Otherwise his WWII experiences look a lot like the boy's in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun.The next third of the film is gruesome experiences in concentration camps as we have seen before even though these are extremely effectively reenacted as the huge cast of actors and extras desiccate before our eyes. The production design in recreating the bare shelter and their work detail is the most realistic I've seen in a fiction film as compared to documentaries and as described to me by a cousin who was the sole Holocaust survivor in our family I'm named for her father who died in Auschwitz. Halfway through these horrors the theme of the film as to the uniqueness of the Hungarian experience starts to come through more than the usual Nazi sadism. Survival is linked to mutual dependence camaraderie and bonding that comes from their national identification even more than their shared religion we see a few inmates nobly strive to maintain Jewish rituals. Individual personalities vividly come through and attitude and the help of one's fellow man turns out to be as important as food as life is reduced to its most basic elements. The only other film I've seen that communicates this as emotionally was Peter Morley's documentary Kitty A Return to Auschwitz about an essential motherchild bond. Even during the camp experience though some subtleties are lost by lack of context for an Englishspeaking audience as a few scenes were confusing to me as there was evidently significances if a character was speaking German or Hungarian and that difference went by me. The German signage was not translated so the last part of the boy's Buchenwald experiences was also confusing unless the point was that he was mystified as well. The voice over narration throughout is unnecessarily for philosophical ruminations and does not communicate any additional information than the stark visuals and conversations.With liberation indirectly providing the first date reference in the film as we presume it is 1945 Daniel Craig has a cameo as an American soldier in his second appearance in a film in the past year as a Jew after Munich. His role recalls Montgomery Clift in Fred Zinnemann's 1948 The Search as one of the few films to also portray the wandering Jews as Displaced Persons amidst the rubble of Europe and their destroyed lives and communities.The last section is movingly unique and vital viewing as we see Europeans who we know from France to Russia but here particularly Hungarians will settle into their amnesia and denial of responsibility what a survivor in a documentary called the 81st blow that is the worst of all. While issues of vengeance are included in passing the survivors seem like ghosts in their tattered prison garb as haunting images that affront and challenge returning normality like echoes of a nightmare that should go away in the light of day. The survivors are suffering from posttraumatic stress and cannot communicate what happened to them in language that the curious whether family friends or strangers can understand or want to understand. The visceral impact is again marred by duplicative philosophizing.Ennio Morricone's score emphasizes the potential for humanity with beautiful vocalizations by Lisa Gerrard.As to the cinematography indiewire reports that the film used bleachedbypass color prints with laserapplied subtitles In the concentration camps it becomes more monochromatic. And after the liberation the color comes back in. I saw it still in first run at NYC's Film Forum and the print was already scratched quite a bit and there were frequent white on white subtitles. A neighbor whose family had experiences as in the film provided background The Germans entered Hungary on March 19 1944. They had exactly one year to do there what they did in Poland Czechoslovakia etc. in 6 years. The deportations started around AprilMay of 1944 from the outskirts of the country leaving Budapest to the end and since the war was over the following May there was no time to deport them as well. Jews from Budapest had to be terribly unlucky to be sent to the chambers. That's why my parents who survived and grandparents who did not were sent to the camps because they did not live in the capital. It was very haphazardly done from the capital. There were several groups of Jews who were taken from labor camps to the front in the Ukraine.".

	schema:reviewBody "Critics have compared Fateless to such other award winning films around the same subject notably Robert Benigni's Life Is Beautiful aka La Vita  Bella 1997 and Spielberg's Schindler's List 1993. Whilst in interview on the UK DVD the director Koltai doesn't mention Benigni's comedy of doom in passing he does cite the Spielberg to whom he makes it clear that Fateless is in some degree at least a riposte. For the director Schindler's List is a mistake for those who know what really happened is his view which represents no victory for humanity. The determined unsentimentality of Koltai's film reflects that view something which he goes as far as to transpose formally into a particular editing technique  an approach that audiences more used to a cosy and somewhat predictable view of the Holocaust will find striking. Koltai's treatment of narrative in his film characteristically breaking down stark events into short impressive scenes that fade to black he terms a series of tudes. Such a treatment serves to isolate the protagonists in time away from the emotionality that a more connected continuity encourages. Indeed for Koltai time is the... terrible... sentence and the main motive behind his film rather than outright shock and his film has great power precisely through this denial of the usual response.An easy criticism of Fateless is that conditions of the camp are shown as persistently harrowing but rarely explicitly violent. The hero Kves is starved slapped and humiliated but rarely does the viewer see an onscreen killing even if the stench of the crematoria is omnipresent. So much is real horror left unseen in fact that at the close of the film upon his return there's a scene where Kves is quizzed about the existence of gas chambers by a doubtful citizen at his home station. As a confirmation it is surely unnecessary for the audience as we've seen them earlier. One suspects that the importance of this brief exchange is instead to assert once and for all that Kves acknowledges the reality of the horror he's seen. Whether or not such epic tragedy and his involvement in it has enriched his humanity a la Spielberg is another matter entirely. By the end Kves thinks back to his experience almost nostalgically to the camps where life was cleaner and simpler and where there's nothing too unimaginable to endure. As one might expect from an acclaimed cinematographer much of Fateless looks superb. Whether its the snowflakes like the millions of spirits already departed floating inside the cattle trucks that speed the Hungarian Jews to their fate or the field of camp mates paraded mercilessly in the heat and wavering in their distinctive striped uniforms Koltai's eye creates haunting moments which remain with the viewer long after the closing credits. Arguably such poetry detracts from the grim reality of the camps in which a good deal of the film is set but a good deal of the film is shot in muted colours a blanched scheme as if the warmth of life has bled out into genocide.Performances are generally excellent notably that of Nagy. Interviews on the disc show the young actor's nervousness at some of the more demanding scenes and the increasing time required spent in make up as his on screen physical deterioration continues but he plays a role which takes him from the dining room of the family home of Budapest to the death carts of Zief without faltering. Fateless is an international coproduction between Hungary German and England. All three languages make their appearance and so  incidentally  does the new James Bond Daniel Craig as Kves' liberation approaches. Here playing a concerned GI who strongly suggests the boy seeks out a new life and a university place in the west Craig makes a brief if effective impression. As it turns out Kves' ultimate decision is characteristic of a film that favours reality over idealism.But for those who seek the unrelenting grimness of camp life depicted as in say One Day In The Life of Ivan Denisovitch 1970 or the memorable depiction of the hardening of innocence into vengeful shock Come And See Fateless will doubtless prove a slight disappointment. Ennio Morricone's excellent score notwithstanding which gives events here an occasionally pathetic sheen this is a film which in many ways raises more issues and questions than it answers and certainly offers no stereotypical picture of a ghastly time. Instead by asking the audience to question preconceptions it stakes claim to being one of the more important Holocaust dramas of our time.".

It attracted so many viewers that no Hungarian film has done before and as it's not surprising that a Holocaustfilm like this divides the audience. Thousands of readers had fallen in love with Imre Kertsz's Nobelprized novel and expectations in this case are very high. However this film does NOT have to make any disappointment and opposite to some critics' opinion it holds the same meaning the novel holds. Don't forget that Kertsz is the screenwriter too it is his true story a man's who went through all these and kept the respect of life so could find happiness after and during this. He agreed this film's value. The movie has some great actors wonderful pictures and lots of very good atmospheric scenes with very real memorable characters. The score is extremely beautiful how it's natural if the composer is Ennio Morricone.There are weaknesses too of course some dialogues mainly in the beginning of the film are not natural maybe it comes from Kertsz's newness in filmwriting it' very disturbing as some weak acting in a few episodes. Marcell Nagy is not a bad choice for the leading role he has the look and the power in his eyes but in speech he's not convincing it drops you out of the atmosphere sometimes but it won't bother the notHungarian audience.'Fateless' is an impressive European masterpiece Hungary should be proud of it.".

	schema:headline " Concentration camp through the eyes of a teenage boy";
	schema:reviewBody "Fateless Sorstalansg  grows out of a famous novel by 2002 Nobel laureate in literature Imre Kertsz based on his experiences as a 14year old Jewish boy from Budapest held in Nazi concentration camps toward the end of the War released and returned home. When we first meet him Gyuri Kves Marcell Nagy is sort of cool tall thin selfpossessed with big puffhead hair  rather like a young Bob Dylan. We enter a world of confusion and denial which he is forced to inhabit. Gyuri is conscientious about keeping his Star of David showing as he walks home across a square as if it's a point of sartorial pride. He doesn't know very well the Hebrew liturgy he's asked to repeat in his family but he's not like the neighbor girl he fancies who cries because she doesn't know what it means to be a Jew. Gyuri arrives to find his father deprived of his business and commanded to go off to work camp. Gyuri's assigned to work in a factory and two elders  a Kafkaesque pair whom we'll meet again when the war's over  argue vociferously over whether he should go to his job by bus or by train as if that decision would resolve the whole predicament. The women are silently weeping the men selfdeceived hypocrites or are they being brave? Gyuri is detached and confident up for trying a little smooching during an air raid. He's not a hero but he seems capable of thriving. Nonetheless he almost dies in the camps. In fact when he's back he says he's already dead. Maybe I don't exist he tells the girl he flirted with before. Gyuri isn't taken away in a terrifying sweep like the Warsaw Ghetto sequence in Schindler's List in fact things continue to be Kafkaesque. He's pulled off a bus going to the factory and held up with some others by an inept cop who waits for orders all at sea himself. The whole process of going to the camps seems like a series of bureaucratic snafus. Later Gyuri observes that there were many points where anyone might have escaped. See Kafka's The Trial. A crucial point comes when a lot of boys are unloaded at Auschwitz and somebody tips them off to claim they're 16. A German soldier with the face of a cadaver thumbs Gyuri to the right to work. A littler bespectacled boy and an officious engineer who brags of his skills and his perfect German are sent left to die. From Buchenwald Gyuri's sent to a smaller camp where there aren't even gas chambers and crematoria. From then on the camp experience is a series of short sequences ending in blackouts nightmarish vignettes that stay in the moment and avoid grand scenes  except for the hanging of three escaped prisoners who've been caught. Characters emerge only to disappear in the chaos of camp life. A man who's just survived four years in a Soviet prison camp becomes Gyuri's protector and mentor showing him how to horde bits of food and keep clean to avoid lice and disease. But Gyuri eventually balks at this second level of control lets himself fall prey to hunger and exhaustion grows scabby and corpselike and collapses with a swollen and infected knee. It's treated but then gets even worse and he's thrown on a pile of corpses the undead among the almost dead and the already dead. Through this his voiceover comments on scenes that unroll for us. Sloughing through rain and mud always cold hungry thirsty the boy still sees a beauty in the twilight hour when they return from work eat and have a minute of peace in this stark hellhole in which later he says they were happy because things were simple and clear. The young actor grew four inches during filmmaking and his voice changed. It's his deeper voice that narrates and tells us at the end about a nostalgia for this clarity and simplicity for the happiness of the camps that no outsider ever knows about and his physical transformation echoes the transformation of his character whose body is still a teenager's but whose mind is middleaged. Somehow the boy ends the war in a prison hospital that restores his strength. The most astonishing moments come when resisting an American officer's advice to go to Switzerland then to America Gyuri returns to Budapest. Here he is back in town cadaverous sunkeneyed scabbylipped in prison stripes yet somehow firm and proud on a Budapest trolley answering a man's questions explaining to him that in the camp beatings and starvation were all quite natural. This and encounters with the wouldbe girlfriend and family and neighbors are the freshest moments in this beautiful painful eyeopening look at the Nazi persecution. Director Koltai has long been a fine cinematographer and the visuals in Fateless are striking the horrible smoke from the ovens lovely in the evening light even as they make the young hero realize what it means and declare We are all going to die. Kertsz has his own dry take on his subject Auschwitz is the human condition the end point of a great adventure where the European traveler arrived after his twothousandyearold moral and cultural history. Showing the camps through the eyes of a pubescent boy who suffers but experiences beauty is essential to the cold neutrality of the author's viewpoint and director Koltai has recreated things in a way that never feels manipulative. No tragic sweeping strings  no tragedy at all rather a mix of grim suffering and transcendence that takes you close to the experience without letting you pretend that you've been there. When someone asks Gyuri how he is when he's back he answers Very very angry.".

	schema:headline " Learning the Meaning of Life in a Concentration Camp";
	schema:reviewBody "'Sorstalansag' FATELESS is an inordinately powerful quiet journey through a year in Nazi Concentration Camps at Auschwitz Buchenwald and Zeitz. Adapted by Imre Kertesz from his first novel the story is semiautobiographical as Kertesz spent a year of his youth in Auschwitz as a Hungarian Jew. Though Kertesz alters his novel of the life of one Gyorgy Koves in a manner he carefully explains in one of the featurettes accompanying this DVD the observational skills and tenor of his literate mind suffuse this surprisingly quiet depiction of life in a death camp.We first meet Gyorgy Koves as a curly headed handsome 14year old youth in 1944 bidding farewell to his beloved father as he departs for a labor camp. Wearing the yellow star of David proudly Gyorgy has little understanding of what it is to be a Jew a lesson he will learn in the coming year and affect his perception of the world and his place in it. Gyorgy's mother left his father and his father has remarried and requests that Gyorgy stay with his stepmother while he is away 'for a while' in the labor camp. Gyorgy is conflicted as he loves his mother but he does as his father requests. Almost inadvertently Gyorgy and his friends are taken off a bus and separated by the Nazis into trains bound for concentration camps. Gyorgy remains relatively naive about what is happening his head is shaved his worldly goods are absconded and he begins the hellish life of survival in Auschwitz. Where Kertesz writes differently than other authors who have described Holocaust conditions is in his mindset of Gyorgy Gyorgy strives to retain a sense of equilibrium in this bizarre new life seeing certain events as probable errors mistakes or simply 'the way things are'. He endures starvation brutal work pain from an injured and infected knee boredom and observing sights of torture of his fellow prisoners. Though he is walking in a stunned world he is still able to fine the little moments of 'happiness' because of his youthful outlook and creative mind. He gradually grows to understand what being a Jew means and while he is unable to fathom all he sees in captivity he learns that if he can't understand life in a concentration camp how can he understand life outside either. Gyorgy is literally on the carts moving toward the crematorium when the Allies free the camp. He meets an American Daniel Craig who suggests he not return to Budapest but go to America instead where he can pursue a new existence. Yet Gyorgy's devotion to family to country and to being a Jew returns him to Budapest where he finds a destroyed city that had been home and wanders the town square trying to make sense of it all.As Gyorgy Koves Marcell Nagy gives a stunning performance a picture of a childman who is forced to enter the world of adulthood via the horrors of Auschwitz. Nagy captures the essence of the character with minimal dialogue and maximum use of his body language and eyes. The supporting cast is superb each creating vignettes in the few moments we see them that burn into our memory. The cinematography by Gyula Pados uses subdued color for the scenes outside the camps and a subtle sepia toned black and white or the scenes within the walls of the terrifyingly real buildings and yards of the camps. The musical score by Ennio Morricone sustains the mood throughout. But it is the director Lajos Koltai whose impeccable sensitivity to Kertesz' writing and vision that makes this long 140 minutes film a seamless pondering of the passage of time  minute by minute hour by hour day by day etc  that is the essence of Gyorgy's survival of a nightmare 'with little moments of happiness wherever they may happen'. This is a magnificent film by a gifted crew and though it contains visuals that will crush your heart it must be seen to be believed. In Hungarian and German and English with subtitles. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Worse than expected";
	schema:reviewBody "My school rented an entire cinema last Friday so we could see the movie together. I read reviews of it before but I didn't expect it to be this bad. I had a bad feeling before going to the cinema because I thought that while most movies that are filmed after books are made in 1015 years this was made in 4 with problems on the set slowing down filming.It's about a Jewish boy in Hungary who is taken to Auschwitz and Buchenwald and other camps during the end of WWII. It's hard to tell where he is most of the time because we only get the boys narration telling us about it but he never says why he was taken there which is really frustrating.The acting if fair but there are some awful performances like Gyuris neighbor Annamria. I don't know how the director aloud that performance to be in the film. Most of the support cast are good but most of them don't really have anything to do or say they just look like they were meant to be really moving.The direction is the worst part of the movie in my opinion. I never wanted to see a dynamic picture but this was too much for me. The theme of direction is that we get a lot of episodes divided by fade ins and fadeouts. This is incredibly boring and monotonous and makes it hard to watch. Especially when most of the scenes are 12 minutes long and sometimes they have no end or beginning. Spoiler Like when Gyuri is at the camp with tents in it. One night its heavily raining and Gyuri comes out from under the tents and goes towards the washingtroughs. It takes him 1 or 2 minutes to get there because he always slips in the mud. This is a little boring after a while so one can't help but wonder why in the world is he going there. It's raining so it can't be that he wants to wash himself. So we wait patiently for him. And just as he reaches his destination what happens? Fadeout...Spoiler off We never get to know why he went or what happened there. Frustrating really. And there are some more scenes like this one. No beginning no end no meaning no affect on the story it's just there.Another stupid thing about the scenes is that they mostly end with the camera taking a shot of Gyuris face. Most of the times he looks really sadlyseriously at something or is just staring into the great beyond like Ben Affleck does but this kid is better at it. Now this also gets boring after a while. And we never see what he is looking at or those sort of things. we just get to have his face. And this takes up at least a half hour of the movie.Another flaw is that the movie is just too beautiful. You know I never thought Buchenwald was such a pretty place. Most of the scenes are shot like this. Very picturelike they are like small compositions maybe thats why people don't move too much. And the fact that the colors are mostly black palewhite and decayyellow also add to the feeling that this movie is not lifelike. Although I thought the book was good because of that fact.The music is bad. I love Ennio Morricones music but here it's just plain old bad. Too romantic... bad.The dialogs aren't a strong point either. Imre Kertesz's novel was great but after this movie it's clear that he is no screenwriter. Awkward sentences and words that don't really belong there.The fact that there are some downright stupid things about itSpoiler like when Gyuris is halfdead in a pile of other dead people we see everyone naked except Gyuri. It's not that I want to see the kid naked but this sort of thing is just too dumb.Spoiler off These things make this movie seem a whole lot worse than it could have been.After Schindler's List there isn't really anything shocking about the film but that would be alright because the objective of the picture should have been to look at the story of the Holocaust through the eyes of a kid from another point of view than we have had already seen many times. But the movie fails in that aspect too.All in all I am disappointed. This movie adds nothing new to the world of cinema. There is nothing outstanding about it. This movie could have been so much better. But it messed up up. Too bad. Maybe in a 50 years we'll get a good adaptation.".

I had much anticipation and high demands when I sat down to eventually watch it through. Soon I got a little disappointed though and emerged from my seat after the end credits missing the cathartic realization of having seen a spectacular adaptation of a highlyacclaimed Nobelprize winning literary artwork. I have to say hardly a bit of the original novel's conception came through. In the book the protagonist has a genuine utterly sarcastic view of the tragic events of the Holocaust whereas in the movie 16yearold Marcell Nagy is struggling to show any authentic emotions other than the confusion he might have felt on the set of a film of this grandiosity. He simply does not have the intuition necessary to convey Gyurka's take on the inexplicable behavior of people infected by twisted ideologies. Other acting performances also fall flat discrediting Koltai's every effort to make Fateless a great piece. Photographying however is wonderful and sets nicely detailed and very authenticlooking. The faded almost blackanwhite images with the occasional occurrence of the color red is  if I am trying to be careful with my choice of words  very much reminiscent of Schindler's list though.".

Yes it was meandering and slow but something carries you all the way through that wasn't the script but it was something visceral and at points lulled me into a sort of hypnosis. This combined with the detached sound of the young actors voice and sound of time in machinery in clocks in breathing there are amazing sounds behind the images. Yes scenes end with no purpose and the center of the film if you could call it that fades in and out and in and out but this only further complimented the disturbing feeling I was left with that this could all happen in a second in a minute or a year it was all the same. Spending a month at one of those camps going about this hellish routine could only lead someone to perceive all the days melting into one long dark endless and pointless summary... Those who know the directors work as a cinematographer will know how beautiful this film is visually. It might be advantage that I can't speak Hungarian so I can't really tell how the acting works or not but paid close attention to the facial expressions which were very careful. one thing I found a little frustrating it was the score. Some of it is just painfully romantic and belongs elsewhere. Only certain people are conducive to this type of material and you probably know who you are. ALSO  try and detach yourself from the book.

It's the story of a 14year old Hungarian Jew sent to Aushwitz Concentration Camp during World War II. Shot beautifully by Gyula Pados the film's color palette and sets are simply striking.

Mr. Kertesz the winner of the Nobel prize for literature own experiences as a prisoner of war were the basis for this moving cinematic account of one of the worst horrors in history. Mr. Koltai was helped in his debut by trusting Gyula Pados to photograph the story as well as asking Ennio Morricone one of the best in the movie business to do the musical score.We are taken to the Budapest of 1944 where Gyuri Koves a fourteen year old Hungarian Jew lives with his family. His life is about to change. His father is going to a work camp and Gyuri also decides to go. Little prepares him when fate intervenes and he is taken from the bus he took to the train that will transfer him to a concentration camp. The horrors Gyuri experiences will make him a stronger individual having seen death on a daily basis. Gyuri survives the holocaust but he had to pay a dear price when he gets back to reality.Best thing in the film is Marcell Nagy who as Gyuri runs away with the picture. This young actor was an asset for director Koltai because of the magnificent performance the director got from this young man. As movies of this genre go Fateless will stay in the viewer's mind for a long time. The ensemble players make a great contribution to our overall enjoyment. There is a cameo appearance by Dan Director Koltai bathes the film in color in the initial scenes in Budapest then he changes to a sepia tone and even to a bluish tone that work fine with the narrative. There is a cameo appearance by Daniel Craig as an Allied soldier that is liberating the camps.Fateless is a hard film to sit through although highly recommend it because of its antiwar message. Thanks for a job well done Lajos Koltai.".

However FATELESS has less in common with Spielberg's movie and is closer in essence to THE PIANIST in which a young man  here a teenager  is put into the meatgrinder of experience and survives to tell his story. It also shares a similarity to Spielberg's EMPIRE OF THE SUN in which another boy also faced the horrors of war and experienced an accelerated painful growth emerging as a near shell of his former self at the close of the film.However the boy in FATELESS Gyuri Kovacs is faced with a dilemma concerning his own Jewishness all throughout the movie. At the start of the movie a girl he has a crush on expresses her anger at being labelled a Jew and having to wear the cross. It's as if for her being Jewish were the equivalent of being a freak of nature  and it's a possible feeling not very mentioned because for many suddenly being thrown into the lion's den and being systematically destroyed for the very sake of being Jewish must have been as incomprehensible for them as for example a gay man being pummeled to death by homophobes.Later on when he is through a fateful decision taken into Auschwitz we're given hints of the inhuman levels of violence that just being in the camps must have been. A short scene in which one of the boys reveals his age to be sixteen and is sent to a group where other selected stand is so potent because of what it implies rather than shows as the camera lingers for one long moment at his bespectacled confused face. His own survival seems to rely on his veiled attitude at the horror he experiences it's as if his own incomprehension of what is happening to him would be his own saving grace.And even then the question floats over his head as to his own heritage to which he has no answer. Moments of inevitable friendship ensue with a young man who takes to the boy and in the meantime the picture grows more and greyer as the life is literally sucked out of Gyuri.A turning point takes place late in the movie however and it becomes a nearly unwatchable experience to see Gyuri being placed in a row of corpses more so because another neardead man thin as a rail resists even then to his own fate. His own survival and return to society is comparable to that of the shellshocked Vietnam soldiers who once they came back from the war were greeted not with open arms but with a sense that they were damaged goods.What is surprising though is the attitude that Gyuri has once he is free of his systematic punishment. It's a facet that hasn't really been explored and one that I thought was an interesting novel approach not just to this situation but any situation. The fact that Gyuri decides to say that he never saw gas chambers or crematoriums and that he decides not to let this horrific event have any hold over him is probably the single most powerful message FATELESS expresses. By not wallowing in the tragedy the movie takes on a transcendental quality. It's a rare move to have a story focus more on hope within and after the horror and Gyuri's last words ...if I don't forget them... ring very true. Sometimes the only way to truly survive is to do the unthinkable to forget and move on.".

Nobel Prize winner Kertesz and Koltay the Oscar nominated cinematographer in his directing debut are both newcomers to their respective roles and the film bears all the resulting flaws. Morricone is an old pro but he seems not to have given everything when composing the soundtrack  not much actually besides his name.The original book is genius and the film itself was a national cause in Hungary with heavy government funding so in some ways it's not surprising that it fails to deliver.It's easy to tell the movie was shot with the master cinematographer's eye as it rolls beautifully throughout and it does follow the book's heartwrenching plot relatively closely.What it misses is the book's unique voice. What sets Sorstalansag Fateless apart from the ocean of Holocaust books is the young protagonist's withdrawn uninvolved perspective. He never allows himself to dive into the big questions of life and never protests against his fate  or a lack of it. The book lacks big emotions those are always formed in the reader making them all the more powerful.This is where the film fails miserably. Maybe it was too tempting to go the sentimental route maybe it's Morricone's uninspired music maybe it's Koltay's inexperience as a director but Fateless turns into nothing more and nothing less than a relatively well made Holocaust film. Enjoyable if a bit longish.The great bright spot is young Marcell Nagy who delivers with precision well beyond his age as the lead character. Whether knowingly or by chance he always has an aura of remoteness about him that nails the original's voice exactly. Even surrounded by some of the best Hungarian actors the boy carries the film by himself. If for nothing else it's well worth to see to witness such a stunning performance.".

	schema:headline " One of the great romanticsatirical comedies of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a famous review of this film by the late Sunday Times critic Dilys Powell which begins 'Is the joke funny?'... what Miss Powell was getting at was that given the horror of the Holocaust it is appropriate to laugh at the Nazis. The answer is ultimately irrelevant to the viewing of this modest masterpiece.Lubitsch was by this time coming to the end of an exquisite career that defined the nature of sophistication in 'light' cinema. 'To Be or Not To Be' skips lightly over all of the minefield of a subject like this and it is difficult or impossible to think of any other filmmaker who might have managed it if you look at Mel Brooks' limp remake you can see why.In 1996 I presented a massive season of 'the greatest' films in Belfast for the centenary of cinema  250 titles in 9 months. Of all of them this was the film which got the greatest ovation  about 5 minutes with a nearly full house standing and applauding! They may have applauded for many reasons but here are certainly some of them...The very complicated narrative is presented virtually flawlessly and the comedy is never allowed to hold up the narrative. The principle actors  Carole Lombard breathtakingly beautiful and Jack Benny in particular but many of the supporting cast as well  throw themselves into the affair with a gusto that is completely infectious. Apart from the satirical aspect of the story and the way in which Hitler and the Nazis are mercilessly ridiculed for their authoritarianism and the fear which is their only motivator the film pokes gentle fun at the vanity of actors in a warm and happy manner. Finally and most important is the notion of farce. Farce rarely works in the cinema but here it does and in the grand manner  just look at how many times the situation regarding Professor Siletsky changes profoundly during the film  it is dizzying  yet the characters manage to come up with often selfdefeating or inappropriate schemes on every occasion.This is a wonderful work that I have no hesitation in saying is absolutely vital for anyone who wants to really understand the glory of the cinema. But to answer Dilys Powell's question... yes the joke is deliriously funny.".

	schema:headline " A controversial classic that was actually made in 1941";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was made before while the US was still playin' both ends against the middle.  Makin' huge profits while staying neutral The film was not allowed to be released until after the US entered the war. Easily the best of the screen versions.  The cast is tight and the timing is impeccable.  You can really tell that the cast believed in the film.  Since America had not taken a formal stance at the time this went into production the producers cast and crew were really making something revolutionary and controversial.  So much so that the making of this movie was not even mentioned on the Jack Benny radio program.  Which is a major deal for those familiar with Old Time Radio Jack's film career provided excellent material for comedy writers on the radio show but also the radio show was an excellent opportunity to promote a movie.  It is doubtful that this was a missed opportunity what is more likely is that his sponsor or perhaps the network did not want to advocate a position.  This movie is wonderful for so many reasons.  Not only is it hilarious there is suspense intrigue and history.  Another poster mentions the Nazi's jumping out of the plane at the order of a radio transmission by Hitler.  The thing to remember here is that the Nazi army was seen as an unstoppable war machine so efficient that soldiers would commit suicide if asked.  This was less humor than it was to evoke fear of fascism.Everyone remembers Bob Hope and his travels during WWII well Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were no slouches either.  After all they made this movie. Carole died in a plane crash along with her mother and twenty others returning from a war bond rally before the film was released.  Jack went where few if any cameras or radio transmitters could reach.  He could be found in the most remote parts of the world entertaining the troops.  Not to take anything from Bob he went there as well he just had more photo ops.Bottom line watch this movietwice maybe more the dialogue is so quick and witty there is a good chance you might miss it the first time them again it is worth at least to looks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joseph Tura and his wife are part of an actors troop in preWW2 Poland. When a handsome young pilot is forced to break off his affair with Mrs Tura to go to England and join the RAF he sends a message through an English agent who offers to take messages to families of all the pilots when he goes to Poland.  Realising too late that Professor Siletsky is a double agent taking addresses to the Nazi's Lt Sobinski alerts Tura who is forced to play several roles to try and outwit the Nazi's and protect the underground resistance.Despite having heard it mentioned and avoided the remake I had still never seen this film until earlier today.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I knew that it had been made during the war and that it's humour might not seem as mocking or sharp today.  However I was surprised how funny it actually was while it also dealt with the Nazi issue at the same time.  The mocking tone of the film is balanced nicely by a real vein of wit with sharp word play all around.  The plot is kept ticking over by this humour until Tura is able to drive the film by his many performances!The Nazi's are mocked without taking away from the horrors of what they were.  The cast are what really makes the film work for me though.  Although he takes second billing I can't help but feel that Benny is the star of the film as he has all the best characters and the lion's share of the lines. Lombard does very well indeed and shows a real ability for quick witty lines  the fact that she died in a plane crash leaving this her last movie should be considered a great loss.  The whole support cast whether Polish actor or German commander all play very well managing to bring both wit and pathos to the film.Overall a film that is not as uncomfortable to watch as I suspected it might have been in fact one that is downright hilarious at times and has all the sharpness and wit that I want in a comedy.  When Jack Benny says so they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt' for the 5th time I defy you not to be rolling!".

	schema:headline " Swan Song in Warsaw";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1940 the American public was shocked when Charlie Chaplin released his first all talkie movie THE GREAT DICTATOR in which he lampooned Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Despite the new European war we were yet still at peace with both Axis states. Hollywood with rare exceptions BLOCKADE CONFESSIONS OF A NAZI SPY ESCAPE had been gingerly tackling the Nazis and Fascists. Yet public reaction to THE GREAT DICTATOR was odd. It had a big box office success and yet many were appalled because it chose to say Hitler could be laughed at. Chaplin's response was that if he had been laughed at to begin with he would never have become such a threat.Actually other voices were beginning to stir in Hollywood. One was the great comedy director Ernst Lubitsch who poked an occasional jab at the Nazis. Lubitsch had to wait until 1941 for a full assault on the Nazis  TO BE OR NOT TO BE a film that looked at the German invasion of Poland and it's occupation of Warsaw. It had an interesting cast. The lead went to Carole Lombard who had many comedy performances under her belt. She played Maria Tura the leading lady and wife of that great actor as he always prefaces his remarks Joseph Tura. Joseph is Jack Benny.Of all the leading men in her career Lombard never played opposite one who was really more of a star in a different medium. Typical costars for Lombard were John Barrymore Fred MacMurray Cary Grant Ralph Bellamy William Powell Robert Montgomery Clark Gable and Fredric March. Here it was Benny who while he had a string of movie credits was basically a radio comedy star and later would be a television star. His best films GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE ARTISTS AND MODELS CHARLIE'S AUNT were not record breakers at the box office. In fact while his performances were good in these he did not necessarily shine in them Laird Cregar in one simple moment in CHARLIE'S AUNT got the biggest laugh of the film. Nobody realized that his performance as Joseph Tura would be his best one and that within two years he'd make his final starring fiasco in THE HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT.Benny and Lombard proved to work well together as the egotistical but oddly loving couple of theater hams. In fact the actors making up the Tura company are all good including Lionel Atwill who briefly is seen playing Claudius to Benny's Hamlet Felix Bressart as Greenberg who dreams of doing the Shylock speech from THE MERCHANT OF VENICE Tom Dugan as Bronski who hopes to play Hitler on the stage Charles Halton as Dubosch the stage manager and the head of the Warsaw underground and Maude Eburne as Lombard's cynical maid Anna. The screenplay did give plenty of time showing the difficulties and tensions of a stage company working together and of handling temperamental stars and their egos.While putting on a play lampooning the Nazis whom Benny and the others dislike the government of Poland Frank Reicher says that due to the growing problems with Germany the play can't be produced. So the troop put on Tura's production of HAMLET. Benny as the Prince of Denmark giving the great soliloquy goes through the proper steps although knowing the comedian from Radio one expects him to start it with WELL!. But he finds that a man in uniform young Robert Stack leaves his seat in the middle of the third aisles just as he begins To be or not to be.... He does not know until later in the film that Stack had arranged to do this to keep a rendezvous with Lombard in her dressing room. Subsequently he treats her to a plane flight he is a Polish Air Force pilot. When war comes he and his fellows fight but the survivors make it to England. The grimmest section of the film is the occupation scenes. Like the comedy in THE GREAT DICTATOR because we know what actually happened these scenes seem slightly unreal. But in 194142 they still get the fears and difficulties of the occupation across. Signs of stores and streets we saw hanging normally earlier are in ruins including a delicatessen. The theater is boarded up. Had Lubitsch wished to do a tragic film he could easily have done so. But he allows the situation to blossom into a black comedy.Stanley Ridges plays Professor Siletsky a secret German Agent who has fooled the Allies into going back to Warsaw. He has the names of families of the pilots. Stack is sent back to Warsaw to stop him and contacts Lombard who helps. Soon the entire theater group gets involved. But will their theatrical egos blow their antiNazi plans? That is the running theme of the concluding portion of the film. Also along for the ride is Sig Ruman as Col. Ehrhardt the Gestapo Chief who relishes the name Concentration Camp Ehrhardt but who keeps running afoul of Professor Siletsky it is the Professor isn't it? when he makes seemingly harmless comments about Hitler. His reaction is usually to yell for his adjutant Schultz Henry Victor whose whole purpose is apparently to be there to be yelled at.The film was a great success but the death of Carole Lombard in a plane crash a month after it was shot cast a shadow over it. Yet it was a fitting swan song for that divine comedienne's career.".

There are a few slow spots early in the movie but after it hits its stride everything fits together well.Very few filmmakers can make something like this succeed because they take themselves too seriously. Lubitsch does not and as a result this film provides a caricatured but relatively insightful portrayal of the Nazis with a lighthearted yet appreciative look at those who opposed them in the occupied countries. The right kind of lighter touch can sometimes be more effective in commenting on important issues than the heavy emotionally laden harangues that are all too common.While providing good entertainment this movie also brings out the Nazis' inherent insecurity pettiness and shortsightedness while also demonstrating their growing capacity for destroying the innocent. For example the wonderful character actor Sig Ruman is greatly entertaining as a Nazi bureaucrat yet he also cleverly brings out the pathetic side of such persons.Aside from a couple of good gags it starts off just a little slowly. A lot of time is spent on Robert Stack's character who is through no fault of Stack's not very interesting. Likewise the subplot involving him and Lombard takes up a lot more time than it was worth. Other than that though it moves briskly with many entertaining scenes while it develops the story. As the pace picks up the members of Benny's acting troupe get some fine moments of their own Benny himself has some fine scenes with several other characters and everything builds up nicely towards a good finale.".

The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact.The film works because of the great contribution of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard who sadly died before the film had its premiere. They play the Turas a Polish theatrical couple that foresee the Nazi invasion of their country.In fact Jack Benny a man associated as a comedian first on radio then on television was an actor with an uncanny sense of timing. Mr. Benny was a natural for this type of comedy as he proves in the film. His pairing with Carole Lombard was a stroke of genius. In fact for being associated to lighter fare he demonstrates with his take on Joseph Tura he was an actor of stature.Carole Lombard is seen as Maria Tura a grand dame of the Polish theater. Ms. Lombard gave a marvelous performance and her contribution to the success of this film is amazing. Robert Stack is seen as the pilot Sobinski. Other faces in the cast include Felix Bressard Lionel Atwill Sig Ruman George Lynn and others that are perfect under Ernst Lubitsch guidance.This is a film to be treasured because of the work of Jack Benny and the impeccable direction of Ernst Lubitsch.".

	schema:headline " In the hands of a ham";
	schema:reviewBody "It has long been controversial to make a comedy out of war and tragedy but often it is among the best ways of dealing with a difficult subject. Being able to satirize evil and imagine humour even in the most desperate of plights is a big part of coming to terms with these things. And when done in the right way it can make some of the most compelling works that cinema has to offer. With To Be or Not to Be director Ernst Lubitsch who had spent most of his career making sophisticated and often innuendoladen comedies with absolutely no political content surprised everyone by tackling the most urgent of topical issues headon yet still maintaining the frivolous comedy style that was his forte.Cowritten with Melchior Lengyel who had provided Lubitsch with his earlier hit Ninotchka To Be or Not to Be features a brilliant premise  that of actors turning their skills to do underground work. As such it takes a lighthearted yet affectionate view of stage acting which is where Lubitsch started out. This was a rather timely subject in Hollywood at the time. In the early days of sound a lot of theatre actors had been called in to do the talkie business but now the trend was shifting towards subtler more naturalistic performances as especially encouraged by directors like William Wyler and George Stevens. And there's nothing wrong with that approach  Wyler and Stevens were making some excellent pictures  but as a result the good old ham actor was becoming a somewhat marginalised figure. To Be or Not to Be makes the theatrical scenerychewers into the heroes. The debate between the different styles is itself the subject of many of the gags for example Lionel Atwill continually having to be reminded not to overact. The young Polish airman who woos Lombard is named Stanislaw perhaps after Stanislavski the nemesis of ham actors.The casting of To Be or Not to Be is like a celebration of the little hams. You won't find theatrical legends like Charles Laughton or John Barrymore here but supporting players like Atwill Felix Bressart and Tom Dugan are exactly the sort of people who were now a dying breed in the Hollywood movie. Here they can be seen at their unashamed best. The two leads on the other hand are not hams at all but they were among the best comedy actors of the era. Jack Benny was ironically a master at underplaying scenes often at his funniest when doing very little such as drawing out the pause before beginning Hamlet's soliloquy. Carole Lombard was a consummate comedienne often adopting a tone of complete sincerity that made little throwaway lines like her enraptured It certainly does interest me when Robert Stack is talking about his bomber sound comically ridiculous. But she could turn that sincerity to dramatic purpose as well for example her very genuine look of trepidation when she is questioned trying to leave the hotel.And finally let us talk of Lubitsch himself. There isn't much to say about Lubitsch's direction here that I haven't said in one of my many other reviews of his pictures. One thing that is specifically worth mentioning now though is the attention Lubitsch gives to minor performers. Another feature of the more modern directors is that they gave very little screen time to bit players. The aforementioned Wyler would often get supporting players to do their scenes with their backs to the camera so as not to draw attention from the leads. Again this is not intended as a criticism  it is right for Wyler's dramas. But Lubitsch was one director who always found a little bit of camera time for even the most inconsequential of actors. There are obvious examples in To Be or Not to Be with the many members of the acting troupe but notice how in the scene with the Polish aviators in Britain he treats several of them to closeups. These aren't faceinthecrowd closeups that you might see in a montage. Instead it's as if each of these men has become a lead character for a few seconds even though they will soon disappear from the story. But Lubitsch did not do this indiscriminately. In the scene where Lombard passes on the photograph at the bookstore there are two Nazis in the background. We don't catch a glimpse of their faces we just have to know that they exist. It seems that when Lubitsch lingers on a character's face he does so out of affection. And that is really the attitude that permeates To Be or Not to Be  contempt for the villains affection for the heroes even through all the wit and satire. It is this ideal that really makes that fusing of the tragic and the comic work.".

	schema:headline " Jack Benny as Hamlet";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the great movie farces of all time. I would rank it very close to my all time favorite Dr. Strangelove. There are several tiers of interpretation as is true of any noteworthy satire. It is not only poking fun at the stupidity and vanity of Nazism but at aggressive war in general. Referring to Joseph Tura Jack Benny playing Hamlet on stage Colonel Ehrhardt Sig Ruman states What he did to Shakespeare we are doing to Poland. Only someone with the comic genius of Ernst Lubitsch could compare the Thespian rape of Shakespeare with the physical rape of a country and make it work.Jack Benny although one of the most popular entertainers of all time never got his just deserts for his acting abilities. Though he utilizes many of his physical mannerisms that worked so well for his comedy routines on radio in the movies and later on TV he also does some very fine acting in To Be Or Not To Be. He is teamed with the multitalented Carole Lombard yet keeps up with her all the way. The two work well together. Had Carole Lombard not been tragically killed in a plane crash while serving her country just before the release of this film she would possibly have been teamed with Benny again. The rest of the cast including newcomer Robert Stack keep up the pace and give all the support needed to make Lubitsch's film a winner in particular the histrionics of Sig Ruman the definitive Nazi stooge later parodied in the popular TV series Hogan's Heroes.The script which Lubitsch himself helped put together blossoms with hilarious oneliners such as So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt? To read a few of the most famous ones see IMDb quotes for the film. Better still rent or buy a copy of this classic and watch it a few times to hear them for yourself. IMDb only lists some not all for that would take several pages.The story sounds like one for a typical romantic or screwball type comedy. A troupe of Shakespearean actors in Warsaw Poland appear to be on the road to success due to the fame of the leading lady Maria Tura Carole Lombard. Her husband Joseph Benny seems to be in her shadow though he does his best as the Prince of Denmark Hamlet. Yet each time he does the famous soliloquy that begins To be or not to be the same man gets up and walks out. This leads Joseph to think he is a failure as Hamlet until later in the film he learns that the young man Lt. Stanislav Sobinski Robert Stack is leaving each time for a rendezvous with Joseph's wife Maria. At this point Hitler invades Poland and the theater is closed as the Nazi's come to town. A Nazi professor Prof. Alexander Siletsky Stanley Ridges flies in with a list of names of traitors Polish patriots who are to be taken care of by the local Gestapo headed by Col. Ehrhardt Ruman. It is up to the Shakespearean troupe to keep these names out of the hands of the Gestapo and then to escape with their lives. So they use their acting talents to impersonate Gestapo officers and even Hitler himself. Joseph becomes Ehrhardt but botches it when the professor brings up the relationship between Maria and Lt. Sobinski who is now in Warsaw also. The rest of the film involves several funny mixups and mistaken identities filled with satirical buffoonery. Though this was somewhat controversial when first released because some including Jack Benny's own father misunderstood the satire the film is possibly even more funny and relevant today than during World War II when the Nazi menace was for real. Because Lubitsch made the spoof universal in nature To Be Or Not To Be transcends time and space.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the very few people who would think to remake an Ernst Lubitsch picture would be Mel Brooks who satirized just about every genre there was in Hollywood. But I doubt that Jack Benny Carole Lombard and Robert Stack would have lent themselves to the slapstick type film that Brooks turned To Be Or Not To Be into and Mel's version is very funny.When the film opens the biggest problem that Jack Benny has on his mind is who's this secret admirer who keeps sending flowers to his wife Carole Lombard every night while they're on stage. Although it's helped his Hamlet performance the angst Benny is feeling about Lombard being faithful pretty soon Benny Lombard Polish airman Robert Stack and the whole touring company that Benny heads are all caught up in the Nazi German invasion of Poland which inaugurates World War II.Stack joins the Polish squadron of the RAF and there's a nice little Polish colony as with other occupied nations during World War II. One of them is Stanley Ridges who does propaganda broadcasts for the BBC. And he gets to be good pals with the airmen. But after he leaves for Germany on a 'secret' mission it's discovered in reality he's a German agent and is going back to Germany with a list of exiled Poles so that the Nazis could retaliate against families. Stack goes back to Poland after Ridges.Where he meets up with Lombard and Benny and the rest their troupe and let's just say that their talents as actors are never more needed than in the series of performances they give the occupying Germans.Whether dealing with marital problems or Nazis breathing down their necks Lombard Benny and Stack have no shortage of wits about them. Carole and Jack are old hands at comedy but Bob Stack showed a nice gift for it as well. Of course Ernst Lubitsch's type of comedy is a great deal more sophisticated than Mel Brooks. He also was making his film at a time when the USA wasn't in the war yet and the outcome for Poland and the rest of the world remained in doubt. Not to mention what was left of a liberal spirit in Germany where Lubitsch was an exile from.This was Carole Lombard's farewell performance. Completed in 1941 To Be Or Not To Be was released just in time for Pearl Harbor and it certainly beats a lot of hastily made propaganda films that came out to tap into the national anger. It also got the same kind of knocks The Great Dictator did in satirizing the authoritarianism of the Nazis. But both films have stood the test of time. And it's not as preachy as The Great Dictator but Lubitsch gets his point across. As for Lombard she went on a war bond tour which ended abruptly in a plane crash outside Las Vegas. FDR from the White House proclaimed she was as much a war casualty as any GI at the front and there were few who would disagree.If your taste runs to an earthier form of comedy Mel Brooks will certainly satisfy you. But for those who value sophistication as embodied in that phrase the Lubitsch touch this To Be Or Not To Be still pulls in the laughs.".

And it's not as preachy as The Great Dictator but Lubitsch gets his point across. As for Lombard she went on a war bond tour which ended abruptly in a plane crash outside Las Vegas. FDR from the White House proclaimed she was as much a war casualty as any GI at the front and there were few who would disagree.If your taste runs to an earthier form of comedy Mel Brooks will certainly satisfy you. But for those who value sophistication as embodied in that phrase the Lubitsch touch this To Be Or Not To Be still pulls in the laughs.";

How difficult would it be to laugh at a film under those circumstances? Then consider the tremendous stresses of a country just entering a global conflict on multiple frontsrelatives going off to war families trying to find a new balance the challenges of a nationwide effort to reindustrialize the profound shift in economics on a national scale the fear of military enemies whose motives and methods seemed somewhat unfathomable.Looking back now it is easier to enjoy this film even though we have a much greater understanding of the horrible realities of Hitler's plans. Though our viewpoint is clouded with wistfulness this film deserves to be celebrated especially for the performances of Benny and Lombard which are seminal in the careers of both artists.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ernst Lubitch's To Be Or Not To Be1943 has to be the most genuinely bizarre political satire to emerge from Hollywood's golden age. It stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Joseph and Maria Tura  a married couple and stage performers living in occupied Poland during WWII. Determined to alter the course of the war the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis When a spy emerges who has damaging information to the Polish resistance Joseph and Maria decide to prevent the information from being delivered to the Reich. Benny's brilliant lampoon of Hamlet's soliloquy to be or not to be is at the crux of a disastrous rendezvous between Maria and Lt. Stanislav Sobinski Robert Stack. Stan gets the hots for Maria  a passion not reciprocated. Hence when Stan is dispatched for war he cruelly implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky Stanley Ridges the real spy who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The theater troupe is then forced to use their thespian skills to ensure their own survival impersonating Nazi officers and even Hitler in order to outwit the enemy. Controversial to say the very least To Be Or Not to Be opened to modest acclaim and was later remade to limited effect as a 1983 farce starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.Warner's DVD treatment is middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized but darker scenes suffer from inconsistent quality. Film grain is moderate. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An archival news reel and short subject are the only extras included.".

The movie is a comedy and yet is every bit as effective in inspiring the war effort. Now it's not surprising that the film is so wellmade as its director is Ernst Lubitsch and he is ably supported by lots of wonderful character actors such as Felix Bressart and Sig Rumand among others. However the nice surprise about the movie was the acting of Jack Benny in the starring role along with the wonderful Carole Lombard.

	schema:headline " Luminous Lombard and a NeverBetter Benny Light Up Lubitsch's Classic Nazi Satire";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a certain sense of melancholy I feel when I watch this 1942 classic Ernst Lubitsch movie as it represents the last appearance of the luminous Carole Lombard surely the most breathtaking and highspirited of actresses during Hollywood's golden era. In a rush to get home to husband Clark Gable after a successful war bond tour she died in a plane crash during the film's postproduction and as the result proves without a doubt the world lost one of the great treasures of the silver screen. She and costar Jack Benny play Maria and Joseph Tura the egocentric stars of a Polish acting troupe who are caught in the 1939 Nazi invasion of Warsaw. As a worldclass flirt she is carrying on with a handsome young pilot named Stanislav Sobinski and their trysts begin once he hears his cue to get up from his theater seat Hamlet's famous opening line to his soliloquy as spoken by an increasingly perturbed Joseph.The romantic triangle quickly takes a backseat to an espionage thriller involving a German spy named Professor Siletsky who holds the names of members of the Polish underground. His intention is to kill them but the acting troupe now with their theater in ruins band together to stop him. This includes the need for the extremely vainglorious Joseph to impersonate Siletsky in front of the befuddled Colonel Ehrhardt and for Maria to seduce any Nazi official who stands in their way. While it sounds like a piece of wartime propaganda the film actually becomes more farcical even as people are getting killed.As Joseph Benny has never been better conveying both selfabsorption and cunning expertly and the script by Edwin Justus Mayer and an uncredited Lubitsch gives him a number of great oneliners. With her honeytoned voice and smoky elegance Lombard is at the top of her game as the seductive Maria as she dexterously shows her comic and dramatic sides with precision and unparalleled style. Delivering her lines with subtle finesse she provides a strong match for Benny. Sixtyfour years later and there is still no one who can touch her. The rest of the ensemble is memorable starting with Sig Ruman's hilarious turn as Ehrhardt. A freshfaced Robert Stack all of 22 plays Sobinski with a callow zestful energy while Felix Bressart excels as the ultimately heroic Greenberg.The movie makes direct commentaries on the concentration camps and the satirical aspects are blissfully unapologetic. The stylishness of the comedy in light of the virulent wartime setting is what makes the film memorable and it proves what a master Lubitsch was at this level of subtlety. The 2005 DVD comes with two extras both featuring Benny  an ancient twentyminute comedy short from 1930 called The Rounder and a brief commercial for war bonds. I wish they could have included some tribute to Lombard as it would have been fitting on this disc.".

I've never been a big fan of STRANGELOVE because I can't reconcile making light of global nuclear destruction at a time when it was considered very likely.  Oddly enough I didn't have the same problem with TO BE OR NOT TO BE.  I can only conclude that 1 I prefer Jack Benny's version of humor to Stanley Kubricks's and 2 I can appreciate irreverence at the expense of the Nazis as opposed to mocking the western governments primarily the Americans and their depicted haphazard response to a nuclear threat.I may be off the mark on this but they were my initial thoughts and I think it makes an interesting comparison if nothing else.".

One minute we are witnessing an air raid on Warsaw and the next we have Carol Lombard imagining what a triumph it would be to play the role of a concentration camp victim wearing an elegant dress.

Mocking the insanely serious using comedy can work but it has to be done with some idea of a payoff other than a few laughs. What is the point of making a highranking Nazi appear a fool? Is such misrepresentation meant to give comfort in having those viewers in 1942 think that the Nazis would be pushovers? Is being made to believe that Nazis are easily persuaded by simple ruses a worthy goal? I don't see it.I ask myself why this film and Benigni's Life is Beautiful seriously bothered me whereas I found Chaplin's The Great Dictator and Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove hilarious and trenchant. I think it is because the latter two are marked as satire from beginning to end whereas the former two are stories set in a real time and place.

Then we are inexplicably transported to a Pacific Island where another group of animals is teaching the native youngsters how to play Japanese games good sense of Imperialism here but soon an airplane arrives caryring Momotaro a traditional Japanese folk hero with his traditional allies our friends from the Navy academy. Most of them join naval infantry but the rabbit becomes a pilot.The movie gets blatent when a British memo is intercepted and the little band of probably cute animals and fairy tale characters drive the Brits out of the island. In the final sequence we see the divine warrior back in Japan celebrating their victory then playing parachute over a map of the US.It's 64 min. which is pretty typical for a first animation feature and would be of great historical interest not only to disgruntle Pokemon fans but also a superb example of selfdelusion  propaganda.

	schema:headline " Propaganda piece aimed at children";
	schema:reviewBody "Japan's first fulllength animated movie is a World War II propaganda film aimed at children and centred around a young boy Momotaro Peach Boy and his animal friends who represent military sailors. The film's aim is to instill love and loyalty for Japan and belief in its military invincibility and inevitable victory over British and American forces. The importance of the group over the individual is stressed and collective action based on absolute obedience and loyalty is preferred over individual action which the film suggests can cause a person to go astray.What plot exists is very loose and falls into three parts that are related only through shared characters. The filmmakers' grasp on history geography and sociology is precarious. In the first part Momotaro and his sailor friends are on leave and visiting their families. A young child gets lost chasing a runaway sailor cap and its life is in danger. The sailors and others in their community hear a rescue call and rise as one to save the child. In the second part Japanese naval forces take over a tropical island where they are welcomed by the natives who are represented by exotic species of animals the sailors build an airbase and take time to teach the locals their language and culture. In the third part of the film the Japanese invade islands in Southeast Asia from the air and force the British overlords there to relinquish control. After parachuting to the ground and ambushing a tank together Momotaro takes charge of negotiating with the Brits while his friends take notes.The animation is very uneven the main characters of Momotaro and his friends bear monkey cat pheasant are drawn well with bodies and limbs in correct chubby proportions. Their faces are usually serene and confident with shining eyes though creepy lipsticked lips don't always synchronise well with speech. Momotaro resembles a plumpcheeked kindergartenage boy straight out of old Chinese Communist propaganda posters. The animals that represent the Pacific Islanders are all very cute and include creatures not usually native to the Pacific islands elephants rhinos crocodiles squirrels bunnies small wildcats and kangaroos all coexist happily. Perhaps lacking highorder predators like lions and tigers among them gives the folks that open and hospitable attitude towards the invaders. The animals' portrayal varies from cute and sweet for small critters to rubbery and comic for the crocs and elephants which could have come straight out of old 1930s cartoons. Just as rubbery dated and definitely caricatured are a trio of three adult monkeys who look and act suspiciously like 1930s blackface minstrels and the British who are shown as lacking in discipline cowardly and spineless. Against backgrounds that look solid and almost threedimensional and the fairly detailed depictions of machinery the variable standard of animation means the film doesn't have a distinctive visual style.Whatever comedy exists in the film seems forced and the songs have been written and played to urge singing along by children. No point in preaching to audiences unless they can be pushed to participate in the message! The film plays hard and fast with the history and geography of Southeast Asia and its colonisation by Europeans. Most likely the islands freed by Japan in the third part of the film aren't a specific reference to Singapore but representative for eastern Asia and the western Pacific region. Parts of the plot are cut off unexpectedly and the film never returns to them. At the end of the film various small animals practise parachutejumping onto a map of North America the implied message is that Japanese domination of the entire Pacific region and beyond is the next step. Given that when the film was released Japan had already been retreating from USled forces for two years and the country was in dire economic as well as military straits the message is desperate and shrill.Viewers may note the tone of the whole film can be strident the pace is steady and fast the story trajectory is onwards and upwards and the animals obey orders and act promptly and efficiently without hesitation. The portrayal of some animals as rabbits has an unintended and slightly amusing suggestion of cloned conformity especially in scenes where they prepare the airfield for military planes to land and to take off with almost preprogrammed foreknowledge. A message of unquestioned obedience with one's heart mind and soul being at the service of the nation its government and emperor is strong. Characters might pause only to look at photographs of loved ones and realise how much they miss their families but that's the only kind of reflection and character development allowed here.Not a film I'd recommend for children until they're of an age to understand how seductive and inviting propaganda can be and the different forms it can take to persuade people to adopt particular beliefs and actions.".

	schema:reviewBody "For years I've wanted to see a bloodthirsty Gung Ho! Japanese equivalent of those eyewatering war movies that came out of Hollywood during the war in the Pacific and have always been sceptical of the claim that such films simply weren't made. Japan's overwhelming military defeat in 1945 and the destruction of most of their film output up until that time makes this claim difficult to test but my scepticism is now further tested by the last ten minutes of this bizarre film which narrowly survived Japan's postwar cinematic autodef.For nine tenths of its running time this could pass for a rather dodgy childrens' film in which various fluffy animals in flying suits somewhat resembling the Gremlin in 'Nightmare at 20000 Feet' sing frolic about and express their enthusiasm for serving their country as airmen at the shrill urging of the one character in the film who looks vaguely human the babyfaced staringeyed Momotaro. But when Momotaro eventually parachutes into 'Devil's Island' with his airbourne comrades to blow up and bayonet swarms of cringing caricature Yanks  Tommies after which he sternly issues his terms for 'Unconditional Surrender' to their flummoxed commanding officers one is forcefully reminded of the total lack of magananimity Japan had shown the people of the territories they had occupied throughout the thirties and remain relieved that this concluding sequence never managed to be more than a pipe dream.".

	onyx:emotionText "For years I've wanted to see a bloodthirsty Gung Ho! Japanese equivalent of those eyewatering war movies that came out of Hollywood during the war in the Pacific and have always been sceptical of the claim that such films simply weren't made. Japan's overwhelming military defeat in 1945 and the destruction of most of their film output up until that time makes this claim difficult to test but my scepticism is now further tested by the last ten minutes of this bizarre film which narrowly survived Japan's postwar cinematic autodef.For nine tenths of its running time this could pass for a rather dodgy childrens' film in which various fluffy animals in flying suits somewhat resembling the Gremlin in 'Nightmare at 20000 Feet' sing frolic about and express their enthusiasm for serving their country as airmen at the shrill urging of the one character in the film who looks vaguely human the babyfaced staringeyed Momotaro. But when Momotaro eventually parachutes into 'Devil's Island' with his airbourne comrades to blow up and bayonet swarms of cringing caricature Yanks  Tommies after which he sternly issues his terms for 'Unconditional Surrender' to their flummoxed commanding officers one is forcefully reminded of the total lack of magananimity Japan had shown the people of the territories they had occupied throughout the thirties and remain relieved that this concluding sequence never managed to be more than a pipe dream.";

The animation indicates that while the Japanese tried hard they were still in the stone age as far as mastering animation. Look at the pans of the L3Y's taking off look at the character turnarounds!

I don't think much more needs to be said on that. The animation is a good technical achievement. However there is a lot more to a film then how good technically it is. The animal protagonist and friends are cute until you realize the underlying brainwashing attempt aimed at the Japanese children. Then the characters lose a lot of their cuteness and seem more diabolical.The film glorifies the war against the noodle armed stuttering westerners. Who by 1945 were far from running around in circles yelping and surrendering. But I digress.I found the ending where the animals are practicing their parachute jumping on the map of the U.S.A. sadly optimistic. Just shows how out of reality the Japanese military was considering the disastrous state of the war. But that is par for the course in propaganda. It reminds me of Dr. Goebbles radio broadcasts encouraging the German people to rise up and throw back the Russian subhumans from hallowed German lands.I wonder how many children saw this film died shortly after in the atomic bombings? I think that is what you should remember if you watch this film. War is sometimes necessary but it can be awfully cruel. Putting a happy furry cute face on it doesn't change that.Not a recommended film for somebody to watch for enjoyment. If you have any knowledge of the suffering WWII brought to the world I think it is impossible.".

Ilsa informs them Do not be afraid we are doctors. While this statement is true the reality is that she wishes to use them in medical experiments to prove that women are as able to withstand pain as men in fact better. This is in fact proved by flogging one of each to death at the same time with the two henchwomen laying on with whips while stripped to the waist. After much more along the same lines Ilsa's nemesis arrives  a blond blueeyed American who has been swept up in the death camps.

	schema:reviewBody "I first rented this sick flick in the 80's and the guy at the video store who recommended it knowing I was into shockexploitation movies told me he'd give me my money back if I wasn't completely offended. Guess who didn't get their money back? . I finally found a copy of the uncut version I first sawhard to find unless you have a DVD player and yep it still shocked me just as much. It may have shocked me even more because I kept thinking No WAY could they put a movie like this out today! I've actually seen all of the Ilsa series and each time I watch one I think this is probably the sickest. Then I realize they are all really sick just in different nasty ways.  The first time I watched this even though I wasn't watching it with anyone else I felt guilty for not turning it off and returning it to the video store it was so sick.  People have said the violence and acting are unrealistic but there were parts where I had to remind myself this was a movie though it was supposedly based on real Nazi experiments...let's not dwell on that and the women screaming in agony at the top of their lungs were just actresses. There's a few unrealistic scenes for instance a woman being boiled to the point where her skin seems to have come off looks almost fine a scene later. Most of it looks a little too real for meenough so I was feeling sick to my stomach by the big dinner scene and I didn't even watch it all at once.First of all anyone who didn't think this movie was violent or gory you definitely have seen a cut version. Anyone who thought it was boring or tame obviously didn't see the version I saw with the woman being boiled alive onscreen or the patients with huge open gaping wounds that had been deliberately infected. As another reviewer said if you see the right version or the wrong one depending on your point of view there are not 5 minutes that go by without some sort of sex nudity violence or all 3 at the same time. If I ever heard anyone describe this movie as 'sexy' I would get away from them as quickly as possible. In this debut of the Ilsa Ilsa herself pronounces it as Illza series Dyanne Thorne plays the title role an extremely sadistic commander of a concentration camp where they perform 'medical research'.  The men usually only get castrated after sleeping with Ilsa and not 'satisfying' her or beaten. The women have the bad luck to be in a camp where Ilsa is trying to prove her theory that women are naturally stronger and can take more pain than men. Some are taken away to the 'brothel' area which is no picnic either one of the scenes that actually made me lose my appetite showed a prisoner after the men are through with her not a pretty sight but the really unlucky ones are taken to the 'medical' area. One woman makes the huge mistake of not only telling Ilsa she can take whatever she dishes out Rule 1 in an Ilsa movienever taunt her with her tough you are but giving her attitude and talking back Rule 2 do NOT give Ilsa attitude or talk back you will probably receive the most disgusting fate of any character in the entire movie and Ilsa decides to make an example of her resulting in some of the nastiest hardest to watch scenes in the movie.  I can't describe them in detail or this review probably wouldn't be posted. Ilsa picks one American man Wolf to sleep with her a so called 'genetic freak' who can satisfy Ilsa so he gets to keep all his uh equipment for the time being. Of course he has an escape plan...he also provides most of the unintentional comic relief in the movie as his acting is so amazingly bad even for an exploitation movie that he sounds like he is reading from cue cards a few words at a time Iwillmake...lovetoyoulike...youhaveneverbeen....madelovetobefore.As a sidebar I'd sure like to read Dyanne Thorne's autobiography if she ever puts one out. Several times during the movie I wondered if the actress ever told anyone how she was making a living in detail at the time. Well today I get paid to go dress up in complete Nazi regalia and pretend to pee on another higher ranking Nazi. Then after lunch.... She hams it up as Ilsa and was let's face it pretty brave to do this movie.A warning to others who might consider renting this because they hear it's campy and fun don't rent it for that reason unless you have a really sick sense of humor or a real ed up idea of fun. Some coworkers of mine unwisely didn't listen to any warnings from people who have watched the entire movie and went to see a midnight screening thinking they were going to see some kind of badinanEdWoodway Bmovie.  They made it through maybe 15 minutes tops before walking out in total revulsion. It's not the kind of movie you want to watch over and over because it's so fun. I watch it every once in a while to see if I'm still as easily shocked as I was a few years ago. So far I am.  Why do I own it if it's so horrible? I guess I have no excuse for that other than to show it to people who think they've seen it all. If you think you've seen it all you haven't until you see the first 3 Ilsa movies.".

If you were to put it up against any of the so called classic movies it would not stand up. But those who search out Ilsa She Wolf of THe SS or any of the others in the series aren't doing so because they want to see a tense well acted well directed movie. Ilsa is first and foremost an exploitation film and realizing that I have to say it is in the upper echelons of its field because it wallows in filth and does so unapologetically. It boils down to this. If you search out a Euro Trash film be it an Italian Giallo or English 70's horror you desire it to be as sleazy and un politically correct as possible but also you want the movie to have some semblance of a plot be it ever tiny. Ilsa scores big on all these points. There is wall to wall nudity all female. Gratitutious torture scenes that are more ridiculous than offensive I mean every time Ilsa drags a prisoner down for torture they are completely naked as they are being tortured. And all most everyone of the female cast members at some point is completely naked. Let's be honest It ain't Shakespeare nor does it pretend to be. Of note is the lead actress Dyanne Thorne. Apparently Ms. Thorne had lofty ambitions of being a serious actress at one point in her career but the fickle finger of fate lead her to Ilsa fame. In her mid 40's Ms. Thorne is competent enough not to look like an amateur on screen. She has a several nude scenes throughout the movie and anyone who watches Ilsa will no doubt remember her more for her large breasts than her acting ability. Ilsa She Wolf of the SS is a noteworthy entry into the world of exploitation films and should be the starting point for anyone who journeys into this genre. I rate it as a 10 because it knows what it is and does not pretend to try for anything higher".

These films are a classic example of true exploitation cinema and should be checked out by any fan of extreme or exploitation films. Short version Ilsa is the head bitch at a Nazi experimentation camp. She gets her kicks by torturing the male and female prisoners in all kinds of interesting ways. Overall SHE WOLF is pretty tame in the gore department compared to what is out there today. I'm sure if you saw this when it first came out in '75 it was probably some really racy stuff...but being from a generation raised on bloodandguts the Ilsa films are more laughable than shocking. I prefer SHE WOLF and the underrated TIGRESS OF SIBERIA installments over HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS and WICKED WARDEN those two having more of a sleazy sex overtone and being very light on the red stuff... but all are worth a look just to say that you've seen them. Anchor Bay has put out a beautiful boxset that contains SHE WOLF HAREM KEEPER and WICKED WARDEN and if you check the right online dealers you can find it for dirtcheap. Makes a great collection piece. To my knowledge TIGRESS OF SIBERIA is not available on DVD at this time at least not in the States... which is a shame because although many other reviewers trash it I really liked that film. Anyway if you are an exploit fan these films should already be in your collection. If you are interested in checking out this type of material these films are as good a start as any. Not for the average moviegoer but not as overthetop as they could be nowdays. recommended  810 for Dyanne Thorne's bigass Nazi titties!!!".

It was a perfect emblem of the pure sleaziness and overall decadent atmosphere of the 70's smut prevalent at this time. Like all grindhouse films it appeals to the baser senses  filled with excess violence grizzly and welldone and sex. And it's shot amazingly well for such a poor film. I expected it to be grainy and imperceptible.There's an element of immorality felt when watching films like this but it's a healthy outlet to sublimate impure thoughts. It's sensationalist yes. Probably no artistic merit either. But it's an appetizer of the 70's Perversia. I do think it's mostly meant to be titillating and gross for the sake of being gross.

Meanwhile she uses the males to try and satisfy her sexual needs and when they fail she has them castrated!. It is up to GermanAmerican stud Wolfe to lead the prisoners in a revolt against the guards whilst simultaneously gaining Ilsa's trust by rogering her senseless at every opportunity.This notorious sleaze classic packs so much depravity into its 96 minutes running time uncut that lovers of exploitation will have a field day. From the opening scene in which Ilsa's sex slave is dragged back to the camp to be emasculated to the ending in which the prisoners exact bloody retribution sex and violence pervades every frame. The effective makeup FX by Joe Blasco are repugnant enough for hardened gorehounds and fans of the female form will be delighted by the copious amounts of nudity nearly every woman gets naked at some point in the film!. And lets not forget the scene in which Ilsa pees on the Nazi general...Thirty years after it was made Ilsa still has the ability to shockthe mark of a true exploitation classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS 1975 is doubtlessly one of the most notorious Exploitation movies of alltime and for good reasons. There is no doubt that the film is sick and sadistic and it is understandable that many find it to be despicable. Yet it is also undeniable that this is classic Exploitation stuff and that every hardcore lover of cultcinema such as yours truly kinda has to see it. Along with Tinto Bras' SALON KITTY 1976 director Don Edmonds' film which was produced by the prolific David F. Friedman who also produced Hershell Gordon Lewis' early gore films spawned the Nazisploitation or NaziExploitation subgenre which practically is a subsubgenre of the WIP or Women In Prison movie. These films mostly from the otherwise best Exploitation country Italy usually managed to be extremely sleazy and brutal yet very boring at the same time. ILSA is the undisputed classic of the Nazisploitation genre and certainly the most memorable film of its kind. Whether that is a recommendation lies in the eye of the beholder. While ILSA and all the other Nazisploitation films are strongly against the Nazis who are entirely portrayed as evil it also trivializes this very sensitive topic which is of course even more questionable since way more Holocaustsurvivors were still alive in the 70s. Then again the producer's name is Friedman and I recently saw a documentary about the popularity of Naziporno novels in 70s Israel so who am I to judge...The eponymous sadistic female Nazivillain Ilsa played by the hugebreasted blonde Dyanne Thorne is the commander of a Nazi experiment camp. In order to prove that females are better soldiers than men she conducts gruesome experiments on the female prisoners. She also has sex with the male prisoners whom she castrates after being disappointed in the can. This changes when the superpotent American prisoner Wolfe is brought to the camp and satisfies her nonstop...Apart from the idea of Naziexploitation as such being questionable ILSA also has a somewhat antifeminist message Even the maneating villainous bitch gets tamed when she is properly getting... err... satisfied. The film is incredibly perverted and gruesome and while the violence is often exaggerated to a ridiculous point and hard to be taken seriously it is yet very disturbing. The female cast members most of which are naked for the majority of their screen time are beautiful but the setting and sadistic violence makes that impossible to enjoy. Without getting into detail I can say that there are plenty of notoriously gruesome sequences some of them hard to look at even for experienced exploitation fans others more ridiculous than truly disturbing.Interestingly this is a GermanAmerican coproduction even though the film was banned in Germany probably both for the violence and the controversial Nazitopic. Apart from the countless ripoffs the movie also spawned two sequels ILSA HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS 1976 and ILSA THE TIGRESS OF SIBERIA 1977 as well as the unofficial sortofsequel GRETA HAUS OHNE MNNER aka. ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN 1977 by the Spanish Exploitation deity Jess Franco.In a nutshell ILSA is highly questionable and I can understand everybody who finds it despicable to make such a trashy movie about such a sensitive topic. However it is a mustsee for my fellow Exploitation fans even though nowhere near as essential as other supernotorious classics such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or MARK OF THE DEVIL in my opinion. Definitely not for the easily offended.".

In this outing she's the Kommandant of Medical Camp Nine a coed concentration camp where she sets out to prove that women can stand pain even better than men. This provides an excuse for torture with electric didoes medicallyinduced syphilis worms in open wounds scalding whipping gangrape etc. More frightening than the savagely itself is the fact that somebody actually took some pains with this picture. The acting is competent especially Thorne's and the production values are good for the budgeteven if the deserted Hogan's Heroes set did serve as the concentration camp. Joe Belasco executed the gory makeups. Uschi Digard is the naked victim in the compression chamber. Wolfgang Roehm known in other pictures as William Roehm and Richard Kennedy appears as a general who even disgusts Ilsa. Some video releases of this charmer toned down the more graphic torture scenessuch as one captive's toes being removed with tin snips in tight loving closeup. Now SHE WOLF is available on DVD in its uncensored glory. Producer Herman Traeger by the way is really the infamous David F. Friedman.

	schema:reviewBody "This is another in the growing list of movies that are deemed shocking disturbing and controversial that I find are a lot more tame than they are said to be.For me it started with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. After reading how people had reacted to it back in 1974 I had to see it. Well it was pretty horrible in my opinion. Not shocking or gory just silly and maybe a little creepy.The Ilsa series fits into this category. I had read that the series was shocking and had to check out what all the fuss was.I watched the Ilsa trilogy last night and while I can see some of the hype about these films was true yet again I found myself looking for more.Ilsa She Wolf of the SS features Dyanne Thorne as Ilsa the warden st Medical Camp  9. The camp is used to conduct medical research that is to aid the SS during WW2. Women prisoners are injected with viruses tortured with electroshock and whipped to test their tolerance for pain. Ilsa also conducts private research more or less for pleasure purposes.Some of the violence is a little graphic. We see a fair bit of blood and in one instance they are performing surgery on a prisoner's vagina. Maggots are injected with a virus and allowed to eat away at a prisoner's flesh. One of the female prisoners is left a bloody mess after 3 days of torture. In others it is left to your imagination such as the castration of a male prisoner and the use of an electrified dildo on the female inmates. During a dinner scene another female prisoner is hanging from a noose and bound at the hands and feet with only a block of ice supporting her.As for nudity there is also plenty of that. The prisoners are routinely shown without clothes and the lovely Miss Thorne also has a fair share of topless shots.Having said all that I still felt that it was not quite as shocking as I had anticipated. Not that it is ever pleasant to see people being tortured and raped. With the reputation this film had I guess I expected it to be much worse.It's a sad statement on today's society when one reacts so calmly to such a movie. To me I think some of the shock value may have come from the setting and the storyline. A Nazi prison camp set during WW2. That certainly does bring up all sorts of disturbing and horrifying images.All in all while a little less shocking than I was planning for this was a pretty good film. Anchor Bay did a wonderful job restoring the movie and put together a nice package along with Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks and The Wicked Warden.Also check out the audio commentary with Thorne director Don Edmunds and producer David Freidman. Despite the flack that this movie has received none of the principal people involved seem to have any regrets. Despite this Freidman along with a lot of the other actors used pseudonyms. Freidman claimed it was as a result of a dispute with the Canadian financiers. Thorne is on record as saying the she has indeed suffered a little careerwise after using her real name on the Ilsa films.Rating 8 out of 10".

This movie has it all to offend most some of the torture scenes are the most graphic you are ever likely to see. Forget about tame exploitation movies such as The House of the 100 Corpses or the Evil Dead this is the number 1 exploitation movie. Although it was made on a very small budget in fact it was shot on the sets of Hogans Heroes it looks classy in places the blood and guts free flowly. This movie was the peak point of the short lived Naziexplotation era of the 1970's. Ilsa She Wolf spawned 2 sequels but neither of which could beat this movie for entertainment.".

She was strong willed and didn't let anyone stand in her way. She also showed that she had a desire to be loved even though it wasn't too obvious. She reminds me of a female Christopher Lee another actor that I enjoy. I thought that it was cool that George Buck Flower was in it as well. I remembered him as the beggar from Wishmaster.

For all the gore nudity and laughter inducing dialogue the film features good camera work quality special effects and a quick moving plot. It follows the travails of an American soldier sent to a Nazi medical camp run by Ilsa who is obsessed with proving women's superior capacity to handle pain so that she can go to the front lines.Ilsa represents Nazispoitation at its finest. Throwing the history book out the window the film gives us a Nazi concentration camp populated by topless female guards and open lesbians. Just for fun it adds gory experiments which all seem to require attractive nude women. Is it tasteless? Lords yes! But it's also fun.What takes this a notch above other exploitation films is that genuine talent was involved. Ilsa has quality cinematography and surprisingly good special effects. This may be because as director Don Edmonds points out many of the people involved were mainstream filmmakers working under pseudonyms for a quick buck. Although no one would mistake it for Oscar material Ilsa is a worthwhile film for all exploitation fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ilsa SheWolf of the SS is an true exploitation classic.SPOILERSRunning the dreaded Camp 9 SS Officer Ilsa Dyanne Thorne and partner Dr. Binz George 'Buck' Flower operate under the pretenses of using women prisoners for their own experiments. When American prisoner Wolfe Gregory Knoph arrives at the camp she takes an instant appeal to him as he manages to please her the way the other prisoners have. Taking an interest in prisoners Anna Maria Marx and Kata Nicolle Riddell to determine whether or not women have a higher threshold for pain than men she begins to torture them constantly while using him for her own sexual gratification. Finally getting fed up with the living conditions they decide to make a break for escape with the prisoners still being held at the camp in a way to get away from the sadistic owner.The News This is one of the greatest entries in the exploitation genre. This is mostly due to the film's incredibly ability to really use it's exploitation leanings to provide some genuine and excessive sequences. These are mostly from the gruesome torture scenes including toes being mangled with pliers an exceptionally bloody double flogging with the fully naked blood streaked bodies later hung up a bloodspewing pressure chamber experiment skin peeling from immersion in boiling water and a maggot infested wound. We also have a very effective blood pumping cut throat and some of the makeup on the disease ridden women especially the one whose face has been infected with syphilis and which gets more and more rotten as the film goes on and is suitably revolting. Many of the torture scenes are incredibly brutal and manage to get a little unnerving after a while. There's also the grotesque and sickening sight of a barely living torture ravaged cruelly mutilated naked woman lying on a trolley lying completely out in the open showing off every single wound from the experiments producing a creepy feel. Away from the gore the film also delivers a few choice moments of exploitative cruelty including an electrified dildo run through the crotch to generate an electronic stimulation and the sequence where a naked woman with a noose around her neck is supported on a block of ice on a dinner table which slowly melts away as the Nazi's dine around her. Female nudity is really rampant not just in the nude inspections of the prisoners and the sex scenes but also during almost all of the experiment and torture sequences. Sparing the victims nothing their fully nude bodies are continuously on display and generally as much pubic hair especially bloodsoaked pubic hair as time allows for is splashed across the screen. Thorne gives her all in her sex scenes with much moaning and bucking but there's also a couple of nonThorne sequences including a brief everessential lesbian tryst where more breasts are on display. That the film in fact opens to a naked Ilsa riding a male prisoner then showering down and finally partaking in a spot of bloody castration on her hasty sex slave only goes to reinforce the fact that there's very little that won't be allowed in here and the film is all the better for it. The general setting of the film with the very effective sets and furnishings as the torture chambers are nicely dank and dungeonlike with strategic portraits of Himmler and Hitler on the walls the Nazi's dining room is splashedout in very decadent opulence and the whole thing feels very overthetop and grand considering the location to the very fact that it takes place in a concentration camp where hideous experiments including deliberate infection by all known diseases are carried out on the prisoners scream exploitationmade material here. Perhaps the best element here is that the lead Dyanne Thorne here looks absolutely perfect for the kind of film. Statuesque sexy and ohsoperfectly form she dominates the movie and literally makes it a far more satisfying experience than it would otherwise have been and is able to ridicule the men and make the women cower. Willing to disrobe whenever the film needs it she makes her a sexually strong and yet also sexually complex character. Ilsa screws the prisoners in the hope of gratification but punishes them for screwing her as they are inferior to her. Once they have lain with her they must be silenced and punished for doing so. And yet despite the sadism she shows to her victims is also very much a subordinate and a masochist when it comes to her own sexual satisfaction. Thorne does bring an extra level to her character's makeup than is the norm in such films. This one also manages some mostly successful action scenes with a few explosions and even an armored car making an appearance during the fun finale resulting in some really great action scenes. There's just a minor minor flaw to this. The fun finale has a really big flaw to get over. There's some very clumsy slow motion and the odd very strange gunshot sound stand out as poor in the sequence. Mainly since it's done during the gunfight is where it really stands out but it's still a really annoying problem to it. Other than this little flaw there wasn't a whole lot to dislike to this.The Final Verdict Without much to stand in the way of pure trash glory this one here is one of the best and most entertaining examples of the genre. Highly enjoyable for fans of the Naziploitation genre or exploitation films in genre while those who can't handle it should ignore it altogether.Rated URNC17 Continuous Full Male and Female Nudity strong sex scenes Extreme Graphic Violence and Language".

The fact that I feel asleep is not a condemnation oh no! I was simply captivated and put under its simple facrical ridiculous but oh so charming spell. humour! So wonderfully silly! It's acting? Clearly deliberately poor to reflect the nature of the acting of comic films of that generation! Costumes scenery breathtaking!

When I was forced back in my innocence to watch this with my brother I shook my fist in an angry fist and said WhyIOughta... but my complaints were silenced when the majesty of this beautiful motion picture washed over me and rendered me speechless. The fact that I feel asleep is not a condemnation oh no! I was simply captivated and put under its simple facrical ridiculous but oh so charming spell. humour! So wonderfully silly! It's acting? Clearly deliberately poor to reflect the nature of the acting of comic films of that generation! Costumes scenery breathtaking! The Academy failed the film going world by not presenting Rocky And Bullwinkle or as I have dubbed it The Most Wonderful and Beautiful and Spiritually Magnificent film Ever in the history of the world Ever the MWABASMFEITHOTWE for short the accolades it deserved. This will always be a best picture winner in my heart.";

If Rocky  Bullwinkle had been campy dumb but fun I think I would have enjoyed it.Unfortunately the only good thing I can say is that I was hoping to hear a lot of bad puns and I did. But there the similarity ended.Taking Rocky  Bullwinkle out of its cartoon format into a 3D realm didn't work for me. The plot stuttered and didn't make any sense. Even starting from the attitude that this is a cartoon so things will be wacky and nonsensical it still didn't make any sense.Worst of all were the syrupy and melodramatic interactions with Karen Sympathy the FBI agent. The emotions and decisions of the characters didn't make sense.Finally there's something about comedy that involves timing. I don't know what it is. But the buildups and physical pranks didn't work for me. Something was really askew in the presentation.Who should see this film nobody even kids and especially if you've seen the original series it will just make you sadI'm forced to give The Adventures of Rocky  Bullwinkle a 3 out of 10.".

It has a big budget which it spends on fancy cartoonish sets and other bizarre gimmicks for what? To make it look like a cartoon! This results into a lot of things that we could prefer seeing in a Saturday morning cartoon. But as a movie it's pretty hard to see why this was such a favorite cartoon during the early '60's. This is one of the most ineffective and unfunny movies I've seen in a while. And if your not convinced lets move to to the casting. Lets see Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader and Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as his bumbling minions. Okay now your convinced.The film uses the technique of putting animated characters in reallive settings and real actors. This was done many times since films in the 80's like WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and recently SPACE JAM. And like SPACE JAM although not quite as bad ROCKY AND BULWINKLE enjoys too much with the playfulness of its cartoon characters that they forget that they're making a feature film here. So it has not much to tell and can't even afford to make jokes that really work.The film is basically a cartoon on a live action movie which is made just as cartoonish as the animated world. Animated evil mastermind Fearless Leader De Niro and his henchmen have crossed the boundaries of an animated world and arrive in our 4dimensional world and start a TV company called RBTV meaning Really Bad Television how prophetic and turn people to mindless drones with their horrible cable shows. The FBI sends a rookie agent Perabo to protect stillanimated Rocky and Bulwinkle from being zapped allowing the megalomaniac from ruling the world.And as the story goes the laughs and silliness get even worse. The film hardly made me laugh and no headhitting carcrashing and any other mishap to change my mind about that. They should know they're making a motion picture here not a an episode of Bugs and Daffy which at least is better than this. Despite its budget director Des McAnuff instead spends it on silly cartoonish gimmicks that joined in with the corny laughs if you'd call it laughs and embarrassed leads it can all be summed up in a 30 minute animated feature for TV not an 88 minute film.Still I did find one thing that was quite bearable in this walking disaster waiting to happen and that is the entertaining cameos. How many movies can you see wellknown and then wellknown talents like Whoppi Goldberg John Goodman Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell and Billy Crystal just to name a few. Their cameos thankfully lightens up my high criticism for the film but that doesn't stop me from giving it a big thumbs down.Still I won't discourage you from letting the kids see it for it's mainly made for them and they might be the only ones who'll enjoy it.Rating  out of 5.".

The puns in this movie was overused as well along with the bad script and I think that's what destroyed it the most for me. Now don't get me wrong an unserious storyline can still make the watcher believe it by using the right tools. But a script that bad made the storyline completely unbelievable and breaking the fourth wall is something you should not overuse even if you want the comedic effect to become stronger. Why is that? Because breaking the fourth wall is a great way to make the audience get shocked since the actors are breaking a rule there which catches their attention immediately. If you overuse this however the effect gets worn off to the point where it just gets annoying.In some shots there's some filmingerrors as well such as too much headroom unnecessary space where it's not needed since it doesn't provide any information lack of contrast balance between the greenblue screen shots and the objectspeople and etc. Perhaps something you don't think about too much but can be extremely annoying if it constantly occurs. This is also the reason why it looks like a really really bad B movie from the 80's personally. The acting overall was pretty okay even though there were in some places in the movie where it was noticeable that the actors didn't really did their roles seriously which made it harder to believe the story.All in all a bad movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "For much of my life I knew nothing about Rocky and Bullwinkle. In fact I never knew until I read about cartoons with similar styles and some of the actors of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show.Many years after the characters made a name of themselves in a 1960s TV series some people who probably liked the show a lot decided to give Rocky and Bullwinkle an encore through this film. Had the film been commercially successful the franchise would have been revived to a great degree.

At first I had no idea that the film flopped at the box office because I was not following it. This was until I read about it on Wikipedia. It was there I found out. I find it hard to believe how a film featuring a famous TV character could bomb. Films bomb at the box office either because of negative reviews from critics or insufficient marketing.

When it's just the human actors things get a little dull. DeNiro Alexander and Russo all are decent but these performances would be criticized no matter who was playing them with the possible exception of Jim Carrey. The best human performer is Piper Pirabo a total hottie. She has been criticized for a bad performance but I thought she did a great job.It's not Oscar material it won't gross 100 million and it's not deep social commentary but it sure is fun. Anybody with a sense of humor would be hardpressed not to smile and feel good on the inside after seeing this. I just hope they make a sequel. Rocky  Bullwinkle forever!!!!".

Makes me wonder if the new Star Trek film will make me love it or hate it since I'm a fan of the original.This film was very entertaining and fun. I have never seen the 60's cartoon but found this movie at a good deal 5 and picked it up. I popped it in the old DVD player one Sunday afternoon and felt a little guilty and embarrassed. Why? Because this movie was so beyond kiddie. I'm watching a movie with a squirrel and a bull! And loving it.Very over the top performances..but works very well in this format. I happened to watch Robocop 3 last night and yes that was very over the top and became cheese! This film does it and succeeds. Robert Deniro does a wonderful job as he did in Dick Tracy. Sure its no Casino or Heat! but he apparently understands the material and plays the role to fit the film. That's a good actor. No Bmovie here. Shame this film is so trashed! Pure entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show was set up as a lowbudget parody of television and film animation. It was rife with injokes sardonic comments on the media bad puns occasional feints at adult humor. It was not your average kids show. It wore its povertyrow production on its sleeve. It mocked all our expectations and a good many of our cultural shibboleths  contemporary academia and smalltown middleAmerica both felt its sting. Having avoided this film for a decade presuming that Hollywood would bollix it up the way they had with the Warner Bros. cartoon characters and Casper the ghost I at last found a cheap copy and said what the heck. Well I was very much  and very pleasantly  surprised. The film is quite true to the original program. I love it when Whoopi Goldberg is referred to as the honorable Judge Cameo. I love the sun bouncing up and down at sunrise and sunset. I am glad they dealt with Rocky's 'fear of flying' again and getting over it without any sentimentality. The injokes and sarcastic cultural references and media lampoons are all intact  those who complain about the animation and special effects miss the several remarks on the poor animation from the characters themselves  the animation and SFx are supposed to be borderline that's part of the joke! So too the overthetop characterizations and acting. The real illusion of cinema's 'art of illusion' is that generated by an audience expecting the illusions to 'look real'  it is this illusion  the audience's  that the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show and now the movie mock. The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show was kinda like Jazz  you either got it or you didn't. The low rating on this film only indicates that this is true for the movie as well. The original show largely survived because of its low cost and through syndication allowing it to be reedited for marginal time slots e.g. 5 am. It was only years after it ceased production that it's real strengths began endearing it to millions. In like manner I suspect this film is on its own quiet gradual way to becoming a cult classic. Parents will play it for their kids who will wonder WTF?!  then ten years later the lightbulb will click on for those same kids and they will 'get it'  and another generation of Rocky and Bullwinkle fans will come of age.".

All were so good to the characters and took on the roles with real bravado. The costumes were a match. In this film was the only time DeNiro has ever redo his classic 'Taxi Driver' Travis Bickle 'are you talking to me' as RB Fearless Leader. It is a scream. And I happen know that most of them were BIG fans of RB show. Nice to know that several producers on this project were the living original cast and crew from the Jay Ward TV days. Many desert scenes were shot in Palmdale and other on the old MGM lot in Culver City. This show is fun and enjoyable for all ages.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are people out there who will greenlight anything! That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's only scary part to the whole movie. It's so bad you'll go off movies forever. I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself.As if it matters here's the basic jist of the 'story'. A group of twentysomethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Pacific Northwest Canada actually because it's cheap for the 'Rave of the Century' which consists of about 8 people and unraving music that they pay some craggy old fisherman 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry. That's gotta be some rave to be worth all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead hang onI thought this was HOUSE of the Dead? and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda.First faults here. Why would a tiny little rave of the Century my foot! be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it? Why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others?Once they arrive they discover that the rave which consists of about 2 tents a small stage and a portajohn has been smashed there's blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rationally thinking person do? Run for their lives of course. But no these clueless obviously blind people decide to go look for them. Soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside. Another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again. The characters like the movie go nowhere.Jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue heinous acting mumbojumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the oncepopular arcade game of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers I'll never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further if that is at all possible.It has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap throwaway line at the end. It makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell even the Double Dragon movie seems multiOscar worthy in comparison to this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast suck I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die.Plus if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity I see no reason why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not frightening in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film. And where did all those bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over. I kid you not you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times.Who's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie is nonexistent. You can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies aren't really taking it all seriously. The actors seem like they're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card. It all feels very unnatural.Plus the film is shot like a twopart miniseries. I have indeed seen better TV productions. And don't get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into making this at all. It truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and George A. Romero can't even get anyone to take his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'postmodern' but it only irritates that they think THIS is in the same league as a REAL zombie movie.For what it's worth the 1.851 anamorphic picture looks great and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily overused ADR even more. The DVD comes with extras but why torture yourself. Isn't this review warning enough? Stay away! You are all doomed I tell you! Doomed! Doomed!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious of Ed Wood's work one look at that commentator from Plan 9 from outer space and you just KNOW you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece. Just like that when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece House of Dead with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.So the movie starts like this  first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown or Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence. No I'm not kidding.Anyway this bunch of 20somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paperbag are going to the Rave of the century rave in question being a few tents a portapotty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry but thankfully will find a way to get there the way being a fisherboat ran by Kirk Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man whoever wrote this script is a genius and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.To make the long story short the gang gets to the island finds nobody there except some bloody Tshirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait they do not they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around there is some screaming and shooting our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang they go out of the house meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team enter the Matrix the rubbersuit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute gameover cutscene for a few characters when they die.I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed So bad it's good category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad the zombies are awful there is no tension lines are bad actors are bad.. the list just goes on.You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.".

Just like that when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece House of Dead with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City I knew I'm in for a helluva ride.So the movie starts like this  first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die. You know to keep you wandering. Then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like Karma..thinks she's Foxy Brown or Alicia..my ex.. we broke up recently.. I had to study and she had to fence. No I'm not kidding.Anyway this bunch of 20somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paperbag are going to the Rave of the century rave in question being a few tents a portapotty and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry but thankfully will find a way to get there the way being a fisherboat ran by Kirk Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man whoever wrote this script is a genius and his sidekick who is a bastard child of Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer.To make the long story short the gang gets to the island finds nobody there except some bloody Tshirts and then decide to run the hell away from there. No wait they do not they actually get all happy and like cos there's free booze.With that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill. Some guys in rubber suits start running around there is some screaming and shooting our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang they go out of the house meet Cpt Kirk and some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they transform into a S.W.A.T. team enter the Matrix the rubbersuit guys start multiplying like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute gameover cutscene for a few characters when they die.I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in that famed So bad it's good category. It's just plain bad. The script is bad the zombies are awful there is no tension lines are bad actors are bad.. the list just goes on.You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful. Don't. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.";

So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean critics hated Resident Evil and while it may not be a particularly great film I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shootem up with a half decent plot. This however is pure crap. Terrible dialogue halfassed plot and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie I use the term loosely that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk Ugh. While his name throws originality out the window you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.

Also the zombies were terrible no where near as fun as any of Romero's work who gets s plug in the movie.

Also all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open So dumb.FINAL VERDICT If any of these actors appear in another film then they've been blessed with a second chance.

Is that it? Oh so this rave thingy is just a party? In the grand tradition of reeuphemizing used cars as preowned or shell shock as posttraumatic stress disorder the word party is now too square for you drugaddled siliconeimplanted metrosexual jagoffs? It is learned that the party was broken up by rampaging zombies. Intelligent thought stops hereI don't think the pinheads who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the mythos behind zombie reanimation. Zombies can't die  they're already UNDEAD. They do not bleed they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely annihilated they will continue being animated. At least that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me.Which means that a .45 shot into their hearts is not going to stop them nor will a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest will certainly NOT bring forth gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated leaving a fetid mush that cannot reanimate itself.Yet each actorslashmodel gets their Matrixcircularcamera moment slaying zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops to the sternum. Seriously these zombies are more ineffective than the Stormtroopers from Return Of The Jedi who get knocked out when Ewoks trip them.I suppose the film's writer Mark Altman having penned the nottooshabby Free Enterprise felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference in the character of Jurgen Prochnow who must have needed milk money desperately to have succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dungswill. There is also a reference to Prochnow's primo role in the magnificent Das Boot when one of the untrained Bactors mentions that he looks like a UBoat Captain. . I wonder how many of this movie's target audience of squareeyed swine picked up on ANY of the snide references to other films as when Prochnow declares Say hello to my little friend presaging his machine gun moment. Aimed at a demographic who have not the wherewithal to comprehend the Sisyphean futility of the videogame concept i.e. the game ends when you die  you cannot win this is merely a slasher film for the mindless and mindless at heart. Accordingly everyone dies in due course except for a heterosexual pair of Attractive White People.A better use for this film's scant yet misused budget might have been to send the cast through Acting School although Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job as did her right breast  and those slomo running scenes priceless! I especially liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she's been stabbed but looking like she's just eaten ice cream too fast.Attempting to do something more constructive with my time I pulled out my DigitallyRestored 35th Anniversary Special Edition Widescreen Anamorphic DVD of Manos The Hands Of Fate.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so I'm not a big video game buff but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though justifying any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and gooing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead with a lot of college kids LOADED college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little haltertops but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.Clint Howard tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when wellknown actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an wellknown actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there Clint! I expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess.Once we get to the island the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive I guess but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year find NO ONE and say well who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll  There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!So not only do they start drinking not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!Now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful todirectly copying the video game. Sure it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget but worse than that is the Matrixstyle bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.Then you have what I call the technoslasher scene. Since the rave never happened and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 16 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever I guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the grossout effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here as was not the case in Resident Evil it wasn't some manmade virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a noholdsbarred horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel.".

This is by no stretch of the imagination a good movie in any sense but you cant help but laugh yourself silly through most of it. Plot line is this A group of ravers travel to an island near Seattle an island known as Isla del Morte Island of the dead and my Spanish spelling is likely incorrect. Once they arrive they find the biggest rave of the year deserted. Why? they find out once they stumble upon survivors and are shown video footage of what happened. This is really an elementary movie poorly written by Mark Altman who did one of my favorite films Free Enterprise and equally poorly acted by the mainly unknown cast. Along with Jurgen Prochnow Ellie Cornell Halloween 4  5 and Clint Howard Ron's brother are the only names I recognized. I really don't expect much from Clint and he certainly delivered in that area but Ellie and Jurgen usually do a little better than they showed here.Johnathan Cherry is really dull as Rudy Tyron Leitso's Simon is an irritating little weasel Ona Grauer's Alicia is really nice to look at but not much else...so on and so forth.Lots and lots of pop culture references including a mention of George A. Romero and the possibility of a 4th Dead film. See this one if you're a Romero fan...please...its a zombie movie and if the industry thinks thats what we want then we'll get George's final vision that much sooner. This is just not a good movie but if you're like me and enjoy giving the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment to bad films you should see this one. 12 out of 5".

After watching it I do agree that it is crap the movie had no story. In the first 1520 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies braindead? or the girls are? then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere  started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy? or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half  woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it which is a good thing! The film is a true insult to the classic game Uwe Boll please do not make any more films. Thank you!".

I knew I was in for something special when the guy at the box office looked surprised when we said Two for House of the Dead please. He had a bewildered look on his face but gave us two tickets and mumbled the usual Enjoy your movie. We went up to the ticket taker she tore our tickets and said Theater 4 to your right. It was then that I understood. Theater 4 is where they send the really special films the ones where they are shocked and surprised when a human being pays to see it.

Beat it.House of the Dead lived up to Theater 4's long standing tradition of Bmovie ineptness. It's the kind of flick you think you should be enjoying a lot more than you are. There's blood guts zombies a couple of topless women and guns. Lots of guns. So what's not to like? Well if you stop and think about the incredible lack of logic you'll probably hate this movie. My advice Don't think. Watch zombies go boom splat ugh. Take the blood and naked breasts and kick back. Any thinking will ruin the movie.Mercenaries with cameras made this movie. They were hired by the game makers to advertise their video game product. House of the Dead One long bloody commercial. There is even a SEGA banner hanging over the rave scene just so you know who's throwing this party. Whenever there was a scene change images from the actual game would pop up. Just when you thought the movie couldn't be any more shameless it shocks you again.I sincerely hope the makers of this film sent some flowers and candy to the makers of The Matrix because they were completely in love with their Bullet Time technology. Shameless again. The only original thought this movie had was to add screen shots of the game into the film. At least it was honest about its intentions Sell sell sell! Buy House of the Dead! The game is more fun! Don't you wish you were playing it? Like...RIGHT NOW?!!".

I knew I was in for something special when the guy at the box office looked surprised when we said Two for House of the Dead please. He had a bewildered look on his face but gave us two tickets and mumbled the usual Enjoy your movie. We went up to the ticket taker she tore our tickets and said Theater 4 to your right. It was then that I understood. Theater 4 is where they send the really special films the ones where they are shocked and surprised when a human being pays to see it.

Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as These are zombies pure and simple and No cap'n we must not go there! It's evil!.We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror. Trash yes but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb House of the Dead received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege.Final Score 110.".

House of the Dead which really takes place on an island full of dead zombies is not only not a good horror movie  it's not even a bad one. It was excruciatingly painful to watch. The only reaction that my friend and I had watching it together was looking at each other with our mouths hanging open. I think the only words spoken between us was what?! We had to look up when it was made trying to make excuses for it. Our only conclusion was well if a 12year old boy made it  it was a pretty good attempt. But when I couldn't resist looking up their trailer for the directorproducer information and actual found out he was a grown man and had the guts to take credit for making this movie including letting all us viewers know about his 360 degree camera or whatever he called it which by the way he over uses in the film. I was dumbfounded.If I had made this mess  I would have legally changed my name after it's release and maybe even undergone plastic surgery so I would not be recognized.The socalled actors were terrible the story was terrible the socalled special effects were a joke  I think the director was asleep during the taping. In one scene  seconds after killing hundreds of zombies a young couple who just discovered they had feelings for one another start making out  like nothing ever happened. Fastforward a bit and the guy who was just making out sacrifices himself to save his 3 remaining friends and blows up the zombies along with himself with some kegs of gunpowder. The girlfriend and the others make it out alive  her reaction to this when the smoke clears Where are we? Her nor his other buddies were even given one line to say about the poor slob that saved their lives. Anyway she ends up dying anyway boo hoo! and two remain to fight off the leader zombie who apparently can never die  even when his head gets chopped off. The last remaining female surviver gets stabbed with a sword  right THROUGH the middle of her chest  and guess what?  the special effects department must have ran out of fake blood! She's actually sitting there with a spot of blood where she was Peirce  but never bled out! Unbelievable.I can't even stand talking about this anymore.Please don't even be curious don't even be tempted to watch this movie  I'm serious  You won't even get one laugh out of it  it is a total waste of time. Cleaning out the refrigerator is more enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering this movie is based directly on a game this does make it a lot harder for the director and crew to write out the script to suit the game form and to please the gamer fans! I had not played the game before though was amazed that director Uwe Boll used original game play footage of first HOTD game to go with the movie and do believe in some of the scenes they actually did work well! For example a scene when three humans are making an escape in an underground tunnel from the zombies the use of a first person shooter shooting zombies then straight away jumping to game form of that same moment I believe did actually work very well for the scene.I give the film a 510 and unlike the other reviews I have read of people completely panning the movie. To be honest I did enjoy the movie's use of action scenes humor and cheesy acting. I do believe maybe the movie could of been better if it was a bit more creepier and shocking in some parts. I did actually jump at one part when some small demon  skull swimming in a mist of red liquid emerged to the screen LOL.Come on seriously how could you not enjoy that full on 7 minute fight scene in the middle of the movie?! Those spinning 360 degrees cameras around the actors are no longer used in films today! Please just don't look upon the movie and think Now that didn't go like that in the game! cos believe me a director does try their hardest to please the fans and I know must be one of the difficultest things to place on screen including book  movie adaption and adding new things in the movie which wasn't in the game I believe isn't a so bad idea other wise is too predictable if you already played the game.Anyway I do think anyone could enjoy the full on action and gore the movie has to offer and not just hate the movie of not being exactly true to the game and of course all zombie films usually have a cheesy b movie story in this case early 20 year olds being trapped on an island with of course zombies as they must try and reach the House of the Dead...".

And there's The Bride of the Monster which does have some stupid moments and pacing issues but I still don't view it as catastrophic. Manos The Hands of Fate is bad but I respect Harold Warren for creating a movie without any kind of education in film.So let's turn to House of the Dead. The first 2025 minutes were quite good. The movie begins with a short and nottooinformative introduction to the four teens that wish to get to some island and have fun with friends there. Some who are pickier about movies than I am say that characters are best introduced through action than any narration but not much is revealed about them so it's no big deal. The dialog sequence aboard the ship was clever funny and served its purpose of establishing the characters especially the captain.Many complained about the characters' decision to stay at the deserted camp instead of running away but please note that all but Alicia was drunk so don't expect them to make rational decisions. Was Alicia's decision to go investigate rational? No it wasn't but the movie had to move forward didn't it?The movie went on and I haven't gotten the impression that it was as bad as the reviews suggested it was. It looked like a typical horror movie and it continued and ended that way. There are dark places zombies sneaking in the forest characters getting introduced and killed a hooded figure in the distance observing the humans etc. The usual horror move stuff.Possibly weakest part of the movie is the big shootout scene in front of the house. It's spectacular but way too long. They kill zombies by the dozens and not much else happens. One may argue that the battle scenes in The Lord of the Rings trilogy are even longer but there are twists in them that serve a narrative purpose.Also everyone aims perfectly and they don't run out of ammo until the plot requires them to. Neither is an unheardof plot device but since the fight is very long it becomes noticeable.I also don't understand the narrative purpose of the ingame clips. It would have been better if Boll left them out entirely.Surely HotD isn't a good movie but I fail to see why it received so much flak. I basically mentioned everything I disliked about HotD and that's all I could find in a 90minutelong movie. There are things I liked as well. Pacing is generally good the dialogs are decent acting is surprisingly good for a movie with this average rating. The flaws don't outweigh the pros so I give it a 6.".

So he can't convey anything worthwhile to an audience. The only thing he knows how to do is get his female cast to take their clothes off. The best horror flicks do not focus on nudity as a main event. They focus on the rules of how to die and how to stay alive. To show how much the naked girls mean to him there is even a feature on the DVD titled The Sexy Babes of the House of the Dead.House of the Dead delivers nothing but ineptitude and will never reach cult status of any kind.

As war brings out the very worst of qualities in humanity so too can heightened expressions of bravery compassion and loyalty serve to greatly ennoble the human spirit in times of blood and sorrow.

	schema:reviewBody "I know this is a serious board devoted to the merits of the movie... but I would like to just mention the fact that rarely does an actor have the effect on me that Billy Crudup did in this film. Oh my god what a beauty! Perfect in every way... And obviously extremely talented made more perfect by his professional choices!So the film. Well as a some time ago graduate of military history with a particular interest in the sociological effects of war I have a special fondness for stories like this. I sought out the book and devoured it. I loved it absolutely as I do pretty much everything else by Sebastian Faulks. I also enjoyed this film immensely but as a separate entity. A film is generally incapable of reaching the depths your imagination can take you to through reading a truly great book maybe people should spend more time reading! I don't agree with the mauling this film was given by the critics it kept me engaged from beginning to end and the happy ending although a little trite is a smile worthy event!Sod the dodgy Scottish Kate Blanchet was believable as far as I'm concerned. Billy was perfect as I think I might have mentioned! Michael Gambon  always worth watching and the chap that played the teacher was sufficiently creepy from first sight. The boys were sympathetic without being irritating child actors and the atmosphere was intimidating.It was emotional without being over the top the relationship between the leads was wonderfully portrayed and I feel it was a valuable description of the horrific situation of collaboration.Not the best film I've ever seen but I definitely enjoyed it. And I'm not sure if you've noticed and I don't like to bring it up but Billy Crudup is a god among men.Watch it with an open mind.".

Oh my god what a beauty! Perfect in every way... And obviously extremely talented made more perfect by his professional choices!So the film. Well as a some time ago graduate of military history with a particular interest in the sociological effects of war I have a special fondness for stories like this. I sought out the book and devoured it. I loved it absolutely as I do pretty much everything else by Sebastian Faulks. I also enjoyed this film immensely but as a separate entity. A film is generally incapable of reaching the depths your imagination can take you to through reading a truly great book maybe people should spend more time reading!

Even bravery coupled with excellent actors nice cinematography and an eye for detail is not enough. Any film can be ruined by a poor script and Charlote Gray is no exception.The whole tale is just so unlikely. The way Charlotte gets 'picked up' by the British Secret Service  the guy making the first approach is such an annoying bore why on Earth would she accept his invitation for a party instead of throwing his business card in the first available bin? Then she falls in love with this pilot how's that for clich's? and of course he is shot down on his next mission 'don't worry' he said  naturally. So she joins the Secret Service as simple as that and trains to become an agent in the hope to go to France and find him. Now that is really strange  this training would take months so why would she expect him to still be at the place he was shot down if and when she ever manages to get there? Wouldn't he likely be back in England or in a POW camp in Germany? Anyway training over she gets sent to France on her first mission. But this is very strange  we don't really get any insight in what this mission actually is. She delivers a couple of radio valves to a French contact but why these haven't simply been dropped as a parcel is a mystery. Later in the film she acts as intermediary between a locally based English agent and the Resistance. Why do they need to send in another British agent to act as intermediary? Why not let the local agent liaise with the Resistance directly? There seems no rhyme or reason for her being there at all.At the handover of the valves her contact is arrested more mysteries  why does this contact insist to receive the valves when she is about to be arrested? A sure way to torture and death! and Charlotte has to hide. But does she hide? No not really  she goes to live with the father of the young Resistance leader under the pretext of working as a housekeeper. And next thing she happily cycles to town as if there was no risk at all that the initial contact would have told the Gestapo all about her drop! So why is she hiding in the first place? A mystery.And so it goes on and on  every twist of the plot makes it more unlikely. Why do the Resistance take Charlotte along when they attack a train? Why does the Resistance leader risk his life and his group by standing on the street shouting at the Germans? Why do the Germans kill the Resistance fighters in a trap instead of capturing them for interrogation? How do the Germans know where the young Jewish boys are being hidden? In the end the whole point of the movie seems to be to paint a love triangle against a backdrop of the French Resistance  wow we really needed a film like that! The script simply sucks and the actors don't know what to do with it either. The cinematography is very nice but then of course it is hard to go wrong when filming in the French countryside.Five stars for bravery that's what I promised so I will stick to that.If only that policeman had said 'Good Moaning' I would have given it six stars for even more bravery.".

Neither romance is realistic or enjoyable to the point where you want to see Charlotte lose both.The EndingShe doesn't lose both in fact despite all her offensive nonsense throughout the film she finds and rejects Biggles in peace time in favour of melodramatic Frenchie!

This is a poorly put together chick flick a glammedup should have been straighttovideo potboiler.Here's what I believe the director thought1 France looks nice  lets make a picture there 2 Cate Blanchett looks nice  lets put her in France 3 Berets are back in fashion  lets put Cate Blanchett in a beret in France 4 Hmm.. maybe too nice so far. Lets have some Germans in there they're not nice. 5 Crudup is a great name  lets have him in France with Cate Blanchett and her beret. 6 Lets rock !!Heres what I thought1 Cate Blanchett does look stunning throughout this film and can certainly wear a beret. 2 It is completely preposterous to have her speak in a Scottish accent prior to her going to France and in an English accent when she gets there. When she is supposed to be speaking fluent French. 3 Cate appears to have been sent into France by the British with no particular aim in mind. She wombles about messing everything up and appears to be completely superfluous there is not one thing she does for the War effort which could not have been performed just as efficiently by a halftrained monkey  in a beret of course. 4 Crudup the heroic Maquis is just about the most lamebrained person you could hope to meet. He spends a lot of his time shouting at Germans which I would presume from my knowledge of goingson in France at that time is not the best way to remain incognito. 5 The Plot is awful. Yet again the Hollywoodpleasing formula of Poor Old Jews  Bad Old Germans is trotted out. Nothing new cliche follows cliche. Oh but we now have Bad French too. Big Deal.This really is a laughably bad film. But it is more than that it is insulting to the memory of those brave men and women who went into France during the War serving with SOE.Forget this nonsense. If you want to know what really happened in France during the WW2 rent Carve Her Name With Pride the story of Violet Szabo a real SOE operative.".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was a pointless movie then this is it. The story is basically the wartime experience of a Scots lass Charlotte Gray who has a much needed talent of being able to speak fluent French. Oh Lord not again do I hear somebody say? Yep! Afraid so. It begins with Charlotte sitting in a railway carriage rolling up a cigarette with a type of paper that wasn't on the market until after the war i.e. with tapered corners. Still in the carriage she then talks to a complete stranger who is obviously after personal information. Whatever happened to the observance of the popular slogan of the time Be like Dad keep Mum? After the railway journey she is seen alighting in a supposedly wartorn yet oddly blimpfree and undamaged London from a postwar indeed relatively modern London bus. After which it starts to get sensible but only for a while.After falling in love with an RAF officer and to whom for some unexplained reason she has tried to teach French beneath the sheets...please don't laugh it's supposed to be serious she discovers that he has been posted missing in France so decides to join SOE Special Operations Executive for the express purpose of finding him. Hold on! It gets sillier! Notwithstanding the fact that never would such an emotional girl either have passed the scrutiny or indeed the strict training of the SOE she is sent to France on a probationary tryout. A tryout? In wartime France albeit only in Vichy? Oh come on!Considering that many if not most agents sent were captured andor killed within days of their arrival this idea is ridiculous. In wartime or at any other time there is no place for sentimentality in the furtherance of sabotage or espionage. Certainly no tryouts. Churchill's idea was to set Europe ablaze not to send lovesick girls on errands of stupidity or should that be Cupidity. I'm still actually wondering what her official mission was or did I miss something? Then we're given a ludicrous depiction of an air drop. Supplies are dropped from no more than 60100 feet at which height the parachutes would not have time to open but somehow they do. Needless to say if a person is dropped from that height they would almost certainly be killed with or without a parachute. A short while later comes a scene after said airdrop of which the enemy had got wind and ambushed it which shows that the Germans have left bodies of resistant fighters lying unguarded in the middle of a field. I find it extremely puzzling that the Germans didn't remove them from the scene if for nothing else than to glean vital information from them. But then I suppose the screenwriter thought that really the Germans weren't all that clever. What? In his dreams! In the meantime Charlotte learns that her pilot boyfriend is dead.Although being somewhat tedious the story then begins to take on a vestige of reality regarding the fate of two parentless Jewish children and the resistance group leader's father who is also of Jewish ancestry. I won't say any more on the plot for fear of any more spoilers but suffice it to say that the end is even soppier than the beginning.I was going to mention more goofs in the film but some have already been noticed by other reviewers and placed in the Goofs board. I refer you to them.It's all reasonably well acted and has good cinematography but in coping with such an emptyheaded script noone shines through. I was hoping this production would be as good as both Odette and Carve Her Name with Pride. I'm sorry to say it doesn't even come close to either. That said there was the making of a really good movie here and it could have been another fitting tribute to the courage of all wartime agents. However somewhere along the line it got lost amongst the emotional twaddle and the scriptwriter's fantasy. Maybe in the future someone with more nous will try a remake and sort out the mess.".

It's a good movie  well it's not a BAD movie but perhaps in this case the opposite of bad is NOT good. An indifferent movie is nearer the truth. Within the last couple of years an English newspaper gave away a series of dvds set in WWII one of which was Carve Her Name With Pride which covers much of the same ground except that it was about a REAL Resistance worker Violette Szabo who failed to survive the war unlike the fictional Gray Carve Her Name made in black and white is light years better than the Technicolored Charlotte Gray Blanchett's fine performance notwithstanding. As long as we're making comparisons I also disagree with the person who unaccountably rated this movie higher than Claude Berri's Lucie Aubrac but then difference of opinion is what makes horse races.".

In the title role of Charlotte Grey she plays a British woman who goes looking for the man she loves in the midst of World War II. He was a member of the Royal Air Force and his plane was shot down. Determined to find out his fate regardless of all the dangerous consequences Charlotte assumes a new name and is taken in by a French family.

The cover photo makes you think  ah our Cate will be playing someone like a French countess or someone elegant and poised and brilliant and fascinating and complex. You can just picture her as a real classy oldfashioned lady spy moving among the German generals and hypnotizing them with her natural glamor and allure getting secrets to help the Allies plan the DDay landing successfully. That would be easy and natural and exciting and sexy to watch.But no you get Cate playing some girl who has no class or personality or even much of a plot to support her. One minute she's this dumb working girl in London and suddenly she's a secret agent? Why? It just made no sense to send some untrained nobody into this occupied French village and then she just sort of muddles around hiding people and the Nazis don't even notice that she's stunningly beautiful. That might be exciting and the movie hates excitement more than the Nazis! I would pay big money to have a full size poster of the cover of this movie. But do not ever rent or buy this turkey.

And while I admit indeed that there was more story and story twists in this movie then in maybe 5 great Hollywood productions such as Spiderman put together...well that's a part of the books too! When reading a Lupin book it is never advisable to get used to things staying as they are! Arsene Lupin himself is one of the most dynamic characters that ever existed! I watched this movie at the Fantasy Film festival and I enjoyed it immensely. So they took some story bits from different books who cares? The story is nevertheless continuous and quite understandable if one is ready to apply a bit more brainmatter to it than to ..say..The Hulk! The costuming and setting was splendid and the whole tone was very fitting for the time in which it is supposed to play. Of cause no movie will ever truly incorporate all that is Arsene Lupin it is simply impossible. Not just because of the different medium but also because of the growing difference in thinking that characterizes the current time and the time in which it was written. The idea of a brilliant and gallant master thief itself will stay the same but the habits interaction with society's members and all that are so definite and important for Arsene Lupin that leaving them in might confuse the mass audience and leaving them out would destroy the Character. If anyone wants a Lupin for current times they may look for Lupin Sansei supposed to be his grandson and Simon Templar might be a sort of poor substitute too. However the original Arsene Lupin is a legend of his own time and that description should make matters clear for anyone. oh and the 910 is because indeed some of the effects were executed a bit poorly especially the odd zoom at the aiguille creuse.".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanPaul Salome director introduced his movie at the Toronto Film Festival September 17 2004 by saying 'I did not want to make a popcorn movie but a champagne movie!'The champagne splashed on the screen in a lavish production that honored the original material from which it was adapted. The opening titles with rolling letters on a background of sparkling diamonds looked luscious. They gave way to thumping horse hoofs racing on the ground. A first scene that establishes the speed and swiftness with which Salome will tell his story. We first meet Arsene as a young boy being tutored by his father first in sports then in thievery. The gendarmes fail to capture Arsene's father in a wellchoreographed fight scene. Arsene is orphaned his father is mysteriously murdered and his mother dies in the hands of the gendarmes. Arsene makes his living as a thief. Arsene's cousin Clarisse shows love and devotion for him. She makes effort to help and reform him. Arsene encounters Josephine Comtesse de Cagliostro in a frightful interrogation scene involving conspiring royalists. He risks his own life to rescue her from drowning in the sea. Arsene is totally infatuated with her. She is evil and corrupting. They join forces on a treasure hunt involving three missing crucifixes. The murderous Beaumagnan stands in their way.The movie is a truly sumptuous production reminiscent of Hollywood blockbuster action films. We see Arsene in Tarzan style swing from the ceiling of the cathedral of Rouen to sweep a crucifix. We see Arsene in Indiana Jones style racing on a horse to jump on a moving train. We see dazzlingly choreographed fights. We see spectacular explosions worthy of a James Bond movie. We see the Paris of the Belle Epoch recreated in all its breathtaking glory. We see the beauty of Normandy showcased in extravagant shots. We see the great needle of Etretat. We see a fabulous ball with beautiful ladies in white soire dresses and men in tails. We see a sumptuous ocean liner celebrating the birth of a new year. We see Arsene Lupin as we have never seen him before an action hero young impulsive and still learning his craft.I truly liked Romain Duris as a young Arsene Lupin. He acted his role with a wellbalanced mix of humor smugness and selfassurance. The dexterity and smoothness with which he moved his hands and fingers to steal jewelry from around the necks and wrists of his hapless victims was impressive. His dark rough looks and slender figure are very much the Arsene Lupin I imagined when I first read the novel many years ago. Kristin Scot Thomas certainly steals the show as the seductive and lethal Comtesse de Cagliostro. She was the right age and possesses the physique and looks needed for her role. Eva Green as Clarisse was a breath of fresh air among all those nasty murderous thugs surrounding her. She has the face of an angel and was able to bring a touch of tenderness and decency to the dark story. Pascal Greggory as Beaumagnan in one word was fabulous evil corrupted and hopelessly incorrigible.Even though Salome was somewhat faithful to his adaptation of the original novel he took many liberties with many incidents and events. He attempted to give us the entire life of Arsene Lupin from a little boy to an older man in one single movie. He borrowed elements from many other stories and incorporated them within his movie. Some of the stories he borrowed from include The Queen's Necklace The Arrest of Arsene Lupin The Hollow Needle The Crystal Stopper and 813. He even attempted to change history and make us believe that the attack on Archduke Franz Ferdinand took place in Paris. Salome certainly did his homework and showed great knowledge about Arsene Lupin and his various adventures. Sadly this extensive borrowing from so many other stories will certainly limit his choices for future movie adaptations. In conclusion I very much liked the movie. The story was fast moving and flowed smoothly. The scenes were beautifully photographed with quick camera movements. The musical score by Debbie Wiseman soared high and complimented the fast action. The sets were lavish the actors were great and the special effects were fantastic. The use of the three crucifixes together to unravel the mystery of the treasure was clever and innovative. I highly recommend this movie. Without a doubt it will produce many new fans of Arsene Lupin and will entice many to read the original works of Maurice Leblanc. Good job JeanPaul Salome!".

	schema:reviewBody "Arsen Lupin and Immortel were among the films that i went to see during the French Film festival in Belgrade. While i immortel left a good impression on me Arsen Lupin got me and a couple of my friends laughing. Here's why First of all The Adventures of Arsen Lupin are a series of books which tell a story of a Gentleman Thief in the 19th century. The books are enjoyable if you are a fan of romanticadventure novels. The film tries to squeeze a few of these books into a whole. This was in my opinion a mistake from the start. The film starts unwinding at about the 1 hour mark and keeps unwinding for another hour meaning that its ending for a whole hour. The scenes quickly jump from one thing to another not explaining the who or why characters come and go places things details... After an hour or so you can't even remember what happened 2 minutes ago and frankly you stop caring since the plot makes 360 degree turns every frame. Instead you catch yourself enjoying the unbelievable plot twists and the speed at which they unfold in a bad way I had the whole cinema laughing throughout the second part of the film. All the characters are switched around so in the end his father is trying to kill him WHY?! oh yeah and he is searching for this treasure which is shown by placing certain crosses together. Also he seems to be in love with a witchdevil character who tries to use him but doesn't then does and so on... Another comic character was the witch's henchman who had a metal plate covering half of his face his role is also unclear. The costumes and scenery are very well done but they don't do much to fix the script editing and awful directing. The first half of the film starts out slow and slightly boring but the second half is fast confusing and outright funny. I loved laughing my head off at the unbelievable plot twists in the second half of the film. Otherwise its not worth seeing this film.".

Fights Stunts exotic places wicked villains and characters you will love to hate or chill for ! It was a good surprise to me because I am not a great fan of Pitoff.Romain Duris and Kristin Scott Thomas especially her ! deliver a very good performance and Eva Green i didn't know her before this movie is really charming as Arsene Lupin youth love. One thing i enjoyed as well is the visual reconstitution of 19th century Paris which is really impressive when you live there.Good entertainment !".

Definitely an update of the LeBlanc Lupin with an eye on Monkey Punch's Rupan San Se and Miyazaki's too as Cagliostro's grand daughter is one of the characters. Salom's and Roman Duris' Lupin is definitely the XXI century Lupin 1st and in many ways it portrays the character as it should have been rather than the Casanova softie of the seventies TV show interpreted by George Descrires.Yes plenty of suspension of disbelief is needed and there was enough material here to make at least two slower paced movies which I would have personally preferred and which would probably have happened with overseas budgets. And the plot does makes sense well most of the time but it's not for everybody some attention needs to be paid to the details. Of course this movie won't work in the US the director does not remind all the time who the characters are with flashbacks and voice overs so this practice excludes pretty much that 90 of US movie audience which seems to suffer from ADD. Oh and the bad guy sets a disabled individual on fire and tosses him out of a window which pretty much guarantees PC police censorship too.For all the Lupin aficionados or for people who have just known the mangaanime interpretation of the grandson character this is highly recommended but you need to be able at least to read French as that's the only language in the subtitles which are also a little incomplete. Over 2 hours just packed with action and romance and good music too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spectacular production of a novel written by Maurice Leblanc about the character Arsene lupin known perhaps to many Europeans and video game addicts but not much to the rest of the filmgoing community. Great for Saturday afternoon film going and very much unlike any French produced film I've seen before. Young actor Romain Duris does a decent job of portraying Arsene Lupin in his youth and early beginnings as a gentleman thief. It's very difficult to take your eyes off him. He plays the part more as a modern day version of the oldfashioned character  grungy and hairy and all that. Up and coming young actress Eva Green plays his childhood sweetheart with just the proper amount of restrain. Overall a finely tuned performance. Kristin Scott Thomas plays the Countess of Cagliostro and outrightly steals the movie. She is no match for the gentleman cambrioleur. Anyone familiar with her other films will not recognize her as the exotic oversexed and murderous femmefatale. It's a multidimensional and very soulful performance. The rest of the cast provide superlative work. I'm sure there will be lots of comparisons to Indiana Jones. However the difference here is the well written and intelligent screenplay. The French has finally come up with their version of an action adventure that everyone can enjoy but doesn't insult your intelligence.. I didn't think they were capable. A most enjoyable film to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess it's not that easy to make a 12 hours script on such a character but I'm afraid that the choices made by the production were wrong from the start.This movie tries to depict how Arsne Lupin became who he is. It tries to give some of the keys which lead him to his extravagant life. But even in this attempt everything is wrong. Arsne does not kill ? OK. But this is given to the viewer as a fact from the beginning. And the whole film tends to push him into criminal revenge for all the bad people he has to suffer from. I mean by this that his character is already forged so the movie does not hint you how and on the contrary everything that happens to him leads to no consequence about it. Then what's the point ?The way I picture Arsne Lupin is as a very smart gentleman. Even if he is nothing but a bad boy originally. This is why the choice of Romain Duris surprises me a lot. He seems like a good actor but he looks much more as a bad boy than as a smart English gentleman. He's got a forced smile on a tough face when Lupin always has this mocking smile. I agree though that this point could be discussed for hours as the original book character was a bit of both.Finally Lupin's character even if he's an opportunist guy is very clever and usually thinks ahead a lot. He is not the kind of guy to run straight ahead inside a trap. I would have liked to see more Ocean's Eleven in it. In this movie he is more reacting to the events than making them happen the way he planned it.All in all it's a nice movie with good acting and nice sets I've been very surprised with the Place de l'opera with a 19xx look but it is not very fair to the quality of the book character.".

The audience are taken on a ride of suspense to the last moment. Twists and turns in the plot unpredictable things happen. The casting is good. I am familiar with Kristen Scott Thomas. I knew she spoke French as i understand she lives there but her French accent is quite amazing. I could here English accent on some occasions but it was so subtle that it was hardly noticeable. Her casting in this film was so contrary to type that i had seen in other films. It was so refreshing. The action scenes were again amazing. So well choreographed and still almost believable and realistic. The original idea originates from an animated book which makes it ambiguous and sets it apart from a lot of other films in the similar genre. Films based upon Comic books are being done to death in Hollywood and i am trying to avoid them. I am glad that this was made by European Film makers not Americans otherwise it would have been almost painful to watch. The romance that develops is another interesting addition to the plot. All of these little things develop well and come together. The choice of location was again just perfect for the scenes and the setting of the film in the mid to late 19th Century made it quite unique. A very clever film which is definitely worth watching.".

I just went across a lengthy interview I made with Claude Leblanc son of Mauricein 1992 when he was 90 years old he died two years later. I'm sorry to say Romain Duris is no match to the list of the former Lupins except Charles Korvin in the last of the three movies made by MGM including Georges Descrires classy but unable to save the TV versions. But how can you concentrate 813 in 52 minutes? And the ending with FranzFerdinand of Austria murdered in front of the Gare de l'Est is purely ridiculous almost an insult to the millions of youngsters who were murdered after the Sarajevo catastrophe. J.P. Salom probably imagined that moviegoers would smile at that none did at least in my sparsely populated theater. If he imagined it as a prelude to a new sequel he missed the point.

	schema:headline " In the Spanish court";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the funniest comedies made for the French cinema was inspired by none other than Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas. The film served its purpose to delight and amuse as the unorthodox pairing of Yves Montand one of the biggest stars in France and Louis De Funes a comic genius who is seen at his best in the film were directed by Gerard Oury. The screenplay was written by Daniele Thompson the director's daughter Marcel Julian and Mr. Oury.The result is a sort of what feels like a French Western filmed mostly in Spain the locale where many other pictures of the genre were shot. The action involve a corrupt tax collector Don Salluste Bazan and his servant the rascal Blaze out to create hell for a master whose only passion is about how much is he going to chisel out from the royal coffers. Delusions of Grandeur is one of the funniest films of that period. The wonderful Yves Montand shows his versatility as Blaze a resourceful man whose only purpose in life is to expose his deceitful employer.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the funniest comedies made for the French cinema was inspired by none other than Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas. The film served its purpose to delight and amuse as the unorthodox pairing of Yves Montand one of the biggest stars in France and Louis De Funes a comic genius who is seen at his best in the film were directed by Gerard Oury. The screenplay was written by Daniele Thompson the director's daughter Marcel Julian and Mr. Oury.The result is a sort of what feels like a French Western filmed mostly in Spain the locale where many other pictures of the genre were shot. The action involve a corrupt tax collector Don Salluste Bazan and his servant the rascal Blaze out to create hell for a master whose only passion is about how much is he going to chisel out from the royal coffers. Delusions of Grandeur is one of the funniest films of that period. The wonderful Yves Montand shows his versatility as Blaze a resourceful man whose only purpose in life is to expose his deceitful employer. A sort of Robin Hood if you will who gave back to the exploited folks the tribute they were asked to pay the crown. Louis De Funes a fine comic actor shows the actor in an inspired role who in spite of being so mean manages to make the viewer laughs throughout the movie.Michel Polnareff's music reminds us of some of Ennio Morricone's compositions for those notorious Spaghetti Westerns where he provided the music.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many comedies with Luis De Funes and have been his fan as long as I can remember. His participation in a movie promises good time plenty of physical comedy funny mess of grandiose proportions and up roaring laughs. He was The man with the forty faces per minute the little volcano or small but powerful dynamo machine whose energy could supply electricity to a town of the average size  whose hilarious hyperactivity perfect for a comic everchanging face and the ego of gigantic size in such miniature frame always produced a highly comic effect. All his trademarks are in full display in the updated version of the tragedy by Victor Hugo Ruy Blas La folie des grandeurs 1971 or Delusions of Grandeur. Ruy Blas has been adapted to the screen several times including 1948 film with Jean Mairet and 2002 version with Gerard Depardieu. Oury's film formally follows the Hugo's story but with De Funes in the cast you would not expect it to be a serious political drama and you will be absolutely right. The film takes place in 17th century Spain and centers around a practical joke played on the queen of Spain by Don Salluste de Bazan the rich greedy and backstabbing tax collector for revenge. Don Salluste disguises his servant Blaze Ives Montand as a nobleman and takes him to the king's court. Attractive funny and suave Blaze saves the king from the bomb becomes popular is appointed a tax collector instead of Salluste and conquers the queen's heart. Don Salluste returns to take his revenge by notifying the king with the anonymous letter about queen's infidelity. The final act that brings together Salluste Blaze Salluste's nephew Don Cesar de Bazan whom his loving uncle sold as a slave to the Sahara barbarians the furious jealous king the queen who is in love with Blaze and her Cerberus like duea old virgin Donna Juana very funny Alice Sapritch who is also passionately in love with Blaze is nonstopping laugh that left me in stitches. La folie des grandeurs directed by Grard Oury adapted by Oury's daughter Danile Thomson and starring Louis de Funs Don Salluste and Yves Montand Blaze is based on the serious drama but it is so deliciously silly dizzyingly fast absurd and hilarious that you would laugh even when you know how silly it is. Ives Montand replaced Bourvil who was initially meant to play Blaze and who had a great chemistry with De Funes on the screen nicely balancing latter's super activity and aggressiveness with his gentle naivet and kindness. But as Bourvil died in 1970 Yves Montand ultimately got the role and proved to be quite good in a comedy even though the viewers were used to see him playing the cool and cynic characters in the thrillers and dramas.As always with De Funes he practically owns the movie. While watching  La folie des grandeurs for the first time last night I could not help laughing hard and loud even knowing how silly and over the top the movie was but laughing even more because of it. This morning I began laughing again just recalling De Funes' face and him losing his voice and making some impossible quacking and squeaking noises when caught by surprise in the most hilarious scene of the film. La folie des grandeurs hold the record as the most successful French film of 1971 the fact that does not surprise me at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film appears to be set in late 17th century Spain but it is NOT just another costume drama. That's because it has a bizarre and often cartoony style about itand as I knew nothing about the film I was taken by surprise. In some ways the cartoony ways reminded me of the dumb but very funny The Villain.The film is about the inept and evil Don Salluste Louis de Funs and his valet Blaze Yves Montand. It's obvious that Salluste is an idiot and Blaze is the brains of the operationmuch like Jeeves  Wooster. However after Salluste robs the poor and behaves like a boorish jerk for the first half hour he is caught in an indiscretion and all his many titles and riches are stripped from him. In a very funny twist of fate these are all then rewarded to Blazewho now becomes the trusted adviser to the King! Ultimately this creates problems as although Salluste was thoroughly hated by the other nobles at least he knew the rulesmistreat and overtax the poor. A group almost like the 'antiThree Musketeers' decide that they should stop trying to kill the King and concentrate on Blaze as now Blaze is encouraging the King to do insane things like curtail the abuse of the poor such as the rule that when a nobleman kills one of their servants they now have to at least report it...how unfair!.This film achieved something difficultvery difficult. While a film can be extremely silly and cartoony making it ALSO funny is a tough order. It could have just been a stupid filmbut was in fact quite clever. If you like this sort of silliness other than The VIllain you might also want to try watching Start The Revolution Without Mean even sillier costume drama that is set in France during the time of the impending French Revolution.Finally a few observations. It really is Montand doing the singing as he had a marvelous voice and was actually a very popular pop singer as well as an actor. Also while some might take offense at or think the many midgets in the king's court was dumb this actually WAS accurate. During this time courts often were littered with such small people as they were a popular fad at the time! Truly a case of the truth being stranger than fiction. And finally why did this movie have a spaghetti western style score? Weird.".

	schema:headline " Montand towering over De Funs at the height of his comical power...";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1970 director Grard Oury was the king of French popular comedy having conquered the highest boxoffice summits with The Sucker and The Great Stroll both starring Louis de Funs and Bourvil. Third time's a charm Oury probably figured when he was planning to feature the memorable duo in a comical adaptation of Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas a tale of ambitions convoluted plots schemes and masquerades set in the flamboyant worldruling Spain of the 17th century. Oury had the reputation the capability and more than anything the dough.But it was fate that took a stand against him for the great Bourvil failed the whole world of cinema and died in the most untimely fashion in 1970 at the age of 52 leaving French cinema orphan of his likability. But De Funs was at the peak of his career and he needed a partner not a sidekick a real costar. Grard Oury was at loss until Simone Signoret suggested her husband Yves Montand. Montand was a singer and dancer but his romantic aura earned him many memorable leading man roles it was time for him to display the natural comedic talent he owed to his musichall days. And Montand pulls a superb performance as De Funs valet.There's a natural complementarity different from the one with Bourvil but with comedic potential as well. Bourvil was the 'lovable' average guy and De Funs the bossy one with a hairtrigger temper but Montand is everything De Funs is not whether in looks or personality. De Funs can manipulate him but the novelty is that he can envy him secretly. The two opposite attract as they say Saluste is the King Minsitry's of Finance Louis de Funs at his cruelest meanest and scroogiest he's like a liveaction version of French famous comicbook caliph Iznogoud or Disney's Prince John spotting a ridiculous hat with two green bobbles. When he comes to take the taxes and a poor official laments that the people are poor Saluste turns his head and the bobbles hit the guy's face That's normal poor are meant to be very poor and rich very rich.Now this was the plainvillainous role De Funs' needed but never vileness at the expenses of sympathy even something as ridicule as his bobbles makes him look more grotesque than villainous. And Montand is the handsome resourceful and clever valet who only plays the fool to fool his master but he's not to be overshadowed by De Funs he can be romantic hell he can even be funny. The scene where he starts dancing the flamenco much to his master's displeasure is simply Montand establishing his presence and the scene where Saluste orders him to walk on his knees because he doesn't want to look smaller is De Funs feeling literally towered.Delusions of Grandeurs starts with the perfect casting choice and then all it takes is a sweeping and swashbuckling story that would have made Cecil B.

	onyx:emotionText "In 1970 director Grard Oury was the king of French popular comedy having conquered the highest boxoffice summits with The Sucker and The Great Stroll both starring Louis de Funs and Bourvil. Third time's a charm Oury probably figured when he was planning to feature the memorable duo in a comical adaptation of Victor Hugo's Ruy Blas a tale of ambitions convoluted plots schemes and masquerades set in the flamboyant worldruling Spain of the 17th century. Oury had the reputation the capability and more than anything the dough.But it was fate that took a stand against him for the great Bourvil failed the whole world of cinema and died in the most untimely fashion in 1970 at the age of 52 leaving French cinema orphan of his likability. But De Funs was at the peak of his career and he needed a partner not a sidekick a real costar. Grard Oury was at loss until Simone Signoret suggested her husband Yves Montand. Montand was a singer and dancer but his romantic aura earned him many memorable leading man roles it was time for him to display the natural comedic talent he owed to his musichall days. And Montand pulls a superb performance as De Funs valet.There's a natural complementarity different from the one with Bourvil but with comedic potential as well. Bourvil was the 'lovable' average guy and De Funs the bossy one with a hairtrigger temper but Montand is everything De Funs is not whether in looks or personality. De Funs can manipulate him but the novelty is that he can envy him secretly. The two opposite attract as they say Saluste is the King Minsitry's of Finance Louis de Funs at his cruelest meanest and scroogiest he's like a liveaction version of French famous comicbook caliph Iznogoud or Disney's Prince John spotting a ridiculous hat with two green bobbles. When he comes to take the taxes and a poor official laments that the people are poor Saluste turns his head and the bobbles hit the guy's face That's normal poor are meant to be very poor and rich very rich.Now this was the plainvillainous role De Funs' needed but never vileness at the expenses of sympathy even something as ridicule as his bobbles makes him look more grotesque than villainous. And Montand is the handsome resourceful and clever valet who only plays the fool to fool his master but he's not to be overshadowed by De Funs he can be romantic hell he can even be funny. The scene where he starts dancing the flamenco much to his master's displeasure is simply Montand establishing his presence and the scene where Saluste orders him to walk on his knees because he doesn't want to look smaller is De Funs feeling literally towered.Delusions of Grandeurs starts with the perfect casting choice and then all it takes is a sweeping and swashbuckling story that would have made Cecil B. De Mille jealous.

These record a person's entire life from a first person viewpointthe camera sees what the person sees hears what they hear. The intention is to have an accurate documentarylike record after the person dies. These are presented as films at their funerals. Citizens known as cutters just a slang for a film editor pare down one's life to a feature length presentation. There are also those who protest the implants. The Final Cut is the story of the latter days of a cutter Alan W. Hakman Robin Williams.While The Final Cut is enjoyable enough it has tremendous squandered potential. As one would expect Williams turns in an incredible performance but the script by writerdirector Omar Naim could have used a lot of work.The premise is fabulous. It opens many philosophical and psychological cans of worms. Some are dealt with but only cursorily. Surely cutters go through a lot of emotional trauma as they vicariously experience the lows and the mundanities of other person's lives. Naim shows us this briefly with a recording of someone who was an abuser. But as soon as he shows us this material he drops it. The film is advertised as a thriller. How much more exciting would it have been to embed Hakman in the middle of some grand suspenseful plot the details of which became known to him through data from an implant? As one of the opponents of the implant technology remarks the implants have changed the way people relate to each other. That is a good pointit would have a profound impact on that. So why aren't we shown instances of this in the film? This could have been another hinge for a very intriguing tense plot.There are also issues of invasion of privacy surveillance paranoia consent the implants are shown being put into infants and being permanent and misuse of the data. Most of these are barely touched. Often they're only broached with a single comment or a protester's sign.Other fascinating issues brought up by the idea of the technology are not even mentioned. Surely such technology would prove to be invaluable as evidence in crimes. And surely many people especially victims would voluntarily offer a tap into their implants so they can be witnesses. Why not comment on these kinds of possibilities? The Final Cut is also oddly understated with such a farreaching scifi premise in this era of rubber reality films. A number of plot points such as the one involving Louis Hunt have almost disappointingly mundane resolutions. For that matter for a scifi film set in the future or an alternate reality there isn't much that is different about the world except for the implants. Probably the lack of differences was due to budget. It costs a lot of money to build alternate realities.This might sound far too negative for the film to warrant a 7 out of 10 from me which is equivalent to a C letter grade. Much of the film is saved by the performances. In combination with direction that is more often than not interesting and unusual it's easy to focus on the promise of the premise rather than the unfulfilled extensions of the same.Hakman and presumably the other cutters have odd dispositions. Their task is to make everyone look goodlike a mortician making up a mangled body so it's presentable at a funeral. They spend hour upon hour as voyeurs. They are something like archivists but also have to play detective. It makes them strangely aloof and dour. It's difficult for them to have relationships. Naim gets in a couple cracks that portray the cutters and their social relationships as similar to geeky Internet addicts. This is all good stuff and it's excellently played by Williams.The flow of the film is a bit odd and especially the ending which I praised for its relative nihilism is eventually abrupt in a way that doesn't exactly work and I usually love abrupt endings. Being generous we could take the wonky flow as a levelremoved kind of selfreference. Of course Naim was faced with cutting the film to make it look good but it's a bit awkward and arbitraryfeeling just as a cutter's work would likely be when faced with having to produce a coherent 90minute film out of 80 years' worth of material. Being less generous Naim simply needs to learn how to better tell a story and there was no intention of realworld reflexivity with his fictional material.The Final Cut is worth seeing especially if you're a Robin Williams fan as I am but it's a disappointment considering what it could have been.".

Naim gets in a couple cracks that portray the cutters and their social relationships as similar to geeky Internet addicts. This is all good stuff and it's excellently played by Williams.The flow of the film is a bit odd and especially the ending which I praised for its relative nihilism is eventually abrupt in a way that doesn't exactly work and I usually love abrupt endings. Being generous we could take the wonky flow as a levelremoved kind of selfreference. Of course Naim was faced with cutting the film to make it look good but it's a bit awkward and arbitraryfeeling just as a cutter's work would likely be when faced with having to produce a coherent 90minute film out of 80 years' worth of material. Being less generous Naim simply needs to learn how to better tell a story and there was no intention of realworld reflexivity with his fictional material.The Final Cut is worth seeing especially if you're a Robin Williams fan as I am but it's a disappointment considering what it could have been.";

The ending was great and I had to think a little longer what I should think about the rest of the movie. Of course I liked it but I didn't now how much till I watched the movie for the 2nd 3rd and 4th time. It's an absolutely awesome movie and it got better and better everytime I watched it. The camerawork is amazing directing from Omar is perfect and the acting performances especially Robin and Thom Bishops are the best of their carreer. I can't help it but I have to compare this movie with One Hour Photo. Compared to that movie this one is more thrilling and I think a lot more accessible for a lot of people. The great thing about Robin is that in this movie he gives the other actors the opportunity to shine.I've read several reviews that were negative about everything they could be negative about. Omar should've been a bad director and writer Robin was robotic and the set decoration didn't fit in. Well I think Omar did a great job Robins performance was even better than in One Hour Photo and I thought Robins best performance was in One Hour Photo the set decoration is very human and warm and the music by Brian Tyler is absolutely fantastic. Ok one thing in the scriptstory may be doubtful but I don't think that makes this movie instantly as bad as other critics say.I completely understood each character and I understood why they did things the way they did it.I hope this movie will get a lot of positive reviews soon because everyone who worked on this project fully deserve it!".

	schema:reviewBody "As the summary reads great idea. But there are some major problems with this movie.The relationshipvery poorly done. We have no idea why Mira Sorvino is attracted to Robin's character. She even has lines that beat you over the head with the theme of the movie What about your life? or You have to live your own life. We get it we don't need to be told that Robin lives his life through others. In one scene she tells him she doesn't want to be with him in the bookstoreparaphrasing and fifteen or twenty minutes later she's back over his place. Why does she act this way? I don't know. Her character was poorly drawn. The best part about their relationship was when she discovered that Robin had been watching her with her previous boyfriend.That added some complexity to the situation and Robin's character.Jim CaviezelI usually like him. He was good in Count of Monte Cristo Frequency The Passion. But he was just GOD AWFUL in this movie. Every line he spoke in this movie was so forced and way over the top. His line to end the movie almost made me laugh at how overly theatrical it was. He didn't need to say anything at the end I thought. Just by showing us what he was doing I believe that the director made his point. But no he beat us over the head again with the message.The subplot concerning the head business guyI couldn't tell what plot was supposed to be the focal point of this movie. He's working on this rememory then discovers he has an implant and the movie seems to lose direction. The grieving wifeNear the end Robin goes to tell her that the disc has been destroyed so that he will be unable to do the rememory. She is WAY too forgiving and accepting here. To her this is the last way she will be able to connect with her husband whom she apparently loves very much enough to fight a court battle to get the implant released. Instead she just nods her head and basically tells Robin that's okay you've destroyed my last chance to experience my dead husband. He did blame it on a technical malfunction of course but I don't think that would have lessened her anger really.Robin has an implantWHOA! Cool idea for a twist but did the Director not think this through? Perhaps I'm wrong about the facts of the movie so I'll lay out what I think is true The cutters work for the company that makes the implants right? Do you seriously think that when Robin applied to be a cutter the company didn't have him in some sort of database as one of the implanted people? Don't you think they'd want to check on that? Especially considering they probably asked him questions about his personal life. It's just too hard to willingly suspend disbelief this far. Granted he obviously told them he had no implant but still wouldn't that be in a computer somewhere?Social CommentaryThematic MaterialThe protesters the stigma of being a cutter etc. These were cool ideas but poorly expanded upon. It's tough for me to explain why because I would argue what wasn't in the movie as opposed to what was.Feel free to rip me apart. Again I thought this was a great idea and the Director has shown us some promise. But there were some major problems with the film.".

But at the very end we discover that whet we have seen in the reremembered version could have been changed by the Caviziel character.

Just as the interviews of family recall the journalist trying to understand Kane the fine scene is a nice visual play on his famous mystifying Rosebud ironically demonstrating that someone outside one's head can never understand what is significant and meaningful to an individual what goes into making that unique personality. While I'm not sure it's such a bombshell that eulogies in this case as visually edited rememories culled from brain implantsare whitewashes as pointedly satirized by Tom Wolfe in Bonfire of the Vanities and the political protesters seemed almost to be satirically out of a T. C. Boyle novel James Caviezel's seriousness keeps them out of Unabomber territory. One awkward miscast is Mira Sorvino. As if it's not already obvious why a Robin Williams would be attracted to a blonde bombshell another layer of motivation is added but it just makes absolutely no sense why she was drawn to him. Not only does this seem yet another instance of film's older manyounger woman tendencies the character would have made a lot more sense as an older woman with a past.

It was a pretty slow moving movie when I was expecting more suspense and action. Robin Williams did a great job in the part just to clarify. Once again it was just my view of the movie as a whole that I did not like. The overall plot was good and the storyline had a great theme but as I watched I just became more and more disappointed.

Who doesn't have whole sections of their lives that they would not want their family  or even strangers  to see? It is not a rant against corporate giants or anything like that. It's science fiction not documentary. It's a directorial debut which is all the more amazing. And the directorwriter is still under 30. The setting is deliberately dark like the subject matter but the director makes the decision to avoid futuristic trappings  nobody riding around in jet cars or wearing aluminumfoil suits  and that makes it even more accessible. Why wasn't it a hit? It probably wasn't promoted by its distributor. With only one major star Williams and few special effects it isn't the kind of thing that brings teenage boys to the cineplex.

Warning mayor spoilers ahead don't read this if you plan to watch the movieFirst of all there is the premise To be able to record memories of people so their lives can be stored after their deaths. This is what justifies the practice of these so called cutters and the counterargument that is voices that this is an invasion of privacy and that God alone is to see through the eyes of others. Well in fact there is more to it. In any ethical society these devices can never be implemented without consent of the carrier. The invasion of privacy is reason enough for this. We all have our secrets we don't need anyone to see especially after our deaths when we aren't around to defend ourselves against misinterpretation. Would in fact such technology ever be deviced and implemented there would have to be an exit option an option to have these devices removed. Instead in the movie it requires electromagnetic tattoos to disable these devices from further recording.This alone makes no sense. There being no agreement of consent of the carrier to be signed nor active tracking of carriers to make sure they are informed of their implant and sign an agreement after all which would have made the main characters situation quite the different one makes absolutely no sense if this technology were developed in a society of western ethics not saying other world ethics wouldn't dictate the same but this movie is all about the typical ethical dilemma's of the direction the western world is taking. Yet the plot revolves around exposing a scandal which should change the way we'd view such technology namely that the man behind the corporation owning the technology abused his daughter... ??? How cheap is that? Why not stick to the moral dilemma of the technology itself which would be way more interesting to explore. No instead they go for old fashion discredit to something that should incite moral outrage. That people are to be killed to get the evidence for this seems no obstacle. I could go on about this 'ethical' foundation but let's get to the next part.Which is the technology. Here you have recordings of half a million hours and they are edited by single individuals with occasionally an assistant? Even if we cut out 60 in sleeping hours and boredom they still have to go trough over 200.000 hours on their own? Impossible. Tasks like this you'd need huge teams for judging material on relevance doing research editing the thing together. Plus of course you'd need boards of privacy protection and whathaveyounot regulating information and clearance a vast system of security realising these regulations etc. The idea that a single person is doing this at home is absurd.And that makes one of the crucial points in the plot totally uncalled for which is where the girl takes a shot at the cutting system destroying the memory implant which the hoodlums are after and which will eventually get the main character killed. See it's already unimaginable that Alan Robin would be doing this job at home but even if we accept this under the notion that we do a lot of work at home too these days on our company laptops We have passwords on our laptops!! Here you have a computer system with the most sensitive information possible and there is not a single password needed to activate it? No key or pass that needs to be inserted? No single way of keeping out those without clearance?? How extremely unlikely once again.. Companies protect information far less sensitive than this. Of course would this device had been protected the girlfriend wouldn't have been able to view her exboyfriends memorycard what was it doing there anyway? Wasn't that guy dead already? Didn't the company have a storage room lacking digital indexing btw where they keep these cards in cardboard boxes so that they'd be exposed to the detrimental effects of the atmosphere?Another minor technical detail is the reading of memory of living people it can't be recorded... yet it can be viewed on a monitor... meaning there is a feed and any feed can be recorded.. what are we moviegoers taken for total retards? For a movie pretending to have this intellectual dilemma theme about it I find stuff like this quite the insult to our intelligence..All of this makes the whole movie feel like a cheap setup which it is for otherwise the plot couldn't have taken the turns it took and which totally destroys any credibility.The music was OK. The acting was mediocre. I liked the detail of Alan leaving the door open on purpose when interviewing the young girl the face tattoo's those antifolks walked around with looked OK and the way the movie was shot wasn't half bad either. But that's not enough. A movie like this needs a foundation that actually compels the mind and they should have worked with the ethical dilemmas the premise brought forth not turn it into the cheap generic thriller it actually became..".

	schema:reviewBody "God bless IFC. If it weren't for them I'd probably never have seen this splendid film and it is a very very good one. I'm going to have to start looking out for more Canadianmade features at this rate because their studios have shouldered their way to the forefront of the global film industry and The Final Cut is a great example of what I'm talking about.The Final Cut takes place in the indefinite future a time when modern technology has made it possible for those who can afford it to outfit their children before birth with a device the Ze Implant that creates a faithful total lifelong visual record of their lives to be retrieved after their death. The idea is to create a vivid tangible memorial of the deceased to be screened at funerals or even placed in handsomely mounted screens on tombstones.Other reviewers have had a problem with the oddly circumscribed nature of how memories can only be accessed after their death in The Final Cut but it's an essential part of this oddly touching haunting story. The limitations of the technique shape the story and define how its characters must cope with some very hard and unpleasant facts.Of course you don't pay extra money to let strangers walk through your memories unedited and an elite class of people exist to er clean up the raw footage. They're called Cutters and the late Robin Williams shines as the central Cutter in The Final Cut. I mean when's the last time this guy didn't shine? Toys? Mork and Mindy on bad days?.Surprisingly so does Jim Caviezel in a role much more demanding and complex than anything I've seen him tackle before not a twodimensional good guy for once. Playing Jesus Christ sure does mess with people's expectations of you  Peter O'Toole is the only actor I'm aware of who carried it off without damage to his career afterward albeit in a very skewed way in The Ruling Class. I am honestly impressed with the performance Caviezel put in for The Final Cut with its texture and depth very impressive for a supporting character in a movie that's only an hour and a half long.Mira Sorvino is also good playing a fellow Cutter  Cutters are an odd wonkish ilk it turns out and she manages to create a nothackneyed notstereotypical hacker character with warmth and verve. But the screenplay and directing done by Omar Naim are what make this film. It's better than any Philip K. Dick adaptation I've ever seen and the production values are also solid  the score beautiful foreboding haunting by turns stylish and wellsuited to the action the cinematography and other technical values spoton except for an isolated loss of audiovisual sync that really takes looking for someone else has commented on it here in the trivia section.And Naim gets it all done in an hour and a half. I'm sick and tired of directors who take an extra hour mainly showing us how skilled they are  it was a major failing of the Australian remake of On The Beach in 2000  and I am soooo glad that Mr. Naim has resisted the temptation. It only took him an hour and a half to totally make his name as far as I'm concerned with The Final Cut. It's a crisp professional corker of a sciencefiction thriller with very few slow places lots of twists and a plot that won't let you relax until five minutes after the end credits.I can't recommend this film highly enough.".

And for a while it looks like it might be heading in that direction which could have been VERY interesting. Instead as Robin Williams is starting to draw you in to the possibility of this conspiracy he gets sidetracked with some stupid guilt trip from his childhood.

	schema:reviewBody "FORMULA 17 17 Sui De Tian Kong Aspect ratio 1.851Sound format Dolby DigitalEvents conspire to frustrate the budding romance between a naive country boy Tony Yang searching for love in Taipei and a local stud Duncan Chow notorious for his sexual conquests.A smash hit in its native Taiwan this breezy romantic comedy was the inaugural production of Three Dots Entertainment an independent studio committed to the production of commercial genre movies and was directed by firsttimer Chen Yinjung aka DJ Chen a 23 year old graduate of Yuan Ze University. To her credit Chen tackles the film's subject matter headon and refuses to cut away when the two guys at the center of Rady Fu's oldfashioned screenplay finally  inevitably  get it on. Yang and Chow maintain a respectful distance from one another at first each afraid to make that crucial leap of faith until Yang finally turns up on Chow's doorstep and sighs Let's stop pretending it's tiring leading to the film's central sex scene a tasteful affair with lots of kissing and fumbling and raunchy good intentions. Much of the running time however is given over to various comic interludes involving Yang's newfound friends Jin Qin Dada Ji and Jimmy Yang a trio of outrageous queens who insist on making a melodrama out of the tiniest crisis. Unfortunately the comedy is forced and unfunny and a little too excessive at times but the central love story yields its fair share of tender rewards.As a vehicle for its ultrasexy leading men FORMULA 17 is hard to beat Yang and Chow the latter billed simply as 'Duncan' achieved teen idol status in popular Taiwanese TV dramas where they both played wholly conventional roles. Here Yang is a childlike innocent searching for True Love and Chow is a beautiful playboy whose reputation belies his own desperate search for emotional fulfilment. Standout scenes include a comic episode in which Jin and co. set up Yang with a hunky prostitute Yang Zhilong who turns up at Our Hero's apartment posing as a plumber in a scenario lifted wholesale from countless porn videos and an early sequence in which Yang and Chow bump into one another while standing at a busy crossroads where their hesitant overtures are kindled by an elderly gent standing alongside them who despairs of their reluctance to acknowledge a mutual attraction this scene has a very gay conclusion!. Chen allows the pace to slacken during dialogue exchanges the bulk of the movie! which takes some of the fizz out of proceedings but the film has a virtuous heart and builds to a joyous conclusion which  along with the cute guys and upfront sexuality  probably bolstered its commercial fortunes at the Taiwanese boxoffice. Productionwise Chen makes the most of her limited resources and she's wellserved by Chen Hueisheng's imaginative cinematography and Zack Gu's designerlabel art directioncostume design leading to the movie's biggest laugh when Yang pronounces 'Gucci' as 'juicy'!.NB. Amusingly or not depending on your point of view FORMULA 17 was banned in Singapore by the Films Appeals Committee for creating an illusion of a homosexual utopia where everyone including passersby is homosexual and no ills or problems are reflected... It conveys the message that homosexuality is normal and a natural progression in society! That same year Singaporean authorities finally allowed the broadcast of popular TV dramedy Sex and the City gave the goahead for a small number of bars to open 24 hours a day and partially legalized the sale and consumption of chewing gum...Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue".

To her credit Chen tackles the film's subject matter headon and refuses to cut away when the two guys at the center of Rady Fu's oldfashioned screenplay finally  inevitably  get it on. Yang and Chow maintain a respectful distance from one another at first each afraid to make that crucial leap of faith until Yang finally turns up on Chow's doorstep and sighs Let's stop pretending it's tiring leading to the film's central sex scene a tasteful affair with lots of kissing and fumbling and raunchy good intentions. Much of the running time however is given over to various comic interludes involving Yang's newfound friends Jin Qin Dada Ji and Jimmy Yang a trio of outrageous queens who insist on making a melodrama out of the tiniest crisis. Unfortunately the comedy is forced and unfunny and a little too excessive at times but the central love story yields its fair share of tender rewards.As a vehicle for its ultrasexy leading men FORMULA 17 is hard to beat Yang and Chow the latter billed simply as 'Duncan' achieved teen idol status in popular Taiwanese TV dramas where they both played wholly conventional roles. Here Yang is a childlike innocent searching for True Love and Chow is a beautiful playboy whose reputation belies his own desperate search for emotional fulfilment. Standout scenes include a comic episode in which Jin and co. set up Yang with a hunky prostitute Yang Zhilong who turns up at Our Hero's apartment posing as a plumber in a scenario lifted wholesale from countless porn videos and an early sequence in which Yang and Chow bump into one another while standing at a busy crossroads where their hesitant overtures are kindled by an elderly gent standing alongside them who despairs of their reluctance to acknowledge a mutual attraction this scene has a very gay conclusion!. Chen allows the pace to slacken during dialogue exchanges the bulk of the movie! which takes some of the fizz out of proceedings but the film has a virtuous heart and builds to a joyous conclusion which  along with the cute guys and upfront sexuality  probably bolstered its commercial fortunes at the Taiwanese boxoffice. Productionwise Chen makes the most of her limited resources and she's wellserved by Chen Hueisheng's imaginative cinematography and Zack Gu's designerlabel art directioncostume design leading to the movie's biggest laugh when Yang pronounces 'Gucci' as 'juicy'!.NB. Amusingly or not depending on your point of view FORMULA 17 was banned in Singapore by the Films Appeals Committee for creating an illusion of a homosexual utopia where everyone including passersby is homosexual and no ills or problems are reflected... It conveys the message that homosexuality is normal and a natural progression in society! That same year Singaporean authorities finally allowed the broadcast of popular TV dramedy Sex and the City gave the goahead for a small number of bars to open 24 hours a day and partially legalized the sale and consumption of chewing gum...Mandarin and Cantonese dialogue";

	schema:reviewBody "I think Formula 17 is excellent because it's an encouraging fair tale for homosexuals and even for people of all ranks. It's a fair tale of course firstly because the two leading roles are both handsome and attractive men just like the prince and the princess as it would have been in an ordinary fair tale such as Snow White or Cinderella. But the point is that it demonstrates the life of homosexuals not in a realistic but in a fabulous way. That's good actually in my opinion. So I'm shocked when I learn from other's comments that the Singaporean Government bans it for that reason. I don't like it if the film is labeled as a beautification of homosexuality or something similar. I think there's touching true love in gay and straight groups alike as is onenightstand. So this film is excellent in that it breaks the stereotype of homosexuals in a great number of movies made before. But this fair tale in addition to the handsome guys pretty settings and touching lines is also encouraging especially for homosexuals. We are not naive enough to believe that such true love as in the movie can fall upon us so easily as in the movie. But at least there's hope the hope for true love and the hope for future. And that's what really counts. That's the same for all fair tales. After reading or watching Snow White or Cinderella we may at first moved by the story and wish we could have the same beautiful life. But later especially when we've experienced more we know that we have to try our best to pursue our happiness. The same holds true for Formula 17 as we can see from some lines such as Love is only to be seen by the brave ones and Even love has the past tense...But we can run faster to catch up with it. As long as we still cherish hope and never give up we can certainly find our true love and happiness no matter if we are gay or straight.".

It's young it's innocent and it carries none of the angst that typifies so many gay films.I do think that some miss the trees for the forest in this film. It's more than just sex it speaks very much to friendshipthe characteristic nonsexual male bonding that appears throughout so much Chinese cinemathat rises above and beyond being gay or in love. This is a theme that is repeated throughout the film and shows itself in everything from Yu's immediate acceptance that Tien will of course be staying with him to each boy's attempt to comfort Yu in his breakup with what they understood best CC with gossip Alan with his weights and Tien Tsai with his idealismit continues in Tien's immediate declination of Richard's initial offer to him because my buddy's heartbroken I'm going home..and through to and especially Jun and Richard.There is a scene in the movie in which Tien runs into Bai and Jun on the elevator watch who Jun watches then watch as both he and Tien reach for the button panel at the same time and the metaphor is all too clear. Yet throughout the film Jun's unspoken feelings for Richard are kept suppressed by him even to the point of giving Richard up when he realizes that the latter really does love Tien Tsai. Those feelings reveal themselves however in the elevator scene and in the twisted smile he gives Richard three times first when he comes upon Richard and TienTsai in the shower together second when Richard is unable to kiss him and third when he asks Richard the for him fateful question Do you want to see him again? and Richard's answer You know I do. The guy who plays Richard doesn't get enough credit for carrying his part so well.Finally while I would agree with Natalie above that Duncan Chow turns in some very good scenesthose in which he is interacting directly with Tien...the two really did have wonderful chemistry together...their scene on top of the building at night was really nice...and yes the countdown scene was sweet as hell...the heart of the show is Tony Yang as Tien. He comes across exactly as he should a sweet kid who is shocked that his internet paramour doesn't want to know him just do him...shy yet heated up by a sexy man he sees displaying interest in him...unsure of himself in dealing with Richard urgent in his first kiss and the morning after scene where he is just remembering the night and exploring Richard's bedroom can't help but bring back memories to any guy who's ever felt those emotions. I think it was that scene which won him the Newcomer's Award...gay or straight you'd have to be a statue to be untouched by the clarity of what he projected at that moment.Even the music is perfect for this film...I don't understand a word of Chinese but it doesn't take much to understand what's going on...Rock Bang is the theme song for Tien Tsai there's a really beautiful set of guitar chords that speak to Richard and Jun's relationship there's a sad song the notes of which speak more to lost love than the words ever could...it was just really all very well matched.Just a nice film to enjoy for lighthearted fun. As one reviewer noted if the melodramatic conclusion doesn't leave you with a silly smile on your face it's probably because you're not human. We all need silly smiles now and then. This film delivers.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Shi qi sui de tian kong' FORMULA 17 is a very fine first venture into film making by two young Taiwanese women  Yinjung Chen director and Rady Fu screenwriter  who are unafraid to take on a taboo subject in Taiwan and find some excellent talent and ideas that suggest that there will be more films from them in the future. Though the central theme and two characters of the story are excellent the movie drifts into wideeyed burlesque with its supporting cast and thus the six rating instead of eight.Tien Tony Yang is a naive seventeenyearold from the provinces who comes to Taipei to live with his old friend Yu Chin King a bartender in a gay bar for a summer. Tien is gay a virgin and intends to stay a virgin until he is in a meaningful love relationship. Yu is suffering from a relationship that is tainted by distance but he sees the need to introduce Tien into the active gay life in Taipei  and to put an end to Tien's virginity. Together with Yu's friends way over the top flamboyant kids Tien is introduced to gay bars is set up with hunks but he holds to his values  until he eyes 30yearold playboy Bai Tiehnan Duncan Lai a lothario famous for his one night stands. We gradually learn that Bai is a sensitive hunk with issues who is afraid to fall in love hence his one night stand rule. The story at the core of this film is how the two ultimately fulfill each others' ideals and needs.Much of the film dawdles in stereotypical situations and poorly acted and directed excursions into the bar scenes but the work of Duncan Lai and Tony Yang makes the film credible and well worth watching both men are handsome talented actors who develop a fine screen chemistry. For all its weak points FORMULA 17 is a film with a big heart and a gay film that manages to deal with some important issues of fidelity and honesty instead of focusing on merely the superficial. In Mandarin Cantonese English with subtitles. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "'Shi qi sui de tian kong' FORMULA 17 is a very fine first venture into film making by two young Taiwanese women  Yinjung Chen director and Rady Fu screenwriter  who are unafraid to take on a taboo subject in Taiwan and find some excellent talent and ideas that suggest that there will be more films from them in the future. Though the central theme and two characters of the story are excellent the movie drifts into wideeyed burlesque with its supporting cast and thus the six rating instead of eight.Tien Tony Yang is a naive seventeenyearold from the provinces who comes to Taipei to live with his old friend Yu Chin King a bartender in a gay bar for a summer. Tien is gay a virgin and intends to stay a virgin until he is in a meaningful love relationship. Yu is suffering from a relationship that is tainted by distance but he sees the need to introduce Tien into the active gay life in Taipei  and to put an end to Tien's virginity. Together with Yu's friends way over the top flamboyant kids Tien is introduced to gay bars is set up with hunks but he holds to his values  until he eyes 30yearold playboy Bai Tiehnan Duncan Lai a lothario famous for his one night stands. We gradually learn that Bai is a sensitive hunk with issues who is afraid to fall in love hence his one night stand rule. The story at the core of this film is how the two ultimately fulfill each others' ideals and needs.Much of the film dawdles in stereotypical situations and poorly acted and directed excursions into the bar scenes but the work of Duncan Lai and Tony Yang makes the film credible and well worth watching both men are handsome talented actors who develop a fine screen chemistry. For all its weak points FORMULA 17 is a film with a big heart and a gay film that manages to deal with some important issues of fidelity and honesty instead of focusing on merely the superficial. In Mandarin Cantonese English with subtitles. Grady Harp";

This is nothing unique to the Asian gay dramas just think of Brokeback Mountain. But I have seen a few too many films that end in death and general misery where the conclusion seems to be that being gay is just pain suffering and misery. Perhaps this is a realistic description in some of the more conservative Asian societies but if suicide is the only way out for the protagonist of the film then that is a bad film in my opinion.Formula 17 is a much more hopeful film. The protagonists have their struggles and problems to deal with. However these problems are in good sense more everyday. The characters cover a wide and not too subtle spectrum of being gay and the story is both fun and cute. Yes it is a bit sugar coated but why not? Also the film offers some nice photo of Taiwan. After I saw this film I wanted to go there.Highly recommended especially if you want to see a good Asian gay drama with more fun and less depression.".

Even though the plot is not so well made but the story line is really good looks exactly same like yaoi gay manga comic from Japan.The story was about a country boy who came to Taipei after did his final exams in Taipei he met friends and fell in love with no. 1 gay playboy Duncan in town. Duncan also liked him so they end up having one night stand but Duncan left him without any real explanation and made him broken heart. Soon after Duncan realized that he loved this country boy and tried to find him. Anyway it's a happy ending film beside it's a comedy which makes me really like this movie.Yeah the plot is not as strong as France movie but this movie kinds of sweet and pure and the soundtracks also nice.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to read yaoi manga see gay's movies or just want to see something good.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the title itself states 'Formula 17' does follow a formula that has been done many a time wide eyes romantic virgin with fanciful ideas of true love meets jaded playboy. This is the gay version of that older than old staple of romance comedy. But there is enough in this production to keep it fresh and interesting. First of all the awkwardness between the leads is very genuine. The acting is very good all around but secondary characters are of course either zany and over the top or of the straight man kind a requirement that seems even more present in homosexual themed films. This leaves only the main couple to truly shine in terms of acting. Their awkward interaction gives a hint of realism in a whacky comedy.The parody element is important in that it pokes fun at gay clichs with gusto with narrated flashbacks staged as theater pieces and light heartedly making fun of being overly emotional. Jokes around lack of communication between Mandarin and Cantonese speakers will probably go over the head of most Western or even nonChinese viewers but they keep the comedy from being too one note. Some nuances are introduced in the general outline of the movie since the jaded man is undergoing therapy to cure himself of his Don Juan ways. Not that this is at all taken seriously. Even when the story plods into its mandatory crisis two thirds into it there is never a feeling that anything is at all in jeopardy.It ends as the viewer expected it too from the every first frame. The conclusion may be a bit too neat and there is something horribly distracting about the soundtrack especially during intimate scenes. This movie has a certain amateur aura to it but that ends up being its greatest selling points. Shot in a fresh way and with plenty of color across the screen 'Formula 17' cannot help being formulaic but it is a worthy effort for all that.".

I have watched many films and TV shows that are high brow or pretend to be and it is often a bunch of incomprehensible nonsense parading as complicated art. This film was made at a time when Gay films without sad endings were rare. The only thing that was kind of silly was the part where two characters were lovesick and they were actually physically sick.This movie has it all  beautiful scenery of the city the parks Shalung beach. Handsome guys lots of comedy and romance. I loved all the characters  Yu CC Richard Jay Ray Tapei Plumber Alan. I think as a supporting player Jason Chang as Richard didn't get enough credit. There were a number of cultural things I didn't understand  Tien's friends spraying what? on Bai  Richard when they returned from the business trip. The tongue movement at the store in the ending credits. Fantastic music as well. This is a light hearted happy ending comedy that if you are Gay or even if not you will enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a little bit hard to put your finger on this show which is a mixture of comedy romance and gay sex  there is a lot of emphasis on sex. Also it's one of those films in which everyone is homosexual and loving it. There is no struggle with sexuality in any of the characters  although that's really not the point of this movie. In all honesty the fact that the cast is gay has no impact on the plot whatsoever. It could have been a straight story and I would have been none the wiser. Of course I probably wouldn't have watched it either had that been the case.There were a few things that really suckered me into enjoying this film though. Firstly the chemistry between the leading men sparks fly between Tieh Nan and Tian Cai from the minute they see each other oh they really really do!. For some reason they worked very well together going from adorable bashfulness to familiarity to blissful contentment with incredible feeling. Also the buildup towards their sex scene with the hesitance and the fumbling hands? One of the best most believably sexy moments I've ever watched on screen another that came close was between Diego Luna and Romola Garai in Dirty Dancing Havana Nights the transition from languid touches to frantic desperate need was so excellently done I can feel tingles down my spine just thinking about it.Another thing I liked about the movie is that they had exaggerated comic relief a typical characteristic of most Chinese films but that it somehow for most of it wasn't too outrageous. I actually enjoyed it. Wen Yu CC  Alan are aside from Tian Cai's protectors and sex gurus the comic relief of the show and they pull off their parts with justified aplomb.On top of that I thoroughly relished the way the movie incorporated the difficulties of being in a relationship and dealing with the aftermath of a breakup. The barrier of language in Wen Yu and his Caucasian boyfriend's relationship was used very well and the contrast in his and Tian Cai's behavior after their breakups one wallowing while the other channeled all his pain into anger was a delight to watch.Finally Bai Tieh Nan which is where I indulge myself in a little bit of what some might consider biased rambling. You see although he's not the typical swoonworthy boy his acting is so wonderfully crafted that there are quite a few scenes I rewound and replayed over and over again just to stare in amazement at his incredibly spoton expressions. Naturally this doesn't hold up through the entire film. His visits to his psychiatrist are too exaggerated his attempts at callousness in his flashbacks are pathetic and they should never use the slowmo wind blowing his hair as he walks into a room with absolutely no wind around angle on him. He's not traditionally handsome enough to pull it off. But boy does he have aura. I could go on and on because he is that good and he has several scenes in the movie that are ovarybursting worthy. Near the close of the film he prays for a sign any sign to show him where Tian Cai has gone and says that if after he counts from one to ten his sign doesn't appear he'll give up. It is possibly the most emotional countdown I've ever heard.Now this movie is not without its downside. I could have done without the lengthy somewhat pointless intro. There was absolutely no use in Tian Cai's dream about jumping into a pool at the start of the movie and then getting kissed by Tieh Nan while his voiceover went on and on about trigonometry. It bore no further significance either even at the end where it becomes apparent that Tian Cai has this recurring dream quite often in which he asks several different questions that Tieh Nan now has the answers to. If that was supposed to show me that Tieh Nan was quite literally the man of Tian Cai's dreams it was a pathetic attempt. The lucky condom that Wen Yu gave Tian Cai was another useless plot point. One of my pet peeves is when these little details are brought to attention only to be neglected at the end of the film.Formula 17 is a difficult movie to sit through even with its occasional flashes of brilliance. It's only worth it when you realize the wonder that is Bai Tieh Nan. He almost singlehandedly saves the show. Steals it really though with the acting that Tian Cai couldn't do it isn't hard to see why.".

	schema:reviewBody "This story about a naive 17yearold coming to the city looking for love just doesn't ring true. Well true enough anyway. In his apartment or dorm room at the beginning of the movie there's a poster on the wall for the film Happy Together. Let me warn youif you admired the gritty realism film style and eyeswideopen antiromance of that film Formula 17 is its polar opposite.And in more ways than one. That the virginal student Tien even knows about Happy Togethermuch less admires it enough to display the posteris completely incongruous with his character. Tien's best friend with whom he bunks in the city is a comic character that probably doesn't translate accurately. I can well imagine Taiwanese audiences finding his high queen low comedy hilarious. But I felt I was not only missing language subtleties some cultural subtleties must have eluded me too. I found very little of his shtick humorous or entertaining. The same goes for the roommate's two friends also intended to be comic. Not for me.The actor who plays the antihero Bai seems to be acting in another movie altogethermaybe an Ang Lee drama or maybe even Happy Together. His gravitas is a couple of notches above what is necessary for this bit of fluff.Toward the end of the movie Tien's three pals confront Bai. At one point one of them insists that he speak Mandarin. It was at that moment that I felt I'd been completely missing an entire dimension of the movie something that had to do with cultural and language differences between the characters. Similarly there are a number of dialogfree scenes that are underscored with untranslated Chinese pop songs. Again I felt I was probably missing something.I agree this film has it's heart in the right place. The production is clearly lowbudget but that isn't detracting. The storyline is not very original but that's not detracting either really. What was a major minus for me though was the feeling that as a nonChinese speaker I was missing more than half of what was going on.There isn't much to this movie. But what little is there almost certainly depends upon a thorough understanding of the language and culture to appreciate fully. Without that understanding you're watching a bit of fluff that will strike you as seriously deficient in content and quality. And that may not be entirely true.".

	schema:headline " A decent spy yarn but falls far short of the true story";
	schema:reviewBody "A couple of years ago PBS aired a 2hour episode of Nova the American equivalent of the BBC's Horizon called 'Decoding Nazi Secrets.' It was a fascinating documentary about the work done at Bletchley Park as well as some material about its American counterpart Arlington Hall. I had wished it was even longer for I suspected that what was left out was as interesting as what was included. Among the many memorable characters in the story none stood out more than Alan Turing a painfully shy socially awkward utterly brilliant genius. I found myself wishing that someone would make a theatrical film about the Enigma code and a film of Alan Turing's life or both.Unfortunately this isn't it. In March of 1943 codebreakers at Bletchley Park discover to their horror that the German navy has changed the code sets used to communicate with Uboats at sea. These were based on the famous and diabolically complex encryption machine known as the Enigma. Authorities enlist the help of a brilliant young man named Tom Jericho played by Dougray Scott to help them break the code again. The possibility of a spy within the British codebreakers' ranks is raised and Tom's love interest Claire Saffron Burrows has disappeared. To solve these mysteries Tom recruits Claire's best friend Hester Wallace Kate Winslet. While investigating Claire's personal life the pair discovers personal and international betrayals involving the nowinfamous Katyn massacre in Poland. Of course Tom and Hester fall in love.Dougray Scott actually does bear some physical resemblance to Alan Turing but there the comparison ends. Turing's sorry shabby reward for the instrumental role he played in winning the war for Britain was to be persecuted during the Cold War because his homosexuality was viewed as a security risk to the point that he committed suicide. While 'Enigma' looks good and plays fairly well as a decent espionage film the viewer who knows the factual background of this piece of fiction will probably be disappointed. The best part for me was the recreation of the physical setting at wartime Bletchley Park especially the Enigma machines themselves and the famous Bombes which were invented by Turing Jericho in the film. These were among the world's first computing machines they were a stroke of brilliance by Turing Instead of looking for what a coded message WAS they operated according to the principle of eliminating what it was NOT. This cut the number of possibilities by better than 90 and greatly simplified the work of the human codebreakers. It is somewhat surprising that this rather wan film is the work of Tom Stoppard and Michael Apted they have done better.".

I mean I have never had the chance to see how this enigma machines really worked so I really appreciated the fact that it was shown so well in this movie. What I also liked in this movie was the love story that certainly wasn't too corny or overwhelming. It was an interesting part of the story that never bothered me it just made the movie even better. As I already said this may not be the kind of war movie for the masses but I liked it and that's why I give it at least a 7.510 perhaps even an 810.".

	schema:headline " I must like this or I wouldn't own a DVD copy.";
	schema:reviewBody "I first viewed this film the way its makers would want me to  on the big screen and with friends. It commanded my attention and concentration which I believe is the way good movies should. The postviewing dinner and analysis made me want to go back and see it again in spite of the fact I thought my absorption was total. In the event I waited until I was able to rent then purchase the DVD. So my opinion is based on multiple viewings which says much about the complexity and detail ENIGMA provides.I am not surprised to read comments from others who believe it was too complex after just one viewing. But I am surprised by the diversity of opinion of its direction acting scripting design and cinematography  all of which I found to be of the highest standard.This is one of those rare films that does not require an audience to suspend disbelief. It is primarily factbased and while like most factbased movies some events are concatenated characters combined or dramatized the presentation oozes credibility. Is it entertaining? Absolutely. Do the romantic plots and themes detract? Not at all. Is the codebreaking boring? No but like most who viewed it with some knowledge of the German encryption machine from which the movie takes its title it may have left stuff out that would be nice to know about. Other reviewers have referenced web sites and publications that contain the detail and I have sourced material that has satisfied my curiosity.It is not a documentary in spite of the fact that director Apted is an eminent documentary maker. It is a human drama set amongst the surreal environment of the codebreaking complex of Bletchley Park. I can't comment on how faithful Stoppard's screenplay is to Harris' book not having read it. And it is specious for anyone to make comparisons in any case.Does the film downplay the Polish contribution to the Ultra activities? I don't think so. They captured an early 3rotor Enigma machine and copied it and successfully cracked the codes then in use. What the English operatives captured was the later 3rotor machine with the front patch panel which was a quantum leap ahead of the prewar machines. Turing and his associates then created the 'bombes'  reproduced in exquisite detail for the movie with assistance of the curator of the Bletchley Park Museum. Incidentally Britain built a number of these bombes for US intelligence which the US still have. But that's the sort of detail that is not essential to the execution of the plot or the enjoyment of its portrayal.I have now enjoyed viewing ENIGMA so often I have lost count. And it has done nothing but whet my appetite for further while less frequent viewings. I can add nothing to the erudite comments of the more discerning reviewers regarding the performances of Scott Winslett Northam Burrows and their superb supporting cast members.

	onyx:emotionText "I first viewed this film the way its makers would want me to  on the big screen and with friends. It commanded my attention and concentration which I believe is the way good movies should. The postviewing dinner and analysis made me want to go back and see it again in spite of the fact I thought my absorption was total. In the event I waited until I was able to rent then purchase the DVD. So my opinion is based on multiple viewings which says much about the complexity and detail ENIGMA provides.I am not surprised to read comments from others who believe it was too complex after just one viewing. But I am surprised by the diversity of opinion of its direction acting scripting design and cinematography  all of which I found to be of the highest standard.This is one of those rare films that does not require an audience to suspend disbelief. It is primarily factbased and while like most factbased movies some events are concatenated characters combined or dramatized the presentation oozes credibility. Is it entertaining? Absolutely. Do the romantic plots and themes detract? Not at all. Is the codebreaking boring? No but like most who viewed it with some knowledge of the German encryption machine from which the movie takes its title it may have left stuff out that would be nice to know about. Other reviewers have referenced web sites and publications that contain the detail and I have sourced material that has satisfied my curiosity.It is not a documentary in spite of the fact that director Apted is an eminent documentary maker. It is a human drama set amongst the surreal environment of the codebreaking complex of Bletchley Park. I can't comment on how faithful Stoppard's screenplay is to Harris' book not having read it. And it is specious for anyone to make comparisons in any case.Does the film downplay the Polish contribution to the Ultra activities? I don't think so. They captured an early 3rotor Enigma machine and copied it and successfully cracked the codes then in use. What the English operatives captured was the later 3rotor machine with the front patch panel which was a quantum leap ahead of the prewar machines. Turing and his associates then created the 'bombes'  reproduced in exquisite detail for the movie with assistance of the curator of the Bletchley Park Museum. Incidentally Britain built a number of these bombes for US intelligence which the US still have. But that's the sort of detail that is not essential to the execution of the plot or the enjoyment of its portrayal.I have now enjoyed viewing ENIGMA so often I have lost count. And it has done nothing but whet my appetite for further while less frequent viewings. I can add nothing to the erudite comments of the more discerning reviewers regarding the performances of Scott Winslett Northam Burrows and their superb supporting cast members. They have crafted one of the finest wartime movies I have had the pleasure to experience. An absorbing and fascinating movie.

	schema:headline " Cracking codes contains spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not a documentary. Or a docudrama. Or a war movie. Or a romance. It is a movie about codebreaking about solving mysteries  every single character is involved in that activity in some way or other.Jericho and the other codebreakers obviously are trying to break the German secret code. Jericho is also involved in a private quest to solve the mystery of his exlover Claire who has disappeared. In this he is joined by Claire's friend Hester. Meanwhile Wigram is trying to figure out who has been leaking information from Bletchley Park to the Germans  also a codebreaking activity in a way but on a psychological rather than a mathematical level. And Puck has all along been trying to solve the mystery of what happened to his younger brother.These three main storylines eventually build up to a climax  the night of the battle when the codebreakers at Bletchley are frantically striving to find their way back into the German Uboat code before their fleet gets attacked while Hester is fighting a  lonely battle in her cottage uncoding the messages that Claire stole hoping that they will offer a clue to where she is.But the real mystery lies not in numbers but in human emotions and relationships. Jericho is hot on the trail of the real traitor only to find that Wigram is always one step ahead of him. But in the end it turns out that even Wigram has a secret to hide  or perhaps it could be said that for all his proficiency at reading people's deepest secrets the one person that Wigram failed to read was himself  which makes him somewhat of a tragical character really.The acting in this movie is superb  Dougray Scott and Kate Winslet both do a fantastic job and so does everyone else down to the smallest parts. One of my favorite bits is a small cameo of one of the women employed in taking down the morse code without ever knowing what any of this is about asking Jericho if what they are doing is at all important  brings me to tears.The most outstanding performance in my opinion comes from Jeremy Northam as the ultrasmooth and ultimately tainted spy chief Wigram  not a pleasant character at all although he can't be said to be evil but Northam manages to imbue this character with so much hidden pain that I find myself relating to him more than any of the more obvious characters.Wigram is a voyeur  he very obviously gets a kick out of spying out other people's most private moments. Witness the scene in Jericho's bedroom where Wigram basically gets his kicks from making Jericho relate his relationship with Claire  someone that as we learn later Wigram has a much more personal interest in than we at first would assume. Or study the series of face expressions when Wigram is preparing and then watching the bombing of the German UBoot that comes to pick up Puck  from utter voyeuristic fascination with the prospect to the horrible moment of what have I done when the bomb has gone off.  I do not know if any of that is in the original book or in Stoppard's screenplay or if it is Apted's direction but it sure does take an extremely intelligent actor to embue a character that could easily have become a clichee and unfortunately the costume doesn't help! with so many subtleties and layers of emotion that he turns into the most interesting character study in the entire plot.The movie does improve on repeated viewings as there is a certain amount of plot overload going on that one has to find one's way through. But hey  it's a movie about code breaking isn't it?".

	schema:headline " Repeat after me Tom Jericho is not supposed to be Alan Turing...";
	schema:reviewBody "Some mild spoilers follow...Enigma was a film destined to upset some people.  Those who didn't read the book would moan that the Brits were trying to take all the glory away from the Poles glory and war...how terribly 19th century... and that Turing was replaced with Jericho because Turing was gay.  Those who had read the book would complain about all the layering and depth that was sliced off the plot in order to pander to a supposedly intellectually impaired audience. Both camps are of course missing the point.The film is a fictional tale of intrigue set against a backdrop of momentous historical events.  The Enigma of the title refers not only to the German code but also to several of the characters. Claire Rommily is an Enigma that Jericho fails to break until the very end of the film Puck is an Enigma made all the more unbreakable by the fact that noone recognises him as such.  Jericho too is an Enigma even to the audience who is privy to some of his inner thoughts as he hides as much as he discloses and is capable of more than appearances suggest.So the story is as much about the codes that people use with each other in everyday life as it is about military codebreaking.  Which is not to say that the use of Bletchley Park as a frame for the story is arbitrary the two kinds of code breaking are bound up in each other and that is the art of the piece.  The artfulness of the film must be accepted before any kind of criticism is undertaken.The historical criticisms that are nevertheless levelled at Enigma seem churlish to say the least.  Firstly the Poles are an integral part of the plot and in the book significant time is given over to their crucial part in the very existence of Bletchley.  That this aspect is less apparent in the film has more to do with the limits of the medium than any British propaganda Fasson and Grazier's role is similarly pared down to a mere line.  As for Jericho as a sanitised form of Turing such criticisms show a level of historical ignorance in the critic that is thankfully never shared by the filmmakers.  Turing was in a far more senior technical position than Jericho and in the book it is made clear that Jericho is one of Turing's students from Cambridge.  Anyone wanting a film all about Turing should get hold of the excellent Breaking The Code starring Derek Jacobi.What is important about the history in Enigma is that it never alters anything that really happened merely weaves it's plot within the established facts.  Unlike say Pearl Harbour...Of course there are other potential problems with the film but they rest pretty much exclusively within the purview of personal taste.  It isn't a fastpaced actioner at no point does Dougray Scott battle Tom Cruise on a pair of powerful motorbikes but then Marmite doesn't taste of chocolate yet I like them both the same.  Some concessions to the visual nature of films are made the reframed ending being an obvious example but readers of the book should either accept these changes or stop watching films altogether.Whilst slow paced at times Enigma remains intellectually stimulating and the plot never seems to drag or become bloated.  As an example of a wellmade intriguing and dare I say it entertaining film this is one for the DVD collection.".

Kate Winslet is one of our finest actors who knows how to play multiple layers simultaneously and who also understands how to cross time shifts.Northam is less brilliant but has been snappy with some Wilde material that plays with text. Saffron is queen of the musky images. The story is even minus Alan Turing one of the richest in all the history of the world in terms of the thing and the representation of the thing.What went wrong?In fact the script is great. The problem is Apted who is oblivious to the possibilities for manifolding studded into the script. Watch Kate struggle with an inept bureaucracy of the film while she does the same in character. Watch as they both the Bletchley and Jagger crowds make provision for genius without understanding it.I am into pairing films for viewing. This one goes with A Bridge Too Far' in terms of the poles of British competence in the War.Despite the clumsy filmmaking and the thuggish score and the laconic editing this is still worth seeing.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers herein.Gosh I waited for this eagerly. Tom Stoppard is the best screenwriting weaver of selfreferential work. Kate Winslet is one of our finest actors who knows how to play multiple layers simultaneously and who also understands how to cross time shifts.Northam is less brilliant but has been snappy with some Wilde material that plays with text. Saffron is queen of the musky images. The story is even minus Alan Turing one of the richest in all the history of the world in terms of the thing and the representation of the thing.What went wrong?In fact the script is great. The problem is Apted who is oblivious to the possibilities for manifolding studded into the script. Watch Kate struggle with an inept bureaucracy of the film while she does the same in character. Watch as they both the Bletchley and Jagger crowds make provision for genius without understanding it.I am into pairing films for viewing. This one goes with A Bridge Too Far' in terms of the poles of British competence in the War.Despite the clumsy filmmaking and the thuggish score and the laconic editing this is still worth seeing. But you must decode it to see the gem of a film that is hidden in there.My one fault with the decoded film is that it lacks a visual mapping of the mathematicalgeometric vision some of these guys had.

He was the undisputed leader of the team that took the initial Polish work to break the Enigma Code broke subsequent variations such as for the naval Enigma machines and automated the whole thing by creating one of the world's first computers called BOMBE. His work thus directly brought World War II to an early end and saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the process. He was also the founder of modern day computers and artificial intelligence just Google 'Turing Test'. Why create a fictional story? In telling the story truthfully they would have to touch on the fact that Alan Turing was gay. In 1952 he was arrested for being gay was chemically castrated and had all security clearance stripped. He committed suicide in 1954. Was it so unpalatable to tell the truth that the main character in this story was gay as were thousands of soldiers who fought in WWII? I think that story is more compelling. Are we so sanitized that he had to be replaced with a team of straight matine idols? Alan Turing was one of the most important figures of the 20th century and one of the most slighted. I wish someone would make a decent movie telling his story.

	schema:reviewBody "For what it's worth I had rather enjoyed the first Kevin Chu  Jay Chou cinematic collaboration in Kung Fu Dunk. Thinking that their follow up film in The Treasure Hunter would be somewhere along the same vein despite the obvious lifts from films such as Indiana Jones The Mummy franchise and just about every desert based Hollywood film out there I'd had rather they really go all out to copy those elements outright than to come up with this half baked film doomed with a nonsensical story plagued with bad acting throughout.I suppose the pairing of two of the hottest Taiwanese celebrities in Jay Chou and Lin Chiling after her maiden outing in John Woo's Red Cliff would be a no brainer except that the attempt here is pretty much lame oh how I hate to use this word since a supposed romance turned out to be worse than the indecisive ones faced by the lovebirds from Twilight. Here there is absolutely zero chemistry between the leads in a romance that's plagued by a courtship full of crap dialogue that will make you foam in the mouth and a love that's so cloy and coy that it'll make Bella and Edward look like they actually know what they're doing.Lin Chiling had admitted that her character Lan Ting was done in a chaste manner so as not to ire Jay Chou's female fans but I thought that is only an excuse since the film had only one cheesy seduction scene to boast of and even that came across as quite amateurish. Then again perhaps this is not a romance film but one steeped in action and adventure since Jay Chou's character has a stylish name in Qiao Fei some incredible powers a couple of notches up against Indiana Jones and with a morally upright calling in life to return all antiques to their rightful place?Wrong on that count as well. In fact this is more of an unintentional comedy with some really bad villains who pop up now and then just to satisfy their sadomasochistic tendencies in having their arses kicked by Qiao Fei. There's a mummy man who looked as if he stepped out of a toilet wrapped from head to toe with toilet paper that just won't run out a ghoul and a gang leader decked out in armour which were nothing more than sideshow villains and a group of common thugs termed the Sandstorm Legion ooh who decided their outing should involve pulling down the structure of the only bar in the middle of nowhere. Or how about the mysterious desert eagle who's supposed to be the messiah and guardian of all things surrounded by sand dunes?The entire film is one big schizophrenic affair in not knowing what it wants to do with itself other than to milk the money off fans of Jay Chou and Lin Chiling if she has any to begin with. Characters are tossed around with zero motivation or purpose being in the film for the sake of. There's absolutely no plot here other than everyone trying to get their hands on a treasure map first then to follow the markings to some mysterious area as marked out for the promise of treasure. Yawn.And in between there's Chen Daoming and Eric Tsang allowed in the film to switch between Cantonese and Mandarin with the former being a poser and the latter being the loud mouth complementing each other as a duo out on their last adventure one having plenty of emo moments to reflect upon which is uninteresting to begin with. For the most parts they look like a lost duo roaming around waiting to pass time contributing to the ensemble of wandering mindless characters talking rubbish given the nonsensical plot. Then again having 5 writers contributing succumbed to the adage of having too many cooks and one wonders if all had been smoking something to write something so comical as this film.If there are those who are still holding on to slivers of hope that Kevin Chu can still make a decent film this one will pulp all that to the ground pronto. The film's all over the place with laughable action sequences. Clearly he has some fantasies about the good old dynamite sticks which can blow up like cluster bombs or got too engrossed in the special effects that hmm what's the point of it all again?There's one thing this film confirms though it's that Jay Chou cannot act and his game is up  he's a oneexpression chap made to look good thanks to wirefu stunts. That however does not bode well for his Hollywood stint as Kato since he has huge shoes to fill in that of Bruce Lee's. I hope for the sake of The Green Hornet that he would have done miles better than this terribly dismal effort clearly made just to milk off his popularity and the festive period.One of the worst movies this year and definitely not something that you'd want to ruin your start to 2010 with. Avoid at all costs even the DVD.".

I did not really enjoy Kung Fu Dunk and I was disappointed at how some great ideas turned into a rushed plot movie. So after reading the horrible reviews of The Treasure Hunter I lowered my expectations. I didn't catch it in cinema due to the reviews and instead I waited for the DVD which surprisingly came out quite fast. I rented it and prepared for the worst. But it turned out to be actually cheesy fun.The story Those who bluntly said that this is a ripoff of The Mummy and others are right. The director took the popular adventure movies and spun a story on his own which turns out not to be original. Though not original I was still entertained by cheesy fight scenes and actionpacked story. Now the story is nothing much to mention and time of the story is weird. First they are in the dessert and another scene shows them in a modern city. Unless they are jumpers it is impossible but in a story. The story is a bit jumbled but the action covers it. The action some are a bit sloppy is not great by any means but it is entertaining. The acting is not that good. Jay Chou I don't even know how he got into the movie with his one and only expression. Chiling Lin the female main character is a disappointment. Her acting is not bad in Red Cliff. But now she creates some laughable expressions.Overall It is not a great movie even for a Chinese movie but it serves its purpose to entertain. A lot of people hate this and call it the worst movie of 2009 but I don't think so. I enjoyed this better than Kung Fu Dunk the movie where ideas become rushed and into junk.".

	schema:reviewBody "After 40 minutes watching it patiently searching for understandable linesI had to turn it off in HUGE disappointment because my patience is limited. Indeed I WAS a fan of Jay Chou but recently he has let me down by both his singing and acting career. The movie Bu neng shou de mi mi made a good impression on me while Chou' latest movie is just a piece of crap!I really feel sorry for Chou's fans and exfans who put their trust in this unbearable movie. I could not understand how Jay Chou would acted as badly as he did in this movie. His appearance which made him look like a 40yearold miserable man was extremely ridiculous but it helped in some way 'cuz Chi Ling is 5 year older than him! Can anyone who has watched this film find the 2 main characters played by Chou and Chi Lingfeel for each others? Besides the action scenes were pompous with nothing worth seeing.

Indeed I WAS a fan of Jay Chou but recently he has let me down by both his singing and acting career. The movie Bu neng shou de mi mi made a good impression on me while Chou' latest movie is just a piece of crap!I really feel sorry for Chou's fans and exfans who put their trust in this unbearable movie. I could not understand how Jay Chou would acted as badly as he did in this movie. His appearance which made him look like a 40yearold miserable man was extremely ridiculous but it helped in some way 'cuz Chi Ling is 5 year older than him! Can anyone who has watched this film find the 2 main characters played by Chou and Chi Lingfeel for each others? Besides the action scenes were pompous with nothing worth seeing.

I wondered why so I searched on IMDb most comments are mixed but I reckoned I should give the movie a watch but couldn't get hold of the DVD until now. Only then did I know why it never made it to the box office nor even near any cinemas in certain countries.Let's face it  we go to the cinemas to forget our problems and not be reminded of them which is precisely the reason why movies like these don't make any money but others do. Most movies about injustice and persecution always have the good guys win in the end but this movie doesn't. In fact we're introduced to the startling reality of the lives of volunteer workers and what they have to go through with all their good intentions in place. We are also introduced andor reminded of the ugly side of humanity as to why certain countries will never be able to have peace because people are just too selfish fighting out their own agendas to spare any thought for another person.Clive Owen was superb in this movie and whilst I would've liked to see him paired up with CatherineZeta Jones the original choice for the female lead Angelina Jolie was pretty decent as well. It could've been worst coz the behindthescenes commentary said their original male lead was Kevin Costner. No offence but I don't think he would've pulled it off. He's too 'The Bodyguard' if you know what I mean. The love story is just a subplot and was so subtly done and there are no mushy loveydovey sequences to make your eyes roll. It's just a simple story about two people bonded by their common passion but whilst one chooses to act it out wholeheartedly the other keeps a silent but burning fire for it. Now that's love! One commentator here said that this movie doesn't do any justice for the refugees and the victims but I must say that no movie can. Even if you do visit these places to see for yourself what really goes on you have a choice  you can leave whilst these people don't so unless you are in that exact same position I think nobody should ever try to comment about it because it's something I don't think none of us in developed countries can ever truly understand. Besides this movie is about the volunteer workers and what they have to go through and the love story between the two leads as the backdrop to distract us from the painful realities depicted in the movie. I don't really agree with some inaccurate plots in certain movies but I don't know the 110 truth about this movie so I just accept it and then find out more about it if I want to. It's something you can't expect from movies anyway coz movies are not supposed to educate but just to entertain and maybe enlighten us a little. You want a 100 accurate show then go watch National Geographic.All in all the filmmakers of Beyond Borders deserve some credit for trying to tell a story different from the rest of the junk playing in the cinemas nowadays. Some of you might have felt they didn't really succeed but I still think they gave it their best shot. Now you have to give them at least that!".

Oh and now it's up to 5.9  going the right way at least!. Hopefully posterity will be kinder to it than that. It is a very good wellacted wellwritten and wellfilmed movie. Apparently though it is too subtle for many viewers.The humanitarian situation it shows is reality. The characters may be fictional and they may not be representative of the typical relief worker  but they aren't supposed to be. This is a story of those particular two people and how their feelings for each other grow out of the humanitarian work they are embroiled in. There's no separating the love story from the relief efforts because she falls in love with him because of his commitment to those efforts. It's true that at the end in Chechnya she is more interested in him than in the local situation but there are two very good reasons for this One unlike in Ethiopia and Cambodia she was only there to find him she wasn't involved in some relief work there so obviously his safety was foremost in her mind. And two and more importantly if she managed to save him he could have continued being the man she fell in love with continued his courageous commitment to fight death and suffering. So I repeat the love story and the humanitarian subject matter of this movie cannot been separated.And the thing about her leaving her own family fer crying out loud it wasn't a happy family! Her cheating husband represented both to Angelina's character and in a wider metaphorical sense the numbing meaninglessness of a trivial awkward and frequently loveless domestic situation compared to the importance of saving lives and being in the company of infinitely more inspiring people.And what a refreshing change to see her husband  Linus Roach  in the kind of role that so many women portray in the usual Hollywood movie being the colorless passive backdrop to the male hero. Gratifying to see it reversed for once.The ending of the movie was unexpected and yet in retrospect it couldn't have ended any other way. If the movie were serious about its subject matter  the relief efforts as well as the love story  it required an end of that sort. The surviving daughter keeps the hope for an eventual happy end alive.I'm saddened that so many people did not get the movie. Many of the criticisms leveled against it are of scenes that were meant to evoke that response and which are addressed later in the movie. There's a development going on the characters are growing in the course of the story and so is the movie. Many people apparently couldn't perceive that.This was an extremely wellstructured rare thoughtprovoking and sobering type of movie that I'm thankful could get made in this day and age and I've just bought the DVD. But what a pity it met with such an insensitive public response.9 out of 10.".

But I can still feel my heart clenched in my chest and my mind is still rolling back and forth over what I've just seen. In my experience those are the kinds of films that stay with you.There have been a lot of reviews on both sides as far as Beyond Borders goes and I think it comes down to knowing yourself as a movie viewer. Beyond Borders presents you with a glimpse of the world and it asks you to believe in it to internalize it.  If you're the kind of person who can EXPERIENCE a film rather than just kick back and watch it than you'll be brushing flies out of your eyes and jumping at every sudden burst of gunfire.  You'll be overwhelmed by the desperation around you and you'll feel despair and helplessness and you'll think Good for those people who go to Ethiopiato Chechnyato Cambodia.  I'm so glad someone's helping and then deep down you'll be ashamed to realize that you think that just because you elected to see a movie about Relief Workers rather than The Texas Chainsaw Massacres you deserve some sort of gold star.And yes there is the love story.  And if you love love stories as do I you'll love this one.  Again it comes down to how much you'll let your self believe in a movie and how much you expect to be convinced.  Certainly I would NEVER accuse Angelina Jolie and Clive Owens of sharing no chemistry as I was completely unable to breathe during most of the scenes they shared. Both actors excelled in their roles together and separately.No it wasn't fastpaced.  It wasn't full of witty acerbic dialogue or fantastic car chases.  There were no jokes about bodily functions.  It was just sincere and powerful and good in every sense of the world. Though it was by no means perfect I gladly rated it a 10 for excellence.".

And yes it was strange to see a piano in the desert. But that is not the point. The point is this is really happening and has been happening for far too long. That people everyday really do risk life and limb to help other humans who have no choice but to go through life living that risk as a reality. The point of this movie is to connect to the viewer to ask the viewer to recognize that more needs to be done that more can be done.Reading an interview with Angelina Jolie inspired me when I was 17 years old to go into a life of service. I will be joining the Peace Corps when I graduate college in 2006. Hopefully I will be deployed to Senegal to help in small business development. Now after reading about the genocide in Rwanda in a book entitled Shake Hands with the Devil by Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire I am convinced that I can do something anything at least on some level. I hope the film rather than being perceived as good or bad will inspire others all the same.So what if the movie wasn't Oscar caliber? At least the refugee and continuing conflict situations have been brought to light in another way brought to more people's attention. Instead of debating the film's merits we should be out there doing something right now. Whether it's calling the attention a local politician learning on our own writing an opinion piece for a newspaper teaching our children tolerance and understanding or donating money to a worthy cause. More can be done so easily.BBC Interview with Angelina Jolie httpnews.bbc.co.uk2hitalkingpoint3808501.stm".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond Borders brings to light the very realistic struggles of the millions of refugees created by war and the valiant efforts of aid workers who contribute to their survival in spite of overwhelming odds.  The storyline of crossing your life's borders away from a comfortable life to help other struggling human beings is a story worth being told. In this type of humanitarian experience every aid worker I have come into contact with has described the experience as extremely enriching.  I'm saddened most of America did not embrace this subject matter at the box office.  We as Americans live a very comfortable life comparatively and perhaps it's out of fear complacency or just selfishness that we generally do not cross borders to help fellow human beings.  This attitude does not make us very popular around the world but perhaps if more people become aware and did something to help other people in their struggles the world would be a better and safer place to live.As a journalist who covered the Afghan  Soviet war recently watching the Making of on the DVD was compelling to see how the filmmakers made something so realistic without putting their cast or crew in harms way.  I hope this film will be embraced as a DVD so that studios will continue to make films of solid subject matter.  Angelina Jolie was wellcast in this role for she in real life is the Ambassador for the United Nations High Commission of Refugees UNHCR. She brought much  passion into this role and while she appeared a little girlish initially the character had to grow out of her pampered life for us to follow her across the borders both real and metaphoric. I am pleased she was brave enough to embrace such a role and hope she will continue to grow in her range of acting choices. Noah Emmerich reminded me of a very gentle Aid worker I knew killed on the job which tugged at my heart strings.  While Clive Owen's portrayal of a man who closes off his heart to survive the cruelty of every day life in the war zone is accurate for the general public who has probably not lived through these extreme conditions it's difficult to empathize or care. I'm sure that is why there might be a general dislike of this character.  For a handful of my friends the romantic connection was unrealistic but in reality if you're living day to day in such extreme conditions and you're friend dies you'll let down your guard just to feel alive. I'm sure a lot of people had sex just after the Sept. 11 attacks.The excellent production design cinematography and poignant music moved the story forward but while I loved this subject matter I also felt the transitions between three very distant locations caused the film to feel somewhat disjointed.  Perhaps that was due to behind the scene budget constraints maybe some transition scenes were cut before they could shoot them or perhaps some studio executive was pushing the film out to theaters before the cut was ready because the investors were crying out for their ROI.  Who knows what the politics were...Either way I liked the film am going to buy the DVD and will definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to be inspired beyond their own border. I certainly was.".

I think she is an excellent actress and I'm never bored when I see her on the big screen. Paired up with Clive Owen I thought the chemistry between the two of them sizzled. I'm wondering what those who voted less than 7 for this picture expected to see when they viewed  this movie or even if they did see it.I thought this movie was great and despite the horrible circumstances and the tragic ending I left the theatre feeling I had been very entertained. I gave it a 10 and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out on video.".

It starts off with Sarah Bauford Jolie playing the piano thinking about the first day she met Nick Owen. The rest is about how she is so convinced by Nick's plea at the gala that she goes to Ethiopia with 40000 pounds the currency not the metric weight worth of food for the starving people. Nick and Sarah don't exactly hit right off but their relationship develops into a love that is only found once in a lifetime. She risks everything and anything even her life just to be with him and for him to survive. The ending was sad but beautiful.The only thing that was bad about the movie was that it was a onesided view making the Americans or rather the English look like heroes while the other people look like victims and greedy rulers. It made the Ethiopians Vietnamese Cambodians and the Chechens look like bastards that have no soul. if it wasn't for the narrowmindness and the one sided view point I might've given it a full ten stars. Of course you'll have to see the movie for yourself to judge it I can't really tell you if you'll like it or not.".

Yes it is a love story which develops over the course of a dozen years.  However amidst that story stark and ongoing brutal realities experienced by so many in the world are depicted  and therein lies the importance of this film. It is thought provoking on many levels. On a performance level the supporting cast filled their roles well.  I couldn't help but be drawn into liking particular characters and was especially attentive to a young man's story of his dance with a landmine.  How haunting.  Both Jolie Sara Jordan English socialite and Clive Owen Dr. Nick Callahan come through with strong performances.  I give credit to director Martin Campbell for respecting the dignity of  refugees and using generated images as appropriate rather than exploiting  people unnecessarily .  This wasn't meant to be a documentary.  Although a few situations might have been developed more realistically hence 810 stars the movie flowed and kept my full attention despite it's two hour plus length.  I found the ending both unexpected and powerful. The imagery of Beyond Borders both visual and verbal   gives pause for thought  Like  Sarah Jordan aidrelief workers most likely have those in their personal lives who say don't go it's not safe there  yet they  remain motivated  to go anyway.    Who are the  Dr. Callahans who travel to  yet another location once their camp is shutdown  perhaps because of reparation or funding cuts?    Why the cuts and what is the full impact?   Could more be done?   How many workers are injuredkilled in the field and how do those situations really come about?  Or  I know of no place in this country where I might walk and be in danger of stepping on a landmine.... but as I sit in a theater eating popcorn there is a strong possibility someone somewhere did and that happens too often. Maybe the price of that ticket and popcorn once a month could start helping UNHCR or HALO or someone... Yes entertaining films have their place but others like Beyond Borders carry the hope of lasting impact. Kudos to all those involved in putting this film together.".

Both Jolie Sara Jordan English socialite and Clive Owen Dr. Nick Callahan come through with strong performances.  I give credit to director Martin Campbell for respecting the dignity of  refugees and using generated images as appropriate rather than exploiting  people unnecessarily .  This wasn't meant to be a documentary.  Although a few situations might have been developed more realistically hence 810 stars the movie flowed and kept my full attention despite it's two hour plus length.  I found the ending both unexpected and powerful. The imagery of Beyond Borders both visual and verbal   gives pause for thought  Like  Sarah Jordan aidrelief workers most likely have those in their personal lives who say don't go it's not safe there  yet they  remain motivated  to go anyway.    Who are the  Dr. Callahans who travel to  yet another location once their camp is shutdown  perhaps because of reparation or funding cuts?    Why the cuts and what is the full impact?   Could more be done?   How many workers are injuredkilled in the field and how do those situations really come about?  Or  I know of no place in this country where I might walk and be in danger of stepping on a landmine.... but as I sit in a theater eating popcorn there is a strong possibility someone somewhere did and that happens too often. Maybe the price of that ticket and popcorn once a month could start helping UNHCR or HALO or someone... Yes entertaining films have their place but others like Beyond Borders carry the hope of lasting impact. Kudos to all those involved in putting this film together.";

If this movie pretends to really care for the unfortunate background characters that really seems to be there to make our protagonists look heroic it even does so in a very bad way. At no point are these people introduced to us as other than set pieces colorful background. They are there to make you forget that the Jolie character actually seems like an extremely selfish woman. She leaves her husband and later one then again later two children to run round the world seeking for true love not that she cares much for the dying around her either she's there for her man. And my argument for the romance being clich? Well have the man first detest the woman but hey they are the stars so we know where they'll end up and her fighting for his respect the only time Jolie seems to care for other people is till she gets his attention  again even the character use these unfortunate like props. Then changes of location one more exotic and strange than the other By the way how does Africa look like is that not something like earth tone color? And Tjetjenia is rather blue and it snows of course and you hear gun fighting every single second. We know the Jungle from Apocalypse Now so we'll remake that.All in all boring but worse distasteful. Only reason for this entry is that i read that Jolie is actually an ambassador for UN and these cases and wonder however she could agree to do this? The film does show some aspects of corruption and politics standing in the way of real aid and that may be new to many? But far more interesting movies could be made on that subject we don't need a love story as sugarcoating.".

Many of the camp shots were pretty good too bad they couldn't capture the smell and the sense of despair. When I first saw Ms. Jolie was now a UNHCR representative I almost dropped my coffee in surprise. It struck me as using a modern Bela Lugosi to spearhead goodwill campaigns for blood drives... or perhaps tax collectors. Yesthere have been corrupt persons using the cover of relief operations to run guns narcotics slaves prostitutes etc. but they constitute an almost infinitesimal percentage of the total relief effort. Using Beyond Borders to learn about relief is like watching Dumbo to learn about elephants.".

	schema:headline " Objections to an exploitative film Some spoilers included";
	schema:reviewBody "I agree with the critics who lambasted 'Beyond Borders' a film with the intellectual depth of an infomercial that portrays starving children to elicit donations. Similarly the filmmakers' methods undermine their intentions if their intentions were in fact as noble as many of the other reviewers here seem to think. If they sought to inspire viewer sympathy and support the filmmakers succeeded. Personally I feel for the extras exploited in the film and I support any viewer who stopped watching within the first hour.If this were merely Angelina Jolie's latest bit of entertaining fluff I could forgive the film for its shortcomings as a star vehicle designed to exhibit the actress' ample charms. Here however Jolie is cast in a serious role as a UN relief worker whose only contributions to the relief effort appear to be her wealth her compassion and her ability to strike a pose during a bad situation. I could almost hear Isaac Misrahi cooing at Jolie's miraculously kempt appearance and missionarychic ensembles. Are we meant to applaud Sarah Jolie for not wearing perfume after Nick's ridicule even when we can see faint traces of mascara on her drooping eyelids as she broods in Chechnya? The attention to Sarah's impeccable appearance detracts from a film that seemingly condemns such superficial concerns in light of human suffering throughout the world. Moreover it contributes to the overall hypocrisy of a movie meant to galvanize social reflection and reaction through the didactic speeches of its belligerent protagonist Nick Clive Owen while exhibiting remarkable indifference to the objectification of the nameless victims that suffer and die in the film so that our love is not for them but for the named heroes who suffer and die out of pity.In 'Beyond Borders' the world is a simple place in which the problems of Chechnya Cambodia and Ethiopia are conflated to represent Third World issues for which compassion is the panacea. Perhaps if this were true I could appreciate Sarah's sudden illconceived trip to Ethiopia at the beginning of the movie thus precipitating her future involvement with the UN. Why not admire her for responding to Nick's impassioned plea for more funding at a dinner in London when her peers are cruel and apathetic? For starters the fact that she is so moved by one incident is more indicative of her obliviousness before the pivotal event than any admirable quality attributed to her reactionary social conscience. Amidst her tears Nick's speech and the audience's jeers a little boy is humiliated to make a point. Worse a fracas ensues and his separation from Nick leads to the boy's demise. Sarah's journey to Ethiopia is as senseless as his death but 'Beyond Borders' seemingly justifies these events by implying that irrationality is at the heart of all worthwhile endeavors. Nick after all is as irrational as Sarah. In his recklessness and outrage at the human suffering he encounters as a Third World doctor Nick is an ineffective negotiator and fundraiser. He is subsequently forced to resort to an uneasy alliance with an insipid trafficker in weaponry and other questionable goods. His actions lead to plot complications involving the relief workers but the social consequences for the local populations they endeavor to help remain unexplored. Even when Nick later expresses his guilt over the little boy's death I wonder if we are meant to feel sorry for him or the boy.Nick is the cynical foil for Sarah's nave idealist but predictably the initial hostility between them turns to attraction. It's inevitable I suppose that the two beautiful dogooders exchange a few clichd remarks about the state of the world before tumbling into bed. First however they share meaningful glances during Sarah's short stay in Ethiopia. The shipment of provisions she brings with her lasts only a few days and as her only occupation involves feeding milk to an extremely malnourished boy whom she rescued from certain death she leaves. Her bedside vigil earns her the respect of the relief workers but the film does not question the outcome of her actions. It becomes apparent that Sarah's act along with her mediocre piano playing is supposed to endear her to Nick. Never mind that her efforts are shortlived and that she abandons the now motherless child to suffer the cruelties of a prolonged existence alone.What more can we expect from a film that suggests food shortages are the root of famine evil is the cause of war and apathy is the sole impediment to social change? If only things were so simple. One of the many problems facing relief efforts is that policymakers are unwilling to explore and fund longterm solutions that have enduring consequences but less immediate results and thus this film in its glorification of thoughtless emotion and quick solutions actually hinders such efforts. Moreover its neocolonial view of the locals in Cambodia Ethiopia and Chechnya as savage criminals or helpless victims is derogatory and condescending. These are not people but stereotypes ripped from the headlines of sensationalist magazines.This film contends that Sarah in her facile understanding of the situations she encounters can somehow rescue the world from its own depravity by accompanying trucks carrying needed supplies across ravaged terrain. What ethnocentric ignorant conceit to think that she could provide aid without adequate knowledge of the local languages people or customs! Then again all Third World countries are the same in their shared devastation and Sarah cares right? Good intentions are no excuse for inexcusable actions or bad filmmaking. Why doesn't Sarah combat poverty in London or address the needs of her family which she abandons to endanger her life in reckless pursuit of Nick? The answer's obvious Then there would be no tragic soap opera against an exotic backdrop of human suffering. It is unfortunate that Sarah and Nick need the exploitation of others to add meaning to their bland love story.".

I thought that the movie was very real and the fact that there was a love story made it even more real because I'm sure that there are many real aid workers who have experienced the same things. It makes fore more excitement with all the different countries and situations. Showing us that it is not only a problem isolated to one country or one race of people. This movie made me sit up and think about the situations of the World and my own Country. I say thank you to the the actors Angelina Jolie Clive Owendirectorswriterscrew and all the folks involved in the making of this movie. Well Done. I believe all the persons who had something bad to say about this movie need to take another good look and check to see if they actually have a heart beating in their chest.

It makes fore more excitement with all the different countries and situations. Showing us that it is not only a problem isolated to one country or one race of people. This movie made me sit up and think about the situations of the World and my own Country. I say thank you to the the actors Angelina Jolie Clive Owendirectorswriterscrew and all the folks involved in the making of this movie. Well Done. I believe all the persons who had something bad to say about this movie need to take another good look and check to see if they actually have a heart beating in their chest. They are probably last or NEVER in line to give a donation to a good cause. I thank you all for listening.";

	schema:headline " Art Film Movie About An Artist At Art School ...Whoa!";
	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I went to my local art theater to watch an art film about a future artist attending art school. Whew! I'm glad I got that out! But lets chat about this art film shall we? Here we go...It's got a lot going for it. First and foremost is an impressive script. Obviously the screenwriter director producer or all three attended art school at some point. And making fun of the people and faculty at such a place is where the comedy in Art School Confidential takes wing. When Jerome Max Minghella the main character begins attending his freshman year at Strathmore Art School he's quickly introduced to the clichriddled cast the clich is purposeful and pulled off just as well as the movie GALAXY QUEST. He meets the burnedout art teacher Professor Sandiford John Malkovich the beautiful model that every male wants named Audrey Sophia Myles the angry lesbian the teacher's petkissa the drug addled film student and a splash of others. There's also a strangler on the loose in the neighborhood which will play a vital role in how Jerome's artistic dreams play out.The ridiculousness of art school is what really makes this movie work. Jerome is obviously very talented but other artists whiz by him because art is what the artists say art is. It might be a picture of a car or a man attaching jumper cables to his nipples and letting current run through him or a mound of plastic chairs.Jerome wants to be the next Picasso. He studies hard tries to get noticed but nothing seems to work. He's also a virgin and wants desperately to get laid but with the wacked out student body at Strathmore he's got his work cut out for him.As Jerome works and works trying to become a successful artist we get to watch him fall into despair he starts smoking drinking and visits a washed up Strathmore graduate named Jimmy Jim Broadbent who gives him some dark and grotesquely sage advice Are you good at 'getting on your knees?' I've cleaned that up a bit but you get the idea. It becomes apparent to Jerome and the movie watcher that he has no chance of becoming a recognized artist ...unless something drastic happens. Which of course it does Cliche? Oh yes! Once this something drastic happens Jerome learns the true nature of being an artist. It's an unfortunate and incredibly funny set of circumstances that finally thrusts Jerome into the limelight.The level of casting in this indie film is surprisingly large and notable. In addition to John Malkovich BEING JOHN MALKOVICH we see Anjelica Huston THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS Jim Broadbent MOULIN ROUGE! Matt Keeslar DUNE miniseries Ethan Suplee COLD MOUNTAIN Steve Buscemi THE BIG LEBOWSKI and several others.This impressive cast pulled off the overlypretentious attitudes that flood many art schools. They were witty yet cynical which made laughing out loud a requirement during the viewing of this amazing little flick.God I love these little independents when they're done right!".

	schema:headline " A great cynical comedy about the art world.";
	schema:reviewBody "What can I say? I always considered that art as in paintings drawings and such was a very complicated thing to follow. I mean you see a painting you let it be absorbed into your consciousness you reflect about it and then you decide about what it means and whether it has any significance to you. But how do you know if it's actually art? This is why I found Terry Zwigoff's Art School Confidential to be an utterly refreshing look at the art world which is even more complicated than what I actually believed it to be. The film deals with a quiet lonely boy called Jerome Platz Max Minghella who has been bullied and ignored ever since he was a child. Now Jerome's hero is Pablo Picasso and ever since he remember he's wanted to be a grand artist like his hero. I wanna be the greatest artist of the 21st century! he often squeals delightedly throughout the film.Anyway little Jerome grows up graduates from highschool and decides to enroll in a renowned art school where young artists whose art is actually new and modern can hope to make a name out of themselves. This college is a tiny but colourful world populated with a large array of weird and quirky characters all of them artists and in comes young boyish quiet Jerome trying to be an artist like all of them.Upon entering his dorm room he encounters his two roommates a fat film major Ethan Suplee working on a short film based on some murders that have been terrorizing the campus grounds and a noticeably gay fashion major Nick Swardson who swears he misses his girlfriend.And in his most important class little Jerome meets his holierthanthou professor John Malkovich who's so full of himself to actually notice any of his students' work a flunkie Joel David Moore who enrolled into art school just for the 'pussy' and...a gorgeous sophisticated model Sophia Myles who also happens to be the daughter of a famous painter and who instantly becomes Jerome's muse and obsession.Throughout the film which is perfectly written and refreshingly funny we follow Jerome's steady psychological downfall. He begins as a happy and anxious boy with dreams and he slowly progresses into a disheartened depressed suicidal failure of an artist. This happens because his art isn't appreciated at all because he notices how arbitrary and tediously unnerving the art world really is and because his muse and obsession doesn't pay him any attention and prefers to mingle with a hunky handsome new art student who also becomes the number one artist in school and who's art if it can even be called that Jerome loathes above anything else.Why brings me back to the initial question how do you know if something is really art? Through various hilarious and original encounters with artists connoisseurs and art grads Jerome begins to put two and two together and finds that this world that he so reveres is actually soulsucking and lifeless. It's not about how good you are an art school grad Jim Broadbent says It's about how good you are at cocksucking. But then just when poor Jerome is about to give up on his life his art his everything...well something happens that will give him one last chance to make a name for himself to conquer his muse and adoration and to make sense out of all the craziness he's living through.More than an ironic film that exposes art as we know it nowadays this film touches on the basic human feelings of failure redemption and need. It also talks about love. And it's also very very funny...which is good because there is still comedy in life's tragedies isn't there? I highly recommend this film. Believe me you will not be disappointed! Rating 4 stars out of 4!!".

Failing this test the other artist character Jimmy beautifully played by Jim Broadbent has become bitter cynical and ultimately homicidal. This is why the film seems to become darker as its true seriousness of purpose unfolds. This isn't a satirical teen comedy what saves Jerome is his relationship with Audrey but his final test as an artist is to see beyond his physical attraction to her and to finally understand her as his muse.I've read dozens of reviews of this film and I don't think I've seen the word muse once. Anyone who doesn't get that point illustrated beautifully in the film's final amazing image doesn't know what they're watching. Most movies no matter how cynical or dark just want to be loved. Art School Confidential wants to show the world as it is and tell the truth about it. And it seems it has demonstrated its own thesis by ending up as unloved and misunderstood as its protagonist.".

	schema:headline " Great film fun exciting fascinating and keeps you pleasantly off balance";
	schema:reviewBody "First off let me just say how much I love Max Minghella. I saw Bee Season at a film festival a while back and straight off knew he was going to do fantastic things with his career. So far he's proved me right.I have been anticipating Art School Confidential for a long time. I found out about it through the IMDb and as a big fan of Zwigoff's previous work I was really looking forward to seeing what he was going to do with the fabulous cast he had assembled Malkovich Huston Buscemi etc. The movie did not disappoint.The beginning of the film is about what I expected cute offbeat story about a talented geek who goes to art school and pursues the girl of his dreams. And then it got dark. And then it got very dark. And then it got extremely dark. I soon realized I had no idea where it was going to take me next and that excited me. The 'mystery' aspect of the movie is brilliantly done as well it keeps you just well informed enough that you have about a 5050 chance of figuring it out preemptively and you'll always realize what's going on just when you need to.I have read reviews that called Art School Confidential misanthropic among other things. I disagree. It has misanthropic aspects misanthropic characters but overall I found that it ended on an expressly positive note. I absolutely loved the ending. Five minutes before it ended I wasn't sure how it was going to end and that in my opinion is the best way to do it. Zwigoff's direction is also very impressive. There's a distinct difference in the atmosphere throughout it starts out looking and feeling sunnier and lighter and as Minghella's character becomes darker so does the look of the movie. Just one of those little things that adds to the overall experience.Art School Confidential thoroughly covers ground that Ghost World touched on briefly namely the line between art and BS. It is clearly a subject on which Terry Zwigoff has a lot to say and he says it very eloquently. The cast is great the music is great the direction is great. Go see it. And let me say again... I love Max Minghella. Here's hoping he doesn't turn to stupid teen flicks to pay the bills.".

	onyx:emotionText "First off let me just say how much I love Max Minghella. I saw Bee Season at a film festival a while back and straight off knew he was going to do fantastic things with his career. So far he's proved me right.I have been anticipating Art School Confidential for a long time. I found out about it through the IMDb and as a big fan of Zwigoff's previous work I was really looking forward to seeing what he was going to do with the fabulous cast he had assembled Malkovich Huston Buscemi etc. The movie did not disappoint.The beginning of the film is about what I expected cute offbeat story about a talented geek who goes to art school and pursues the girl of his dreams. And then it got dark. And then it got very dark. And then it got extremely dark. I soon realized I had no idea where it was going to take me next and that excited me.

The talented artist here is one Jerome Platz Minghella son of filmmaker Anthony Minghella and disturbingly looking like the teenage version of the comic strip character Dondi ! a lonely lowly freshman embarking to find his true talent as an artist by enrolling at a prestigious New York art college called Strathmore where he rooms on campus with vulgarian film student Vince Suplee and mincing ambivalently gay fashion designer wannabe Matthew Swardson and pines for his drawing class' nude model Audrey Baumgartner Myles a combo of Cameron Diaz and Uma Thurman yes definitely easy on the eyes kids! who he idealizes and imagines her to be his destined love and inspired muse.

Perhaps the must cutting to the bone and too painful to be honest depiction of art as success is a symposium with Strathmore's prized alum and sensation to the art world Marvin Sagemiller Scott who basks in his misanthropy and embracing his assholedness. Zwigoff and Clowes make a perfect combination even if the subplot is superfluous and unnecessary providing an unbalanced final act that suggest what would've been the coda to Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.

	schema:headline " Another great film of Terry Zwigoff";
	schema:reviewBody "The dream and principal goal of Jerome Max Minghellais to be one day the greatest artist of the 21st century. The film follows his experiences in an art school where he will find that his talent as a painter is not the only thing that he need to have success in the art school.The screenplay of this great film was based on a comic book created by Daniel Clowes just like the previous film of Terry Zwigoff Ghost World 2001. The story is simple but the result is very good because the film is a mix of genres you have the typical story about a talented boy dealing with the adaptation in his new school with professor and students who don't like his style the love story between Jerome and Audrey Sophia Myles that affects Jerome's art and end almost with an obsession and also a crime story involving a mysterious murderer. And all the stories with the classic black humour of Terry Zwigoff's previous films makes this film a terrific black comedy about an art school. I really like the turn in the plot and the end is amazing and maybe is a reason of the poor rating on the film because is a very dark end.And i love all the characters made on purpose with a lot of clichs i mean there is the classic student filmmaker always thinking about his script the typical professor who thinks he knows everything but most of the students have more talent than him and some others that Jerome's friend explain on a terrific scene. And i really like that because this characters are not just from others films i mean there are always those kind of students in every school not just in art schools and prove to that is that Daniel Clowes based his comic book in his own experiences in an art school.Well the cast is very good this is the first time i watch Max Minghella and Sophia Miles and both are good and very young. John Malhovich who is also one of the producers is great in his role as Jerome's professor and i really like the cameos of Angelica Huston and the great Steve Buscemi.Conclusion i really like this black comedy of Terry Zwigoff for me is not his best but is another example of why for me Terry Zwigoff is one of the bests American filmmakers working right now and all of his films are highly rewatchable for me. And if you don't believe me about how great is Terry just watch any of his films. 9.5 out of 10Region 4 DVD is excellent contains a lot of bonus material like deleted scenes the making of the film and the presentation of the film at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. And i really hope the release of the Region 4 DVD of Ghost World.PS the Mexican title for the DVD is El Arte De La Seduccion that means The Art of Seduction. Horrible title!".

This is a brilliant dark comedy that parodies and ridicules the world of art not excluding the movie business. Young and relatively unknown actor Max Minghella stars as Jerome Platz an innocent boynextdoor type from the suburbs who dreams of becoming the greatest modern artist of the 21st century meaning of today. He doesn't have a girlfriend is shy and idealistic and moves into a dorm at a prestigious art school where he encounters a closeted gay an overweight smartaleck aspiring film director and a classy gorgeous blonde Sophia Myles named Audrey who becomes his Muse. But far from being a comingofage story in a traditional vein Jerome's journey is one of naivet and idealism to jaded cynicism and despair. His art is criticized and disliked by his colleagues the girl of his dreams is drawn to his rival Jonah Matt Keeslar who is in reality a fraudulent twofaced nobody. Jim Broadbent puts in a great performance as Jimmy an older pathetic exalumni of the same art school whose artwork was rejected and who was disillusioned with the art world in general. Now he lives to drink beer and lives in squallor. Jerome's love of art and dreams are pure and unselfish but he learns that to make it in the art world one has to kiss butt and sell out. John Malkovich as the art professor is another fine performance. Angelica Houston as the art history teacher is also great. This film has not been wellreceived by critics or audiences simply for the fact that the film is ultimately not artsy and more Hollywood in its antiHollywood antisellout theme. Also the clichs and jokes are nothing fresh. In the art school we are introduced to Goths hippies artsy housewives or moms artist groupies and every aspect of the film seems to be based on some kind of dark novel written by a disenchanted artist. The music is lovely the cinematography is exquisite and there is nothing wrong with it. Some folks just can't handle the truth about some darker aspects of the art world that it is superficial in its own way that it can make one jaded and that it's ultimately as biased as the rest of organized high society.".

I had a very close acquaintance who did his MFA at RISD and the slant here absolutely nails his experiences and stories. For me this is Zwigoff's best work since Crumb. I also seem to be among a minority who think it is way better than Ghost World the first collaboration between Zwigoff and graphic comic writer Daniel Clowes who wrote the screenplays for GW and Art School Confidential. If you liked Peter Chelsom's Funny Bones or Emir Kusturica's Underground chances are you'll like this film too. But then lots of folks won't. My grade A 910.".

With Art School Confidential ZwigoffClowes have not only grown as a filmmakerwriter ensemble but have provided us with one of the best cynical stabs at the artistic medium ever portrayed on camera with a very tightly plotted and unpredictable script. Just go in with an open mind you have to be one to appreciate Clowes' unconventional style the humor you JUST must get. I went in with the lowest expectations the trailer is terrible and was completely blown away. By far my favorite movie of the year so far. Watching the premise unfold on screen litereally feels like flipping through one of Clowes' classic Eightball issues. Brilliant.".

A lot of adrenalin laced action big guns with big explosion and the possibility of the main characters dying in the end. It was a good story and a good movie. Willam DeFoe was awesome.

Saratoga CV60 in 1985. The ship in the movie was the U.S.S. Independence CV62 and it's the same ship in design as the Saratoga. When I was on that ship a pilot died suddenly when his A7 exploded on approach and it was caused by a bomb arming and exploding on its own.

Saratoga CV60 in 1985. The ship in the movie was the U.S.S. Independence CV62 and it's the same ship in design as the Saratoga. When I was on that ship a pilot died suddenly when his A7 exploded on approach and it was caused by a bomb arming and exploding on its own. We had an memorial service at the same place on the ship and it really blew my mind. From then on I have admired that movie and have watched it several times. To this day I get really choked up.

This aircraft is now out of service with the Navy except as a fueler but I can testify that this aircraft is down right dominating and scary to anyone on the ground when they make a low level pass and this movie captured it all! That said I read the book too and yes it is a lot different from the book but then most movies are. The question is does it conform to the spirit of the movie and Flight of the Intruder is close. It does take some short cuts which are even more obvious to a Navy vet but over all this is one of my favorite Vietnam War movies and about the only one that gives a decent treatment to the carrier pilots.The romantic part is not much and probably left in to keep it from not having any attractive females but it sure is not needed for dramatic effect.The political and legal junk is really over blown and trite but if sufficient detail were included the movie would have been 3 hours long.It is a good Tiger flick war movie for a rainy day and it has an honored place in my DVD collection!".

It takes place at the beginning of the Vietnam war  after his bombardier is killed Jake Grafton Brad Johnson a carrierbased Intruder pilot questions the purpose of Navy bombing missions and he join forces with another partner Willem Defoe to carry out a dangerous objective in Hanoi . Meanwhile  a grumpy general Danny Glover surveys their exploits and frustrations but when his aircraft is shot down  he is stranded in the wilds of Vietnam .

As the protagonists come determined to rescue him .Pretty good aerial flick plenty action  tragic drama  fantastic cloudy scenes and breathtaking dogfighting . It's a spectacular actioner including impressive scenarios  fine star cast and memorable acting . It plays like one of these 1940s service propaganda war that was shot in cooperation with US Air Force . This stirring as well as incongruous warlike movie mixes thrills  rugged action and dialog with lots of military scenes  without losing sight of the continuation of its interesting plot or necessities of war and works on various levels . Acceptable budget extended adventures about a maverick pilot and his pal undergoing risked feats on air and bombing on earth . It gets the right balance between the oldstyle warfare movies and the modern wartime films . Noisy action scenes punctuate the tension without breaking it . Brad Johnson and Willem Defoe give terrific acting in this otherwise passable film  both of whom show professionalism as two crack fighter pilots  two ambitious Lieutenants assigned to risked missions . Danny Glover is topnotch as Cmdr. Frank 'Dooke' Camparelli  he is a grumpy but likable officer subsequently stranded and alone after his plane is gunned down . Secondary cast is frankly excellent as Rosanna Arquette  Dann Florek  Tom Sizemore  Ving Rhames  Madison Mason  J Kenneth Campbell  David Schwimmer  John Corbet  among others . Fine production design and right special effects  as a 1160 scale model of the city of Hanoi was built for the filming of the bombruns scenes  buildings closer to the camera were detailed more while the furthest away buildings in the background we only painted blocks of wood . And being partially filmed on the USS Independence CV62 . While the story was centered around VA196 VA165 was actually the squadron used to film the movie  all of the aircraft used for filming were repainted with VA196 markings used during the Viet Nam conflict era . Colorful and evocative cinematography in super 35 by Fred J Koenekamp . Moving musical score fitting to action by Basil Poledouris  he had originally been scheduled to score Dances with Wolves but reluctantly dropped out to score this film for his close friend John Milius with extremely damaging results to his career when he found himself suddenly unemployable at any studio making a picture with the thenhot Kevin Costner .The motion picture was professionally directed by John Milius but he stated that making this film was one of the worst experiences he had. He is a notorious screenwriter and filmmaker with several hits  specially on adventure genre as Jeremiah Johnson 1972 Conan  Red Dawn and also made biography as Dillinger  making two films about Theodore Roosevelt   The Wind and the Lion1975 and Rough Riders 1997 .

	schema:reviewBody "Call it Top Gun with balls. Red Dawn director John Milius' bigscreen adaptation of the Stephen Coonts novel The Flight of the Intruder upholds not only the finest traditions of the Hollywood aerial combat epic going as far back as Howard Hawks' The Dawn Patrol 1930 as well as its gildedged 1938 Errol Flynn remake Mark Robson's The Bridges at TokoRi 1964 and Walter Grauman's 1964 British fighterbomber classic 633 Squadron but also issues a highlypoliticized antiwar statement without undercutting its high octane ingredients. How they got the U.S. Navy to ante up all that fabulous equipment for an antiwar movie still amazes me. The aerial sequences rank among the very best particularly when the A6s explode in the air as the pilots bail out. Part of the dramatic punch of Flight is that our heroes fly jets that have no guns on board to retaliate with during an airborne enemy assault. They have to radio for help when it comes down to that. This raises the stakes considerably in the Robert The French Connection 2  Prime Cut Dillon  David The Warriors  Nighthawks Shaber screenplay that thrusts these Navy pilots into several suspenseful situations. When Intruder flies you cannot beat its dogeared but flagwaving heroics even if a couple of renegade A6 Navy carrier pilots played by Brad Johnson and Willam DaFoe unfurl them for our entertainment. Indeed all the clichs remain intact in this virtual remake of The Bridges at TokoRi except Flight boasts a happy ending. Basically Flight is a testosterone flavored tearjerkers for guys. When he loses his bombardier to a stray bullet at low altitude Lt. Jake 'Cool Hand' Grafton complains about the targets they pick. Not long afterward the death of Grafton's Lt. Cmdr. Virgil 'Tiger' Cole Dafoe comes on board with a bad reputation for having allegedly abandoned a fellow pilot on the ground in North Vietnam. The two become best buddies after a neardeath encounter in the night skies over North Vietnam when they dodge at least four SurfaceToAir missiles and plan an audacious mission that they fully expect to be courtmarshaled for by the Navy brass. Along the way Flight bogs down momentarily for an obligatory romantic subplot involving a Navy widow Callie Rosanna Arquette and her daughter. Mind you the movie never captures the complexity of the novel but remember this is a genre movie and the romantic subplot is sort of expected. Sure they could have put more bang into it in emotional terms and may very well have. Sure you can tell that the Tom Sizemore character is going to bite the bullet when he learns that he is a dad albeit an illegitimate one. The cast is firstrate too. Look for Ving Pulp Fiction Rhames in an earlier role as well as David Friends Schwimmer as a duty officer. One of the few things that date this aviation saga is the choice of Lethal Weapon's Danny Glover as the shouting authority figure who makes life rough for our heroes. An uncredited Fred Dalton Thompson has some choice moments as the CourtMartial captain. Now is the time to come to Jesus he warns them as their trial gets underway but yields surprising results. The Paramount DVD is a bare bones version without a Milius commentary that I think all diehard Milius fans would have welcomed. Can we say Special Edition in the future with a JM commentary?".

This is one of those times when less than stellar effects do not get in the way of enjoyment.  The opening bombing scene and the adventure in SAM city were awesome.Sadly the story doesn't hold much and the ending is not so great.  The daytime climax is really cheesy and doesn't fit well with the rest of the movie and this climax itself doesn't flow well either.  It's also pretty much a given when you have soldiers pilots andor sailors in bar chances are there'll be a barfight.

It's also about how guys deal with keeping guy friends but I won't bore you...If it makes you feel any better there's a scene in a bar that involves a zipwire and a mudpit with an alligator and some cool flight stuff that includes 'how to make the new nonpilot sick.'Didn't have a 'chick' problem with it which is probably why I'm so proud of my hardbound copy of Baa Baa Black Sheep autographed by Pappy Boyington. Don't count the women out when you watch this film.

It is highly entertaining and actionpacked however the truth of the story lies somewhere in the middle and there's not much of it in this screenplay. I'm sure that many of the Navy's aviators in Vietnam grew weary of hitting suspected truck parks oil refineries and missile sites but I have yet to hear tales from my dad or his buddies about anyone who decided to fight their own war and fly through downtown Hanoi in order to destroy a SAM surfacetoair missile storage area all on their own. Guys got shot down a lot during the war yes but they were mostly Air Force guys that's meant to be a dig! and rarely a Navy A6. In this movie we see several from one squadron on the same cruise go down. Not too realistic. The quickly referred to Operation Linebacker was a real mission proud to say that my dad was in the first plane over N Vietnam on that mission and followed up by Linebacker II later on. It was not however inspired because of what the two lead characters in this movie did. The flying is pretty realistic though and it is nice to see the notassexyasafighterjet Grumman A6 Intruder in a movie I give it three stars for that. Still...I would rather listen to real bomber pilots and bn's relate their adventures in 'Nam and aboard ship. If you want a real Vietnam movie stick with Apocalypse Now Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.".

This movie called  The Flight of the Intruder  brings to light the skills courage and integrity of the Navy pilot. The story one of many from that era relates the decision of pilot Lt. Jake Grafton Brad Johnson and his bombardier Lt. Cmdr. Virgil Cole Willem Dafoe who implement a scheme to take the war to the enemy. By defying their main authority they fly their single Intruder into North VietNam and drop their bombs not on the dark jungles of that country but in the stockpile area known as ' Sam City.  Upon their return they are arrested and brought before the Naval Board of Inquiry. Their commanding Officer Cmdr. Frank Camparelli Danny Glover warned both men not to get too involved with personal losses now they both stand a good chance of going to prison. The film is an excellent tribute to the officers and men of the US Navy and with all the action and combat drama seen in the movie there is little doubt this movie will become a war time Classic. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The story was lacking! Being a veteran a fan and supporter of Naval Aviation I loved all the air and carrier operations sequences. They were all realistic thanks to U.S. Navy cooperation. But being a Coonts and Jake Grafton fan in my opinion the actors didn't bring much life to the characters established in Stephen Coont's best selling novel and the screen writers went their own direction.Danny Glover is a good actor. But in my opinion I didn't feel the command presence of Cdr. Frank Camparelli that I felt reading the pages of the novel. Glover put in the demeanor of Camparelli but didn't get the command presence right. If you want to get a good idea of command presence check out the performance of the late Richard Crenna in First Blood. Or see Gene Hackman's performances when he plays high ranking military officers like in Behind Enemy Lines and Crimson Tide. Brad Johnson was okay as Jake Grafton but was Luke warm compared to the novel version. For example if you read the court martial and testimony of Jake Grafton in the novel and see the on screen version you will be highly disappointed in how the film presented it. It's like they watered the Grafton character down! I thought Willem Dafoe's performance as Lcdr Virgil Tiger Cole was the most convincing and closer to the novel version than everyone else who had a character from the novel. The movie Tiger in my opinion was a little better. But unfortunately one good performance doesn't make the whole story.The CallieJake relationship from the novel was turned into a corny subplot for the movie! I really loved the way it was presented in the novel and loathed the way they interpreted it on screen! Callie in the novel was a pretty smart woman but in the movie she didn't seem that way and her character lacked dimension.Others have already stated other differences so yeah I know the movie will always be different from the novel. But it doesn't mean the movie can't live up to the novel. A good example of a movie adaption of a novel that is a good interpretation is The Great Santini. Of course like all novel  movie adaptations not everything from The Great Santini book is in the movie. But if ever there is movie that is true to the novel in characters and plot it's The Great Santini. I think if Flight of the Intruder was true to and lived up to the novel then I would agree that it shouldn't be underrated.Despite the nice Naval Aviation and action sequences this movie leaves a lot to be desired in the story and characters. Yes there will always be differences in a novel  movie adaptation but it doesn't mean the movie should stray so far away from the book that you get an inferior interpretation.".

But somehow this movie just falls flat. It is not engaging. Suspension of disbelief is very difficult to achieve. Even the court martial scene comes across as wooden and preachy despite trying to make very valid points. The lead actor the relatively unknown Brad Johnson who looks remarkably like a young Tom Berenger is quite believable as a navy pilot  as the adoptive son of a USAF F111 pilot I grew up around men just like this  but the performance simply isn't compelling. In the end we really don't care about these characters or their actions. Tom Sizemore long before he was a known Hollywood face Ving Rhames with a full head of hair and Willem Dafoe are basically just wasted in this movie their roles have very little room for growth or expression. Danny Glover's frequently humorous turn as the CO is faintly rewarding and a very young David Schwimmer makes a kind of cute appearance. But when all is said and done this movie comes across as having very little in the way of a real point. The feelgood triumphant music that floods us toward the end as the planes are launching off the carrier comes across as just downright silly and worse yet patriotically manipulative. There is also a marked lack of complexity when it comes to the Vietnamese. Except for one very brief moment when a drunken Johnson looks up after falling in the mud at a family of locals whose faces seem to show a mixture of fear disapproval and indifference the indigenous population don't have any roles or presence other than as either whores or largely faceless enemies. On a positive note the visual effects are actually quite impressive for the early '90s especially in the bombing raid on Hanoi. Many CGI attempts at realistically depicting missiles and aircraft have done worse than the apparently modelbased effects in this film.".

On a positive note the visual effects are actually quite impressive for the early '90s especially in the bombing raid on Hanoi. Many CGI attempts at realistically depicting missiles and aircraft have done worse than the apparently modelbased effects in this film.";

He tells Jake about SAM city. It's a bit of 'Top Gun' a bit of 'Road House' a bit of 'Animal House' and a whole lot of prowar militarism. The tone is a mess. The humor is broad low grade. The romance is stiff and melodramatic. Brad Johnson is not the best lead. He has limited range. The good news is the movie has Willem Dafoe and also Danny Glover. What works are the planes and the missions. The flying action is done well although the miniatures are a little obvious and the special effects aren't the best. However the first run in Hanoi is terrific like the Star Wars trench run. In fact that's what is better than 'Top Gun'. These are war actions with the characters getting shot at and killed.

It depicts the downfall and low morale that arrised towards the end of the war.So many great actors are in this film and even though they do not all have killer performances they make for a great cast that blends well together. While watching this film I couldn't stop laughing at some points because the interactions of cast members and the jokes they made.Like this is the most fun you'll ever have with your clothes on Doc...O Jesus or Got room for a six pack and a pizza and Willem Dafoe's reaction to the bar fight. It was just great to watch.The flight and bombing scenes are well done and shows the frustration of loosing friends to A bunch of trees day in and day out. With the lose of public support at home and unknown reason we are still fight lingering in the tone. It does a great job showing this.The ending scene is one of my favorite scenes in all the films I have scene. As it clearly depicted scenarios that plagued American pilots through the war. It also showed should the brotherly love for one another and how they would go into hell to get them out even if they loose their own lives.Even Brad Johnsons romantic interest was done well. It was there but it wasn't overly excessive.Overall this is a great movie and worth a watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Fans of unusual Asian horror will no doubt be familiar with the spate of weird and rather unsavoury films that emerged from Hong Kong in the early 80s titles such as The Devil Seeding of a Ghost Centipede Horror Calamity of Snakes and Devil Fetus delivered disgusting gore mixed with black magic and quite often featured a plethora of slimy or creepy critters bugs worms eels snakes etc. crawling from corpses or victims' mouths.Thailand's 2004 horror Art of the Devil from director Tanit Jitnukul is very reminiscent of such films it's a revenge film that sees a woman using magic to torment and kill the family of a man who wronged her. It features some nasty gore plenty of hokey voodoo rituals including one that involves the use of a dead baby! and LOTS of eels but although it has the occasional good moment the film is rather tedious overall not as nasty as I had expected and is hampered by some mediocre acting.Jitnukul's direction is slick and the film has a very polished look but with a narrative that meanders rather aimlessly until the predictable conclusion plus lots of confusing flashbacks it's hard to stay interested for the duration. Lead actresses Arisa Wills and Supakson Chaimongkol as vengeful bitch Boom are both easy on the eye and provide a little incentive to remain focused but in the end Art of the Devil proves to be nothing more than another forgettable horror flick.5.5 out of 10 rounded up to 6 for IMDb.".

	onyx:emotionText "Fans of unusual Asian horror will no doubt be familiar with the spate of weird and rather unsavoury films that emerged from Hong Kong in the early 80s titles such as The Devil Seeding of a Ghost Centipede Horror Calamity of Snakes and Devil Fetus delivered disgusting gore mixed with black magic and quite often featured a plethora of slimy or creepy critters bugs worms eels snakes etc. crawling from corpses or victims' mouths.Thailand's 2004 horror Art of the Devil from director Tanit Jitnukul is very reminiscent of such films it's a revenge film that sees a woman using magic to torment and kill the family of a man who wronged her. It features some nasty gore plenty of hokey voodoo rituals including one that involves the use of a dead baby! and LOTS of eels but although it has the occasional good moment the film is rather tedious overall not as nasty as I had expected and is hampered by some mediocre acting.Jitnukul's direction is slick and the film has a very polished look but with a narrative that meanders rather aimlessly until the predictable conclusion plus lots of confusing flashbacks it's hard to stay interested for the duration. Lead actresses Arisa Wills and Supakson Chaimongkol as vengeful bitch Boom are both easy on the eye and provide a little incentive to remain focused but in the end Art of the Devil proves to be nothing more than another forgettable horror flick.5.5 out of 10 rounded up to 6 for IMDb.";

Good production values for a Thai horror flick. But the bland script never generates suspense the director approaches the material entirely conventionally and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds. At one point a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun. Bad writing  you're soaking in it! Some icky gore effects including a really tasteless latetermfetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach. Only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in Asia in the last 15 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Twisted Thai witchcraft flick with an emphasis on using evil to seek revenge and to gain riches. Jittima..the alluring beauty Supakson Chaimongkoi is a lover scorned a pregnant victim who seduced a wealthy architect PratanTin Settachoke who threw money at her to keep her away from his family..that while also arranging for her to be ravaged by his business chums. With the help of a secretly practicing witchdoctor Jittima uses black magic to systematically eliminate Pratan's entire family. When she is hit by a car..while spellbound at the site of Pratan's family together as ghostly apparitions looking at her Jittima loses her child becoming even more volatile than ever before. Adding extra sting to her torment another family..whose mother's children were Pratan'sreceives Pratan's luxurious estate and inheritance with Jittima orchestrating a plan to besiege them using the dark arts to gain access to the fortune she feels is rightfully hers. By capturing..literallythe heart of RujIsara Ochakul Jittima will infiltrate the family marrying him and progressively use witchcraft to destroy them with her eyes on the prize she's so longed for.The film focuses on this family's teenage daughter NanArisa Willsand the effects on her watching each member falling prey to supernatural forces beyond her control. This is the emotional arch of the film a family worsening at the hands of a pathological coldblooded female with a deadly agenda gaining trust by those she is in fact exterminating. Interesting enough the witchdoctor is just as guilty for he willingly participates in performing the rituals which cause such destruction whose spells cause really horrific acts to innocent people..many of the acts cause hallucinatory effects which force victims to see created horrors resulting in certain death. There's no doubt that Jittima..known as Boom to the family she's annihilatingis pure evil and to watch so closely her own handiwork the architect of destruction she is is really what makes the film so chilling. The violence that ensues can get quite disturbing such as the sight of an army of eels smothering Nan's brother NengNirut Sutchart Ruj's vomiting razor blades Nan's mom constantly coughing up blood her insides hemorrhaging or reporter DanaiSomchai Satuthum a threat to the entire concocted scheme suffering a piece of broken glass crawling underneath his skin having to slice his body in order to get it out..you see the effects of just how dangerous black magic can be. I think it's the way Jittima carries them out like a Black Widow slowly poisoning her husbands with arsenic a cold and calculating series of attacks that provides the film's most unpleasant tone. The inhumanity of it all and the whole fact that no one suspects her..the cynicism of this kind of power seen earlier when Nan was forced by a friend a true believer into visiting a spiritualist is establishedis what drives the story culminating in a showdown between Nan and Jittima with Danai a believer in the forces of good and evil lending a helping hand trying to uncover the one responsible for causing the black magic. One unnecessary decision which mars the film is the bouncing back and forth to past and present as Jittima discusses her reasons for what has transpired to a bound and distraught Nan. With more focus on linear storytelling this could've been less aggravating. Still the film shows the genesis of the monster that would become Boom until the very confusing climax when Jittima makes a very odd decision regarding her own fate in turn shattering all that she has strived for. Another really bizarre subplot has this mysterious ghost girl hanging around Nan's kid brother..this ghost child is connected with Jittima and it's quite a revelation to say the least.".

	schema:reviewBody "But only as high as a 6.First off I have to say that my copy of the DVD will not play the original Thai audio so I am stuck with the horrible English overdubs. I kept the subtitles on anyways but had to laugh at how different they were from the spoken lines. Sometimes the dialogue was more detailed and sometimes the subtitles were.So due to the fact I had to listen to the overdubbed version I cannot comment on the acting as a whole. Most of the physical acting was decent with body language and whatnot but nothing really stood out.The Story Pretty decent revengeblack magic story. The woman has an affair with a married man gets pregnant wants hush money gets gang raped by the married mans friends demands more money gets bitch slapped around and then wants revenge. You're sort of torn about how you're supposed to feel about the main girl. She's sort of a slut and seems a bit like a gold digger but she was also cast aside by the baby's daddy and raped by his friends. So you can see why she wants revenge but not to the extent she takes it which is why she makes a good villain. She's a very pretty girl but can definitely pull off the evil look to her. The story gets a bit confusing at first since a lot happens in such a quick time with little explanation but picks up a bit more later. She kills one part of the family and then moves on to the other side It' sort of confusing to explain. You never connect with any of the characters except for Nam the other main girl so when a character dies big deal. The twist if you can call it that is a bit weird but very typical for a horror film. The little albino girl or maybe she was just Swedish was a bit creepy which I'm sure was their intentions. What or who the albino girl represented can be disputed. I won't go into detail as not to spoil too much.Now for some of the technical aspects. Some of the graphics were very bad but I'm guessing this was somewhat a low budget so understandable. The physical graphics as in the gore spitting up bloody razors nails coming out of the head the eels stabbing etc was pretty good something that if was digitalized would have made this worse. Some shots were very well done but a lot seemed amateurish.Now was it entertaining? Yes it was. Worth a rent if you can deal with cheesy horror films. Just make sure the Thai audio track works or you may just laugh a lot at the English overdubs especially the scene where the mother is being haunted by the previous family killed by the girl.6 out of 10 for being entertaining with some good gore and a decent story".

It's little more than an excuse for more gruesome deaths but the novelty quickly wears off.The cast isn't particularly good for a film of this calibre. There's plenty of overacting  especially from the villainess  and little subtlety aside from the actor playing the investigative reporter. There ARE some good gruesome bits one involving the old joke with a victim having an evil presence under his skin and his efforts to cut it out. Of course there are also moments of bad taste as is the norm for this genre of production. A guy vomits up eels in one unpleasant scene while the nastiest bit involves the rotting corpse of a baby being used in a ritual. Such moments come few and far between however and this is a case of style over substance. In the end it's a disappointment feeling like a halfhearted attempt to emulate the classics of old.".

The story is really scary and has some nasty and cruel scenes the worst is the sequence when the teenager is tortured with hot water and burned by a torch. The story follows the pattern of the good Asian horror movies with secrets and revelations being disclosed in the last moments like the last parts of a puzzle. This macabre type of voodoo with corpses is unusual in Western movies. The screenplay is very well tight with great lines and I liked the wise thought of Kim The future is what we want to be the past defines us. The direction is very precise the special effects are impressive and the cast has great performances. The lead actress is extremely gorgeous and unfortunately I do not know her name.

Art of the Devil 2 is related to the first only by the theme of Thai curses which are by far more imaginative than anything brought to the American screen. There are weaknesses such as the quality of the translation track and the cheap effect but the movie succeeds by imagining a world in which dangerous curses can kill from a distance where witches can appear and disappear at will in which the dead dance silently just out of sight of everyone but you and in which the cost of revenge is the soul of the wronged. This is not gentle stuff cannibalism corpse mutilation and bloody rituals are abundant but on the whole the picture succeeds in doing something not seen from American directors in many years.".

Staying true to the Asian root the movie explores the theme of curses and it's working. When a cursed is placed two holes are created is the basic idea here i.e when you place a curse on someone you get equally influenced by the curse because it links you and the one you cursed for eternity.The plot is great with a very nice twist at the end. You end up not sympathising the protagonists at the end but some might differ. Characters are complex unlike most Western horror which are awfully full of shallow rehashed characters. The scares works as well with lots of supernatural jumpscares mixed in with gore and torture images although they are rather creepy than scary. The performance are decent. While the movie could've done better by filling in a plothole or two it doesn't take away from the overall excitement of it. Highly recommend it 910.".

Also this is about as name only for a sequel as it gets  as far as I can tell this film has nothing in common storywise with the original ART OF THE DEVIL other than the title...The story centers around a group of kids who have a sorcerer cast a spell on some guy cuz he's a dick to them. When homeboy starts pushin' fishhooks through his skin his ol' lady decides to get even by casting some spells of her own. The kids take a little vacation to a shack on the waterfront  and this is where the action happens. There's a decent amount of gore including the previously mentioned fishhook death and a particularly decent legblowtorchingtofleshremoval that is pretty choice. There also seemed to be some sort of twist to the ending that I didn't understand...Overall AOTD 2 seems to be a pretty decent film similar in vein to the 80's era Hong Kong sorceryhorror joints but WAY better. There seemed to be a few genuinely creepy moments and the gore was pretty heavy though not as much of an allout bloodbath as I was expecting from the trailer.

Of course there's gore but the thing is that it's not senseless just for schock value. If you follow the story completely to the end you'll see everything has its place.I'm lucky to have picked this movie because with a franchise like  insert corporate video franchise of your choice you'd never know.By the way Mr. Panor is so devilishly beautiful that it's a trip to see how cold and heartless she is.".

All of the characters were very well constructed and as representative types of their social groups offered much material for the audience to reflect upon.Indeed a knowledgeable audience would find this film to be replete with commentary on our social and political reality the Anatolian and the European and on the respective preconceptions and stereotypes. Some of the commentary is tragic some is ironic. Here in Bulgaria the audience laughed and applauded when the German granma said with all her conviction to the Kurdish girl that everything in her country will become alright once they join the EU. On the other hand an migr Kurdish audience will probably applaud a very moving and full of suspense depiction of the Kurdish struggle in Turkey which is however frank both to Kurds and to the Turkish authorities. It included small cameos from the conflict that are for the first time openly publicised for example the revolutionaries as they are taken out of their hideout to be arrested by the police announce their names to the street and the world in apprehension of being disappeared by the authorities minutes later the crowd of passerbys claps to the departing police vans in a popular approval of the suppression of kurdish struggle...Still the myriad political and social themes are only a setting to a much more personal story. The opening of one's soul the crossing of inner walls that separate us from those who love us. This story is repeated three times in different context for the three characters who remain alive to cross 'to the other side' the German mother who accepts her daughter's ideals the GermanTurkish son who forgives his father the Kurdish girl who takes the love of her friends over her revolutionary commitment. However the director allows no one of them to consume their redemption within the film's running time  their characters remain tragic.It is a very powerful film. As a friend said after the screening it tramples over you like a steamroller. The emotional mix of the previous film Headon had me cry but crying releases the pain. This one doesn't let to release the tension even at the final scene. It will stay with you for days after.".

The movie focuses on three families who are all connected in some way. In a beautiful way Akin shows the struggle of a Turkish prostitute a professor of German literature a young Turkish rebel a student English and Spanish and a retired widower to find peace and happiness in their lives. Akin manages to avoid the many pitfalls which can lead to clichs. The characters remain just ordinary people with genuine emotions and problems. The movie also depicts the impact of globalization and multiculturalism in nowadays Germany and Turkey. It's the most debated topic of our time. To what extent do we want newcomers to adapt to their new surroundings and to what extent do we accept them to cherish their own cultural heritage. In an even broader perspective it deals with the clash between the Islamic and western world. 'Auf der anderen Seite' which means on the other side shows how Turkish immigrants come to love their new country Germany without losing their Turkish roots. I think Akin invites us to try and imagine the backgrounds of people so there will be less misunderstanding. This view is symbolized by Lotte a German student who decides to help Ayten a Turkish political activist who fled Turkey. She doesn't know the Turkish girl but just wants to help her because the girl has nowhere to go. This quest even brings her to the shores of Istanbul a city where East meets West in the most literal way.In the end 'Auf der anderen Seite' is a story of love and hope which is most endearing and sheds a refreshing light on the global trend of clashing cultures.

	schema:reviewBody "Auf der anderen Seite 2007 written and directed by Faith Akin was shown in the U.S. with the title The Edge of Heaven. This is a powerful and moving drama that interweaves the stories of six peoplea father and son and two motherdaughter pairs. The father and son are from Turkey but live in Germany. At the outset of the movie one of the mother daughter pairs is separated with the mother in Germany and the daughter in Turkey. The other motherdaughter pair are Germans living in Germany. By the end of the movie for various reasons each of the six has traveled from one country to the other.Faith Akin himself a German of Turkish heritage obviously understands and is comfortable in both worlds. Some of the characters in the film make the transition from one culture to the other seamlessly but some suffer from extreme culture shock and all of them are changed. The acting is uniformly excellent. I particularly admired Nurgl Yesilay as a Turkish student and radical and Patrycia Ziolkowska as the young German woman who befriends her. Fassbinder's muse the incomparable Hanna Schygulla has possibly the most difficult role of the six and as always she is outstanding.We saw that film at the Rochester High Falls International Film Festival but it will work well on a small screen. This is an extraordinary film and it's definitely worth finding and viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Auf der anderen Seite 2007 written and directed by Faith Akin was shown in the U.S. with the title The Edge of Heaven. This is a powerful and moving drama that interweaves the stories of six peoplea father and son and two motherdaughter pairs. The father and son are from Turkey but live in Germany. At the outset of the movie one of the mother daughter pairs is separated with the mother in Germany and the daughter in Turkey. The other motherdaughter pair are Germans living in Germany. By the end of the movie for various reasons each of the six has traveled from one country to the other.Faith Akin himself a German of Turkish heritage obviously understands and is comfortable in both worlds. Some of the characters in the film make the transition from one culture to the other seamlessly but some suffer from extreme culture shock and all of them are changed. The acting is uniformly excellent. I particularly admired Nurgl Yesilay as a Turkish student and radical and Patrycia Ziolkowska as the young German woman who befriends her. Fassbinder's muse the incomparable Hanna Schygulla has possibly the most difficult role of the six and as always she is outstanding.We saw that film at the Rochester High Falls International Film Festival but it will work well on a small screen. This is an extraordinary film and it's definitely worth finding and viewing.";

But this one has Hanna Schygulla magnificent as the bereaved mother of a young woman who goes astray for love. And instead of two people with wildly disorganized lives it has six people who come in pairs whose lives crisscross unawares. All go back and forth between Germany and Turkeyas they must because Akin is himself a man partly German and partly Turkish.Akin's scenario is ingenious enough to have won the Best Screenplay award at Cannes and like Head On's isn't short on turbulent and surprising events. It unfolds like a collection of neatly intertwined short stories. An old man in Bremen who's Turkish Tuncel Kurtiz goes to a prostitute in a blonde wig the appealing Nursel Kse. She turns out to be Turkish herself. He revisits her and persuades her to give up the oldest profession and come and live with him he promises to pay her as much as she's been making as a woman of easy virtue. He has a nice place with an enclosed garden where one can dine and enjoy the vines and tomato plants. And he's a good cook. But he's crude and reckless. He wins and loses at the races. He's also a drunken brawler and on his first night with the lady in his house his overindulgence brings on a heart attack. She sticks with him but when he's back from the hospital still smoking and drinking he fights her and accidentally kills her. His son Nejat Baki Davrak is a professor of German. We see him in a lecture citing Goethe's disapproval of revolution. We don't know it yet but at that very moment a young Turkish woman who's a revolutionary on the run Nurgl Yesilay is sleeping in the lecture hall. The prostitute has a daughter in Turkey and after she dies Nejat as recompense goes back to Istanbul to try to find her. Maybe eventually he meets her. But the markers of the screenplay are the deaths of the prostitute and of the young German woman called Lotte Patrycia Ziolkowska whose mother is Hanna Schygulla.You can organize all that happens in your mind in various waysas a study in contrasts and parallelisms of generations as an examination like Head On of conflicts between cultures and between inner moral law and external social pressures as an ingenious depiction of that modern sense that everybody is connected yet also doomed to isolation. Or you can just say it means people do the damnedest things. What's certain is that even with our attention divided among more central characters this time Akin still knows how to make us care about them. We have to because they feel complex and unpredictable and their relationships are fresh and explosive. His images are open and his movement is wonderfully fluid. One scene slides into the next with such smoothness and inevitability that it's only later you may feel like these dovetailing moments though how they're filmed is nifty are a little too pateven as the ways relationships are constantly reshaped alternatively through luck coincidence or unbridled emotion are curiously moving. Akin has caught something of Kielslowski and also of Haneke. And the way people shift identities may even owe something to the Antonioni of The Passenger. Like these big boys of European cinema he reaches for great themes but he also tells a good story. There's something for everyone here though some in the audience may not know what to make of it all. This is the kind of movie like Head On you want to see more than once.Shown as part of the series Film Comment Selects at Lincoln Center New York February 23 2008 this will go into limited release in the US May 21 2008.".

Many compare it to Babel but that is superficial. Unlike in Babel and many similar movies where threads connecting the three separate stories are haphazard the lives of the six protagonists in the three stories of The edge of heaven are truly interwoven.

German fatherandson pair has Ali the common earthy retired father and Nejat educated college professor son. Their relationship could have been at least civil and cordial had not the old man's sexual pursuits become increasingly irritating to Nejat. Also German are Susanne and Lotte in a situation that is not at all uncommon mother's tradition values against somewhat rebellious daughter. The third pair is Turkish mother Yeter who is very easy to sympathize with a woman who wants so much for her daughter to escape the vicious cycle of poverty and poor education that she goes to German to become a prostitute to finance Ayten's education back in Turkey. The cruel irony is while Yeter's secret is harmless Ayten's is not she is a member of a militant underground resistance group.The way these three pairs are connect is quite complex but not it any way contrived. It will do both the writer and the audience an injustice to try to describe the award winning plot in the context of IMDb user comments. Suffices to say that the two main connecting points are that YeterAli and AytenLotte. In the first case after providing sex service to Ali for a period of time Yeter comes to live with him as his woman. In the second case Ayten trying to seek political asylum in Germany encounters Lotte and they become lovers. These two situations expectedly meet with disapprovals from Nejat and Susanne respectively. Two accidental deaths set off a chain of complicated events that see the remaining four characters converging in Turkey.The story is told in a simple straightforward fashion that set European films apart from staple Hollywood. Simple here is complimentary as you'll understand after having indigestion from artificial formulaic Hollywood treatments e.g. blood seeping out from a body on the floor to make sure that the audience understand that its occupant is dead. This does not mean that cinematic montages are not used. It's just that they are not overused and are used only at the right time. One example is when Susanne is in a hotel room in Turkey at the beginning of the third chapter there are written chapter titles on the screen at the start of each. Another is the voiceover announcing refusal to Ayten's asylum request overlapping with Lotte's argument with Susanne before leaving home for Turkey.Spoiler warning notwithstanding I have already said too much about the movie that is much better left to be enjoyed by the audience as the stories unfold.".

Simple here is complimentary as you'll understand after having indigestion from artificial formulaic Hollywood treatments e.g. blood seeping out from a body on the floor to make sure that the audience understand that its occupant is dead. This does not mean that cinematic montages are not used. It's just that they are not overused and are used only at the right time. One example is when Susanne is in a hotel room in Turkey at the beginning of the third chapter there are written chapter titles on the screen at the start of each. Another is the voiceover announcing refusal to Ayten's asylum request overlapping with Lotte's argument with Susanne before leaving home for Turkey.Spoiler warning notwithstanding I have already said too much about the movie that is much better left to be enjoyed by the audience as the stories unfold.";

The first compliment that I have to make is that although his films are multicultural cinema the films only consider religion as being one part to their whole which is something special if you look at global discussions about ethnic problems. Many migrants fight a constant battle between their old and new home. In the end they don't really feel home anywhere. Main character Nejat Aksu played by Baki Davrak is a prime example for this ambivalence. He's not fully able and willing to leave the Turkish elements in him behind and for that is able to see the conflict between identities even clearer. Ayten ztrk's character on the other hand lets us experience what freedom of opinion really means. Nurgl Yesilay delivers a very fine performance in this role.".

Akin builds his narrative on elaborate coincidences yet his characters are drawn with such nuance that we willingly go where he takes us without questioning. Though The Edge of Heaven is a realistic drama shifts in the timeline and dreamlike visions introduce surreal touches that serve to enhance its intensity.Moving between Germany and Turkey The Edge of Heaven is divided into three sections two revealing a crucial plot point in its intertitle.

He is close to his father Ali Tuncel Turkiz a lonely widower who is a frequent visitor to the redlight districts of Hamburg. When he falls for Yeter Nursel Kose a Turkish prostitute he asks her to move in with him and have sex whenever he wants. When Yeter is intimidated by two Turkish fundamentalists on the bus because of her profession she decides to accept his offer.

In The Edge of Heaven the 34yearold Akin has vaulted into the elite group of international directors whose films have a universal appeal.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that speak to your soul directly. Excellent scenario and directing a wonderful use of the helplessness and missing half theme and a strong moral implication related to today's ideological arena.The complex story is wellwoven and under the control of the scenarist. The storyline revolves around four or five characters creating a couple of different stories that go on. No one among the characters are aware of the full complexity of the situation they are in and they keep missing their destiny by a couple of seconds or by a couple of meters. The audience is fully aware of what is going on and this creates a feeling of helplessness. One main theme therefore is that Helplessness in the face of chance meetings  or lack thereof.One of the main characters arguably the main character Nejat Aksu acted by Baki Davrak is reminiscent of the writerdirector himself. He is a professor in a German university and his emotional or behavioral ties with his rural Turkish background are split. As a loner the audience does not hear much his opinions or feelings on the issue we have to judge by small changes of expression in close shootups. He has lost his Mediterranean expressiveness. In contrast Lutte's acted by Patrycia Ziolkowska behavior becomes more and more aggressive as she moves geographically and mentally towards Turkey.One note of interest is that all characters have a missing half somewhere else in the movie but fail to get to that half and even die trying. Nejat Aksu has lost a mother and then loses his father. The maternal figure is there with Lutte but Lutte is missing the father and a certain strength of will to take steps as she later confesses in her journal. Ayten ztrk is also missing the mother probably she is missing a lover as well  she is unrested  she is in fact a person you likes to struggle as commented by Susanne Staub. Lutte's mother Susanne Staub by Hanna Schygulla is missing a daughter eventually. This contributes to the feeling of helplessness but also adds a moral tone implying that solutions to our life problems can be lying closer than it would appear to us.A very touching scene in the movie is when Susanne is in front of the window watching the Muslim man walk to the prayer. She is explained by Nejat Aksu the significance of the festivities and she realizes that she is closer to Turkey than she imagines. In that scene she takes a step towards making a posthumous peace with her daughter which she direly needs. The scene is symbolic in the sense that it reflects the political arena.The writer and the director Akin is an acute observer. The contrast between Istanbul and Bremen are first laid out with striking effectiveness then the similarities in the human emotional range are brought out to contribute to the reconciliation towards the end. In effect the audience is presented with a moral tone To find the missing half you have to actually travel geographically and mentally to the other half and make your peace with it. The other half is of course Germany and Turkey West and East.The end is particular Two important questions are unresolved. Are we then to assume that our characters are lost without hope? No because Susanne Staub and Nejat Aksu have already taken the first steps to reconcile with their missing half.One possibly negative point about the movie is that the director's image of the Turkish police force and lawyers is outdated by probably twenty five years. However this is to be overlooked for the sake of cinematic language and the story.The movie is a rare piece. It tells a story of lost chances with an ongoing theme of missing half and miss by a couple of inches. However we have reconciliation at the end creating a feeling of optimism but also unresolved issues which helps to add the moral tone of You have to go towards your missing half to reconcile.".

As a loner the audience does not hear much his opinions or feelings on the issue we have to judge by small changes of expression in close shootups. He has lost his Mediterranean expressiveness. In contrast Lutte's acted by Patrycia Ziolkowska behavior becomes more and more aggressive as she moves geographically and mentally towards Turkey.One note of interest is that all characters have a missing half somewhere else in the movie but fail to get to that half and even die trying. Nejat Aksu has lost a mother and then loses his father. The maternal figure is there with Lutte but Lutte is missing the father and a certain strength of will to take steps as she later confesses in her journal. Ayten ztrk is also missing the mother probably she is missing a lover as well  she is unrested  she is in fact a person you likes to struggle as commented by Susanne Staub. Lutte's mother Susanne Staub by Hanna Schygulla is missing a daughter eventually. This contributes to the feeling of helplessness but also adds a moral tone implying that solutions to our life problems can be lying closer than it would appear to us.A very touching scene in the movie is when Susanne is in front of the window watching the Muslim man walk to the prayer. She is explained by Nejat Aksu the significance of the festivities and she realizes that she is closer to Turkey than she imagines. In that scene she takes a step towards making a posthumous peace with her daughter which she direly needs. The scene is symbolic in the sense that it reflects the political arena.The writer and the director Akin is an acute observer. The contrast between Istanbul and Bremen are first laid out with striking effectiveness then the similarities in the human emotional range are brought out to contribute to the reconciliation towards the end. In effect the audience is presented with a moral tone To find the missing half you have to actually travel geographically and mentally to the other half and make your peace with it. The other half is of course Germany and Turkey West and East.The end is particular Two important questions are unresolved. Are we then to assume that our characters are lost without hope? No because Susanne Staub and Nejat Aksu have already taken the first steps to reconcile with their missing half.One possibly negative point about the movie is that the director's image of the Turkish police force and lawyers is outdated by probably twenty five years. However this is to be overlooked for the sake of cinematic language and the story.The movie is a rare piece. It tells a story of lost chances with an ongoing theme of missing half and miss by a couple of inches. However we have reconciliation at the end creating a feeling of optimism but also unresolved issues which helps to add the moral tone of You have to go towards your missing half to reconcile.";

The events even when they have a comic twist are so heady and difficult they could make whole films each by themselves but here they work through several related sections within a single tapestry. As strong as the acting is the core of the movie is the series of events the plot. You'll see early on some coincidences beyond reason making the plot almost Shakespearean and therefore artful. The roles are each character are just a little surprising just enough to keep us curious yet each character represents a distinctive aspect of the crosscurrents of German and Turkish cultures and worlds such as old people assimilating and young people refusing to assimilate. Even more than the mixing of Mexican and American worlds here in the U.S. this is a dramatic and more contentious melding fraught with all those dangers of misunderstanding we hear in the news every day.

It would be interesting to know what kind of film Alan Parker would make about Turkish prisons today. The Kurdish minority is treated badly in Turkey and there are probably horrid stories of injustice to be told but would anyone in the USA be interested in a mistreated Kurd as opposed to a sandyhaired white boy from Long Island?

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Auf der anderen Seite Edge of Heavenin a cinema in Bremen not too far from where some of the scenes in the first part have been shot. Well if you have to know it they are the ones with the prostitutes and the shoe shop . I am a huge fan of Faith Akin's work ever since I saw Head On Gegen die Wand which is in my view one of the best films that has come out of Germany in a decade and certainly could hold its own against Oscar winner The Lives of Others. If you have a chance to get it on DVD I would strongly recommend to rent it out.Auf der anderen Seite treads on similar ground like his earlier film. His protagonists experience an amour fous an unsuitable love and its subsequent loss the loneliness of being between two cultures and belonging to neither and the eternal search for the other place the place where you belong and can be happy. But Auf der anderen Seite is far more ambitious than Gegen die Wand as it tells these themes through six different protagonists whose lives are intertwined two mothers and two daughters and a father and a son. Auf der anderen Seite means in this context also to understand the other side your parent or your child. And it also means the understanding between Turkish and German people who are the main protagonists here. However it is the film's ambitious multiprotagonist structure that prevents it from being truly great and moving. If you think Traffic was constructed think again. In this film there are even more coincidences most of them unlucky. The most annoying side effect of this multistructure is the fact the characters stay rather flat and feel constructed despite the good acting. It doesn't really help that Faith Akin's dialogue seems to be rather on the wooden side to me  at least some of the parts in German and English my Turkish isn't up to scratch. I think the film could have been improved if Akin would have explored the characters more than the different themes of the plot. To give one example among many the main male protagonist Nejat is of Turkish origin but a university professor for German literature in Hamburg. His father is a guest worker of humble origins in Bremen who takes up with a prostitute. In their relationship class culture and language are clashing. Nejat is a fascinating character not only standing between GermanTurkish identities but also between middleworking class and defending his sensitivity against the macho attitude of his father. Even a sexual rivalry is hinted at. This father and son couple is brilliantly and completely believable played by Baki Davran and Tuncel Kurtizare but once they get separated in the middle of the film their plot line simply disappears until the very end. We don't know what motivates Nejat to move to Istanbul or to completely break off with his father. Or why he suddenly decides to make up with him again and searches him out. And even then Akin denies us the emotional climax of the reunion by letting the film end with the son waiting for his father to come back from fishing. An elegant open ending but a far cry from the raw emotion that characterised Head On. However one of the major disappointments in the second half of the film is Hanna Schygulla Fassbinder's muse who is strangely wooden throughout her scenes with Nejat the son and her daughter's lover Ayten. At no point is she able to carry the film's high drama. But enough of complaints. Even a slightly failed Faith Akin film is a good film. It's never boring and so beautifully shot that I see my hometown from a different point of view now. And one scene will stick in my mind a moving car and a moving tram close to each other the people inside so close and still so far. Just like in real life.".

Throw in an odd romance some spectacular Tuscan scenery actually wonderful cinematography all the way through a slowmoving but involving storyline and one of this generation's mostinteresting actresses Cate Blanchett and you have a film worth investigating.A word of warning especially to younger people this film might be too slow for what you are used to seeing. If you want action skip this. This film is more for people into visuals and a different story. Subtitles also turn off a lot of people and you need them here.As someone who just loves great visuals this is an astonishing piece of work  just magnificent to view. I also appreciated the director's sky cam with some wonderful aerial shots.The R rating comes from a very very brief sex scene which doesn't involve the major characters. There is almost no profanity in here. A strange film to label but it sure is a visual treat. I liked it even more on the second viewing".

Three Colors' was as much about French filmmaking and the French national character as it was the stories within. That business about watching with the watching creating accidents of fate...He planned a similar trilogy that worked with Italian themes in life but especially Italian filmmaking. Italian films are about the freshness of captured impulse about excessive emotion and excessive theatricality expressing that emotion for the screen. About characters never situations. About talking often with overlapping threads. About the magic of place created by the magic of people.Kieslowskis method like Ang Lee's method is to come ever so close to the soul of the thing but be different in ways that matter but don't necessarily show. That's why you end up haunted by something that seems ordinary.In this case we have the importance of family but it is outside of the peer pressure that drives the thing in Tuscany. We have the magic of the land but it is magic that the characters enter by transcending it rather than the normal' way of creating it in the soil by presence.But most of all we have passion almost exclusively without words. We have love driving fate and not the other way around. We have emotional minimalism down to the music. We have Griebe's odd colors like frescos instead of real earth. We have always the threat that this is really magical rather than real.To make this work requires an actress who can pull the entire world with her. The less noise she makes the more we hear. Cate Blanchett is one of the three most powerful multilayered actresses alive and possibly the only one whose scalp could become the whole landscape. Watch how much she does with so little actual motion.

I on the other hand consider it to be a matter of her great performances along with those of her fellow actors of course. But she is the one common denominator. Whether it be drama comedy period pieces or whatever you can always count on an outstanding performance from this lady. And Heaven is no exception. I can't quite label her the Best Actress of her generation but she's certainly in the top 3 in my opinion. And as is usually the case a fine performance by Giovanni Ribisi her costar in another movie The Gift. I rated this movie as a 10. Check it out and see if you agree and even if you don't you won't be disappointed.".

It doesn't hold weight for character motivation at all. Meanwhile Ribbisi's character is believable but the situation becomes downtrodden and clichd  and the storyline simply throws in the towel towards the end giving up.

She wants to blow him to bits but her bomb ends up killing four innocents. Now she merely wants to finish her revenge. but imprisoned she'll need help. Enter young guard Filippo Giovanni Ribisi.Hmm. you see once you've got the plot. the movie doesn't go anywhere. It's a thrillerrevenge story. and then it tries to morph into a love story. It's aimless though a headless chicken of a beast crashing about the place and circling all around itself thematically. Character's motivations shift without any real good reason given Blanchett wants to own up for her crimes and then does not. Why? The characters are grand enough but the relationship between Ribisi and Blanchett is entirely unconvincing  it's portrayed more as a kid crush that Ribisi has. This is the movie's biggest flaw  it's not going anywhere and ends up crashing perhaps the opening sequence is a meta commentary on how the plot drives itself into a nothing of a dead end. It's not like that it's boring it's more you're left at the end going Well what was the point of all that?' That's not good.Acting? Blanchett is an acquired taste  very subdued much more sublime than a lot of other Hollywood faces. Here it suits her fine  she's a tired defeated woman with a small bit of steel still inside her. She does tend to drift through the movie a bit as if not really sure how to grasp her character. Ribisi again is good although a bit too freshfaced to carry any real chemistry with his costar. At least he gets to talk for a large bit in a language other than English.So is there anything to redeem this? Yup  the photography. Mmm  tasty! Director Tom Tykwer has some utterly wonderful shots  check out the gorgeous train motion shot or the simply stunning twilight embrace later on. There're also some superb aerial and isometric shots. It's great for setting the atmosphere and distracting you from the aimless drifting plot. It's all accompanied by a simple but pleasing musical score  basic piano but mood setting without being distracting. The movie is also not too long so it doesn't overstay its welcome so you do not become too irritated with its lack of focus.Heaven' is if nothing else a breath of fresh air. It looks great has a nice and sedate pace that is too often lacking in the flashbang of the modern flick. The weak script means it cannot be anything ever great but its worth a perusal if you fancy a change from the mundane. 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heaven had almost all the ingredients to make a great film A good cast Cate Blanchett giving a superb performance and some beautiful cinematography. But the plot which is arguably the most important item on the list was one of the most unconvincing ill thought out stories I've ever seen on film.spoilersIn order to accept the story and follow it you have to accept the two main characters who are both reprehensible. Philippa murdered 4 innocent people because of her ill thought out cowardly assassination attempt on a drug dealer. We the viewer are supposed to let this slide because a. She didn't mean to and b. This drug dealer indirectly caused the deaths of 2 people close to her.Filippo falls for her and decides to help her break out of custody. He has a bit of an excuse in getting her free he knows that people high up in the police establishment are complicit in covering up the actions of the drug dealer that Phillipa was trying to expose.That is he could be excused if he broke her out of custody in order to uncover the truth about the crocked cops. That's not what happens he falls pathetically in love with her at first sight and devotes himself to keeping her away from the police for his own selfish reasons.Phillipa states that she will answer for her actions she just wants to murder that evil drug dealer. Filippo dutifully obliges with her wish and assists her in murdering the dealer. At which point Phillipa should now turn herself in if she has one shred of integrity. She doesn't they both continue to run from the police.Filippo's father Remo is equally unbelievable. Police officer all his life and head of the police constabulary in Rome accepts his sons choice for aiding and fleeing with a fugitive because he is in love.

	onyx:emotionText "Heaven had almost all the ingredients to make a great film A good cast Cate Blanchett giving a superb performance and some beautiful cinematography. But the plot which is arguably the most important item on the list was one of the most unconvincing ill thought out stories I've ever seen on film.spoilersIn order to accept the story and follow it you have to accept the two main characters who are both reprehensible. Philippa murdered 4 innocent people because of her ill thought out cowardly assassination attempt on a drug dealer. We the viewer are supposed to let this slide because a. She didn't mean to and b. This drug dealer indirectly caused the deaths of 2 people close to her.Filippo falls for her and decides to help her break out of custody. He has a bit of an excuse in getting her free he knows that people high up in the police establishment are complicit in covering up the actions of the drug dealer that Phillipa was trying to expose.That is he could be excused if he broke her out of custody in order to uncover the truth about the crocked cops. That's not what happens he falls pathetically in love with her at first sight and devotes himself to keeping her away from the police for his own selfish reasons.Phillipa states that she will answer for her actions she just wants to murder that evil drug dealer. Filippo dutifully obliges with her wish and assists her in murdering the dealer. At which point Phillipa should now turn herself in if she has one shred of integrity. She doesn't they both continue to run from the police.Filippo's father Remo is equally unbelievable. Police officer all his life and head of the police constabulary in Rome accepts his sons choice for aiding and fleeing with a fugitive because he is in love. He even provides them with a chunk of money and offers to help them escape.The final scene is hardly worth explaining the police tighten the net around the duo and they again seemingly escape to yet another slow motion piano scored scene.

Unfortunately I found it rather boring. I should have seen it coming. Tykwer best known for his quick action montages seems to have tried to mimic Kieslowski's long and pensive style to no avail. The story is thin and fairly uneventful. The long pensive shots I was talking about are stretched to awkward proportions. The acting is alright but not terribly special. The cinematography was good but not terribly interesting. I would have expected more from Tykwer. Unfortunately I have to give Heaven a 610 and I think my grade is somewhat biased due to my appreciation of Tykwer's other works.".

Those in the latter group have taken the morality issue' very much to heart denouncing the diabolical portrayal of a killer of four innocent people as the hero. The accent on innocent' however opens up news grounds for debate of morality. Would it be assumed then that the killing of the drug dealer is a good thing? How about those who would take the view that it's a crime and a sin to take any life? Or is there a fine distinction somewhere as to under what circumstances a vigilant killing is justifiable? You see my point.The first half of the film is intense with frequent use of a slow moving camera to capture the moods. Love or hate few can deny the mesmerising cinematographic beauty of the second half that takes the audience to an idyllic Italian countryside. In some cases knowing in advance what the film is about helps in the enjoyment of it. For Heaven however I wish I had not heard anything about it and would therefore be able to take in the amazement and wonder as each frame unfolds. Even this foreknowledge however did not diminish in any way the devastating impact of the magical silhouette' scene. The audience in the cinema in awe and wonder responded in kind to the absolute silence that accompanied the scene.even the loathsome squeaking of the chair throughout the film in the next block came to a complete and total stop.No doubt members of the audience would make their free associations with the various images and symbols in the film.

Maybe because of the ethereal light my free association went to the baby in the womb at the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey.In a film so rich in symbolism it is a delightful surprise to see such a downtoearth and damned touching scene of the father saying goodbye to them particularly his kindness to this woman whom he could have very easily hated for taking away his son.On the cast nothing I can say is good enough for Blanchett. The delightful surprise is Giovanni Ribisi whom I though is an Italian meaning physically in Italy who happens to look familiar but later found out to have played an excellent supporting role in two recent movies Kendall in Basic and John in Lost in Translation which I saw only three days before Heaven.".

It is very different from the rest of Bergman's films I've seen but that does not make it failure for me. It is only Bergman's second film in English and it boasts an unusual for his films large budget Dino De Laurentis was a producer with enormous and elaborate sets. Bergman was able to recreate on the screen Germany Berlin of 1920th exactly how it was seen in the films of 1920th German directors  Fritz Lang's films come to mind first. Another film that The Serpent's Egg reminded me of was Bob Fosse's Cabaret  the theme of the Feast during the Time of Plague sounds very prominent in both films and the cabaret's musical numbers in Bergman's film could've came from Fosse's. I was very impressed by Liv Ullmann's singing and dancing in the beginning of the film  she can do anything.In spite of the film's obvious differences from Bergman's earlier work it explores many of his favorite themes. It is in part a political film about the helpless distressed and terrorized members of society that face the merciless and inevitable force of history and are perished without a trace in the process. Also like the earlier films The Serpent's Egg explores its characters' selfisolation inability to communicate their attempt to cope with the pain of living their despair fear and disintegration.The Serpent's Egg may not be a perfect film and a lot has been said about the abrupt and heavy handed ending the dialogs that don't always work and David Carradine's performance as a main character. Perfect or not I think it is an interesting visually always amazing cinematography by Sven Nykvist is above any praise and very honest and thorough study of the human condition in the unbearable situation. In the documentary 'Serpent's Egg Away From Home' 2004 Ingmar Bergman Liv Ullmann and David Carradine talk about making the film how it started and how and why it was so different. Liv said that couple of years ago she and Bergman had seen The Serpent's Egg for the first time and they both liked it. I am in a good company then because I believe that Serpent's Egg is an unforgettable film and everyone who was involved in making it should not be ashamed of it. I am yet to see a Bergman's film that I don't like.".

	schema:reviewBody "Highly unusual and underrated. Bergman says volumes about the future he saw before us in 1977 by returning to 1923 and making what to the casual observer seems to be a film about hindsight. What is most unusual about his treatment is that he completely abstains from moral judgment. He does not feel the need to point a finger and instruct the audience that the Nazis are bad. Dr. Vergerus is not portrayed as is suggested in another comment as a villain. In fact he is given all of the trademark qualities of a villain and then his sincerity and tenderness concerning subjects both tender his feelings for Liv Ullman's character and horrifically vile experiments are given the most comprehensive hearing in the film and serve as its marvelously conflicting centerpiece. He may be said to be the most emotional character in the film. In the end he must take his own life to escape hypocritical prosecution at the hands of a police inspector who will no doubt be a Nazi official in 10 years time. Vergerus' death as he views himself in a mirror slightly recalling Powell's Peeping Tom from another perspective is shockingly memorable to this day.Carradine is perfect and correct when he says on the DVD that Bergman didn't want a performance from him just his mystique. We spend much of the film simply on nearly blank reaction shots of his face and that's a good thing his very unlikeness makes him a perfect fit. Carradine is the target of much malice and scorn within the cinephile community but I can't quite figure out why unless it is simply his arrogance which I find a little charming. It might have to do with the mountain of junk movies he's been in. At least at the time he had given exceptional performances in Boxcar Bertha and Bound For Glory. With David in Kill Bill and Keith in Deadwood I hope that Robert Carradine will find some sort of project better than the Lizzie McGuire movie to remind us that in The Big Red One he kicked some tail. I don't ever expect to see them embraced by the mainstream just something that lets them be as good as they can be would be nice.Ullman gives an excellent performance. It requires her to do so many things that Bergman never had her do any other time from being a dancing sexpot to flying into a completely spontaneous outburst.Woody Allen certainly seems to have drawn inspiration from this film for his Shadows and Fog. The experiment footage is aggressively horrifying.The assessment that it was a failure in the eyes of Bergman is also mistaken. He said that it was a great disappointment to work on. This comment is illuminated by Liv Ullman on the DVD where she explains that it was the alien work environment that left him depressed and unsatisfied but that upon a recent viewing he found to his surprise that he was quite proud of the film. I personally found it very entertaining often surprising and simply a wonder at how Bergman was able for this film to completely sublimate his style to the demands of quite a different kind of picture but still make it his own.In its way it is a sort of prewar Third Man. It is not among his best but when your best are many of the best films ever made that's not a harsh judgment. It is more than just an oddity or an Altmanesque interesting failure.".

	schema:reviewBody "One can look at Ingmar Bergman's the Serpent's Egg as being many things but it should not be looked at through the same prism that one looks at say Through a Glass Darkly or Scenes from a Marriage. This is Bergman being 'cinematic' and for the lone moment of a career spent with lowbudget filmmaking and theater as his passions a bigbudget a Hollywood star and a sprawling canvas to work on was at his fingertips. It's also one of his few shots at not only an 'homage' kind of movie but also one in English one of only two. So it's the dark horse no pun intended when compared to the more oneonone based films. This time the star David Carradine is not only an acrobat but also in a city where the environment is grim to the point of a scarcity of hope amid the post WW1 German cityscape. It's not the kind of film in other words that'll make money in the mass US market coming off the high of Star Wars though it's been said that this film did make back it's money in Europe and then some. It's the kind of uncompromising vision that goes for broke and it's a fascinating journey.Carradine who is at his best with a certain style and downplayed quality that keeps him still cool today is an American in Berlin where his brother's just died in a rather grotesque fashion. This puts a certain immediate marker of doom over him and his sister in law played by Liv Ullman if for no other reason to see the film it's for her work as usual. Over the span of a week surprisingly so if not for the voice over one might feel it being longer amid the rain and nights and drunken stumbles and overheated moments Abel Rosenberg tries to deal with all that's going on. But there are stranger things lurking ahead with his upcoming job. This story is dealt with by Bergman in a curious way it SEEMS a little longer at times but it doesn't lose a certain momentum of stripping away its character's defenses bare. Even Carradine an actor who's mostly had a career as a largerthanlife kind of persona gets intense with his work here.Where Bergman gets entangled in everything he's got going on is a sense of structure to it. It's not the kind of 'soulsearching hell if I know if God can help' film but one more connected to the perverse lurid qualities of the control some people could have over these people at this point of time in the world. One could say it's connected stylistically with the films of Murnau and Lang however I would argue that more than half the time I did still feel like I was seeing a Bergman film with his part n parcel cinematographer Sven Nykvist expressing greatly what is there in the huge set constructed of 1922 Berlin. And because of this there's still the closeups and the surreality that's induced. But because there's so much to work with with sometimes overwhelming scenes like when Carradine walks into that bar loaded with people compact and tight or whenever there's a chase or 'danger' kind of moment for Rosenberg or just having to deal with large crowds or difficult lighting setups the narrative thread gets tangled up. The opening shot of the people walking in slowmotion is brilliant yet I didn't feel that same brilliance in the film.Several directors hit this kind of moment in careers where a largerthanusual concept is provided by the appropriate budget. That it's in English is unusual and though Bergman is functional in the language one can tell there's not the same fluidity in the writing at times. However I don't discredit the Serpent's Egg as this horrible quagmire of a picture as I was almost led on to believe. It still contains some extraordinary stuff like the Cabaret scenes as weird and compelling as some of the stuff in the Silence. Or the terror instilled when Heinz Bennent's character shows Rosenberg the 'footage' towards the end of the film. But it's also one of the more difficult films of Bergman's I've seen that moves at a pace that's postmodern and not too steeped in the 20's that is one of its strong points at times in theme while resisting going for the easy Hollywood bigbudget kind of moviemaking. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "This must have seemed like such a great idea at the time.  Put Ingmar Bergman arguably one of the finest filmmakers of our time at the helm of a bigbudget international horror film starring the notable David Carradine and his candonowrong leading lady Liv Ullmann.  As a concept it's faultless as a film it's amazing this has as many moments as it does.Taking place over a period of one week November 311 in 1923 Berlin The Serpent's Egg zeroes in on two desperate characters who are slowly overtaken by the horror of their situation.  The country has virtually come apart around them the German mark is practically worthless unemployment is astronomical and Adolf Hitler is laying the plans for his first attempt to seize power.  Abel Rosenberg Carradine and Manuela Ullmann are outofwork circus performers whose third partner Max Abel's brother commits suicide in the opening of the film.  The rest of the movie concerns itself with their gradual awakening to the horrors perpetuated by their current employer Vergerus Heinz Bennett.Actually the rest of the movie concerns itself with taking as hysterical and pessimistic view of life as possible.  While not entirely unfamiliar to Bergman's fans here the gloom is so allpervasive and the time and place so alien that the film is often nearly impossible to sit through.  It becomes instead a movie of moments each breaking out of the general tedium to grab the viewer by the throat.The opening is brilliant and promises something really special. Likewise the ratinfested piles of garbage are not something the viewer is likely to forget.  But the conclusion they build up to is disappointing and unenlightening.  Worst of all we know no more about the characters at the end of the film than we did at the outset Liv Ullmann whose performance is wonderful considering the circumstances has virtually nonexistent character development to work with.Any fan of Bergman should try to see this once if only for the light it sheds on his other films of the period and his personal turmoil at that moment in time.  Casual viewers need not apply.".

As a concept it's faultless as a film it's amazing this has as many moments as it does.Taking place over a period of one week November 311 in 1923 Berlin The Serpent's Egg zeroes in on two desperate characters who are slowly overtaken by the horror of their situation.  The country has virtually come apart around them the German mark is practically worthless unemployment is astronomical and Adolf Hitler is laying the plans for his first attempt to seize power.  Abel Rosenberg Carradine and Manuela Ullmann are outofwork circus performers whose third partner Max Abel's brother commits suicide in the opening of the film.  The rest of the movie concerns itself with their gradual awakening to the horrors perpetuated by their current employer Vergerus Heinz Bennett.Actually the rest of the movie concerns itself with taking as hysterical and pessimistic view of life as possible.  While not entirely unfamiliar to Bergman's fans here the gloom is so allpervasive and the time and place so alien that the film is often nearly impossible to sit through.  It becomes instead a movie of moments each breaking out of the general tedium to grab the viewer by the throat.The opening is brilliant and promises something really special. Likewise the ratinfested piles of garbage are not something the viewer is likely to forget.  But the conclusion they build up to is disappointing and unenlightening.  Worst of all we know no more about the characters at the end of the film than we did at the outset Liv Ullmann whose performance is wonderful considering the circumstances has virtually nonexistent character development to work with.Any fan of Bergman should try to see this once if only for the light it sheds on his other films of the period and his personal turmoil at that moment in time.  Casual viewers need not apply.";

	schema:reviewBody "When asked by an interviewer about his notorious 1969 flop A Place for Lovers' Italian director Vittorio de Sica who had previously made some of the most influential films in the history of cinema simply replied I'm an artist. Artists make mistakes.' It was an honest straightforward statement that acknowledged the necessity of failure in the business of moviemaking. Filmmakers have their boundaries and when those lines are crossed it is only appropriate that they are shocked and prodded back into their proper place.Like de Sica Ingmar Bergman has made many stunning films that skillfully explore the facets of the human soul. The Serpent's Egg' is not one of them. This is a clumsy heavyhanded mess that fails to find anything interesting in its subject. I'm sure this story has something interesting to say about the suffering caused by war poverty and bigotry but Bergman doesn't seem to know how to translate his own script's ambitions to the screen.Certainly there are elements present that always make for an interesting Bergman film family tragedy frustrated love a protagonist fearing for his own sanity and a hint of the supernatural. But these elements do not flow together as they did in Bergman's previous films on the whole it comes off feeling static lacking the urgency so desperately needed. Character motivations are frequently illogical and the more interesting figures such as a priest played by James Whitmore are given too little screen time while the more frustrating characters are given too much. The film is also weighed down by banal dialogue that spells out the emotions of the characters in an insulting and sometimes laughable way. The performances don't help either to call them overwrought' is a dire understatement. David Carradine spends much of his time posturing and pouting Liv Ullmann shrieks her lines enough to set your teeth on edge and Heinz Bennett scowls and sneers his way through his final confrontation with Carradine just to make sure there are no doubts that his character is the villain.The only really effective element to The Serpent's Egg' is the atmosphere thanks largely to photographer Sven Nykvist who gives the smokefilled cabaret halls a lurid grimy feel. The recreation of 1923 Berlin is convincing effectively portraying a society that justifies evil by using it to pull itself out of poverty. But the visuals are a thin shell that cannot hide the emptiness of the drama. Perhaps Bergman's vision was at odds with the demands of producer Dino de Laurentiis who at the time was better known for action fluff such as Mandingo' Death Wish' and the 1976 remake of King Kong.' Or perhaps Bergman who made his most personal films in and around his Swedish homeland did not know how to transplant his ideas into so foreign a setting. In any case Bergman like de Sica later acknowledged his mistake' in his autobiography Images' where he rightly described the film as one of the most disappointing experiences of his career. The Serpent's Egg' is only of interest if you want to see what results when a talented artist pushes his art in the wrong direction.".

This side of the movie feels a bit like another bleak 70s artifact Soylent Green. When David Carradine gets  at last  hired as an archivist in a sinister clinic the viewer's interest is piqued.However Carradine is saddled with a sisterinlaw Liv Ullman who comes along with a different set of scenes that recall Cabaret without the acrid verve of the original. Liv Ullman tries hard but she is truly miscast. Jane Birkin would have been perfect in this role.The dialog is poorly written and gives the movie the choppy quality that everyone has objected to. The lines sound translated unnatural and David Carradine can't be faulted for sounding lost.The big budget is well spent and the film is not boring nor pretentious. Some effects are in poor taste the opening credits and an excruciating scene in a brothel.I suspect that The Serpent's Egg would have a better reputation today if it had been signed by a lesser director say George Pan Cosmatos.

Fear allowed us to meekly accept the chipping away of our own civil rights and privacy and also government sponsored torture.It also gives us a glimpse at one of Hitler's truisms which is that if he could have a person at age 7 then that person would be a Nazi for life. The experimenting Doctor restates this in his observations that the sons and daughters of the defeated German populace will be the ones who create the new German society of which he already is a part with his inhumane human experiments.Of course all this is done with hindsight so how can it be wrong? It can't but then it's still a good review of a period in Germany that many Americans know nothing about and should learn if they want the answers to the question of how Naziism came to be.

Objectivity is a must.David Carradine never made a good film but a good director can use a bad actor. Indeed think of Welles using Heston and Leigh in Touch of Evil in fact Carradine's commentary on the MGM DVD resembles Heston's comments on working with Welles. And had this been a svenkfilm with a minuscule budget Bergman probably could have although he was much more of an actor's director than Welles was.But it's hard to figure out what Bergman was really after with this and we can only assume that he was too overwhelmed with the size of the crew and perhaps associated his old films with his estranged home country driving him to similarly cast off his previous ways. But this is a portrait a period piece. Fear and paranoia are at large the dialogue makes this VERY explicit and virtually every clich aspect of the political thrillers from the early 70s are implemented.Probably the most intentional and most admirable aspect of the film is how it parallels the filmmaking styles with those contemporary to the setting. This is an intriguing idea adapted by Merhige for Shadow of the Vampire. And Nykvist is certainly up to the task shooting hauntingly dark back alleyways and staircases. Caligari's influence is beyond the obvious mental institution associations but the way the character's paranoia beyond the horrid dialogue is transferred to the camera following him. Add the Pabstesquire cabaret scenes and this could be a fullfledged expressionist homage but it doesn't compensate for the banal script and the conspiracy undertones. Even the Camera the film's greatest aspect is polluted with 70sish zooms and focus pulls resembling something by Jewison or Siegel.Still we can allow a certain amount of artistic purging in the timeline of Bergman's career. And if this was a necessary step to Sonata and Fanny than it is certainly worth it.2 out of 5  Bad outweighs the good".

Even the Camera the film's greatest aspect is polluted with 70sish zooms and focus pulls resembling something by Jewison or Siegel.Still we can allow a certain amount of artistic purging in the timeline of Bergman's career. And if this was a necessary step to Sonata and Fanny than it is certainly worth it.2 out of 5  Bad outweighs the good";

David Carradine stars as a circus performer in 1923 Berlin who moves in with his sisterinlaw Liv Ullmann after his brother's suicide. The two make what money they can to survive but they both find it difficult being Jewish and things take an even worse turn when Carradine's character takes a job for a strange scientist. I've read several negative reviews of this film and it appears the movie was originally attacked for being disgusting or hard to watch because of the subject matter. I didn't find anything even the ending to be disturbing but I did find the movie hard to watch because it was really really boring me to death. I really couldn't believe I was watching a Bergman movie because everything in this movie came off as being flat to me. There wasn't a bit of life in this thing and I realized by the tenminute mark that I was going to be in trouble. One big problem is the entire story structure which just seems invisible to me. I'm not sure what Bergman was trying to do here and I've heard many say this film has more story than most of the director's films but I'd disagree. I didn't find any story here and to make matters worse is that Carradine really seems out of place. Not once did I buy him in this role and I don't think he delivered the power the movie needed especially in the more emotional scenes. I also found Ullmann to be rather bland which is the first time I've said that about her. The one saving grace is a major one and that's the cinematography by Sven Nykvist. I'd almost recommend this movie because of his work alone and that opening sequence where Carradine discovers his brother's body is certainly a beauty to look at.".

It is however awkwardly torn between the autuer's creative impulses and those of this film's corporate benefactors.First off it looks amazing. It's hard to believe nowadays but in the mid to late 1970s Hollywood studio money was being offered to European autuer's to bring their artistic prestige to Tinseltown. The film features lavish sets of Weimar Germany that are at least as impressive as those of say Cabaret. And damn does cinematographer and frequent Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist have a field day with a way bigger budget than he's used to. Swirling crane shots take in the many intricate spaces of this setworld with colors that are simultaneously garishly bright and menacing.The acting is problematic in that the quality disparity between the two lead performances is so large. Liv Ullman does a characteristically outstanding job while David Carradine is clownishly inept at providing what Bergman asks of him.In general I'd say this is a good movie until its final twenty minutes when the inertia between European and American tastes present throughout the work take a bizarre and disastrous turn. The filmmakers felt a need to force this narrative into an acceptable genre tropes. Being the 1970s the paranoiaconspiracy thriller was an acceptable studio genre what with such notable films as The Conversation The Parralex View and Three Days of the Condor. The Serpent's Egg is suddenly hijacked to fulfill the demands of that genre resulting in one of the most bizarrely inappropriate and abrupt movie endings of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ingmar Bergman didn't always make good films. He generally scripted his films himself and he obviously didn't notice or care when his scripts were not very good but filmed them anyway. Although not a bad film this is not an altogether good script.David Carradine as Abel Rosenberg an American Jew comes to Berlin in October 1923 and finds his brother Max dead in his bed having shot his brains out. That's how it begins.The brothers were circus trapeze artitsts and out of work and the dead brother had a girl friend separated Liv Ullmann who tries to take care of Abel which is not very easy since he is constantly misbehaving and spends every day and night drinking. The local police inspector Gert Froebe with whom he got in touch concerning his brother's suicide consults Abel over a number of mysterious and atrocious murders and Abel gets into a paranoic state believing himself to be a suspect which doesn't make his own situation any better.The character of the film is consistently depressive and the occasional interesting moments are the insights into the extreme and absurd conditions of Berlin and Germany in 1923 which gave rise to Hitler. This makes it a fascinating time documentary. The cabaret scenes lift the show to a bizarre level of gleeful decadence but they also gradually go from bad to worse especially when they are interrupted by power cuts and brutal razzias by hoodlums.Bergman made this film in Germany while he was in exile from Sweden chased out of the country by clumsy tax authorities and he admits himself in his autobiography that he like many Swedes were ardent Nazis before the war. So there are some interesting explanatory excuses and motives for the film.It emanates into a Kafkaesque nightmare into an archive of terrible human experimentation definitely heralding Nazism and ultimately into a very dramatic finale with Heinz Bennent another cavalier of Liv Ullman's which gives the film its meaning but you have to wait for it through many long and absurd scenes many without reason or meaning.".

My perception of this film is very awkward considering that I've watched ten of his films including Persona Wild Strawberries and Fanny and Alexander all of them magnificent but then he comes with an American project which is very difficult to relate with since it is different than anything the Swedish master ever done before. It is faster than his previous classics not much philosophical or methaporical and instead it's quite meaningless for the most of its entirely until we reach the conclusion and even faster than his other films it is tiresome at parts. Bergman is present in the beautiful cinematography by Sven Nykvist and the opening titles a trade mark that Woody Allen used to present his films.The story of a American trapezist David Carradine in German investigating the reasons behind his brother suicide during Weimar Republic's inflation crisis of 1923 might be a excellent material for a talented directorwriter like Bergman but here in his way of trying to built a suspense create horror and disgust in our eyes something got lost in the middle. A better construction of characters or make them interesting in some way anything. The historical background is very interesting but these characters are so driven by the automatic pilot that gets very difficult to really feel something for them and we should felt something for them. After all they lived during troubled times no jobs to find no food to eat to the point of eating horse meat yes one was killed offscreen but the corpse's presented in the film and there's brutality here and there in one of the most violent moments a Nazi officer beats a Jewsih cabaret owner by smashing his head on a table. Bergman is a master in not showing us the event we can only hear the head hitting something hard and we as audience get very uncomfortable feeling this guy pain. If the performances of Liv Ullmann and David Carradine keeps going like a switcher from good and bad each time they appear and disappear off the screen James Whitmore in just one scene gives a memorable moment playing a priest. Some of the supporting roles were more interesting than the main ones.The point made by the film at its conclusion was excellent but it came a little late. The idea of the seeds of 2nd World War being created in a horrific and strange experiment looked real very believable but Bergman could have explained more about it it sounded something weaker than what we were expecting from what Carradine wanted to discover about the other characters deaths which reminds of a important topic to be debated what in the world happened to the villain? Noises on the screen of police wanting to enter in his room then he looks into sort of a mirror then collapses and die? I really didn't get it! And to reach the brilliance of this film is to wait and wait and see strange and pointless scenes the funny brothel scene is one of them a lousy investigation made by Gert Frobe's character which includes arresting Carradine without evidences and more.I'm sounding a little bitter about The Serpent's Egg but in fact I enjoyed. The bitterness comes from my fears of giving the first thumbs down in a Bergman's film while watching it. When you see the whole picture you realize that it works it's well made has its flaws but it's not as great as his other classics. I can't complain much about this film because the director had many problems at the time tax evasion and things like that which made him get out of his country and a director must live of his films he needs to write and direct and this was a nice work for him he made the best of what was available to do for another kind of audience. Of course when you see Bergman  Carradine  Ullmann  Dino DeLaurentiis as producer you really want to see a spectacle of film and not a minor work almost forgettable. The potential for being great was there at everyone's hands but it's good anyway. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Upon getting to the end of The Serpent's Egg my first reaction was how could a director of Bergman's calibre have made a movie as bad as this? When I'd had time to reflect on the film I realised that it wasn't as awful as I'd first thought. The issue seems to be that when Bergman's name is given as the director of a movie we expect something close to perfection. But should we really have a preconceived belief that The Serpent's Egg will be an outstanding film simply because it's made by the same person who directed The Seventh Seal Wild Strawberries and Cries and Whispers? Surely each new film should be judged on its own merits or lack of rather than compared to earlier works?JewishAmerican Abel Rosenborg David Carradine is an outofwork circus performer living in Berlin in 1923. The city is in financial ruin following the German defeat in World War 1  inflation is at astronomical levels and unimaginable poverty exists everywhere. Abel discovers that his brother has committed suicide after writing a bitter and rather unsettling suicide note. He tracks down his brother's widow Manuela Liv Ullmann and finds her eking out an existence by working in a seedy nighttime cabaret act. Abel also meets an old acquaintance from his past Dr. Hans Vergerus Heinz Bennent who offers living quarters for him and Manuela. Soon Abel discovers that his brother is not the only person he knows that has died under strange circumstances  there are other acquaintances who have killed themselves or been murdered. A Berlin police inspector called Bauer Gert Frobe suggests that Abel is one of the leading suspects in the investigation into these unexplained deaths. Later Abel is offered a job working at the clinic of Dr. Vergerus. Times are hard and money is in such short supply that he readily accepts the job but gradually he learns that Vergerus is working on morally questionable often sadistic studies into human nature. His brother was part of these experiments which is why he killed himself and what Vergerus is doing anticipates the terrible atrocities that would later be carried out by the Nazis. Like an actual serpent's egg  which is transparent and allows us to see the fully formed snake before it hatches  we can see the future of Germany Nazismsnake in a sort of transparent membrane Dr. Vergerus's experimentsserpent's egg.The film suffers for several reasons. Carradine is somewhat miscast and struggles with the demands of his role but his character is so central to everything that his awkwardness fatally damages the film. The narrative is awfully convoluted and longwinded pursuing too many halfideas that come to nothing and there are moments when Bergman's difficulty in shooting an Englishlanguage picture is painfully apparent. Furthermore there are long periods when the film comes across as uninteresting. These flaws made me strongly dislike the film at first. But as already mentioned I gave myself a little time to reflect and found occasional redeeming features in particular the grimly realistic evocation of place and period a Berlin in dire ruin and its people lost in despair. Sven Nykvist as always works his magic in capturing this hopeless mood with his deliberately gloomy and depressing photography. Also there's Ullmann who gives a brilliant performance very different from anything Bergman asked of her in their other collaborations. The Serpent's Egg is not a very good film overall but it probably gets more of a raw deal because of Bergman's involvement. If anyone else had made it the negative comments would still be there but I doubt the film would be reviled as much as it has been.".

	schema:headline " Far from great but I don't think it's as bad as many say";
	schema:reviewBody "A film even most Bergman enthusiasts dislike. However as weak as it is I have to admit I found a lot to like about it. First the bad David Carradine is pretty awful. He's had an uneven career giving several very good performances and many bad ones. In the interviews included on the MGM DVD it seems clear that he was out of his element working with Bergman the featurette incidentally is a mustsee it's hilariously awkward especially with Carradine's positive take on the film and his own work in it and how it contradicts what Liv Ullmann has to say. Secondly this was the biggest budget Bergman ever worked with Dino de Laurentiis produced it when Bergman was hiding from Swedish authorities in Munich and it feels like a lot of his attention to the emotions of the film and possibly also David Carradine was diverted to the handling of the massive amounts of extras and the massive sets of 1920s Germany. Third the script takes too long to develop. The first half of the film can be excruciatingly slow and most of the good material comes in near the end. I fear that for most it'll be a matter of too little too late. The good well to counteract Carradine's crusty performance we have the fantastic Liv Ullmann. True she's a little hard to understand through her accent I should have probably also noted in the bad section the sound which I think was just badly done I watched the film with subtitles but then hey it's a Bergman film so no big deal right? but she's as expressive as always. She brings out a lot of emotion and does it subtly. The setting Depressionera Germany is vividly recreated. The Bergman film The Serpent's Egg reminds me most of is Hour of the Wolf in that it is a horror film. The setting is truly horrifying. The film builds to a surreal dreamlike climax with Carradine winding his way through a labyrinth. These scenes are impressively done as are several others. I love the oneshot scene where Carradine wanders into a crowded dance club looking for booze. There really is a lot to like even though overall it's pretty hard to enjoy. Honestly I think it's well worth seeing.".

I had no feeling for Abel whereas I should have identified with him fully his character felt like little more than a vehicle to display the images that Bergman had in his head. The characters are secondary to the plot which isn't a problem when the storyline is interesting and absorbing but in this case there is very little to speak of in the way of a story. What it basically boils down to is that bad things happen to some Jewish guy with an American accent who is living in Germany. This somehow translates into a statement on the early warning signs of Nazism in Germany and the futility of life. The characters and story aren't fleshed out enough to carry the weighty themes that Bergman is trying to hoist on the viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Ingmar Bergman was in selfimposed exile from Sweden in the late 1970s over a flap where he was accused by the Swedish government of tax evasion he made several films abroad. One of them was The Serpent's Egg Das Schlangeneirmens gg an English language film his second The Touch was the first made in 1978 in West Berlin studios for legendary film producer Dino de Laurentiis who was reeling from the financial disaster that was his 1976 remake of King Kong. This film did nothing to change the producer's fortunes as it is easily the worst Bergman film I've yet seen. This is a reputation that most other critics agree with as well. That said it is not really a bad film merely a muddled and poorly edited one and by Hollywood's dim standards especially considering this is a horror film it is quite complex and superior to films in that genre that had mass appeal such as the Hollywood fare of the day like the remake of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and Coma.But diehard Bergmaniacs who have never seen it will be as repulsed as those to whom this film is an anomolous monstrosity. It is jagged nonfractal and often a totally disorganized mess. Yet despite all that it does come together quickly and cohesively in the last twenty minutes to provide a chilling and well acted end. If only the opening hundred minutes were even half as good this film might rank as a horror classic along the lines of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Yet as poor as the bulk of the film is what is even more astonishing is that Bergman himself is listed on IMDb as having written the screenplay. It seems hard to believe as this is easily his worst screenplay far worse than noble failures like Cries And Whispers although the look of the film is unmistakably a Bergman film from the musical score to the lighting and photography by Sven Nykvist.But there are many problems besides the script. All in all The Serpent's Egg is to the Bergman canon what a film like Mr. Arkadin that bizarrely brilliant abortion of a film is to the Orson Welles oeuvre. That's to view it at its best. At its worst it is a bad subKafkan work of art attempting to deal with the craziness that threads about the edges of individuals and societies. What is truly odd is that it narratively is 180 from the way most bad films unfold. Instead of fraying apart from a promising beginning it is a mess that only near its conclusion seems to find its focus. The last twenty minutes are truly excellent and Bergman at his best. Interestingly it is also the only time the film really gets really 'personal' with its until then undeveloped lead character. Until then it is off the rack and unspun. Bergman fans should watch this film though for in failures one can see the architecture that great artists use successfully in their great works but which the greatness hides. Here a faltering Bergman has the curtain pulled back and we see him not as The Wizard Of Oz merely as odd. Shiver.".

Amusing but hardly gripping or hilarious. Then the film suddenly becomes great at the climax. It contains more emotion imagination action and characterisation than the rest of the film put together. The mystery is revealed and becomes more complicated and dramatic than it seemed. The final duel is an excellent ultrafast sword fight with superpowers  but it IS still mainly about the clashing of blades.

A sword would have done the trick but these guys would rather fight with lightning. OKay this is all well and good  its based on a legend of a fight between the greatest swordsmen ever so it must be made to look special. However the film doesn't build up much suspense. We are not made to really care about who will win. Where the film scores highly are in the scenes between Vicki Zhao Zhao Wei and Nick Cheung. Zhao is particularly charming and their interplay is the core of the film. The two warriors generally mope around for most of the film  Ekin Cheng is almost entirely absent from the screen for the first hour. CGI will be a great asset to Hong Kong directors once the novelty wears off  it can be used to create the image of superhuman characters doing amazing things but the problem is that it often makes the same characters seem untouchable and inhuman.".

Though the movie is about the duel the life and investigations of a royal officer seems to be a main focus.  Nick Cheung who plays the royal officer kind of takes the audience through the movie and provides comic relief. Vicky Chao the princess provides some comic relief  as well.

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed 'The Duel'. It certainly isnt the greatest film in the world but its certainly isn't the worst. It begins with a traditional 'Stormriders'esque action sequence. By that I mean more CGI than actual fighting. I don't mind this at all really. People fly around. A geezer turns himself into a giant snowball and a man regurgitates poison. All in a days work. I like to see things like that. Spectacular and a bit out of the ordinary. The people who usually complain about the flying around in films such as this and Crouching Tiger are the very same ones who believe Bruce Willis can exterminate an elite squad of Mercs by himself or that Toby Maguire does have webs coming out of his wrists. Its funny what people will suspend disbelief over and what they won't. Anyway after the initial sequence we discover that the main character in this is a parody of James Bond but one that fraternises with whores and gangsters. His main task in the film is to set up and mediate a Duel between the two greatest martial artists in the world one of whom is his best mate and the other is a mysterious recluse with a harem of flying beauties. Its just funny to watch basically. The Duel doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you. If you liked StormRiders and can sit through A man called Hero without fastforwarding the story parts then you will really enjoy this. On a side note as most people will inevitably watch this on DVD The Duel is presented in flawless widescreen with good subtitles. The 5.1 soundtrack is lively and the soundscape is wide. The extras are standard but servicable. Don't bother watching the pan and scan dub. It cuts out half the action and I mean half. Rendering the story unintelligible.".

Just another HK martial art and romance story but still it was very surprising to find out how awful this film is.The story is really dumb and the rest is even more dumber. There is no logical consistence in the plot no clever dialogs not even funny jokes or slapstick humor. Well maybe some situations made me smile but now I don't remember why. Characters appearing and disappearing in the movie with no reason most of them have no purpose at all the others that got something to do and should move this very simple plot forwards are actually complicating the whole thing and the movie steps in one place with no progress or interest at all. There was at least five times that I asked myself when god damn it this movie is going to end? Fighting scenes the main reason for watching this kind of movies are very boring and has no creativity nor imagination. Just simple and basic moves that I already saw in much better films with much better choreography and with much better camera working.Fantastic and unreal stuff like people flying or making some energy waves with their swords looks pathetic and completely unbelievable visual effects are very bad and infantile. The only reason I gave this film a second star out of ten is the appearance of Vicki Zhao as princess Pheonix. As usual she is just adorable and sweet as beautiful woman can be.But I got to ask you Vicki WHAT DA FK ARE YOU DOING IN THIS STUPID MOVIE? You should make more movies like amazing Green Tea or really funny and interesting Chinese Odyssey 2002. Anyway be cool.Thats it. I'm highly recommending not to see this film especially if you Andy Lau fan cause his acting skills is very doubtful well as much as the rest of the cast.  Not you Vicki ".

Andy and Ekin just seem to pop in every now and again until the end of the film when the actual duel comes to the fore. Its this aspect that gives the film an air of originality in what is otherwise a pretty straightforward plot unfortunately their characters aren't really given that much opportunity to develop so come the end you don't really care that much which of them actually wins.If you didn't enjoy Storm Riders or A Man Called Hero then you're unlikely to like this very much. For me it sits somewhere between the two Storm Riders being the worst.Rating 3 out of 5.".

And yes that is his name. The emperor believing this all to be in good fun allows this but at the same time his special agent Dragon 9 Nick Cheung starts investigating strange murders around the palace.The Duel features some spectacular special effects for its time though I do admit that they water down the traditional wuxia fighting more than a little bit. There are some cool shots certainly but I still prefer the more restrained wire techniques. Luckily though the movie largely makes up for this with a relaxed tongue in cheek style of storytelling. The characters are played for laughs the dialogue is quick and witty and overall the movie isn't aiming to be a huge epic. It's more of an affectionate parody of the genre but in a way that also works as a straight example. If only barely.I also really enjoy Dragon 9 as the main character. He's clearly the comic relief of the film but refreshingly that doesn't make him the butt of the jokes. Quite the opposite. He is one serious badass only surpassed by the two masters of the sword. He's also joined by the emperor's sister Princess Phoenix Wei Zhao who's a lot of fun but also capable in her own right.All in all The Duel is a great watch for all looking for a more lighthearted wuxia experience.

	schema:reviewBody "Having watched and enjoyed Andrew Lau's The Stormriders and A Man Called Hero watching The Duel seemed to be the next logical step.  While those two had a more serious tone this one is played more for comedy. The plot goes like this The world's two greatest swordsmen Andy Lau  Ekin Cheng agree to have a duel on top of the Emperor's royal palace.  A government agent Dragon 9 played wonderfully by Nick Cheung is first given the duty to hand out eight medals to the ones who would be allowed to watch the duel.  During this mission Dragon 9 discovers a muderer is loose and he must track down the murderer before the duel takes place. If you're expecting a flat out martial arts film you are going to be dissapointed with this film.  It contains little fighting and the scenes that do involve fighting are short and less than impressive.  However if you can appreciate Asian humor and can tolerate three different love stories you will enjoy it.  Also the murderer subplot is quite interesting in a who done it sense.  The love stories are not bad Dragon 9's is the best the scenes with his love interest are often quite funny.  Also the scene involing the other Dragon Agents watch for the one with the crutches!! is hilarious.I do have some small problems with the film.  Ekin Cheng isn't give nearly enough screen time.  I realize it was important to have a shroud of mystery surrounding his character but there are ways of adding to his character developement without giving anything away.  Also the final duel is way too short.  So much of the film is invested in building up the fight that it's dissapointing when it does go down...it left me saying that was it!?!?!?. The conclusion is satisfying yet sad at the same time.  Is that the sign of a welltold narrative or a bad story?  I guess it depends on how much you enjoyed the events leading up to it.Overall I did enjoy the film but it could've been much better.  Give me a longer final fight and more Ekin Cheng and it would've scored much higher. I give it 610".

	onyx:emotionText "Having watched and enjoyed Andrew Lau's The Stormriders and A Man Called Hero watching The Duel seemed to be the next logical step.  While those two had a more serious tone this one is played more for comedy. The plot goes like this The world's two greatest swordsmen Andy Lau  Ekin Cheng agree to have a duel on top of the Emperor's royal palace.  A government agent Dragon 9 played wonderfully by Nick Cheung is first given the duty to hand out eight medals to the ones who would be allowed to watch the duel.  During this mission Dragon 9 discovers a muderer is loose and he must track down the murderer before the duel takes place. If you're expecting a flat out martial arts film you are going to be dissapointed with this film.  It contains little fighting and the scenes that do involve fighting are short and less than impressive.

While much of the battle is symbolic it's still a very unusual creative choice made by the folks behind the film.While this duel apparently has spawned more than four films over 10 television series and many books the story is reduced to a battle which lasts less than five minutes in a roughly two hour film. The rest of the film centers upon a series a unsignificant romances incidental secondary battles and crude sophomoric humor. Was it the writer's intent to turn this epic struggle into a comedy? If it wasn't then the film suffers from horrific editing as the first hour is primarily a study in using foul language.Still it's hard not to recognize the merits of THE DUEL. It is welledited and wellphotographed and for the most part the performers all hit their marks.

Playing dead he initially avoids capture and then is joined by a small band of survivors who retreat deep into the jungle.

	schema:headline " A Highly Recommended and Underrated WWII Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I do not usually write reviews on IMDb.com but after viewing this movie and especially after seeing its rating on IMDb I've decided to take the proverbial plunge....Oba the Last Samurai is based on the true story of Captain Sakae Oba who fought during the Battle of Saipan in the 18th Imperial Japanese Army Regiment. After surviving the brutal Banzai Charge of July 7 in which U.S. Army and Marine units fought against nearly 5000 Japanese soldiers in pitched handtohand combat Captain Oba retreated into the mountainous interior of Saipan with 46 other Japanese soldiers and nearly 200 Japanese civilians. As the movie eloquently depicts Oba waged a remarkably successful guerrilla campaign against the U.S. troops stationed on Saipan for which he earned the nickname The Fox. As the movie also depicts Captain Oba battled not only against the Americans but also against starvation disease and the overwhelming emotional chaos of war. Finally on December 1st 1945 Captain Oba and his surviving men surrendered to the U.S. military. Oba was repatriated to Japan where his memorable struggle on Saipan was later turned into a popular novel. Like any historically based film Oba contains its share of historical inaccuracies and dramatizations. In particular the Korean Okinawan and especially native Chamoru civilians who were also present on Saipan and who suffered just as terribly as the Japanese civilians are virtually ignored in this film. But in comparison to other WWII films and especially to Windtalkers another WWII film set during the Battle of Saipan Oba successfully depicts the desperate fighting that occurred on the island from both the American AND Japanese perspectives.In summary I highly recommend Oba the Last Samurai for anyone who is interested in the Battle of Saipan or the Pacific War. This movie comes as close as almost any other movie or TV series I have seen American or Japanese to capturing the sheer brutality of the fighting between the American and Japanese forces in the Pacific. And it deserves a much higher rating than the 6.2 average it currently holds on IMDb.com.".

The movie told the story of the Japanese people on the island both soldiers and civilians and it explained their attitude about the war.The scenery is great and if the story does not show an American defeat at lest it shows an American struggle. It also captures the moment of the Japan's surrender showing that it was not as instantaneousness as some historians lead to believe. Overall it was a story about a Japanese hero fighting for survival and a group of Americans fighting because it's their job.".

There are 2 emotions in this film and you will be hard pressed to recognise either of them.The script is soooo cheesy I think Disney would blush.

Given the enormous scope and nature of their aggression and war crimes in the 1930s and 40s dubbed The Asian Holocaust and given their longstanding refusal to acknowledge said crimes or apologize to their tens of millions of victims I find that any portrayal by the Japanese of their WW II soldiers as heroic  even if probably true  leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

	schema:reviewBody "Im Lauf Der Zeit Kings of the Road  In the Course of Time directed by Wim Wenders was his first own production Wim Wenders Produktion. It's the third film of his roadmovie trilogy 1st Alice in den Stdten 2nd False Bewegung and it summarizes the bottom idea of the two films into a masterpiece. Yesterday I saw Im Lauf Der Zeit for the second time in theaters and loved it even more than the first time. The big screen achieved to maximize the emotion in it and it let the music express the scenes better.When they started filming this they actually didn't have a ready script. They kept writing the script chronologically while they were filming the movie and I think that's one of the main reasons which created this amazing atmosphere for Im Lauf Der Zeit. After the film was ready they got a nearly three hour long roadmovie film. In spite of the unplanned script writing the movie is full of small details and it is very well written I wouldn't call it a masterpiece if it wasn't. The story builds around two men and their relationship. Robert Lander Hanns Zischler who has just divorced from his wife meets a projection mechanic Bruno Winter Rdiger Vogler who travels from one dead movie theater to other. They decide to travel together and during the journey they see movie theaters falling apart and a modern country that is being americanized day by day.In the beginning Robert doesn't have a direction for his life but instead Bruno has he has got a clear list of theaters' projection equipment to fix. A clear direction for his life. During the journey they learn about life and start to find new things. They realize that if you want to be satisfied with your identity you must get over your past. The journey they travel together feels so natural there's not a single mistake. This is a movie where you could actually cry. Not because of it's sadness but because you can actually feel what the characters are feeling you can almost touch them.The film among friendship and society is about the difficulty of communication. You can see this in the minimal dialog in the film. For Robert communication is mostly writing printing a newspaper with his father. Then for Bruno it is the language German and English. Wim Wenders also researches man's identity in Im Lauf Der Zeit. When you're in a state where your identity breaks you become afraid and vulnerable. If you open yourself up to another human being your identity is in danger the playingwiththeshadows scene is a good example of this.All the movie theaters Bruno and Robert visit in Germany are decayed. The theaters have fallen apart or have decided only to show pornfilms. Still Wim Wenders gives an optimistic choice to filmindustry as it does to its characters Everything must change. In the beginning we see a man telling about the great times of silent movies and in the end we see a woman pitying the modern cinema and thinking is it worth to even keep theaters up for this. But then we have just seen Im Lauf Der Zeit which is a great modern film and it's a proof of the fact that there's still hope in cinema.This is a long film with many layers which is why people can write so long reviews of it. We could analyze it for days but these are the main themes I wanted to mention from Im Lauf Der Zeit. It's basically about the difficulty of communication friendship identity and about the loneliness in us all. Even that the film works on an artistic and intellectual level I think it will appeal to all the people. Because in addition to it's artistry it manages to be more entertaining than any silly Hollywood comedy.1010 Im Lauf Der Zeit as a threehour long black and white road movie requires empathy patience and a lot of heart from the viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bruno Rudiger Vogler is a Cinema projector repair man who travels from town to town along the West and East German border repairing old cinema projectors. One day while shaving by the side of a road a man drives his car at high speed into a lake gets out and walks over to Bruno. Bruno not knowing what else to do laughs at the man and offers him some clean clothes. The man Robert Hanns Zischler hitchhikes with Bruno from town to town beginning a strange and often uneasy friendship.The film has several themes which jump out at you and are present throughout. The first is a love of cinema and anger at what has become of the small German cinema. Most of the cinemas that Bruno visits are either badly run have been turned into porn theatres or are closed altogether. This is director Wim Wenders way of showing viewers what is happening to small cinemas. It is a problem which over thirty years later is still present in my own country. Occasionally Bruno will come across a small old theatre run by an ex Nazi that is run with care and dedication. A place where old noisy machines are used by artisan projectionists to show the great classics of the 50s and 60s but generally he deals with people who have no interest in film or it's proper projection. This film is very much a love letter to film.A second theme is that of loneliness. Both men are incredibly lonely. Robert's half hearted suicide attempt and constant depression is due to his loneliness after his wife has left him while Bruno spends his life on the road in an old van with no time for any love or affection from a woman. For large swathes of the film nothing is said but much is learned through glances and slight comments. It isn't until over an hour in that we discover what the characters names are and it is about two days after travelling together that the two men actually reveal their names. Both are used to silent existences. In one telling scene Robert confronts his father about never being allowed to speak and we gain insight into why he is so silent.The third and final central theme is the Americanisation of Germany. This is a theme of the entire second half of the twentieth century but obviously something that affected West Germany in a large way. When talking about American music Bruno states that The Yanks have colonized our subconscious. Although filmed and set in the mid 1970s it is still obvious that the Second World War is in the back of everyone's minds. Bruno lost his father to it the elderly people were party members and the Americans still have a say in the daily lives of Germans who like Bruno and Robert were possibly not even born in 1945. There is a sense that the men and Germany as a whole have been castrated by American 'imperialism' and that is one of the factors in their introverted and non communicative personalities.A visual metaphor that Wenders uses is a railway. For much of the film the men are seen to drive parallel to railways as though to indicate that they are remaining with the status quo and nothing is changing in their lives. In one telling scene Robert has to cross the line to confront his father and in another he stands very close to it as a train passes almost as if he is desperate to cross but can't quite manage it. It is as if the line is a barrier between their current selves and what they could be. This is confirmed in the closing scene in which the two men part company.Shot in black and white the film has the kind of hyper realism of Martin Scorsese's contemporary films. Wim Wenders goes a step further though and is not afraid to show the audience every part of a person's life. In one early scene Bruno is seen parking his vanhome near a beach walking on to the beach squatting and defecating. The faeces are actually visible leaving his body. The scene is unexpected and shocking but makes you realise that you are seeing every part of this person's life and that nothing is being left out. In later scenes a cinema projectionist is seen to be masturbating again showing the entire act and Robert is filmed urinating once again hiding nothing. This hyper realism was unexpected and is responsible for the film's '18' Certificate in the UK. Was it necessary? No. But it let the audience know that nothing was being hidden from them.The plot itself is very slow and nothing much happens for a long time. It is the lack of communication that drives the tension rather than car chases or explosions etc. You almost want to reach into the film and start a conversation. The film also feels older than it is in part due to the black and white but also because the rural Germany in which the protagonists are driving through feels unchanged from before the war. The landscape of the towns reminded me of rural Slovakia a country which today feels somewhat more 'backward' and less developed than Germany.The acting is very realistic and the script also adds to the realism. Wenders' shooting technique is visually arresting but the film is nearly three hours long and feels longer. It's a film that I'm glad I watched and would recommend to hardcore cineaste but a lot of people will find the film boring. I enjoyed it but could have done with an hour less of it.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

There is a sense that the men and Germany as a whole have been castrated by American 'imperialism' and that is one of the factors in their introverted and non communicative personalities.A visual metaphor that Wenders uses is a railway. For much of the film the men are seen to drive parallel to railways as though to indicate that they are remaining with the status quo and nothing is changing in their lives. In one telling scene Robert has to cross the line to confront his father and in another he stands very close to it as a train passes almost as if he is desperate to cross but can't quite manage it. It is as if the line is a barrier between their current selves and what they could be. This is confirmed in the closing scene in which the two men part company.Shot in black and white the film has the kind of hyper realism of Martin Scorsese's contemporary films. Wim Wenders goes a step further though and is not afraid to show the audience every part of a person's life. In one early scene Bruno is seen parking his vanhome near a beach walking on to the beach squatting and defecating. The faeces are actually visible leaving his body. The scene is unexpected and shocking but makes you realise that you are seeing every part of this person's life and that nothing is being left out. In later scenes a cinema projectionist is seen to be masturbating again showing the entire act and Robert is filmed urinating once again hiding nothing. This hyper realism was unexpected and is responsible for the film's '18' Certificate in the UK. Was it necessary? No. But it let the audience know that nothing was being hidden from them.The plot itself is very slow and nothing much happens for a long time. It is the lack of communication that drives the tension rather than car chases or explosions etc. You almost want to reach into the film and start a conversation. The film also feels older than it is in part due to the black and white but also because the rural Germany in which the protagonists are driving through feels unchanged from before the war. The landscape of the towns reminded me of rural Slovakia a country which today feels somewhat more 'backward' and less developed than Germany.The acting is very realistic and the script also adds to the realism. Wenders' shooting technique is visually arresting but the film is nearly three hours long and feels longer. It's a film that I'm glad I watched and would recommend to hardcore cineaste but a lot of people will find the film boring. I enjoyed it but could have done with an hour less of it.www.attheback.blogspot.com";

For me this film has many moments in it that drift back to me sometimes during my life. It is a tender story about the friendship developed between two men who are both wandering both avoiding life yet experiencing things that others miss out on. They are both very free spirits yet bound by something one by the truck  the other by his past where he is from. They meet by chance and enjoy their company until they must part. Nothing is forced in the film and the relationship does seem to run a very natural course. A great thing about this film is that there is little dialogue in it and yet it does not impede the story flow. I like so much about this film. I read a book on Wenders a while back and I remember something he said. It was that the sensation of travelling is much more preferable to that of arriving or departing. For me this film is that. It is a feeling. One of my favourite moments is when Robert is in the back of the truck and he stares up at the moon through the skylight in the roof his face staring at it as though it is the first time he has ever really looked at it. His eyes are open finally. It is extremely moving. A life affirming film that everyone should see. I adore it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wim Wenders's Kings of the Road differs from most road movies insofar as it does not quite conform to the conventions of the genre  a setting out a journey and an arrival.  Its two protagonists Bruno a cinema equipment maintenance mechanic and Robert a pediatrician have already commenced their journeys before the film begins and there is no clearly defined destination at the end.  True their initial encounter marks the beginning of a developing friendship but Wenders does not seem to be particularly interested in where it will take them rather is it the minutiae of the journey itself that is all important.  With a running time of three hours in which very little happens it would be easy to dismiss the film as selfindulgent.  But this would be to miss the point which is a recreation of the rhythm of everyday life.  In the case of Bruno we are aware of every little thing he does.  He climbs naked out of his van.  Later we watch him shave and at one point we see him defecating in an open landscape in a middle distance shot held for as long as the act takes.  Appropriately there are no such candid camera shots of Robert.  He is an altogether more complex and private person.  Estranged from his wife he is clearly on the cusp of suicide when we first meet him.  Playing chicken by closing his eyes while driving he ends up in the river.  He climbs out of his immobilized vehicle unaided to be helped on his way by Bruno who is the only witness to the misadventure.  The couple barely talk for some time but a bond of friendship gradually develops between them so that Robert becomes Bruno's companion during his tour of cinemas in small towns on the EastWest German border.  And that is about all there is to it really.  Except that the very feel of the flat landscapes the river the open road level crossings and seedy cinemas takes one over so that one hardly notices the minutes ticking away.  This journey may be of little consequence but Wender's acute eyes and ears for detail make it one well worth taking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robby Muller is the Cinematographer for the 1976 movie Kings Of The Road Robby shows himself as a stylistic and unique film maker. This movie is not only in German but otherwise very heavily based on emotional concept instead of a hard concrete story line. The dialogue is a minimum the shots tell the story the theme are vague and abstract. At it's core the movie is looking at two characters one is a projector repairman and the other a depressed man who recently divorced his wife. The two characters meet and travel together and form a relationship as one deal with depression and both simply live as humans. The elements of film and cinematography the Muller used were essential in making this story. In this film one of the most interesting things is the use of cinematic motifs. Similar shots and themes were repeated throughout the film. This created the effect of themes in the story being re enforced and portraying the same theme gave emotional significance to the moment. Because so much of the film is based on non dialogue or explicit story but more based on emotional elements this way of using similar shots to link emotions to the views understanding of the story was extremely effective. For example one cinematic theme that Muller uses is a specific shot of the truck door with a shaving brush and shaving cream propped on it when one of the characters opens the door the shaving setup falls. This shot is repeated several times throughout the film and in every scene it's used it's used to show the characters starting a part of their journey. It's used when they first meet used when one leave used when they meet a different character. It's significance is clear as a gateway shot and the view understands this and associates this shots with a new leg of the story. The recurring shots help develop the viewers association build the story which is essential because the story is hard to grasp for the most part. One of the most unique characteristics of the film is the choice to make it black and white. The film was stylized with this black and white effect and also how this black and white effect affected the shadows and other lighting elements as well. The use reinforced the films overall themes of dealing with human depression. The black and white was a cleaner way to expose the humanness of the story. The lack of color was more effective for telling this story dealing with depression. The side effect of the black and white was that it created higher contrast and deeper shadows which made the overall scene more depressing in part. Similarly much of the film was shot at darker times of the day and night. The lighting was either natural or low lit industrial areas. When inside the scene most likely had a signal lamp or light on and the characters were partially lit. When outside the scene was mostly sunlit and the shot was wide this was used to invoke a different theme of the largeness of the world in contrast with the minuscule characters. The lighting in the film matched the themes and message of the film overall. Through camera work Muller used a collection of three or four shot throughout the majority of the movie. These include a moving medium shot of the character widescreen full shot of the landscape especially including the truck and a close up static shot of a character's face. These shots are recurring and the way they are used and interlayer shows a lot about the themes of the movie. In a film dealing with human existence and a mixture of human depression and hope the use of the wide shots and the close ups create the big picture view contrasted with intimate human realities. The moving shots show the environment around them. For example because of the lack of dialogue and story line one of the most character developing moments in the film is the projector repairman buying a hot dog and coke and walking back to the van. In the shot choices we see the extreme view of the world intimate view of the individuals and the moving shots of how they interact with the world. These shots basically narrate the story more than any other element. Overall the film is very interesting. The film is stripped of many things such as color dialogue and an action packed story line as a result the cinematography shows through clearly and noticeably. The majority of the storytelling is told through cinematographic elements and Robby Muller utilizes them well to tell a fairly abstract story.".

The majority of the storytelling is told through cinematographic elements and Robby Muller utilizes them well to tell a fairly abstract story.";

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the length and weight of his oeuvre my exposure to the cinema of Wim Wenders is a limited one to say the least. This inexperience stems not from a lack of viewing opportunities but an apprehension instilled in me after a succession of runins with some of his lesser achievements such as the patience testing 'Until The End Of The World' and 'Faraway So Close'. It was with a thick air of trepidation then that I slipped the German auteur's 1976 opus 'Kings of the Road' into the DVD tray and positioned myself nervously on the couch in preparation for a potential 176 minute assault of selfindulgent monotony. I watched the first hour beneath a cloud of ambivalence as the monochrome images and sparse dialogue crawled by at tortoise speed with any blip of a detectable plot yet to appear on the radar.The longer it went on however the more snugly it began to slip under my skin and the saga of Bruno Winter Rudiger Vogler  a truckdriving mechanic travelling across Germany to fix broken down projectors in dusty old picture houses  and Robert Lander Hanns Zischler  a depressed hitchhiker with a failed marriage behind him  began to gracefully reel me in from the waters of uncertainty and onto the shores for a warm embrace. At journey's end my mood was a gleeful mix of satisfaction and gratification the best part of three hours in these charming men's company had proved very rewarding indeed.Bruno and Robert's paths cross via the latter's soggy blackly comic suicide attempt leading them down the long  winding road of decaying movie theatres lonely hearts unforgettable black  white images and a stunning soundtrack. And without really trying too hard KOTR ends up as a far more worthy lament to the good old days of filmmaking than anything to be found in the predigested pap of 'Cinema Paradiso'.This is beautifully illustrated both in the prologue where Bruno bends his ear to an elder statesman bemoaning the passing of cinema's golden age and a sequence in which our heroes manfully attempt to restore a matine viewing gone awry whilst silhouetted behind the movie screen of a theatre full of impatient school children. The two men spontaneously burst into a Chaplinesque slapstick routine to the delight of their captive audience and end their performance in a laughing gasping heap on the floor. They're rudely awakened by a hangman's style noose swinging ominously between them. For better or worse things will change. A very poignant moment considering today's climate of declining bumsonseats in the cinema.Another thing that jumped out at me were the separate occasions in which Bruno and Robert cast their eyes over the frontpage headlines of the daily newspapers Terror attack in Jerusalem and 1 million unemployed are the typefaces that flash momentarily on the screen giving both men a firm tap on the shoulder as a reminder of the bigbadworld they've left behind. Blank facial expressions give nothing away as to what either man is thinking and Wenders cuts to the next scene before there's any time to ponder the effects these news stories might have on the decisions concerning their chosen lifestyle. Whatever the case it resonates loudly with the state of our own current affairs demonstrating at once that nothing really changes and what a fascinating timeless work of art KOTR truly is.All of these things might sound portentous and heavy handed but Wenders never forces the issues takes sides or labours the point instead opting for a relaxed narrative where everything unravels in its own time in a hands off matteroffact fashion leaving us with an elegiac medative affair blessed from top to bottom with great understated writing and performances.Fans and critics alike seem to agree that the spare dialogue interaction between the protagonists signifies the difficulty of communication and selfexpression that can lead to the breakup of a relationship resulting in physical violence. This reading of the subtext is certainly not without merit but as far as the central characters are concerned I'd have to say I think it's a much lighter movie than that.Bruno  Robert's nods smiles and casual shrugs are all part of a silent language and mutual understanding that highlights their freespiriting nature and genuine feel and affection for each other. There is no need for them to spout endless superlatives re the might of the road or posture existentially on the magnitude of the landscapes when they know more likely than not that they're both thinking the same thing. Oh sure they might bicker now and again endure sadness and have the occasional strop but so does everyone else on the planet. Everyone else likes to laugh from time to time too so when the buck finally does stop after an insipid mirthinducing 'punchup' they go their separate ways with a smile and cheer of goodwill for each other. What could be sweeter than that? I'm not the first and will surely not be the last to say that one could go on longer than the film itself hammering out endless analysis on its incidental delights sensitivity craftsmanship etc  so I'll sign off by saying that Wenders' masterful epic will certainly not be for everyone but was most definitely for me. It's quite possible I'll still be on my guard when it comes to checking out his other titles although I'm superkeen to see the first two parts of this trilogy  'Alice in the Cities'  'The Wrong Move' but when the mood takes me again I'll be more than happy to hitch another ride on board The Winter  Lander Express. When it comes to KOTR Wim Wenders is the REAL 'King of the World'!".

This is the goodbye message which character Robert leaves to character Bruno after a few days of joint traveling through the 197ies West German countryside.

Both are somehow reluctant or unable to really get involved with life and other people. They seem to have plenty of time no hurry for both of them. And thus this movie proceeds at a snail's pace. Tormenting it felt sometimes and I was thankful for the pause button of my DVD player. Kings of the road was shot in 1976 West Germany. Watching it in 2017 felt really odd to me. Nowadays' motto sounds rather like 'modernize or tear down'  'keep a tight schedule'  'time is money'  'everyone for himself' etc.  well you know. 75 8 of 10 anyhow for remarkably beautiful takes mind the side view mirrors! and very adequate last minutes. In general the combination of visually stunning shots and a rather dragging storytelling might actually strengthen the sustainable impression this movie is able to produce  if you can bear watching it all through.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is already the second time I watched Wim Wenders' Im Lauf der Zeit or Kings of the Road and even if I did not hate it as much as I did during the first watch I still find it really underwhelming and nowhere near Wenders' best. I like Wings of Desire and Alice in the Cities a lot more. This 40yearold film made in 1976 we have here is a film is a twoman show basically from start to finish and quite a challenge for lead actors Rdiger Vogler and Hanns Zischler as the film runs for almost three hours. Wenders made color films before and after but here he made the creative choice of returning to blackandwhite. This is the story of a friendship between two men as they spend together a whole lot of time on the road. One of them a mechanic who does lots of repair work in theaters is played by Vogler while the other Zischler is a man who just turned single again after the relationship with his wife ended. I did not care for these two as much as I hoped I would. I like Vogler as an actor most of the time but here he gave off a really unlikable vibe on many occasions and this was a huge problem as it certainly was not intended. Vogler's character was not half as interesting as he should have been with his background. Admittedly the short performance of Marquard Bohm stayed more memorable to me even if Wenders' attempt to show things could be way worse about wife struggles feels pretty clumsy. Lisa Kreuzer has a very small role only and as she is third in the credits it shows how much the film is really only about the two main characters. She also adds very little as a shorttime love interest to Vogler's character. The struggles of the latter were also really irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. I personally enjoyed seeing Rudolf Schndler in here as I think he is by far the best thing about the Lmmel franchise even if his character here is of course entirely different. As a whole it is a film that is as slow as it gets and this is not necessarily a problem can even be an advantage if the slowness still brings up interesting characters and elaborates profoundly on them. But I never developed interest in the duo here or even felt involved with their story and I do not think this is my fault but the fault of writing characters that impossibly can carry this film especially with this runtime. Still with the whole atmosphere and setting of this road movie I am not surprised it received some awards attention actually less than I expected. But I am very much surprised by this film's rating on IMDb as I think it is one of Wenders' weakest works from what I have seen so far and I don't think it has aged well at all. Also the parts about sexualitymasturbation add very little except cheap thrills. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read another reviewer's comments about Wrongfully Accused and I am continually amazed at how many people judge movies like this as though they are meant to be serious cinematic endeavors. Leslie Nielsen's films literally are jokes and if you can't take them that way then maybe it would be better if you didn't watch them. I only say this here rather than just to that reviewer because I think it's worth pointing out that in case you couldn't already tell this movie is a parody and is meant to be laughed at. I am perfectly willing to admit that it is peppered with scenes that fall completely flat the sex scene with the sports commentary in the background is a prime example and much of Nielsen's acting is absolutely awful also note that much of this is also a parody of similar bad acting in the movies that are being spoofed in this movie such as The Fugitive and obviously some of the James Bond films but again you really need to keep in mind what kind of movie this is. Besides there are also plenty of truly hilarious scenes. I can't help cracking up at the train peeking around the rock at Nielsen as he tries to escape or the scene where he bends down to get his foot out of the railroad tracks and is hit in the forehead by the crossing gate. This scene was also screwed up because that crossing gate was down across the track rather than a road going over the tracks and it stopped rising just above Nielsen's head. But who cares? Comedy is a surprise if you just saw what was expected it wouldn't be funny!I can't say that Wrongfully Accused promises a cerebral workout or any moving social commentary but if you look at the cover of this movie and expect something like that maybe you should stick to the kid's section at the video store because you are probably a little out of your league. The rest of you should be able to find some things to laugh at in this movie. Just enjoy it for what it is because there are really only two things that frost my butt a snow cone about that high and IMDb reviewers that can't take a good joke!".

He does so through trial and error questionable flashbacks smartalec quips and oddly phrased metaphors. And somehow does it in what seems to be 2 days! In the good tradition of the parody nothing is sacred to this movie. Although it is mostly a spoof of The Fugitive every movie gets the blade here. Braveheart Titanic Mission Impossible Field of Dreams it all gets the Nielsen treatment. And just movies but pop culture too! Car alarms ER bras basketball commentary and Alfred Hitchock all get their dues. Even the adorable puppet Lambchop can be heard chanting 'Riot riot riot!' in a scene.Simply put any Leslie Nielsen fan will love this. If you hated his previous movies you won't like this one. It's a rehash of the classic parody formula a formula that has withstood the test and still stands up. And of course the clueless Nielsen doesn't fail to disappoint. Running from a model airplane wearing a meat factory coat to impersonate a doctor using a long wooden stick to deactivate his beartrap car alarm and playing a violin with his teeth...He does it all! Leslie Nielsen is without a clue without a hope and he's been Wrongfully Accused!".

Leslie Nielsen lends his natural parody mindset to this 1998 spoof of The Fugitive as well as a cleverly delivered collection of other films such as Braveheart Mission Impossible and Titanic. Ryan Harrison played by Nielsen has been as the title states wrongfully accused. Of murder that is. While running from the police led by Lieutenant Fergus Falls portrayed by Richard Crenna of Rambo fame Harrison manages to not only escape from execution but also disguise himself as a gardener a fisherman named Buzz'n Frog and a doctor while acting as a private detective himself in an attempt to stop the killing of Sir Robert McKintyre from those who have framed him.As a Leslie Nielsen fan who appreciates his unique and natural sense of humor and expression I would say Wrongfully Accused is one of his best films  a winner in not only the spoof genre but in the comedy world as a whole. The greater your knowledge of films the more you will appreciate this movie. Wrongfully Accused boasts many memorable quotes and hilarious scenes which never lose their flavor and will put a smile on the faces of the whole family young and old. Although it lacks blockbuster special effects and a strong original storyline I feel it is a true comedy classic worth nothing less than 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Nielsen saves this spoof from being very bad.";
	schema:reviewBody "Leslie Nielsen is truly the grandmaster of slapstick comedies. In the new film Wrongfully Accused Nielsen once more proves that he is capable of saving a bad spoof from being bad. In it he releases his natural talent of comic genius into his character similar to the one from the magnificent movie The FugitiveHarrison Ford and of course makes us laugh up a storm.Leslie Nielsen is surprisingly energetic in this film more than usual. I mean it's not like him to do some of the things he does in this production. Then again this is not your typical Nielsen movie in any means. The plot is awfully serious for a slapstick and the characters are too complicated. In a drama movie these things are all signs of skill but for a movie that just wants to have fun these things are flaws. Nielsen saves the production by doing what he can with the script.Another problem of the film is that it virtually strained for laughs to the point of  making the audience think before they laugh. For example the accused murder walks into a town labeled The Town That Has More Police Than Anywhere in the Whole Wide World.There are some quickie jokes that do work for instance In a hospital the intercom speaker says Dr. Kavorkian to Mr. Simson's room. Or how about when Ryan looks over Lake's photo album under the family tree the father has two branches her dad and Bill Clinton. The funniest When Harrison makes the jump from the dam from Fugitive you here the title song from Baywatch and see a group of attractive young lifeguards race to site. The US marshals shoot machine guns at the criminals' feet making them do an Irish dance.Wrongfully Accused is the summer's second spoof movie. First along came the lame Mafia which didn't work because there were no main characters. To have Leslie Nielsen on your team when you're making a spoof that's an almost certain success even if the film on its own is bad like this movie. In other words if this movie was absent of him and was still released in theaters it should have been called Wrongfully Released.".

	schema:reviewBody "A late entry in Leslie Nielsen's careerrebooting series of movie parodies 1998's Wrongfully Accused treads familiar territory. However the film will likely be catnip to fans of Airplane Naked Gun and Police Squad. Written produced and directed by Pat Proft a veteran writer on the Police Squad TV series and the Naked Gun movie trilogy the movie is an endless string of hitormiss sight gags bad puns and slapstick. While showing his age the 72yearold Nielsen manages to keep up with the frantic pace. Proft's first and only directorial effort is a takeoff on Harrison Ford's The Fugitive and Nielsen plays Ryan Harrison a moniker among numerous obvious references who is a music virtuoso also known as Lord of the Violin. Nielsen is passingly involved with the wife of Hibbing Goodhue played by Michael York and when York is murdered Nielsen is convicted of the crime jailed and sentenced to death. The set pieces imitate the original film with a trainbus wreck in which Nielsen escapes a pursuit in the sewers and a daring jump into a raging river. On the run Nielsen seeks to prove his innocence by finding a onearmed onelegged oneeyed man all the while pursued by Richard Crenna a garrulus cop named Lieutenant Fergus Falls. For movie buffs the references to old movies are enough to make the film entertaining from extended scenes that mimic The Usual Suspects Mission Impossible Titanic and North by Northwest to passing references to The Empire Strikes Back Field of Dreams and Braveheart to dialog lifted from Casablanca Proft's movie is great fun. Viewers are advised to sit through the wacky end credits which like those of earlier Nielsen spoofs include a number of genuinely funny attributions. Unfortunately unlike other Nielsen spoofs the cast is light on star cameos and only York and Sandra Bernhardt are well known among the cast. While Melinda McGraw plays Nielsen's sidekick and love interest she fails to make a strong impression and the more than 35year age difference between Nielsen and McGraw is borderline icky. However the MayDecember attraction is a small quibble. The audience for Wrongfully Accused knows what they paid for and the film generally delivers. However those who hated Airplane and Naked Gun are warned to stay clear.".

That may not sound like much to begin with but when you see how these spoofs are woven into the story you'll be laughing your socks off in no time. Also the way they transform these spoofs is fantastic as well changing the overbearingly large Biplane from North by Northwest into an RC model and having Leslie Nielsen's character washing and polishing the van during a ripped off version of the Blockade scene from Clear and Present Danger. On top of that the acting is very good as well with Leslie Nielsen playing the wrongfully accused Ryan Harrison a man on the run for the murder of a rich statesman who was in fact killed as part of a Terrorist Insurtion. The story is you're basic sort of thing ripping off the story of the Fugitive mainly but other than that it's the humour you've got to keep an eye out for. I recommend it to everyone!".

On top of that the acting is very good as well with Leslie Nielsen playing the wrongfully accused Ryan Harrison a man on the run for the murder of a rich statesman who was in fact killed as part of a Terrorist Insurtion. The story is you're basic sort of thing ripping off the story of the Fugitive mainly but other than that it's the humour you've got to keep an eye out for. I recommend it to everyone!";

	schema:reviewBody "The '70s cycle of disaster films provided widely acclaimed titles such as The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno and universally panned titles like When Time Ran Out and Hurricane. It's tricky to decide which side to place The Cassandra Crossing. This 1976 entry in the genre divides critics and the public like no other disaster movie  on the one hand you have Maltin giving it his nod of approval while on the other you have Halliwell dismissing it as a totally undistinguished potboiler. Personally I feel The Cassandra Crossing has been rather hard done by. It's a good wellmade sporadically exciting film with a firstrate cast.A terrorist on the run boards a continental train unaware that when he recently infiltrated a top secret laboratory he was infected with a highly contagious killer plague. Pretty soon people aboard the train are coming down with the horrendous virus. In the corridors of power Colonel Stephen Mackenzie Burt Lancaster plots to divert the train to an abandoned concentration camp where the passengers can be quarantined ignoring the fact that the train will have to traverse the famously fragile Cassandra Crossing a dangerously rickety long unused bridge to get there. Meanwhile the passengers  including Dr. Jonathan Chamberlain Richard Harris  realize that they're not as safe as the authorities would have them believe and they try to regain control of the express.Admittedly The Cassandra Crossing is derivative and clichd  as indeed so many disaster films are. But it doesn't waste its marvelous allstar cast. Each character is wellwritten and wellperformed by a stellar cast. George Pan Cosmatos later to helm Cobra and Rambo First Blood Part II directs with an assured touch and generates some very effective tension particularly in the film's memorable climax. At 123 minutes the film is just long enough  there's time to get involved in the story and the characters but not quite enough time to get bored. The Cassandra Crossing is an abovepar disaster flick which has been unfairly underrated for far too long.".

Loren toplines as a divorcee and author who happens to be boarded on the same train as her exhusband twice!  Harris is the husband a noted neurosurgeon.

Other passengers board in the typical genre fashion each with their tics and traits and duties to the story.  Gardner looks stunning.  She ludicrously but welcomely appears in a new dropdead Franka ensemble for almost every scene.  Nothing about her character is realistic but she adds great style and class to the film.  Sheen plays her latest boytoy and they share a rather kinky Oedipal relationship.  Simpson in another subpar performance is a mysterious priest.  Strasberg is excruciating as a sort of male Estelle Getty from The Golden Girls omnipresently appearing everywhere trying to sell watches to the passengers. He gets better toward the end but his appearance is mostly embarrassing. Turkel doubtlessly on board due to her offscreen relationship with Harris is a hippie singer who warbles a truly awful song which stops everything in its tracks pun intended.

The film contains some really impressive aerial camera work the film should be viewed in widescreen and doesn't take long to begin it's feeling of dread and suspense.  Though a lot of the drama is diffused by clumsy editing inane dialogue agonizing bit players lax rear projection but not often and lazy acting there is enough good in the film to overcome this. Immeasurably helpful is Goldsmith's Italianflavored chugchug score which wrings every ounce of excitement it can out of the visuals.  It's also fun to see Loren in a film of this type pitching in and holding her own with Harris in the action scenes.  There is a level of emotion in several instances that helps this rise above some other screen flops like When Time Ran Out and Avalanche.  A lot happens in this film.  The plague would be enough but then there's gunplay and the weakened bridge!  The situation is the film is serious and threatening and isn't relieved until almost the fade out so a few missteps along the way can be forgiven.".

Burt Lancaster is great as Colonel MacKenzie the army intelligence officer in charge of operations who has a decision to make  should he sacrifice the passengers to prevent a Europewide epidemic? Sounds familiar? This might even have inspired such recent movies like EXECUTIVE DECISION OUTBREAK PANDORA'S CLOCKTV mini series and in part UNDER SIEGE 2.

Burt Lancaster is great as Colonel MacKenzie the army intelligence officer in charge of operations who has a decision to make  should he sacrifice the passengers to prevent a Europewide epidemic? Sounds familiar? This might even have inspired such recent movies like EXECUTIVE DECISION OUTBREAK PANDORA'S CLOCKTV mini series and in part UNDER SIEGE 2. Aside from the action you get a distinguished cast featuring Sophia Loren Martin Sheen Richard Harris Ava Gardner and more plus great scenic train footage. Don't miss it!";

The film's storyline features the potential outbreak of a deadly pneumonic plague virus on a train from an germ infected passenger and the legend of the Cassandra Crossing add to the suspense . As passengers on a European train have been exposed to a deadly disease .

One of them is Doctor Chamberlain Richard Harris  though Peter O'Toole turned down the role along with his exwife Sofia Loren .

The Fear Is Spreading but nobody will let them off the train . As when the train carrying plague approaches a weakened bridge the events go wrong .This is and amusing and entertaining disaster movie though has some sloppy executions . This formula intrigue movie belongs to catastrophe genre of the 70s  being the undisputed king  The towering inferno along with Earthquake  Two minutes warning  Rollercoaster  among others . Filmed at the height of the disaster genre from the 7os  this entry in the spectacular series profits of a decent acting by protagonists and overwhelming action scenes . It blends thrills  chills  shootouts  noisy actionpacked  government intrigue international smuggling  and many other things . It is a crossover in which Outbreak meets Under siege 2  The Runaway Train and Death Train  taking parts here and there . The Cassandra Crossing of the film's title refers to a bridge in the movie called the Kaslindrliv Bridge being shot in France and Italy . The architectural structure used to play this was the Viaduct of Garabit which is located in the South of France  it was built between 1881  1884 and was manufactured by Gustave Alexandre Eiffel of Eiffel Tower fame .

The main and support cast is frankly good  it is plenty with known faces such as Ingrid Thulin  Ava Gardner  Lee Strasberg  Lionel Stander  Lou Castel  Ann Turkel John Phillip Law  Ray Lovelock  Alida Valli and several others . Producer Carlo Ponti saw the movie as a showcase for his wife Sophia Loren . The movie also costarred the then husband and wife actors Richard Harris and Ann Turkel with Turkel being pregnant during principal photography . Luminous and shimmer cinematography by Ennio Guarneri . Fitted to action and stirring misical score by the great Jerry Goldsmith . This improbable motion picture was professionally directed by George Pan Cosmatos . He's a good director who got a great success with Tombstone and flops as Shadow conspiracy Leviathan Escape to Athena  Massacre in Rome and this Cassandra crossing was a hit at European box office .

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers.  This film which seems even longer than the train it deals with is strictly routine.  To make fun of it would be too easy like parodying a karaoke amateur night.  It's done entirely by the numbers.  A cast of dozens of international stars most of them over the hill at this point in their careers and all one dimensional and strictly functional.  Burt Lancaster is the full colonel who wants to destroy the train.  Martin Sheen in an echt70s mop of hair is a heroinsmuggling gigolo.  O. J. Simpson's presence is depressing.  Ava Gardner quite a babe in real life should have sued the makeup department for trying to glamorize her instead of simply letting the beauty of her aging features shine by themselves.  Anne Turkel plays a young woman who's a real hottie  she was Richard Harris's wife at the time. Harris himself is the requisite doctor who has the skills necessary to interpret what's going on for dummies like us in the audience.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers.  This film which seems even longer than the train it deals with is strictly routine.  To make fun of it would be too easy like parodying a karaoke amateur night.  It's done entirely by the numbers.  A cast of dozens of international stars most of them over the hill at this point in their careers and all one dimensional and strictly functional.  Burt Lancaster is the full colonel who wants to destroy the train.  Martin Sheen in an echt70s mop of hair is a heroinsmuggling gigolo.  O. J. Simpson's presence is depressing.  Ava Gardner quite a babe in real life should have sued the makeup department for trying to glamorize her instead of simply letting the beauty of her aging features shine by themselves.  Anne Turkel plays a young woman who's a real hottie  she was Richard Harris's wife at the time. Harris himself is the requisite doctor who has the skills necessary to interpret what's going on for dummies like us in the audience.  Sophia Loren is less garishly made up than Gardner but still overglossed and overdressed.

	schema:reviewBody "The 70's were rife with disaster movies. All were formulaic and most were pretty bad. Aside from the formula they were bad because they hung flimsy plots and characterizations on spectacle and hoped we wouldn't notice. Two that stood apart for me were The Cassandra Crossing and The Towering Inferno. The Towering Inferno was among the most technically silly of the bunch but it had some good performances to redeem it. The Cassandra Crossing took a different tack eschewing spectacle to tell a good tale.Another hallmark of 70's disaster films were the roster of capable performers who weren't current Alisters. The Towering Inferno broke the mold with a number of Alist talents. The Cassandra Crossing followed the trend but made up for it with shrewd savvy casting choices. Richard Harris spent a lot of time flirting with Alist status but never rose above an A despite his talent. Sophia Loren is a classic but this film was made when she was getting old enough that the studio suits considered her a relic. Obviously Ava Gardner and Burt Lancaster were past their career peaks but still capable of turning in a better performance that the material could justify. And with only a little screen time Lee Strasberg delivers a master's class portraying the minor spoiler Heroic Sacrifice character.The two weakest characters were cast for obvious reasons that had nothing to do with the film  O.J. Simpson at the height of his celebrity Ann Turkel because she was married to Richard Harris. Another interesting point is the international flavor of the cast. Ingrid Thulin in particular turns in a memorable performance.The plot is a mishmash of terrorists government conspiracies with a central plot device that anticipated Speed by 17 years. As with most disaster movies the plot is almost incidental. We know going in that some characters will die others will live but disaster will be narrowly or partially averted. As in all disaster movies it's the journey rather than the destination that's important. The Cassandra Crossing takes us on a better than average trip.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every so often the idea is raised that rather than separate national film industries in each of the European countries there should be a single panEuropean cinema industry which could make largescale films to compete with those coming out of Hollywood. The idea suffers from the same flaw which has doomed all political attempts to build a United States of Europe the cultural and linguistic differences between European nations far greater than those which exist between any two American States but that does not prevent occasional attempts to create the Great European Blockbuster. The Cassandra Crossing a BritishItalianGerman coproduction which tried to transfer to a European setting that quintessential Hollywood genre of the seventies the disaster movie was one of those attempts.The plot concerns a terrorist who in an attempt to escape following a failed attempt to blow up the headquarters of the World Health Organisation in Geneva here presumably for legal reasons renamed the International Health Organisation boards a transEuropean express train bound for Stockholm. Unfortunately the man has become infected with a particularly virulent strain of pneumonic plague and it is feared that he will infect his fellowpassengers. In an attempt to avoid a Europewide outbreak of the disease the authorities arrange for the train to be diverted to a former Nazi concentration camp in Poland where the passengers can be held in isolation. The only way in which the camp can be reached however is along a disused railway line which passes over a dangerously unstable bridge known as the Cassandra Crossing.The film has a European setting and makes use of European stars such as Richard Harris and Sophia Loren but is still heavily indebted to Hollywood borrowing not only big American names such as Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner but also lesser lights such as Ann Turkel or O.J. Simpson. No doubt it was felt that the film needed such names to compete in the American market and probably in the European one as well. Despite this debt however the film's politics are virulently antiAmerican. As he had done a few years earlier in Seven Days in May and as he was to do a few years later in The Osterman Weekend Lancaster plays a villainous American army officer Colonel Mackenzie. To stress the link with the earlier film Mackenzie's subordinate is called Captain Scott the surname of the character Lancaster played in that film. Mackenzie who has the responsibility for dealing with the emergency has little regard for the lives of the passengers his main concern is to cover up the fact that the Americans have been using the IHO headquarters to conduct illegal germ warfare experiments. The European characters however apart from the terrorists are generally sympathetic or heroic. The message was clearly that the presence of US forces constituted a threat to European security in fact by deterring Soviet aggression NATO and the American presence did much to preserve the peace during the seventies and throughout the Cold War.Although the director George Pan Cosmatos manages to create some tension during the early scenes when the passengers on the train start to fall sick the film suffers from two main defects quite apart from its biased political stance which prevent it from being an effective thriller. The first is that as the film progresses the plot becomes more and more melodramatic and improbable. The sick passengers start to recover cured by the remarkably simple method of pumping oxygen into the carriages but Mackenzie still continues to order the train towards the dangerous bridge and a group of passengers fight to take control from his security guards. There are a number of plotholes which are not resolved it is not for example explained why the Communist authorities in Poland are happy to go along with Mackenzie's scheme which seems to have been designed to prevent embarrassment to the American government.The film's second main defect is a lack of realistic characters. Burt Lancaster in the latter part of his career generally had a good eye for a role and starred in some of the best films of the sixties seventies and eighties from Elmer Gantry to Field of Dreams. His judgement did however desert him on occasions and he ended up in some embarrassing turkeys. The Hallelujah Trail was one such occasion and The Cassandra Crossing was another. In Seven Days in May he was able to invest General Scott with a depth that saved him from being a onedimensional villain and the film from becoming a mere melodrama. Lancaster normally a fine actor was unable to perform a similar service for The Cassandra Crossing and Mackenzie is never more than a cardboard villain.The passengers on the train are all similarly onedimensional stereotypes largely selected for maximum emotional impact. There is Jonathan Chamberlain a brilliant doctor and his twicedivorced exwife whom he meets purely by chance giving them the opportunity to engage in some battle of the sexes banter that would be more at home in a HepburnTracy type screwball comedy than in a supposedly serious drama. There is the wife of a millionaire industrialist and her toyboy lover a cute little girl a nun a pair of hippies and a suspiciouslooking clergyman who turns out to be a detective on the trail of a drug smuggler. Most pathetic of all there is a former concentration camp inmate whose family were murdered in the very camp for which the train is bound.The disaster films of the seventies can look very dated today but many of the American examples such as Earthquake or Jaws have survived much better than this one. The future of filmmaking in Europe did not lie with inferior copies of Hollywood blockbusters like The Cassandra Crossing a disaster movie in both senses of the term. 310".

	schema:reviewBody "Hooray another 70's disaster flick! I love them so much that I put up my own sort of fivepoint checklist for this genre. Five little traits to see whether a film is a cheesy and clichd 'sobadit'sgood' blockbuster guff  Or a surprisingly atypical and innovative hidden gem! The best thing about this checklist is that the audience always wins regardless of the particular film passes or fails the test. If a film scores 3 points or more you're guaranteed to have found an undemanding but fun popcorn film. If the film scores less you might just have stumbled upon an original disaster film full of genuine shocks and effective surprise twists. The Cassandra Crossing scores pretty high on the scale alas it's a prototypic 70's disaster movie with all the commonly known clichs and stereotypical characters. In all honesty I must admit I was hoping for a much better film in this case however. The concept of a bacterial virus spreading itself amongst the unsuspecting passengers of an intercontinental express train offers so much potential greatness. There isn't any setting more appropriate for a disaster movie than an inescapable claustrophobic high speed train! Unfortunately the plot almost immediately reverts to all the dire clichs of traditional American disaster flicks. This is a European co production and thus should have formed the unique occasion to handle things a little bit differently like Bullet Train and Virus did for the Japanese disaster movies. We have a cast full of stereotypical characters muttering the most pitiably banal dialogs you can imagine albeit they're all Alist stars and starlets absurdly grotesque action sequences that might as well feature in any other disaster movie ever made lousy attempts to evoke sentiments of empathy and plot twists you can see coming from multiple countries away. A Trio of Swedish terrorists break into the buildings of the International Health Organization in Geneva to plant a bomb but their incentive fails thanks to some very alert security guards. Two of them die at the spot but the third one escapes although exposed up close to bacteria containing a deadly and highly contagious pneumonic plague. The infected terrorist hops on the Intercontinental Express from Geneva to Stockholm where he naturally comes into contact with many of the passengers including children a prominent neurologist and his exwife a spoiled rich woman and her younger tomboy and an oddly behaving priest. Although local scientists are working hard to find a cure the American Colonel McKenzie is very reluctant to call off the quarantine and even ordered for the train to alter its route towards a notorious former concentration camp in Poland via the ramshackle Cassandra Crossing. I'm not entirely sure if it were intentional actually I hope not but George P. Cosmatos' script contains a few elements that leave a sour aftertaste. Basically the innocent plague carriers are being transported towards annihilation like Jewish people were during WWII. I truly hope he's not comparing the victims of both situations.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hooray another 70's disaster flick! I love them so much that I put up my own sort of fivepoint checklist for this genre. Five little traits to see whether a film is a cheesy and clichd 'sobadit'sgood' blockbuster guff  Or a surprisingly atypical and innovative hidden gem! The best thing about this checklist is that the audience always wins regardless of the particular film passes or fails the test. If a film scores 3 points or more you're guaranteed to have found an undemanding but fun popcorn film. If the film scores less you might just have stumbled upon an original disaster film full of genuine shocks and effective surprise twists.

Unlike other disaster films this film was an original set on a train with a plague ridden passenger. Aboard this Paris bound train it's changed to a place in Poland which was a concentration camp to quarantine the passengers. What the passengers don't know is that they have to cross The Cassandra Crossing which is poorly constructed bridge in Poland that can't handle the train's weight. Even the former residents have left living there because of the bridge's danger. I thought this film has a lot of thrilling sequences even with the seventies music and score by Jerry Goldsmith. The cast is first rate with the late Richard Harris who should have been knighted Sophia Loren Martin Sheen Ava Gardner Lee Strasberg even O.J. Simpson is cast in an unusual role. I haven't watched anything with Simpson since 1994. I thought Lee Strasberg was brilliant as was Burt Lancaster and Ingrid Thulin as well.".

Three terrorists try to blow up a hospital in Geneva but things go even worse when one comes into contact with a Bubonic Plague and escapes capture.

A doctor Harris and his exwife Loren try to help those on board but things take an even bigger turn when they learn they have to cross a bridge that won't hold the weight of the train. It seems this film hasn't the reputation of some of the more popular disaster films which is a little surprising because this here is a pretty good movie in its own right. Perhaps the government propaganda gets in the way for some but this was only one minor issue in the film. For the most part it featured some pretty fun performances a tense story and an ending that I didn't see coming. Simpson as a preacher was pretty funny before the twist as was Sheen playing the boytoy to Gardner. Gardner seems to be having the time of her life playing the diva and barking orders to the younger man. Both Loren and Harris turn in fine performances and I thought their melodrama actually worked pretty well. Lancaster plays a guy you really love to hate and he too delivers a fine performance. The film certainly deserves its Rrating as we also get some pretty graphic violence along the way so be sure you're not watching the edited down PG version. In the end I'm really not sure why this film seems to have been forgotten but fans of the genre will certainly want to check it out. While it's certainly more political than some of the films that came before it there's still plenty here to enjoy.".

I saw this at the theater when it was released as a teenager coming off seeing Bird W The Crystal Plumage 2 years before so I expected at least another stylish horror film. I got it black patent leather gloves and all. Argento himself said this is his most disappointing film. I disagree it delivered the goods in a well made suspenseful well plotted never boring and good looking package. His worst film by far is the atrocious Phantom of The Opera 1998. Avoid that one. Although Cat O' Nine tails is no Suspiria or Deep Red it still is a worthy addition to any Argento or Giallo horror film collection. I give it 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "When fans of Dario Argento watch his films they expect to see certain things violence amazing camerawork violence crazy storylines violence towards women etc. And that's the main problem with CAT O' NINE TAILS it doesn't deliver those things fans of Argento expect to see. If you take Argento's name off of this film's credit I'm sure a lot of people would consider it great but because it's sorta thrifty when it comes to the usual Argento ingredients too many have dismissed it as being average. Most of the onscreen killings are strangulations. I'm sure many fans of Argento were disappointed with this. And most of the people killed are men which probably also disappointed fateful Argento fans accustomed to seeing the director murdering women in spectacular ways.Compared to other nonArgento Gialli CAT O' NINE TAILS is excellent. For example it is much better than DELERIUM SOLANGE TORSO THE CASE OF THE BLOODY IRIS and slew of other average or mediocre gialli out there. It's a shame this movie is a Dario Argento film because it is completely overlooked as a great giallo.With that said the film still has some weaknesses. It's all over the place. One minute it's a mystery. The next it's a racing movie. Then it suddenly becomes a romance story etc. The lack of focus in the direction and the script is evident throughout the movie. In comparison THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE was much more focused that this second movie in Dario's animal trilogy. The characters' motivations are also murky and muddled. The relationship between handsome Franciscus and notso handsome Malden is fun if not really convincing. There's simply very little background information about those two characters certainly James Franciscus' character who is as one dimensional as humanly possible. But the acting is better than most Argento films and what's lacking in details in the characters is compensated by the excellent cast. The little girl was really good. The comedic bits like the barber shop scene or when Franciscus decides to wear a raincoat after making love ?!?! fell flat with a big thud. But the film's storyline IS interesting if implausible. The feel and look of the film is dreamlike and the music is excellent. Even if CAT O' NINE TAILS doesn't have as many signature Argento scenes as his other famous films there are a couple of standout moments or shots peppered throughout which makes this worthwhile viewing. And there's actually an ending to this Dario Argento film.All in all I think CAT O' NINE TAILS is totally memorable. It is much better than the crap Argento has been making these days. And like I've said above it is much better than most nonArgento gialli made in those days. So the only thing wrong with this great film is that it's a Dario Argento film.".

Sure Cat O' Nine Tails 1971 is not an Argento masterpiece depending what one's criteria are and is certainly not a perfect film but the good stuff in this baby just outweighs whatever it's faults may be as far as I'm concerned. It's beautifully photographed as usual and makes lovely use of the widescreen filmscape it has a great Ennio Morricone musical score and it really displays the first true signs of Argento's unique ultrastyle and technique for which he is now so beloved. There are some gorgeous set pieces here and some truly striking sequences the cemetery scene and the car chase are my two particular favorites. The film is filled with typically Argentoesque odd eccentric characters and bit players and the atmosphere created is one of true unease and hidden perversion. Karl Malden is terribly sweet and thoroughly convincing as the blind man Arno and James Franciscus is handsome and cool almost too cool as the reporter with whom he collaborates. I think Catherine Spaak makes a great leading lady with her aloof beauty and nonacting presence. She to me represents the kind of female character that Hitchcock was so good at bringing out of his actresses she is a virtual blank slate upon which the director in this case Argento projects what he wants. This being Argento's second film as director it's perhaps true that he does not achieve the delirious highs and awe inspiring beauty of some of his later films. But on the flip side Cat O' Nine Tails is exceedingly better than so many other 'giallo' films of that era or any era. Definitely a must for any Argento fan and I think a good recommendation for anyone looking for a unusual EuroHorrorThriller.".

I'm assuming that the American version is botched and that is the version most people have seen.This movie isn't as flamboyant and eccentric as most of Argento's later work. The plot though convoluted at times actually makes sense and there is a bit more character development that you normally expect. As much as I enjoy Argento's later surrealism he sometimes just goes too far e.g. the messy and downright silly 'Phenomena'. This movie is more controlled and conventional but still features some spectacular murders and has enough Argento touches to make it an above average giallo thriller.

While walking with Lori on the street he overhears a strange conversation of two men in a car parked in front of the institute and he asks Lori to watch their faces. In the same night there is a break in the institute with an attempt of heist. On the next morning the researcher Dr. Calabresi Carlo Alighiero dies in the train station and the police believe that it was an accident. However Lori recognizes the picture of the scientist in the newspaper as one of the men in the car. Franco contacts the snoopy reporter Carlo Giordano James Franciscus and asks him to blow up the picture and examine the details. The photographer discovers that Dr. Calabresi was pushed off from the platform but he is also killed and the photograph vanishes. After their preliminary investigation they find that the scientists are researching a revolutionary drug and a genetic experiment of XYY chromosomes associated to delinquency for the government and they conclude that there are nine leads to be followed each of the five assistants of the institute Dr. Calabresi Dr. Esson Dr. Mobelli Dr. Casoni and the gay Dr. Braun the stepdaughter of Prof. Fulvio Terzi Anna Terzi the fiance of Dr. Calabresi Bianca Merusi the missing photograph and the robbery of the institute. The suspenseful Il Gatto a Nove Code is the second film in the career of the director Dario Argento and despite the flaws it is an entertaining conventional thriller. The association of Giordano with Arno is implausible the unethical way that Giordano works breaking in the residences is unacceptable for an experienced reporter the one night stand of Giordano and Anna has no chemistry or eroticism the car race of Anna is pointless the edition of the accident of Dr. Calabresi is poor. But there are good moments like the angles of camera in the stairways or when Giordano brings two glasses of milk toward Anna. The deduction of Arno that Bianca has hiding the note in the watch in the necklace is unconvincing. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Gato de Nove Caudas The Cat of Nine TailsNote On 12 March 2016 I saw this film again.".

The association of Giordano with Arno is implausible the unethical way that Giordano works breaking in the residences is unacceptable for an experienced reporter the one night stand of Giordano and Anna has no chemistry or eroticism the car race of Anna is pointless the edition of the accident of Dr. Calabresi is poor. But there are good moments like the angles of camera in the stairways or when Giordano brings two glasses of milk toward Anna. The deduction of Arno that Bianca has hiding the note in the watch in the necklace is unconvincing. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Gato de Nove Caudas The Cat of Nine TailsNote On 12 March 2016 I saw this film again.";

I was a bit surprised to hear that although I must agree it's a flawed film. It's worth noting that while it's generally regarded as something of a minor early work among his filmography in his native Italy it remains his most popular video rental.The Cat o' Nine Tails is a murder mystery thriller that strays far closer to classic Hitchcock and Agatha Christie than to Argento's own later works which focused heavily on extreme violence andor the supernatural. While the Ten Little Indiansstyle whodunit plot has some clever interesting twists and turns to keep you guessing I did feel that Argento got rather bogged down in the mechanics of his plot at times. Also at 112 minutes it's one of the only Argento films that slightly outstays its welcome.Karl Malden is excellent as Arno the blind crossword puzzle designer. I enjoyed his charming interaction with both his little niece Lori and sleazy investigative journalist James Franco. There's one strikingly tense set piece where Franco is trapped in a dark crypt. The film also has an amiably jaunty comic tone in places. Perhaps my favourite feature of the whole movie was the excellent musical score of Ennio Morricone. A jazzy progrock soundtrack that mixes bass percussion and trumpets it's probably the coolest grooviest music in any Argento film before he began collaborating with soundtrack maestros Goblin.All in all The Cat o' Nine Tails is for me not quite as lively memorable or inspired as Argento's strongest work but it's still an entertaining and clever thriller that's well worth a look.".

	schema:headline " An interesting if somewhat conventional early thriller from Argento";
	schema:reviewBody "Something of a stepdown from the creative success of The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970 with Argento turning in a film that is more subtle  conventional even  than his dizzying and genredefining debut. Regardless The Cat O Nine Tails 1971 offers some fine thrills and the typically rewarding combination of imaginative murder sequences and moments of lighter character development that is characteristic of the Giallo genre and of the director's work as a whole. Argento himself has subsequently claimed that the film is a personal failure but I think even given the occasional lack of the distinguishing Argento flair that we've come to expect from films such as Deep Red 1975 Suspiria 1977 Tenebrae 1982 and Opera 1987 it is nowhere near as bad as he seems to suggest with the characters and the direction of the narrative all drawing us into this labyrinthine murder mystery that continues the filmmaker's early interest in the ideas of sight and perception as well as featuring two fine performances from lead actors James Franciscus and Karl Malden and a great 60's influenced soundtrack from Ennio Morricone which still ranks as one of the best Argento scores ever heard.Some admirers of the filmmaker's subsequent work might be somewhat disappointed by the lack of his more iconic approach to shot composition colour and movement as well as the relatively tame degree of actual on screen violence especially if discovering the film for the first time. However perseverance is the key and the film ultimately rewards with a lowkey narrative filled with memorable characters some particularly fraught moments of terror and a satisfying if perhaps slightly conservative script. As mentioned before the direction is much more subtle than we might expect from Argento a man famed for his vivid colours bold compositions and at times opulent use of production design with the toning down of these elements allowing the actors to simply bring more personality to their performances. On the whole The Cat O Nine Tails has something of a made for TV feel to it bringing to mind the slowburning detective work of a character like Columbo or Kojak in both theme and presentation though again this is hardly a bad thing as the characters are strong enough and interesting enough to support the various workings of the narrative while the final revelation of the plot is clever but never ostentatious.Ultimately the film works as a result of the likable characters and their relationship with one another with that typically Argentolike combination of the more experienced pro working with the younger more enthusiastic protg. This setup is mirrored twice in the film both between Malden's blind sleuth Franco Arno and Franciscus freelance reporter Giodarni as well as between Arno and his young niece Lori which again gives yet another perspective to the film. The fact that Arno is blind could have been milked for more dramatic purposes such as in films like Wait Until Dark 1967 See No Evil 1971 and the recent Chinese horror The Eye 2000 with Argento instead using it as an advantage having the plot unfold around a snippet of illicit conversation that Arno happens to overhear as he walks past a stationary car. Again it doesn't quite compare with the style excitement and terror of Argento's more iconic films however The Cat O Nine Tails is nevertheless an intriguing work rich in character and a plot that is continually interesting if perhaps somewhat generic.".

As mentioned before the direction is much more subtle than we might expect from Argento a man famed for his vivid colours bold compositions and at times opulent use of production design with the toning down of these elements allowing the actors to simply bring more personality to their performances. On the whole The Cat O Nine Tails has something of a made for TV feel to it bringing to mind the slowburning detective work of a character like Columbo or Kojak in both theme and presentation though again this is hardly a bad thing as the characters are strong enough and interesting enough to support the various workings of the narrative while the final revelation of the plot is clever but never ostentatious.Ultimately the film works as a result of the likable characters and their relationship with one another with that typically Argentolike combination of the more experienced pro working with the younger more enthusiastic protg. This setup is mirrored twice in the film both between Malden's blind sleuth Franco Arno and Franciscus freelance reporter Giodarni as well as between Arno and his young niece Lori which again gives yet another perspective to the film. The fact that Arno is blind could have been milked for more dramatic purposes such as in films like Wait Until Dark 1967 See No Evil 1971 and the recent Chinese horror The Eye 2000 with Argento instead using it as an advantage having the plot unfold around a snippet of illicit conversation that Arno happens to overhear as he walks past a stationary car. Again it doesn't quite compare with the style excitement and terror of Argento's more iconic films however The Cat O Nine Tails is nevertheless an intriguing work rich in character and a plot that is continually interesting if perhaps somewhat generic.";

	schema:headline " Solid second feature from Argento";
	schema:reviewBody "The Cat o' Nine Tails is Dario Argento's 'difficult second movie'. This is the one that had to follow up his genredefining debut The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. It's a movie that many fans and the director himself apparently think is unsubstantial. Certainly it's relatively weak when set alongside Crystal Plumage but when it is considered as a film in its own right and directly compared to other early 70's gialli it's actually pretty good.The story basically involves a couple of amateur sleuths  a journalist and blind exnewsman  who get embroiled in a series of murders that surround a genetics institute.Plot wise the film is very farfetched. Events and character actions don't exactly make logical sense a lot of the time. This is a common feature of giallo cinema but it is something that viewers unfamiliar with the genre might find a little offputting. If you can accept this and roll with it you will find that Cat o' Nine Tails is a good exercise in suspense filmmaking. Although it's fair to say that the story compares quite badly in comparison with the classic giallo twistinthetail narrative of Crystal Plumage although it is serviceable enough.Unlike many of his contemporaries such as Umberto Lenzi or Sergio Martino Argento did not incorporate graphic violence in his early gialli. Sure there are murders here that are quite disturbing but it's not exactly a bloodbath. What Argento does show however is a clear understanding of how to generate suspense. There are some very tense well handled scenes such as the poisoned milk setpiece the sequence in the mausoleum and the climatic rooftop fight. He is helped in creating this kind of atmosphere by the soundtrack provided by Ennio Morricone. It's a nice dark piece of work with a memorable main theme not as good as his work on Crystal Plumage but superior to his subsequent score for Four Flies on Grey Velvet. Like that latter film Cat o' Nine Tails has a more experimental approach than his debut movie. Argento incorporates odd editing techniques where we see quick flashes of events before they actually happen. This disorientating approach helps create a slightly mad offkilter atmosphere. We are actively encouraged to identify with the killer in this film as the various POV shots and the huge closeups of their retina attest. Overall this isn't the best looking movie that Argento has directed but it's still very accomplished. The cinematography is good and the interior dcor is at times insane  check out Bianca Merusi's wallpaper its garishly appalling in a way that only early 70's dcor can be! The acting here is pretty decent. James Franciscus and Karl Malden lead the cast well enough. And there are some interesting performances from other supporting cast members most notably Cinzia De Carolis as the little girl Lori Horst Frank as the homosexual Dr. Braun and Rada Rassimov as Dr. Calabresi's doomed lover Bianca. As is typical in movies from Argento's golden period and unlike other gialli of the time there is a distinct lack of eyecandy this is not a criticism far from it just an observation. It's interesting how disinterested he appeared to view the sex side of things in his classic gialli when you weigh it up against the somewhat dubious relish he seems to give it in his latter inferior thrillers.I think this film has definitely been unfairly maligned for either not being as good as The Bird with the Crystal Plumage or for not containing sufficient sex and violence. While it's true that it's restrained compared to many of its contemporaries it's a better film than most of them because its mystery is compelling enough and its a genuinely tense affair a lot of the time. Not only that but this movie has one of the most ambiguous and downbeat endings in any gialli I have seen  lets just say that you really aren't too sure about the wellbeing of certain cast members at the end. If you're a fan of either giallo cinema the work of Dario Argento or cult Italian cinema in general then I would strongly recommend seeking this one out. It's ultimately a superior if relatively restrained slice of giallo mayhem from the master of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just can't understand the editors of the Maltin Movie and Video Guide sometimes. How could they possibly give their lowest Bomb rating to 1971's The Cat O'Nine Tails for example citing its graphic gore and sex and bad dubbing? The uncut DVD that I just viewed had hardly any gore at all one very brief topless scene and was excellently dubbed indeed the main characters look to be speaking English. This is actually a very fine mystery thriller that should have received 3 stars from this oftendubious guide. In the film a blind exreporter played by Karl Malden teams up with journalist James Franciscus to investigate a string of murders that takes place following a breakin at a genetics lab. The two make a fine and believable team especially when joined by Malden's cute little niece Cinzia de Carolis I could have easily seen the pair continuing on to a crimebusting TV series of their own. Speaking of TV this film often reminded me of old Avengers episodes what with a crazed killer doing away with folks around a scientific institution while our heroes scramble to track himher down. Of course though this is a Dario Argento giallohis least favorite of all his films he tells us in one of the DVD's many extras but a very entertaining one from where I sit. The picture has a complex plot that takes many unexpected turns involving genetic anomalies garrotings a visit to a gay bar a double poisonedmilk tribute to Hitchcock's Suspicion kidnapping blackmail an insult contest a veryhighspeed car chase grave robbing death by locomotive and elevator shaft and on and on. Ennio Morricone here delivers yet another superb score alternating between a creepy childish lullaby of sorts and discordant pulsating arrhythmic jazz. The film also features some excellent dialogue and handsome production values. A bomb? Hardly!".

Also there are some really great lines of dialogue that had me cracking up.  i bought the DVD off Ebay and so my copy was pretty darn good.  Check this one out if you get the rare chance.  Good stuff.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nobody makes suspense films better than Dario Argento. Even his weakest ones are superior to some of the best suspense films of other directors. In this creepy Argento whodunit a blind puzzle solver named Arno Karl Malden joins with a journalist Giordani James Franciscus to investigate a theft at a genetic research institute. But very quickly the crime morphs into murder. And as one character tells Giordani The doctor thinks we're dealing with a maniac. Naturally.Once we move into the main part of the plot there are seven suspects and two important mysteries making a total of nine tails of this murderous cat. Argento uses subjective angle shots to show the action from the killer's POV. Many times all we see of the killer is an extreme closeup of one of his or her eyes making it impossible to tell whether the killer is male or female.A number of scenes are set in dark sinister places with nobody around except the person about to be killed and the unseen killer. Suddenly a thin rope whirls around the person's neck strangled. With silence in the background sounds of footsteps are amplified which ups the suspense. The intermittent Morricone score with its discordant and repetitive phrasing adds enormous tension.A disappointment of this film is its lack of spectacular cinematography so characteristic of Argento's other films. In The Cat o' Nine Tails the lighting and camera angles are quite good. But they lack that touch of genius found in Argento's other films like Suspiria for example. Another problem typical of most whodunits is the story's implausibility. The killer always seems to be at the right place at the right time. While we expect that sort of thing in this film genre the problem shouldn't be so obvious as it is here. And that's a script weakness.Overall this is a fine Italian Giallo. My guess as to the identity of the murderer was dead wrong. I wasn't even close. Which adds another plus to a film wherein the plot is as clever as it is suspenseful.".

Later on we find out Yurika is alive but inside the box of Bosen jumping with no explanation on how she got there or how the box mysteriously landed in the hands of a Martian splinter group. Also Akito is proven to be alive although he is now the troubled soft spoken badas that is shown in so many anime movies. He speaks of experiments done on him but doesn't give us any more clues then that. I felt cheated by this movie. Some praise it as a masterpiece but I personally fell in love with the quirks and the humor that is not evident in this movie. It ends abruptly and leaving you sitting on the edge of your seat in outrage. Mars is single handedly defeated by characters from the series but with no mention of their involvement on the first Nadesico Akito does something completely out of character again with no explanation and that's the end of everything with no explanation on what the hll just happened for the past 80 minutes.If you were a fan of the Nadesico TV series I wouldn't recommend this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the trailer for Role Models I thought it looked like a funny movie but I wasn't expecting much I was thinking they might have just shown the great parts in the trailer and that would be it. But I took the opportunity and saw Role Models the other day and I have to say this is completely opposite from what I was expecting first off I was worried that there was going to be a lot of gross humor and the kids might be more annoying than funny but it turn out that this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year. I just couldn't stop laughing throughout this film who knew that Sean William Scott could actually be really funny? I know there are a lot of Stiffler fans that will hate that sentence but I don't remember a time that I laughed so hard at his character. He and Paul Rudd both worked so well together and were terrific on screen this was the last duo on Earth that I expected such great laughs from.Wheeler and Danny both work for an energy drink company but after a very hard day for Danny he crashes their company truck on school property but his exgirlfriend Beth who is a lawyer is able to get them just 150 hours community service with two kids one is a total dungeons and dragons nerd and the other is just a pain in the butt. You know how the story goes Danny learns how to be happy and Wheeler finally grows up into a more father figure role.Now the story is something we have seen a million times before but it's still a great comedy. Jane Lynch who is becoming one of my favorite comedic actresses you've also seen her in 40 year old virgin she is just absolutely hilarious in this movie and has all the best lines You know what I ate for breakfast? Cocaine. You know what I ate for lunch? Cocaine... she is such a great and fun actress to watch on screen. I really loved Role Models it turned out to be a great comedy and was an absolute blast to watch. I highly recommend if you get the chance to see it take it it's a guaranteed laugh.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Role Models is directed by David Wain who also collectively writes the screenplay with Timothy Dowling Paul Rudd and Ken Marino. It stars Paul Rudd Sean William Scott Christopher MintzPlasse Bobbi'e J. Thompson Elizabeth Banks and Jane Lynch. Music is by Craig Wedren and cinematography by Russ T. Alsobrook. Two energy drink salesmen Rudd and Scott are ordered to perform 150 hours of community service as punishment for an offence that occurred when their company vehicle was about to be towed. For their service the two men work at a program called Sturdy Wings that is designed to pair kids with adult role models.Personally I avoided it until now because it just sounded like another lame American bawdy comedy about two slacker dudes who create chaos and then grow up by the end credits. This in spite of the fact that I rate Rudd highly and have often found Scott watchable in small doses. As it happens the film follows the standard formula of plotting but rises above it with funny dialogue a commitment to its characters and an avoidance of the sort of treacle thick sentimentality that is out of place in this type of comedy. It's also expertly performed by the cast with the youngsters doing their shift admirably.Yep there's adherence to poignancy and type while the odd scene just comes off as being too smug and clever. But there's so much fun to be had here it doesn't hurt the film it's a true pick me up if you are feeling down a splendid case of a cast finding chemistry across the board and delivering on the promise of the zippy script. 810".

	schema:headline " Rauchingly sweet";
	schema:reviewBody "For every twenty filthy disgusting Rrated comedy gems there's one that stands out because of its heavy dosage of heart. Role Models isn't the sort of movie you'd expect to be the exception but nonetheless delivers quality filmmaking quality writing and acting and plenty of lifelessons as well as raunchy humor to keep you laughing throughout. Paul Rudd's first script is full of his dry sarcastic witty brand of humor and then we have the hilarious Seann William Scott in the sidekick role. Underneath the layers of profanity sex jokes cleavage lies life values and a hidden layer of sentimentality that seeps its way through the second and third acts. The transition is very slow and gradually actually improves the film as it rolls on.Role Models follows two slackers a bitter one Rudd and a rowdy horny freebird William Scott being forced to community service after a mishap outside a school. For their community service they have to enroll in a big brotherlike program and take care of a kid for 150 hours. The task becomes hard because one of them is a major fan of the fantasy medieval roleplaying lifestyle and the other is a foulmouthed misbehaving youngling with no respect towards adults or people in general. As they spend more time together however they realize they have a lot more in common than previously assumed and suddenly start changing each other's habits for the better.The screenplay is helmed by four minds with Paul Rudd providing his personal touch for the first time in his career. The payoff is magnificent as the plot never dwells into formulaic and most of the humor hits rather than misses. Unlike most modern ratedR comedies some of the jokes are very low and come quickly therefore passing by the viewer without getting a reaction. It takes some quick wit to nab the swiftlydelivered oneliners. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast as the lead character Danny and performs with an overwhelming aura of selfishness sarcasm and subtle hostility. Seann William Scott is at his best when being second banana See American Pie The Rundown and is also perfectly cast as the wild immature coworker of Danny. Last but not least we must applaud Christopher MintzPlasse as he delivers another grand geeky performance that mixes humor with heart.What separates incredible ratedR comedies like The 40YearOld Virgin and There's Something About Mary from stinkers like Scary Movie 2 Superbad and My Best Friend's Girl is how much raunchy material is presented and its timing. In the first two films mentioned there's squeamish and adult humor sprinkled throughout but it's never overdone or overkilled. Role Models has a lot of profanity a bit of sex and a bit of crudeness attached but these elements are never onehundred percent focused on. Director David Wain knows how to keep the film from being unbearably crude and unwatchable by proving other ways to deliver laughs whether it is with physical humor snappy comebacks and hilarious scenarios. The best bits are when Danny and Wheeler are having trouble adjusting to the behaviors of their little brothers.But then the movie dwells into deeper territory by providing insight into the reason why the little brothers are such a hassle to handle and why these kids can potentially help our two main characters. Themes about life love family and understanding the next individual are all too present. Nobody's bizarre and unique mannerisms are ever left unexplained. By the end you've gotten to know the characters so well you can figure out their next moves. It's a sort of predictability that's actually refreshing. Of course then we are all thrown off by the climax which stages one of the funniest moments in 2008 cinema. The epic finale is long but ludicrous and wraps up the story very nicely.Bottom Line It usually isn't my nature to give a film with dozens of cleavage jokes a high score especially with my hate affair with Dane Cook but Role Models is surprisingly cute surprisingly sweet and delightfully hilarious and touching. You'll care for everyone by the third act and will remain entertained until the very end. Unlike the average adult comedy this one comes with a lot of values and adorable little moments that makes this worth watching more than once. Paul Rudd is a much underrated actor and entertainer as we see him deliver on his first main comedic role. Here's to hoping we'll see much more of him in the near future. In the meantime you'll do yourself some good by watching this gem.No venti is twenty. Large is large. In fact tall is large and grande is Spanish for large. Venti is the only one that doesn't mean large. It's also the only one that's Italian. Congratulations you're stupid in three languages.".

The task becomes hard because one of them is a major fan of the fantasy medieval roleplaying lifestyle and the other is a foulmouthed misbehaving youngling with no respect towards adults or people in general. As they spend more time together however they realize they have a lot more in common than previously assumed and suddenly start changing each other's habits for the better.The screenplay is helmed by four minds with Paul Rudd providing his personal touch for the first time in his career. The payoff is magnificent as the plot never dwells into formulaic and most of the humor hits rather than misses. Unlike most modern ratedR comedies some of the jokes are very low and come quickly therefore passing by the viewer without getting a reaction. It takes some quick wit to nab the swiftlydelivered oneliners. Paul Rudd is perfectly cast as the lead character Danny and performs with an overwhelming aura of selfishness sarcasm and subtle hostility. Seann William Scott is at his best when being second banana See American Pie The Rundown and is also perfectly cast as the wild immature coworker of Danny. Last but not least we must applaud Christopher MintzPlasse as he delivers another grand geeky performance that mixes humor with heart.What separates incredible ratedR comedies like The 40YearOld Virgin and There's Something About Mary from stinkers like Scary Movie 2 Superbad and My Best Friend's Girl is how much raunchy material is presented and its timing. In the first two films mentioned there's squeamish and adult humor sprinkled throughout but it's never overdone or overkilled. Role Models has a lot of profanity a bit of sex and a bit of crudeness attached but these elements are never onehundred percent focused on. Director David Wain knows how to keep the film from being unbearably crude and unwatchable by proving other ways to deliver laughs whether it is with physical humor snappy comebacks and hilarious scenarios. The best bits are when Danny and Wheeler are having trouble adjusting to the behaviors of their little brothers.But then the movie dwells into deeper territory by providing insight into the reason why the little brothers are such a hassle to handle and why these kids can potentially help our two main characters. Themes about life love family and understanding the next individual are all too present. Nobody's bizarre and unique mannerisms are ever left unexplained. By the end you've gotten to know the characters so well you can figure out their next moves. It's a sort of predictability that's actually refreshing. Of course then we are all thrown off by the climax which stages one of the funniest moments in 2008 cinema. The epic finale is long but ludicrous and wraps up the story very nicely.Bottom Line It usually isn't my nature to give a film with dozens of cleavage jokes a high score especially with my hate affair with Dane Cook but Role Models is surprisingly cute surprisingly sweet and delightfully hilarious and touching. You'll care for everyone by the third act and will remain entertained until the very end. Unlike the average adult comedy this one comes with a lot of values and adorable little moments that makes this worth watching more than once. Paul Rudd is a much underrated actor and entertainer as we see him deliver on his first main comedic role. Here's to hoping we'll see much more of him in the near future. In the meantime you'll do yourself some good by watching this gem.No venti is twenty. Large is large. In fact tall is large and grande is Spanish for large. Venti is the only one that doesn't mean large. It's also the only one that's Italian. Congratulations you're stupid in three languages.";

Miraculously enough though the threadbare premise is held together by enough jokes and amusing moments to make the thing worthwhile largely due to the continued comedic stylings of one Paul Rudd and the strength of the various supporting bit parts on display throughout.When allotted their respective 'littles' Danny and Wheeler are 'bigs' by Sturdy Wings boss and recovering alcoholic Sweeney Jane Lynch we immediately see where this is going.Danny considers himself 'normal' but in reality he is so concerned with not being deemed 'uncool' that his disdain for clich and obvious statements leaves everyone else bored by his constant judgment. He scores 16ish Augie Christopher MintzPlasse a medievalstyle role player who is intensely insecure when not in character and intenselyintense when he is.Wheeler on the other hand wants no part of responsibility of any kind. He is more than happy being the jumping around sidekick in the costume and has no thought for his own future. For now he is all about the well let's just say boobies and everything below. Of course he is allocated troubled young 8ish Ronnie a profane little shtstirrer who wants nothing more than to not have to deal with adults.Each kid has parental issues  but ones that don't kill the potential laughs  no abuse here and the guys must get through to the children in their own way and sucks maybe learn a little about themselves on the way What develops is a romcom with all the associated hijinks temporary fallouts and hitches only between an adult male and a kidyouth but that's not where the laughs are born.Role Models works best in the smaller roles the now renowned Ken Jeong keeps his pants on this time and plays the King of the role playing game L.A.I.R.E. surrounded by his toadying minions and remaining in character even away from the game in his kingdom at the local cafe. Jane Lynch is a little OTT with the attempted mind games as the Sturdy Wings boss but she also gets a few of the best lines in the flick and there are numerous other bit roles  each with a couple jokes  filled by character actors that'll have you remembering them from other bit roles in other flicks.The jokes are thrown about quick and fast and while some don't work enough do to make Role Models a lot like I Love You Man and Knocked Up lightweight and amusing enough to justify your time with occasional genuine humour and unexpected nudity!.Final Rating  6  10. I can see the future. When I watched this 4 days ago I knew myself well enough that I wrote It really is a 6 next to the rating. You might not recall Role Models as such a cracking laugh weeks after the viewing but while you are watching it is a good time.".

There are definitely some surprise moments that will have you busting up.I really hope this movie gets a PG13 rating so that it's available to a wider audience for see. It was almost border Rrated so I hope they don't have to tone it down too much at all. Everyone in the theater seemed like they had a great time watching it and I think it's going to be a big hit.BTW they are calling the movie Mentors now.".

	schema:reviewBody "I need to look into the plethora of comedies coming down the pipe for who wrote and directed them. I watched the trailer for Role Models and thought it looked funny enough. But it was Seann William Scottdon't get me wrong he's pretty good I just didn't have it high on my list even though my boy Paul Rudd costarred. So here I was months later and finally ready to take a peek and the starting credits just made me excited for what was to follow. I had no idea that the crew behind The State were integral in the production both writing and starring. Whether my memory of that show holds up to its actually enjoyment I don't know however what they have been doing lately has been comic genius. Even in the more subtle collaborations like Diggers the laughs were big and the comedy worthwhile. Thankfully director David Wain and cowriter Ken Marino brought the star of that film over Rudd to help them once again. The guy is pure gold these days and even though this new film is pretty runofthemill storywise the characters and antics are anything but.Two manchilds screw up on the job performing at school auditoriums to sell kids on an unhealthy energy drink to take the place of narcotics by disrupting the peace destroying property and abusing a police officer. Rudd's Danny's girlfriend who broke up with him just before the incident is a lawyer and gets jail time reduced to community service for the Sturdy Wings organization got to admit I really like the logo for this madeup entity in the film. Danny and William Scott's Wheeler find themselves paired with the two toughest cases in the program Augie Farks a nerdy teen who entrenches himself in a liveaction DD world called LAIRE and Ronnie Shields a foulmouthed grade schooler from a single mother home acting out to push all those who try and reach him away. Assigned by Wings founder Gayle Sweeney the always memorable Jane Lynch in another gem of a role as an exdrug addict prostitute who found her calling in servicing the children they are set up to fail to be sent to the big house. While Wheeler begins to enjoy time with a child as crude as himself Danny can't get out of his funk a depression that continues to escalate as he can't even bring himself to call his coworker a friend  they just work together.The interactions with Augie and Ronnie Christopher MintzPlasse and Bobb'e J. Thompson respectively are definitely the high points of a very funny film. I hate to say that McLovin' will forever be typecast as the loser geekhis nasally voice and gawky features don't help the factbut for now it's working for him. Wearing a cape and fighting grown men in costumes who speak old English Augie is both embarrassing and endearing showing a side of us all that need to be unique and different to escape the monotony of our horrible lives no matter what cost to our own public image. As for Thompson's Ronnie you won't get anything funnier. This kid is fantastic cussing slapping people in the face without warning and bringing out the cute when necessary. I don't know whether to condemn or condone the parents of this boy because he's definitely got something I'm just not sure if it is morally right to let him have it. Both boys though fit right into the craziness of the movie bringing out the inevitable discovery of Danny and Wheeler's need to dismantle their selfish selves and adding fodder for and the creation of multiple laughoutloud moments.Supporting this foursome team is a lot of familiar faces many who have worked with each other before. Lynch is a staple in this genre and joining her are a couple guys that have been cropping up lately too. Both Ken Jeong as the King of LAIRE and Joe Lo Truglio a fellow countryman of Augie's add some awkward brilliance to that thread of the story. You may remember both from bit parts in Pineapple Express  someone needs to get the Apatow gang and The State gang together for a film. As for members of that troupe Ken Marino and Kerri Kenney have fun as Augie's parents director David Wain himself tries to play the acoustic guitar and even UCB alum Matt Walsh comes to join in the fun. Let's also not forget the beautiful Elizabeth Banks as Danny's love. She may not be integral to the humor but she is the rock that his character works towards and thus becomes a reason for some of the insane activities that occur.Yes the kooky kids and their inclusion in the sordid ways of two screwup adults would be funny anywhere but add in the medieval wars the teaching of an eleven year old on how to disguise his cleavage viewing and the cryptic words spewing from Jane Lynch's mouth each time she's on screen along with her prize volunteer weirdo A.D. Miles and you can't lose. References to pop culture are infused throughout adding a level of relevance as well. We have Kiss entering the land of LAIRE Rudd quoting every romantic film his character has seen a gutbusting joke at Harry Potter's expense and even a mention of Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra's own regular Marvin Hamlisch. Sure its obvious sure its vulgar I did view the unrated version but there is enough heart and an abundance of quality laughs to make checking Role Models out a good move.".

And Shawn William Scott is very funny playing a stiffler type of character with a soft spot. It was good to see McLovin in another movie but he was only OK playing the nerdy kid that knows he's nerdy. I loved him as the nerdy kid that thought he was cool. I'd rather laugh at him then feel sorry for him. Oh And I agree this movie needs to be rated R. Nothing is funnier then kids cursing.

	schema:reviewBody "I hear a lot of bad things about Paul Rudd and I hear and say my fair share of bad things about Sean William Scott. This movie works perfectly for both of them. Their characters are both funny but not overthetop or just stupid. Actually they are stupid on one level but the kind of stupid we enjoy the kind we can relate to more. They say what comes to their mind with little regard to who is listening. This makes them potentially the worst role models in history. That is the main premise of this film. These two guys have to do community service time after one of them goes a little overboard while advertising one of those Monsteresque sports drinks. They have to watchguide two kids or go to prison. One of our kids is a Fantasy dork but when you see the fantasy world he gets to inhabit it looks like fun. The other is one of the funniest kids I've ever seen. He swears like one of the kids from Superbad and everything he says is pure comedy gold. He's like a 7 year old Martin Lawrence with the material of Dave Chapelle. The guys have problems and issues through the nose and the less maturity than most of the kids but as the kids start to open up to them they open up as well. It isn't the typical I know how you must be feeling stuff either. It is more like how people actually meet and make relationships and entertaining besides. Hope you like Sex and Rock and Roll. As for the supporting actorscharacters they are all hilarious as well. Jane Lynch is hilarious as the head of the community service center ideal role model Gary is perfect for making us see these two morons in a better light and Ken Jeong is perfect as the King of the Realm watch the movie for full understanding. All together it's crude but it's funny. It's absolutely worth watching if you like to laugh. I don't recommend bringing your kids though.".

Yet it uses welltimed jokes to generate a few laughs here and there that made the movie worth watching if you do not get too offended at seeing some breasts or hearing the constant use of profanity. This type of movie is definitely well received in the culture of young people and I am guessing it won't become old anytime soon with young moviegoers. The movie speaks to the need for adults to invest in the lives of hurting kids who are lacking the traditional family unit. Studies show that kids who have a relationship with a caring nonfamily member usually are healthier. Sean William Scott and Paul Rudd's characters are not your typical role models who kids necessarily should emulate. Yet through the chaos of the movie the two characters actually make a positive impact in the lives of the students and their families. Part of me wants to say that only in the movie world could characters with lives as crazy as these actually be fit to be an actual role model. One could wonder at what point does somebody actually qualify to invest his or her life in others. Maybe the first act of selflessness portrayed in the movie is the crossing line one can actually be a role model. Is it too crazy to think that any of us can let go of our selfabsorption and invest time into others?".

Rudd and Seann William Scott play a fairly likable buddycombo even though I'm not a big fan of Scott's simply because he comes across as the same smug partyboy in everything since his role in American Pie but as an actor for this role I guess he did alright. The two boys that Rudd and Scott are assigned to mentor were the selling point on this movie Christopher MintzPlasse aka SuperBad's McLovin and Bobb'e J. Thompson aka the sasstalking sailormouth kid. The moments spent with these kids is different from past comedies that try to sell the Odd Couple mismatch awkwardness between its characters primarily when it comes to acting more like adults with these kids taking them to parties talking about Whispering Eyes and all that.There's a KISSconnection throughout the whole movie that is quite puzzling. Sure KISS makes fairly adequate hard rock music that drives the soundtrack through these characters' days but it plays such a huge roll here for no reason and the script relies on their existence for character conversations and setups. It's very similar to Rudd's movie I Love You Man except replace KISS with Rush. Maybe the writing wasn't all there for me but the characters make the movie work pretty well especially in the unrated version where they were allowed to riff a little longer in scenes.Most of the comedy was physical in nature coupled with didhejustsaythat? moments. I liked seeing so many actors from the defunct sketchcomedy troupe The State in the movie Joe Lo Truglio especially played an excellent role as a LAIRE medieval swordsman.It's another of these feelgood comedies in the end but the stakes are so low that you really don't care what happens to the characters. Scott for me felt out of place in this venture and I've seen Rudd in so many of these same character roles that it makes me wonder if I should see him in any more. He basically was the same character for I Love You Man. I still think the movie is better than any average comedy that tries to make this scenario work but it is growing stale. 6 Stars.".

The film production kept on going until April 23 in BerlinBabelsberg and as long as the early days of May in Prag the last major colour film shot being Shiva und die Galgenblume. Until that time there were about 90 films being either completed or shot in the Prag studios. If you want to find out the really last film perhaps you should check out Kutner's absolutely beautiful Under the Bridges which didn't pass censorship in March 1945. But I'm not sure even that was the last completed film. Amazon.de sells about 6 different films on DVD which are marked as completed in 1945 Frech und Verliebt Monte Miracolo Peter Voss  Millionendieb Fledermaus etc. Plus there are several which were completed in 1945 but released only after the war.Then Kolberg hadn't fallen when this film premiered in Berlin and La Rochelle which perhaps inspired by the film capitulated only two days after Germany had fallen. Kolberg was finally abandoned on March 18.There is a beautiful restored print sold by the International Historic Films. It has beautiful colours and a good soundtrack plus some extras. This film can be watched  and indeed enjoyed  as a work of art unless you absolutely want to read propaganda into it. Sure it was made as an ultimate propaganda vehicle but as a viewer I am permitted to distance myself from the politics and see this film as a cinematic near masterpiece. We know that it was radically edited in January 1945 since Dr Goebbels found it to be too bloody nearly pacifistic. Every trace of human suffering aside from the lame love intrigue was removed and that's probably what makes this film uneven and jumpy at times. What the director's cut could have looked like we can only guess. Politics and propaganda are as important today as they were back then. It's important to remember the atrocities of war and the crimes of Nazist regime. But a film starts living its own life since the moment it's completed and we are stupid if we fail to recognize its merits merely because we know that we are supposed to be blind to them.".

	schema:headline " While how and why this film was made are sick and twisted the film itself was brilliant.";
	schema:reviewBody "During the waning years of WWII it was obvious to just about everyone that ultimately the Germans would lose the war. However the Minister of Propaganda Josef Goebbels insisted that a rousing German epic about war MUST be created in order to inspire their people in the defense of the nation. And so while the country was being incinerated from the air and troops were being slaughtered by the 100s of 1000s on the Eastern Front HUGE resources were rather inexplicably being diverted to the creation of Kolberg. 10s of 1000s of soldiers were cast as extras and the great power of the sleeping German movie industry was mustered. And seeing that it was a fullcolor film with all this money being thrown into it it's not surprising that this is a great filmthough also one most would probably want to forget simply because of who made it and why it was created in the first place.The film is set during the Napoleonic Warsback around 1807. Town after Prussian town have surrendered to the oncoming French juggernaut. Yet inexplicably the town of Kolberg isn't ready to welcome the invaders. Despite a very weak commander of the Prussian army in the region the Mayor isn't about to surrender and he's encouraging his people to fight to the death as by slowing down the enemy ultimate victory may result. But he must contend with the wimpy commander and send a rather ordinary lady on a mission to have the King replace the commander and support the defense of the city. What follows are some exceptional battle scenes and the only ones which I have seen which are better are from the insanely large Russian version of War and Peace a film you just have to see at least once in your life.Overall the film is very rousing and inspiring. It's obvious that the purpose of the film is to get the German people to be very willing to lay down their lives as well as convince them that this is not a sacrifice in vain which is was. As a result the film probably contributed to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of peoplewhen there was no possible way to stop the inevitable. Plus unlike the Prussians during the time of Napoleon they were NOT fighting for what was right. Sad...but amazingly effective...provided the local movie houses had not been blown up so the folks could see it in the first place! By the way the scene where the peasant girl meets the queen was exceptionally well doneeven brilliant. See this and you'll understand what I mean.".

And so while the country was being incinerated from the air and troops were being slaughtered by the 100s of 1000s on the Eastern Front HUGE resources were rather inexplicably being diverted to the creation of Kolberg. 10s of 1000s of soldiers were cast as extras and the great power of the sleeping German movie industry was mustered. And seeing that it was a fullcolor film with all this money being thrown into it it's not surprising that this is a great filmthough also one most would probably want to forget simply because of who made it and why it was created in the first place.The film is set during the Napoleonic Warsback around 1807. Town after Prussian town have surrendered to the oncoming French juggernaut. Yet inexplicably the town of Kolberg isn't ready to welcome the invaders. Despite a very weak commander of the Prussian army in the region the Mayor isn't about to surrender and he's encouraging his people to fight to the death as by slowing down the enemy ultimate victory may result. But he must contend with the wimpy commander and send a rather ordinary lady on a mission to have the King replace the commander and support the defense of the city. What follows are some exceptional battle scenes and the only ones which I have seen which are better are from the insanely large Russian version of War and Peace a film you just have to see at least once in your life.Overall the film is very rousing and inspiring. It's obvious that the purpose of the film is to get the German people to be very willing to lay down their lives as well as convince them that this is not a sacrifice in vain which is was. As a result the film probably contributed to the unnecessary deaths of thousands of peoplewhen there was no possible way to stop the inevitable. Plus unlike the Prussians during the time of Napoleon they were NOT fighting for what was right. Sad...but amazingly effective...provided the local movie houses had not been blown up so the folks could see it in the first place! By the way the scene where the peasant girl meets the queen was exceptionally well doneeven brilliant. See this and you'll understand what I mean.";

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose some kind of cosmic justice has been meted out to all concerned in regard to Kolberg the town and Kolberg the final propaganda product film of the Third Reich. This piece of turf that became the symbol of German resistance to Napoleon whose story Josef Goebbels had hoped to inspire the Reich populace to resist and fight the invaders from east and west in 1945 is now part of Poland.The film is an awesome piece of spectacle especially when you consider the money spent and the manpower appropriated from the battlefield by Dr. Goebbels to be extras playing being French and Prussian soldiers for the camera and missing the real war where doubtless a lot of them would be killed. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of candles were lit for Goebbels in many German households today because of it.The story is after Austerlitz Napoleon pretty much had the run of things in Europe for a while. In his march toward Russia he met this incredible resistance from the former Hanseatic League town of Kolberg. Inspired by its mayor played by Heinrich George and Horst Caspar as General Gneissenau the place held out against incredible odds until the Treaty of Tilsit was signed one of the few places in the future united Germany to do so. A whole lot like the way the City of Leningrad held out for years against the Nazis invading though that was a comparison the Third Reich would not be making.George who was a favorite and favored player during the Third Reich is brilliant as Mayor Joachim Nettelbrick who spent as much time battling with Paul Wegener as the first commandant of the garrison as with the French. I had to think about that one for a bit but it occurred to me that Hitler would probably have liked the citizen mayor showing up the professional army man as George continually does. After he was just a corporal and had conquered most of Europe against the advice of most of his generals. Of course then Gneissenau who is an ideal Aryan teams up with the mayor and they triumph.The battle scenes populated with extras who were thanking whatever Gods they worshiped that they were not in the real war only miles away are staged brilliantly. The message of Kolberg is resistance and none of the other Nazi prejudices made its way into the film.Veit Harlan one of the Third Reich's favored directors brought this one in which in Hollywood would have had the studio bean counters tearing the hair out of their heads. Krista Soderbaum who was the symbol of blond Aryan womanhood and Harlan's wife is also in the film who sustains several tragic losses but carries on.In a booklet that accompanied the DVD of Kolberg I ordered it pointed out the film did not have quite the impact that Goebbels thought it would after its Berlin premiere on January 30 1945. First of all it had limited bookings because 90 of the theaters in Germany had been destroyed by Allied bombings. And by the time it came out the people were really not responding too well to the Propaganda Ministry's pablum. I have to say that this last film from Goebbels is brilliantly conceived and executed. But after World War II Kolberg became and remains part of Poland with its German population expelled or worse by the Russian Army and Polish resistance. So what was it all about?".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Kolberg on French television some time ago. What was most interesting about it was how desperate the propagandizing looked in this film  as if the filmmakers knew that they were on a sinking ship and that time was running out.  I don't think the film is as evil as other Nazi films but it's only watchable for the historical interest of witnessing the final product the last gasp of a dying militarist and antihumanistic culture.  It looks like a film shot on borrowed time.Herr Goebbels mentioned that Kolberg was an attempt to oneup the Hollywood style and clearly he's given his director Veit Harlan the financial and manpower resources to stage some big scenes. Or at least what I think were big scenes. Goebbels worried that the sight of Prussian troops the film is set during the Napoleonic wars getting wounded and killed in battle might demoralize the flagging German spirits  the film was shot in 1944  and thus cut most action sequences out of the film. You'll get an army charging a hill abruptly cut into a shot of a burning housewhose ignition is never seen cut again into someone encouraging the dedicated Prussian citizenry to hold fast against the merciless French troops. Cut back to a charging army that never really engages with the enemy.  Cut again to panicking villagers.  In between these gaps which become more egregious as the film progresses you get hamfisted attempts at colorful local humor an impossibly convulted plot that crosscuts between several German towns to no avail and an overbearing Valkyrie peasant woman forever spurring her fellow subjects to the Higher Cause she's the most sexless woman in movie history.  Everything in the movie is impossibly crude to the hammeronanvil dialouge to the declarative acting each actor seems to be wearing his or her own Greek mask while at the same time failing to make any impression whatsoever to the whole stilted and incoherent pacing of this film.The film is terrible but fascinating especially given the context of when and where it was made.  Goebbels diverted troops from the eastern front for the battle scenes that he subsequently mutiliated.  And when one learns that Goebbels considered this the film that would revive the Nazi cause and that it was filmed at the time and near the locations where the Final Solution was shifting into high gear it leaves you with a strong feeling of disgust for the whole enterprise.  Even the subject matter about Kolberg's citizens futilely defending themselves against a French onslaught seems out of place.  The tale is obviously used to rally support for the flailing German cause but the Kolberg citizenry's efforts were lost the Prussian army was vanquished and thus the message of the film is cancelled out. In an even greater historical irony by the time the film debuted 30 January 1945 the Pomeranian town of Kolberg had been taken over by the Russians and today is a part of Poland.Kolberg is a unique document showing a welloiled propaganda machine collapsing in the face of its immanent demise. It achieves the opposite of its intent. The stolid face at the end of the film with the protoNazi flag as a backdrop is supposed to convey a sense of determined conviction but there's fear in those eyes.".

	schema:headline " One of the most remarkable films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the most remarkable films ever made and surprisingly stands the test of time extremely well. In many ways it is a much better film than Mnchausen. Its problem is that it is irrevocably tied to the period it was made and the reasons for making it. On the one hand it is a timeless tale of the need for ordinary people to stand up and resist tyranny and aggression on the other it encourages Germans to support their Great Tyranny at the height of the Final Solution. On the practical level one is continually astound by the cast of thousands both civil and military assembled for the grand set pieces and the fact that they were all correctly clothed for the time. Goebbels' ability to divert vast amounts of scarce resources into the making of the film was truly amazing. One is also surprised by the quality of the acting which apart from Gneisenau was generally restrained and authentic. Some of the set pieces in which the citizens discuss whether to surrender to the French and thus protect their livelihoods or resist the invader and at least maintain their honour if nothing else were well argued and believably presented. A particular plus point in the film is that the Germans speak German and the French French. The version we saw came from Art so had French subtitles. The story itself may well distort history. In 1813 the citizens of Breslau demand the right to form a citizens' militia to fight the French. The King of Prussia refuses war is for soldiers not civilians. Gneisenau points out that a there are a lot of civilians outside and b if it hadn't been for civilians Kolberg would have fallen to the French in 1807. Kolberg is a town in Pomerania now part of Poland which shows how the future mocks the past. The time then switches to 1807 and a grand scene in which the Emperor of Austria renounces the title of Holy Roman Emperor showing himself to be morally degenerate. In Potsdam the King of Prussia fearful of the French flees to Konigsberg. In Kolberg we see much peasant merrymaking until the military commander objects to the Mayor's interference in military matters and says he has orders to surrender the town to the French who now lay siege. The film's heroine torn in love between two officers is smuggled out and sent to Konigsberg to press the King to send a new commander. After a moving scene with the Queen Gneisenau is sent and takes charge of the defences. About the only light moment is when he orders trenches to be dug across roads and the Mayor orders them to be filled in. Gneisenau insists they be dug out again. However the Mayor explains they will hamper movement in town. The message is clear the military give orders but they must be sensible and advice must be sought and considered. To protect the south of the town a canal is dug and the low lying ground flooded in one of the film's great spectaculars. A huge battle ensues as the French try to raze the town and we are treated to a spectacle of what it must have been like in Lubeck and Rostock when the RAF bombed these old Hanseatic towns. In the end the resistance of the town and political developments elsewhere lead to the French halting the bombardment. The people have won but they paid a heavy price. Back in 1813 the King agrees to the formation of a citizen militia.In retrospect it is bizarrely amusing that at the time Kolberg was filmed France was our glorious more or less ally and Germany the seriously bad guy. However at the time it was set France in the form of Napoleon was the Big Bogeyman and children were scared to sleep by the threat of his coming and Prussia was on our side and helped us at the Battle of Waterloo even if they did arrive late. Russia too was an ally of Prussia against the French.".

One is also surprised by the quality of the acting which apart from Gneisenau was generally restrained and authentic. Some of the set pieces in which the citizens discuss whether to surrender to the French and thus protect their livelihoods or resist the invader and at least maintain their honour if nothing else were well argued and believably presented. A particular plus point in the film is that the Germans speak German and the French French. The version we saw came from Art so had French subtitles. The story itself may well distort history. In 1813 the citizens of Breslau demand the right to form a citizens' militia to fight the French. The King of Prussia refuses war is for soldiers not civilians. Gneisenau points out that a there are a lot of civilians outside and b if it hadn't been for civilians Kolberg would have fallen to the French in 1807. Kolberg is a town in Pomerania now part of Poland which shows how the future mocks the past. The time then switches to 1807 and a grand scene in which the Emperor of Austria renounces the title of Holy Roman Emperor showing himself to be morally degenerate. In Potsdam the King of Prussia fearful of the French flees to Konigsberg. In Kolberg we see much peasant merrymaking until the military commander objects to the Mayor's interference in military matters and says he has orders to surrender the town to the French who now lay siege. The film's heroine torn in love between two officers is smuggled out and sent to Konigsberg to press the King to send a new commander. After a moving scene with the Queen Gneisenau is sent and takes charge of the defences. About the only light moment is when he orders trenches to be dug across roads and the Mayor orders them to be filled in. Gneisenau insists they be dug out again. However the Mayor explains they will hamper movement in town. The message is clear the military give orders but they must be sensible and advice must be sought and considered. To protect the south of the town a canal is dug and the low lying ground flooded in one of the film's great spectaculars. A huge battle ensues as the French try to raze the town and we are treated to a spectacle of what it must have been like in Lubeck and Rostock when the RAF bombed these old Hanseatic towns. In the end the resistance of the town and political developments elsewhere lead to the French halting the bombardment. The people have won but they paid a heavy price. Back in 1813 the King agrees to the formation of a citizen militia.In retrospect it is bizarrely amusing that at the time Kolberg was filmed France was our glorious more or less ally and Germany the seriously bad guy. However at the time it was set France in the form of Napoleon was the Big Bogeyman and children were scared to sleep by the threat of his coming and Prussia was on our side and helped us at the Battle of Waterloo even if they did arrive late. Russia too was an ally of Prussia against the French.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kolberg isn't remotely a good movie but at the same time it's no worse than 99.9 percent of the tripe that is and has always been made by Hollywood. It's hard to objectively discuss this film because of having to precede any actual comments with obligatory expressions of PC horror.  But even more so the quality of the copy in general circulation is so terrible it is difficult to form a fair opinion of how the film does or does not work as a piece of entertainment and or art. The structure of what I saw is so far beyond episodic as to be virtually incomprehensible at times  and I doubt that a film this professional on other levels could ever originally have been so choppy and unclear.  It looks to be very heavily edited with a meat cleaver by a blind person. Perhaps it was cut to remove as much material as possible that would make the German cause sympathetic or perhaps just for length it is still quite a long movie. The color in the copy I have is close to indescribable.  In fact when a friend asked me if I saw it in color it took me a few minutes to think of a way to answer him.  It isn't color and it isn't black and white  but it is hideous and must be far far removed from what Kolberg originally looked like. It's got a cast of thousands impressive and beautiful or so it seems through the dim veil of putrid picture quality that I experienced locations and sets and some good acting particularly by the patriarchal male lead. The person who plays the Queen of Prussia is outstandingly beautiful. As to 'horrible' 'terrifying' etc. propaganda Kolberg is much subtler and less specific than the typical exercise for the moron millions churned out by Hollywood such as Casablanca or any number of movies in which Errol Flynn or Harrison Ford singlehandedlydefeatsthe fill in the blank etc. I find it rather refreshing to get another perspective as the old one is wearing quite thin these 60 years after 'freedom' supposedly won and all that. Kolberg's effectiveness as propaganda the dark days descending over Germany is interestingly substantiated in the history of genocidal mass rape and murder of Germany civilians in the wake of the Soviet conquest of just the provinces in which Kolberg is set.  That the leading actor  an actor not a politician  was starved to death in a Soviet you remember the Soviets  our allies in right vs. wrong freedom vs. slavery World War II? concentration camp in 1946 certainly gives a certain air of credence to the pronouncements of the film.".

I must say there were a couple solid moments in terms of storytelling more than usual for a Harlan film but overall it was not enough for a 100minute movie I must say. The message to hang in is worth discussing if it is really that bad to allow people to ban this movie. I don't really think so.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about the best 30 years of a woman's life.20  feeling alive and trying new things 30  feeling jaded and hopes for stability 40  the rebirth of a womenSylvia Chang has once again proven herself as a powerful director! The  3 stories intertwine very well while they don't affect each other you are never really out of the story because you see the other leads at the background.Li Sinje proves herself to be a great actress holding her own aside the older and more established actresses. Her story las alot of sexual tension in it but somehow in a way that most girls would understand. I admire Rene Liu for her powerful potrayal it is a Rene that you haven seen before. Sylvia one great looking 40something she just draws you deep into the story...This is one of the lighthearted taiwanese movie that is rarely seen in taiwanese cinema. Everything about this movie is great. It is very different in style and mood from the last few movies that Sylvia Chang has done before.One last thing to note. The concept of the movie actually started as an album. One day Rene Liu mentioned to Sylvia Chang why don't the 3 of them do an album called 203040 make it total girl power album. Sylvia loved the idea so while making the album. She decided to make it into a movie as well. And boy am I glad she did!!! If not we wouldn't have 3 awardwinning actresses portraying such powerful acting in one of the greatest movie! Worth every cent of the ticket.".

The  3 stories intertwine very well while they don't affect each other you are never really out of the story because you see the other leads at the background.Li Sinje proves herself to be a great actress holding her own aside the older and more established actresses. Her story las alot of sexual tension in it but somehow in a way that most girls would understand. I admire Rene Liu for her powerful potrayal it is a Rene that you haven seen before. Sylvia one great looking 40something she just draws you deep into the story...This is one of the lighthearted taiwanese movie that is rarely seen in taiwanese cinema.

	schema:headline " A film beyond female world";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a female film 203040 starts from a female angle to look at life at different stages of age. The stories of Rene Liu and Sylvia Chang are indeed quite stereotype and traditional. Liu because of lack of confidence in man and marriage under the influence of her mother has a wild love and sex life. Chang has divorced after finding her husband having an affair and crazily look for a new companion but finally in vain. The magic of the film comes from the director catering to the inner feeling of characters their thoughts and the actors' superb acting performance.There are two scenes very touching. One is when Chang doing volunteer work in the hospital she said life is a passage where people around you keep leaving you. It's a bitter monologue but then she said to the patient if people don't leave me how can I take care of you now?'  The heavy tone is simply turned into an easy laughing mood. It's touching but not emotional.The other one is when Liu finally has settled down with the man who bought her piano. Liu was sitting in front of the piano with the man's daughter who was playing a song the man's hand touched her daughter and then moved to the shoulders of Liu. The audiences see only the man's hands touching Liu yet at the same time feel his heart touching Liu too. The warm feeling coming from Liu's face is such a contrast compared with the previous Liu in love or sex with the other guys.The story of Li Sin Je is a more brave trial. The relationship she has with the other girl is for audience a fresh experience. It's pure sensational yet sexually related a test about the extent of love. The director has dealt with it in a very sensible way giving the characters high spiritual innocence and visually no faulty behaviour. I've seen an interview with the director where she said she believed this kind of friendship exists in a lot of cases between two close teenage girls but it's not lesbian love. I would prefer to say she's given a space in the film for audiences to decide what they think this relationship between the two girls is than having defined it. No matter what one might think he can't deny it's so pure and innocent.The blending of the three stories deserves a high credit to the director and is one of the successes. Without this the film wouldn't have been so profound in content. The characters of the three stories are so close together even though they don't know each other in the film.The ending is the 3 females though after very tough period of trial in catching what they aim for have all failed Liu also failed because she'd been looking for passion not settle down. They fail but they don't regret still brave to face their future and accept what has happened to them a part of their lives. Destiny only chooses what to happen to them but can't decide for them what they should do and go for. They still choose their own ways. They look like loser actually they are winner.It's such a great film and we should not simply regard it as a female film because the extent it covers and message it has conveyed is certainly beyond female world. A man like me watched it with little tears wetting my eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersI have heard too many radio interviews of the three leading ladies to be immune from their effect. The deeply ingrained concept before I saw the movie was that 20 is about having all the time in the world and nothing to lose 30 is about crossroads and choices and 40 is about having no choice and hence complete liberation. While there is a fair amount of truth in these generalizations there is not much originality.The movie is made up of three stories or sketches which would be a better description written separately by the three actresses Sylvia Chang 40 Rene Liu 30 and Lee Sinje 20. Obviously one would not expect the brilliant interconnection of the three as in Inarritu's films. The three sketches are independent and whatever links we see are entirely inconsequential. One thought that I have though my own not from listening to the radio interviews is that these three could very well be the same person at different crosssections of her life.Of the three sketches 30 and 40 depict things that work themselves through daily if not hourly in all big cities in every continent a flight attendant at a crossroad with her romantic interludes and a divorcee searching for a new balance in her life. With limited scope to work with the two awardwinning actresses do whatever they can with some good results here and there. They did not get much help though. 30's two romantic objects are mere cardboard although the final encounter gets a bit better. 40's episode oscillates between runofthemill comedy and occasional nice touches.Back to the radio interview Lee Sinje said that when she delivered her script to director Sylvia Chang she wasn't sure if it would be accepted. Without even blinking Chang took it. This sketch of 20 is certainly more refreshing than the other two tackling the relationship between two girls that tread subtly between friendship and sexual love. The performance of Lee also awardwinning does not suffer in comparison with Chang and Liu although all three might be said to be acting themselves' to a degree. Worth mentioning is Kate Yeung who playing the other girl is billed in the credit under Introducing'. Based on her performance she has every right to be billed as the fourth lead. A starstudded supporting cast Anthony Wong Tony Leung Kafai Ren Xian Qi ensures a good draw. On the opening night I went to there were a lot of laughs from people who must have felt compelled to laugh simply because Anthony Wong was speaking a line.While on the whole somewhat sketchy the movie is enjoyable but not as good as director Chang's previous work Xin Dong 1999 which goes considerably deeper into the characters.".

Throughout the three stories there are subtle connections but the three protagonists never really meet one another. This allows Sylvia Chang as director and writer to explore each woman and the effect they have on those around them to their full effect. A number of secondary characters mainly being the men in their lives pop up and serve each story well. Anthony Wong plays a rather comedic but also tragic record producer who fails at supplying the young girls with a good career. All the performances in this film are beautiful each main actress capturing the confusion of their characters as well as keeping them strong. Without the brilliant writing and direction of Chang though this film would probably fall flat on its face as a dodgy female empowerment propaganda film. Chang notes the fragility of the female but doesn't deny that the love of a good man can and does help. It is also obvious that Chang has experienced moments not unlike those in the film. The film may be a bit too positive although Angelica Lee's segment is quite heartbreaking the film is obviously a pickmeup film that shows the bright side of life.".

I've found the lead actresses Sylvia Chang Rene Liu and Angelica Lee to have given very powerful and commanding performances in their respective roles provided much drama realism and heartfelt moments in making the movie engaging and captivating.While a film that could give you a few tears this movie also has some humor that will give you a few chuckles particularly in the part where Sylvia Chang's character try to outwit her lovestarve tennis instructor lover.I also particularly enjoy the sincere portrayal of Rene Liu's character how her struggles and hardship of failed relationships and lifeontherocks livelihood are detailed her praying upon the grave of her deceased mother to help her through the hard times is emotional. Their portrayals of their lives could be something you could relate to in real life.While the three women are not related in the story the story cleverly makes connections and plot twists involving the three.

The nonlinear beginning is quite confused but provocative and intriguing I saw this movie on DVD and I watched the first chapters again to get a better understanding however after ten minutes the story becomes intelligible with the development of the characters supported by magnificent performances and wonderful cinematography. The story is deep and touching and viewers that enjoy superficial Hollywoodian fairy tales may not like this dense drama developed in lowpace. Monica Bleibtreu and the lovely Hannah Herzsprung have topnotch performances that deserved nomination to the Oscar. The conclusion is thrilling and heartbreaking and will probably make the eyes of sensitive viewers wet. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Quatro Minutos Four Minutes".

The director'sopening sequence with skillful use of silence and a relatively slow pace immediately caught my attention. The photography was excellent and the acting superb. The story although slightly contrived was engaging. I feel that the subplot was not really connected to the main story and could have been developed further. The music was most enjoyable but I feel that although music features to a large extent in the film it is not meant to be a showcase for the music but rather as a tool to explore the relationship between Frau Krueger and Jenny. This is exceptionally well depicted and the acting absolutely brilliant!I feel that there is a great depth to this film which probably needs more analysis than I have had time to give it. I should like to see the film again and wish I could see a version without subtitles. It is so tempting to peek thereby missing all the nuances of the wonderful characterizations.I would recommend this film to anyone interested in intelligent acting and who wants to be able to reflect on a film's deeper meaning rather than just be superficially entertained. I enjoyed Vier Minuten and although it was set in a rather grim environment I found it uplifting rather than depressing!".

And no it is not one of those touchy feely Hollywood setups this has real depth.The 4 minutes the title refers to is a film sequence which I personally found incredible I still get gooseflesh down my back when I think back to it. The audience in the cinema I saw it spontaneously burst in to applause at the end of the 4 minutes.All in all a thoroughly worthwhile film although there is quite a bit of German history some knowledge of this would be of use and I am not sure how it would translate from the original German. Some excellent comedy intersperses the intensity of the drama  but all credit must go to the main actors. Really good  go see it..".

Hail hail rock and roll HipHop Punk Goth New Wave Rap Swing Jive Big Band and even Classical. We have come a long way since the days of Turlough O'Carolan or Steven Foster.The plot is not as simple as you might think. Two women both gifted both abused and injured as youths both driven. A father seeking redemption at the end of his life... a vast array of opponents meaning to deter hope and subdue expression. Movies have been built on oppression and hardship for a long time. It makes for a great story like Purple Rain for example.Beauty and the beast... continuance salvation rebirth dignity... you could ponder the factors of this movie for some time. The music itself is meant only to be representative not sterling and you must remember the settings. I found the opening hard rock song of the piano being transported to the prison absolutely fantastic and the finale innovative and yet reminiscent of the Acid Freak Concerts of the late 60s oddly enough. Listen to The Rolling Stones  Their Satanic Majesties Request 1967. Maybe they even used the same piano and the strings in the same way. However I won't tell you how this one ends....Nevertheless make no mistake Hannah Herzsprung's performance throughout the movie is absolutely stunning for lack of a better word. You will not forget it.I had a great deal of trouble tracking down a copy of this movie since DVD copies are hard to find. In the end I was really glad I took the time and now I am tracking down the CD soundtrack as well... yes I think it is well worth seeing the movie and owning the music too.If it only reminds us how to curtsey and rebel at the same time....".

	schema:headline " Four Minutes";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this last year at a screening by the Desert Film Society. Directorwriter Chris Keaus shows promise in this only his second film. The film is set in a German penitentiary and revolves around two central characters Traude Krger Monica Bleibtreau an elderly spinster who is a piano teacher at the prison and working long past her retirement age and Jenny Von Loeben Hannah Herzsprung. a young woman serving time on a murder conviction. Jenny is also a a naturally gifted pianist under her gruff demeanor who Krger wants to tame long enough to enter her in a piano competition to give a four minuter recital in a prestigious concert hall before an affluent audience. Krger lives and teaches order and conformity and comes from a past where the Nazi's were about order and conformity in their world of fascism and she had to adapt to that world while suppressing her the nonconformity of her lesbianism. Jenny has a violent temper and comes from a world of childhood abuse and has lived a life of disorder and nonconformity while suppressing the order and conformity of her protg talent. Jenny likes modern music and the modern rhythms and passion of the street and experimental music scene while Krger hates modern music. Ironically the piece Krger has chosen for Jenny's recital is by German composer Robert Schumann who's own approach to music incorporated rhythm that was considered daring for it's day. Directorwriter Kraus may have thrown in another little ironic tiein to Schumann where a guard at the prison has a young daughter named Clara who Krger had no patience with because she wouldn't curtsy. Schumann's wife and great love of his life was named Clara. This is a film that keeps your interest throughout but the screenplay has lots of gaps and implausible scenarios and runs a little long but despite its flaws the two fine acting performances by Bleibtreu and Herzsprung are certainly noteworthy and I would recommend the film and give it a 7.0 out of 10.".

In these grim surroundings an elderly visiting piano teacher collides with a wild inmate serving a life sentence for murder and harbouring an extraordinary talent for piano. Traude and Jenny are polarised personalities from the moment that they meet again and again their differences boil up and threaten Jenny's entry into a young pianist competition. Their path is troubled further by the hostility of prison inmates and staff alike including Kowalski an emasculated prison guard played by Richy Muller and the reappearance of Jenny's father which dredges up terrible memories.Through confrontation of demons past and present both Traude and Jenny begin to delve into the other's background revealing the reality beyond the ossified teacher and the abominable student. Traude's history is illuminated through flashbacks to the Second World War but although these scenes are well choreographed and filmed they fit awkwardly at best into the main narrative and encroach upon a sterling performance by Monica Bleidbtrau. The details of Jenny's life are left scarce and tantalising which plays to Hannah Herzsprung's performance by turns angry and beautiful scary and charming.This film is graced by some excellent pieces of classical music at least from my standpoint as a layperson in the classical music world. The musical and dramatic highlight comes at the film's climax  the Four Minutes of the film's title which features a stunningly original composition encapsulating the turmoil of the previous two hours and leaving a vivid and lasting impression.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't readily find fault with this movie despite being fairly critical usually... It had me hooked within the first minute and didn't let me go throughout the movie!The characters are gritty but believable and the characterization by the two lead actresses is flawless for most of the movie. The cinematography I found to be gorgeous with a rustic and brittle edge to many of the screen shots!The slow revelation of the histories involved in the two lead women's lives shows a deeper more tangible side to who and why they are the people they are. Some of the flashback sequences are slightly dislocating but this doesn't seriously detract from the plot. The timing of these revelations is well thought out though and we start to realize that the first question we need to ask of anyone is what their past is that has made them who they are...It challenges a good few precepts about femininity as well along the way but this is secondary to the relationship dynamics of the psychological motherdaughter relationship that is setup here.It asks some deep questions about the meaning of our relationships and our purpose in life that doesn't let go right to the end. This movie doesn't hold back from any of the capricious nature of life and the consequences that it often throws in our life paths. It also shows the failure of people to deal with this on a humanistic level... often resulting in shattered and wasted lives. The violence both emotional and physical depicts well the struggle people have with dealing with each others 'violations' towards each other.I'd wholeheartedly recommend you see this movie! It will have you captivated from the opening sequence of the the suicide of her cell mate that Jenny sleeps through and then awakes only to then carelessly steal the last cigarette from the dead woman's body as if this is somehow a daily occurrence to the final Four Minutes that are the summation of all that Jenny is as a human being...".

I think my main problem with the film is the editing. The editor seems restless with the slow pace of the scenes and tries to speed things up by hard cutting. But this just leads to the fact that each scene ends at the very point where it starts getting interesting. The jumping back and forth between the subplot the piano teachers love story in the past and the main plot the same teacher teaching a young criminal to play is often confusing and creates distance to the viewer. The subplot also doesn't really tie in to the main plot and should probably have been left out altogether. The final scene where the girl triumphantly plays the piano would have been so much more efficient and touching if shot in just one long take now the editor tries to compete with the girl's virtuous skills and again it creates distance and makes the whole sequence feel fake and pompous. I still recommend this film because of the great actors and a nice story.".

	schema:headline " Superficially impressive but music lovers will gag";
	schema:reviewBody "This starts as an interesting story of an elderly woman played by Monica Bleibtreu who teaches piano in prisons and sees enormous potential in one girl Hannah Herzsprung who is especially violent. Though it is all pretty straightforward it is wellacted and the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival screening I attended responded well. I initially liked it too but upon reflection I came to despise it.Ultimately it's a shallow story. The character of the old woman teaches her student nothing and just stifles her from playing anything modern. All of the lessons are for a simple Schubert Impromptu that is then not used in any significant way by the story. And then the Schumann Concerto sort of comes out of nowhere in a thoroughly implausible way there is no orchestra.Clearly the teacher with her age classical music and closeted lesbianism is made to represent spiritual and emotional deadness. On the other hand even though the prisoner is violent and her playing is without any emotional depth she represents untamed passion and genius and proudly resists her teacher. And to further alienate us from the teacher she refers to the student's popinfluenced improvisation as niermusik. As a musician I had to suspend my judgment at the time because most of the music in the movie was poorly played and horribly recorded. The piano sound was so distorted that it almost sounded like an electric guitar. As with the movie COPYING BEETHOVEN which I also saw at the Festival I think the writerdirector has a poor understanding of classical music and far as I can tell doesn't even like it  in fact based on the movie itself I'd guess that he hates it.However I had my hopes raised because someone had told me about how amazing this one original piece of music was in the movie. I suppose it worked in the movie but I wasn't blown away as many in the audience were  it was all flash and little substance. You won't be seeing real pianists scrambling to learn it any time soon.I'll probably be alone in thinking this. But I'm realizing movies about music are generally wretched. The major exception is AMADEUS but that's because that movie loves music and has something genuine to say about human relationships and emotions even if there are historical inaccuracies. The rest just perpetuate ridiculous clichs like love inspires artists to greatness or geniuses must suffer. Unfortunately this is one of those.This was a bad choice for the Lola Award.".

I mean Traude is supposed to be a woman who is devoted to music and who wants to help female inmates of a prison to learn piano. And she turns Jenny away because she plays Negro music and has filthy hands? Couldn't Chris Block the writer and director have come up with a more realistic reason for Jenny to bash Mutze nearly to death thus turning him from what was initially a sympathetic character into a jailer out for revenge? The wartime lesbian subplot didn't add anything to the main plot. If anything it seemed gratuitous. How could a woman who was daring enough to love another woman under the gaze of Nazis come to hate Negro Music? These two characteristics don't seem to fit together.The other weird if not gratuitous inclusion was the incest subplot between Jenny and her father. Aside from Jenny's outbursts it was handled vaguely as it it were no more important than the refusal or inability of Mutze's daughter to curtsy to Traude.And the music drove me crazy. The Mozart and Schubert pieces have been played to death. Surely a couple of more interesting tudes out of the thousands upon thousands that have been written by hundreds of composers could have relieved the boredom of hearing these hackneyed tunes over and over for the entire length of the film.I came to this film expecting to like it which is why I'm so bloody disgusted. But by the time the last plot contrivance was thrown at us Jenny finding a bottle of her detested father's favourite booze at Traude's place and thus setting up a melodramatic bellowfest not even the heralded last vier minuten could save it.".

The turning point is when the young pianist recounts her sojourn in the hospital in order to give birth to her son. The scene marks the first opening between the two women from that moment on a different lighter touch would have been better and could have been expected but we are left with the same dull atmosphere. Given the sheer emotional difficulty of the story a change of pace could have given the viewer the time to absorb the story. But the authors do not relent so that some parts for instance the repeated recollections of the past in Nazi Germany do not really support the story but compound horror the present with horror the past... All in all an interesting film but with big holes in a rather unbalanced screenplay.".

Jenny the main heroine of the story is jailed for murder and has little chances to see anything than prison for the rest of her life. She is however also a very gifted pianist but her rebellious character drives her playing as it drives anything that she does in life.The penitentiary system as enlightened as it may be in a country as Germany has the bureaucratic oppressive and shadowy treats of any system that punishes and deprives men of their liberty.It's a friendship story. Traude the piano teacher who gives music lessons to detainees in order to ease their time and improve their lives and who befriends and supports her is herself a survivor of the Nazi persecutions who is too familiar with suffering and with what life without freedom and hope means. Yet their friendship is not an easy one none of them is a communicator the level of mistrust and fears that the outer world imposed on both of them prevents them from relying on each other.It's a music story. Music is supposed to play the role of redeemer and possibly do the job of deusexmachina in changing the fate of the heroes of the story. Yet the director who is also the script writer avoided the easy path and never falls into conventional melodrama. More than that music is one of the conflict reasons between Jenny and Traude and in the superb final scene of the film Hannah will win her internal freedom by rejecting the classical beauty and conventional balance of the symphonic music for the freedom of improvisation of the 'negro' music that expresses herself.... and in the final seconds of the four minutes they seem to meet  psychologically and in music.Acting which is traditionally a strong item in German movies is superb here. I have already seen Hannah Herzsprung in Der Baader Meinhof Komplex and The Reader  here she gets the full screen for a role of a broken young woman which music cannot redeem completely. Monica Belibtrau is the piano teacher  she is supposed to be the redeemer but far from being linear and angelic she cannot free herself from the sufferings and guilt of the past and from her own limitations.Vier Minuten may surprise with its pessimistic message  if a remake is ever made at Hollywood it better keep the skeptical look as any other approach risks to turn it into a valueless melodrama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vier Minuten is probably the most known work from German writer and director Chris Kraus. At the German Film Awards it won Best Picture over Academy award winner Die Flscher gave the late Monica Bleibtreu Moritz' mother a Best Actress win and scored nominations for Kraus' writing and directing as well as Herzsprung's acting. She lost to Bleibtreu but won in the supporting category for another movie. I thought Herzsprung played very well here so I am a bit surprised and disappointed about the fact that she played mostly cheesy parts in weak romance movies in recent years. Time for something more challenging again.There were a few issues I had with this movie like that Bleibtreu's character does not want to help initially but after Herzsprung's character violently assaults a police officer she suddenly wants? Also I felt that Lesbian reference came out of nowhere a bit only to make the movie maybe more interesting. Also the whole Nazi past and alcoholism references were maybe a bit too much. It seems as if they tried to include so many baity aspects and then did not entirely elaborate on these. It's certainly not a film as important as it sees itself. The female prison inmates struggling with each other was solid one of the better parts of the film. Tabatabai does a good job with her minor character.Near the end of the movie all the smaller characters are pretty much out of the picture and it's all about the two protagonists which I liked even if the late Sven Pippig plays an interesting character who is actually a nice person but gets drawn a bit towards the dark side due to the back lash he keeps experiencing in his job and even on national television. The film ends with the four minutes described int he title which are the big piano performance from Herzsprung's character before she gets arrested on stage.As a whole I felt this was a decent movie but nowhere near as good as all the awards it won and was nominated for would make you think. It's a bit predictable prison girl becomes music superstar despite all the obstacles and the final piano scene felt like an extract from a weak American Idol episode to me where everybody is silent after the performance and then breaks into loud applause. The whole piano performance did not feel as emotional and freebreaking to me as I wished it could have been to be the true highlight of the movie as the makers intended it to. Nonetheless it's slightly under two hours of solid entertainment and I recommend it especially if you are interested in German cinema. On a random final sidenote I felt this movie looked a lot older than from 2006 maybe 90s or even 80s but that helped the prison atmosphere maybe.".

The whole piano performance did not feel as emotional and freebreaking to me as I wished it could have been to be the true highlight of the movie as the makers intended it to. Nonetheless it's slightly under two hours of solid entertainment and I recommend it especially if you are interested in German cinema. On a random final sidenote I felt this movie looked a lot older than from 2006 maybe 90s or even 80s but that helped the prison atmosphere maybe.";

	schema:reviewBody "Angela Winkler totally dominates this movie and it could scarcely function without her acting skills. She is at once reserved and sensuous in a way that suggests a deeply spiritual person. It comes as no surprise that her character was educated in a convent and is jokingly called the nun by her friends.  Quite possibly she might have entered holy orders and she still keeps up contact with the Cloister she remembers so fondly. Anyhow Katharina is now a housemaid working for a kind lawyer and his wife after a failed marriage to a dork. Somehow though she manages to have a fancy apartment and a Porsche something that will cause her much grief later on. She gets invited to a party in progress by a bunch of her friends she is reluctant to go but finally accepts. This is during Carnival similar to Halloween so most people are dressed in outrageous costumes and partying wildly. The demure Katharina seems out of place here until she meets a kind young man not in costume who treats her with tenderness and respect quite different from the boozers. It's love at first sight Katharina is overwhelmed for the first time ever  love at first sight.  They go off and spend the night in her apartment.SPOILERS The next morning all hell breaks loose as a SWAT team bursts into her apartment looking for the guy who by then is gone. We have known there's something odd about him as we've seen him at the beginning of the film framed in the crosshairs of a moviecamera a brilliant touch reminiscent of Peeping Tom and seen him throw off a pursuer in an exciting car chase. It turns out the police think he is a dangerous international terrorist worse still they think the pure and delicate Katharina is his longstanding accomplice in terror. She is now plunged into utter hell not so much from the police interrogation which is bad enough but from the attentions of the gutterpress which uses distortions and outright lies to destroy her reputation in the eyes of the gullible populace with much cooperation from the police. As she's being escorted to the police station the cops grab her hair in order to make her face twist in pain thus the pressphotos get to show her as vicious.  END SPOILERS I am struck by how much this film resembles Town Without Pity 1961 which was also set in Germany with Christine Kaufmann playing a role similar to Katharina Blum it must surely have been a major influence on Schlondorff. Kafka's The Trial also comes to mind. Another influence must have been the paintings of James Ensor eg The Entry of Christ into Brussels with its revellers in grotesque and frightening masks. Carnival is a major participant in the story as the drunken revellers in strange costumes become something frightening when they turn into an accusatory mob as they do upon seeing the nowdishonoured Katharina. Although the story chronicles the systematic destruction of a personality there are some surprise twists which I won't reveal.  It should be said that Katharina imperceptibly metamorphoses from a terrified victim into somebody with a quiet determination to do what must be done.  Angela Winkler is absolutely brilliant in the way she portrays this subtle change in her character underplaying the drama and conveying her changing feelings with the minutest of facial expressions which speak louder than sweeping gestures. I'll leave others to discuss the political implications of the movie but you have to see it for one of the great  acting performances of the century.".

	schema:headline " Powerful film based on Heinrich Bll novel";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is based on the novel of the same name by the German author Heinrich Bll.  The book is purported to be written by Bll as a result of an ongoing feud in the German media between Bll and the publisher of the German daily tabloid the Bild Zeitung a publication known for its lurid and sensational reporting of the news.  In his story Bll attempts to show how damaging irresponsible journalism can be to the lives and reputations of innocent persons caught up in the tide of current events.The story begins with Katherina Blum attending a party where she meets and is strongly attracted to a young man.  She invites him to her apartment and they spend the night making love.  The next morning the young man has gone and the police are storming her door seeking to arrest the overnight guest as a terrorist.  Instead Katherina is arrested and taken to the police station for interrogation as his accomplice.  The young terrorist has been killed and Katherina is unable to prove that she had no knowledge of his activities.  A tabloid reporter becomes obsessed by the case hounds Katherina mercilessly destroying her reputation and any semblance of a normal life.  The emotional tension continues to build finally reaching a violent climax.This is a very powerful and well made film.  Bll's message regarding sensational and irresponsible journalism is very clear.  After suffering along with the innocent Katharina through the insult pain and dishonor of her ordeal I came away from the film with an altered point of view toward tabloid journalism and commercial news reporting in general.  In a world where reporters are being found guilty of manufacturing news stories media agencies are providing dramatic reenactments of sensational news events and names like O.J. Simpson and Monica Lewinsky are used as teasers to improve the ratings of news programs this film is a must see.".

Although those who know Katarina tell the press and police of a bright sweet and quiet girl her reputation is run through the gutter by the men who translate her private life to the public world.  Eventually Katarina takes on the attributes of a stereotypical terrorist because the state has given her no choice but to become radicalized.  Simply because Katarina will not give up her dignity and privacy she becomes an enemy of the state.For Katarina her private life becomes glaringly public and the public judges her based on both the fabricated evidence presented by her accusers both press and government as well as their own assumptions about how a woman should behave.  In the society that surrounds Katarina the state functions through conformity and those who do not conform instantly become the enemy.   As a woman Katarina bears the brunt of this brutality as her sexuality becomes both exploited and demonized.

My point is that it is clear that Schlndorff is a very enlightened director aware of the great modern literary tradition that came before him. We may be reminded of Joseph K. in Kafka's THE TRIAL who wakes up one fine morning with the police in his room and is under arrest without having done anything wrong. We also should find similarities between the methods the police in this film use to prosecute Katharina Blum and the way the prosecutors slander Camus' hero Meursault in THE STRANGER. This film is highly recommended for those interested in the legacy of German history. There are subtle references to the Nazi period in this film that students in German Studies should pick up on. Overall this film is very respectful of the intellectual tradition that precedes it but it gets a 9 for not infecting the viewer in the Tolstoyan sense.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's funny but the recent Criterion DVD release of The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum gives it a whole new perspective. Next to The Legend of Rita Lost Honor is almost like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. But in this case it's dead serious.Katharina Blum is a normal German woman who has a onenight state with a man she meets at a party. Later she finds out that he is an anarchist and part of a BaaderMeinhofftype gang the group Rita from Legend of Rita is supposed to be a member of.Responding to the activities of German urban guerrillas there is a national dragnet to hunt them down. Blum is arrested and gets caught up in the hunt revealing a myopic government at it's most abusive. Equally revealing is the insidious nature of the media and it's role in repression. You can't help but get a chill watching it not because you can't believe it ever happened. But because you can't believe it happens all the time. Life in America is a lot like Katharina Blum's for many people.Schlndorff is an intellectual. Both of these films are great reflections of that.

	onyx:emotionText "It's funny but the recent Criterion DVD release of The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum gives it a whole new perspective. Next to The Legend of Rita Lost Honor is almost like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. But in this case it's dead serious.Katharina Blum is a normal German woman who has a onenight state with a man she meets at a party. Later she finds out that he is an anarchist and part of a BaaderMeinhofftype gang the group Rita from Legend of Rita is supposed to be a member of.Responding to the activities of German urban guerrillas there is a national dragnet to hunt them down. Blum is arrested and gets caught up in the hunt revealing a myopic government at it's most abusive. Equally revealing is the insidious nature of the media and it's role in repression. You can't help but get a chill watching it not because you can't believe it ever happened. But because you can't believe it happens all the time. Life in America is a lot like Katharina Blum's for many people.Schlndorff is an intellectual. Both of these films are great reflections of that. They're smart challenging while being well paced and lithe. Lost Honor marked the directorial debut of Margarethe Von Trotta in some ways a protg of Schlndorff's not to mention lover who would go on to great things including Rosa Luxembourg.";

It becomes a media frenzy and the media comes down especially hard on her. It's a real circus and Katharina's life is turned upside down as well as that of her dying mother. There's one reporter who was particularly oppressive and in the final scene is shot by Katharina.A lot of the specifics aren't particularly clear but that seems on purpose. It's not clear what sort of criminal Ludwig Gtten Jrgen Prochnow is except for a widely sought one. It's also not clear if Katharina was lying the entire time and actually helped Ludwig or not. In the end she's very quick to get back with him and call him on the telephone. This seems very contrary to someone ignorant of the man's criminal past. I really like how the police and media are portrayed. I hear a lot of talk about how police are necessary but they are those who walk around with a gun putting out harsh questions and being general jerks. This film does a good job showing of what they do  how many times the innocent are convicted etc. It's also great that the media is shown how they are. The obvious bias shown by media in their decision to cover certain events over another and the intrusive and aggressive nature of the tabloids is shown well. Undoubtedly this isn't a true story but it is based on the novel by Heinrich Bll who had experience with such things himself. It's easy to forget sometimes that film is a part of life and it's important to show the modern world as it is while still telling a story  which this does.

The next morning she is shocked to wake up to see a special police unit storming into her apartment seeking to arrest Ludwig to no avail as he has already left. It turns out Ludwig is a highly wanted criminal involved in anarchist activity and Katharina is arrested as well as a potential associate. Her name and pictures are published in trashy tabloids and particularly an almost caricaturelike journalist called Ttges Dieter Laser is completely unashamed of dragging her whole life through dirt by selling fabricated stories to his magazine.The film examines the effects of the witchhunt caused by the press and was inspired by writer Heinrich Bll's own experiences. The atmosphere of anxiety is created subtly with some avantgarde music and bleak photography. Some of the scenes during Katharina's imprisonment have Kafkaesque loneliness written all over them in an effective distressing manner. Angela Winkler shows all these feelings naturally without much dialogue.Even though the exploration of Katharina's emotions during the media spectacle is interesting the slowpaced film feels a little too long at times and could have benefited from being trimmed down a bit in the middle. On the other hand in the beginning I would have liked to see more of Katharina and Ludwig's short relationship as it could have explained her fondness for him better. Now it doesn't seem all clear why she wants to protect him despite all the troubles it causes her. Also the film is understandably completely on Katharina's side but the ending comes across as a little heavyhanded partly due to the overwrought performance of the priest in the epilogue.In spite of minor complaints I think Katharina Blum is a good and still highly relevant film and I recommend it to anyone interested in slowpaced character studies and bleak dramas. Those interested in the power of the Press and the hypocrisy of the public should also check it out.".

On the other hand during the film I had high hopes about the climax and the actual ending became a disappointment. I still think that the director and the writer have missed an opportunity. Unfortunately it may well be that the silly unraveling is actually their intention. Most part of the film seems to be a warning to the viewer that he or she can become a victim of the public opinion and the judicial system. Since this is both true and ill understood the film could bring some enlightenment. In the Netherlands there used to be a PR campaign proclaiming that the police is your best friend. In fact the interest of the police and the accidental bypasser are seldom coinciding and paragraphs about extorted false confessions are not uncommon. And although the highly subjective gathering of news by the media is well known most people still tend to believe what is in print or on the screen. The story is located in the turbulent Germany in 1975 at a time when violent revolutions still seemed a viable alternative. The anarchist Rote Armee Fraktion scored its first terrorist successes. The Berlin journals of Springer Verlag started a rightwing campaign which had some resemblance to the American McCarthy years. Civil rights were curtailed and radical citizens were excluded from certain professions. In this political climate the famous leftwing politician Rudi Dutschke was shot by an idiot. The film hitches on to these living conditions when the main character Blum experiences love at first sight for a suspected and wanted terrorist. Actually the story is not quite clear about his criminal past and it may consist of conscientions objection verbal agitation or being member of a subversive organization or so. After a one night stand with the man a quickie Blum is arrested on suspicion of accessory. The man himself has somehow disappeared in a miraculous way. The police officerinterrogator is an unpleasant character but to me his behavior seems to be within the usual limits. His main fault is a collaboration with an unscrupulous newspaper journalist. They exchange information which is indeed penal and an official abuse but I fear also quite common. The journalist even obtrudes himself on the dying mother of Blum and writes a distorted paragraph about it. Characteristic is the reaction of the pertinent surgeon in response to the article If he indeed has entered the intensive care station the hospital will sue him. However I think it is impossible. Consequently the public opinion condemns Blum as a terrorist and she is spit at etc. So far so good. But then the story takes a bizarre turn. We discover that Blum has actually organized the escape of the terrorist and his going into hiding. Apparently she is indeed an accessory and guilty. In the end she actually murders the journalist and it is suggested also his photographer. The tables are turned Blum is an unscrupulous criminal and the police officer and the journalist are effective professionals albeit human who deserve our admiration. The film ends with the burial scene of the journalist where in a moving speech the liberty of the press and its vital importance for the democracy are professed. We are back with the fairy tale that the police is your best friend and the media tell the truth. In a world full of power abuse this is not the most helpful message and therefore I can not frankly recommend this film. If you are captivated by the theme of state oppression in some form you may consider seeing Fatherland Man of Marble Einer trage des anderen Last or Die Architekten. In addition my list of reviews contains lots of films about unionism.".

	schema:headline " Doesn't quite achieve what it wants to achieve but has some interesting aspects";
	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1970s West Germany was having quite a problem with what was known as the BaaderMeinhof terrorist gang. Author Heinrich Bll wrote an article criticizing what he saw as the German tabloid BildZeitung's fearmongering tactics in their reporting of the activities of the BaaderMeinhof gang. Subsequently Bll was called a terrorist sympathizer and the police began checking him out as if he were a criminal. This provoked Bll into writing a novel also called The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum which was to serve as a parable for the consequences of yellow journalism and fascistleaning police actions. The subtitle of the book was the overambitious How violence can arise and what it can lead to.Filmmakers Volker Schlndorff and Margarethe von Trotta knew and empathized with Bll so they began to put the film into production immediately. I haven't read the novel so I can't compare the two but unfortunately the film at least based on the English language translation comes nowhere near its goals in terms of political or social commentary.Here's how the story begins per what we actually see on the screen a manhe turns out to be Ludwig Gtten Jrgen Prochnowwho is behaving mysteriouslycovertly finds his way to a party. At the party he hooks up with a swinging trio consisting of an apparent Arab and two women. They then head to another party where Gtten runs into Katharina Blum Angela Winkler. They stare at each other oddly and dance slowly. The Arab heads off to the bathroom reports to whoever is listening on the other side of his wire that Gtten and Blum are together and we see Gtten and Blum subjected to surveillance as they leave together to go to her apartment. In the morning I'm not sure why they'd wait until morning police including armed men in something like riot gear storm into Blum's apartment planning on absconding Gtten. But Gtten is gone. So they take Blum in for questioning. It seems that Gtten is a suspected terrorist and they want to know what Blum's relationship is to him. Blum ends up briefly imprisoned.At the same time a local tabloid paper simply called The Paper in the Englishlanguage subtitles at least begins printing trumped up stories about Blum occasionally even completely fabricating quotes from interviewees. As in the novel the gist of the film is supposed to be that the treatment from the police and the newspaper are ruining Blum's life.It's certainly true that the police and the journalists shown in the film get a bit out of line. However their transgressions are relatively minor especially compared to other filmic depictions of such things. Blum is never strongarmed by the police for example. Compared to the real world there are no molestations with broomstick handles here. The journalists do not do anything unusual for tabloid journalists. I can't remember when it started publishing but The Weekly World News sure fabricates stories a lot stronger than The Paper in Katharina Blum does and it's not as if The National Enquirer say hasn't been successfully sued for slanderlibel. On the other hand The National Enquirer hasn't exactly ruined lives either. That would be quite an exaggeration.It's not clear why Blum answers the police's line of questioning without objecting more vehemently or alternately refraining from talking and incriminating herself. I'm not sure what Germany's laws are or were on that. No one tells us that Blum has to respond to the police in the way that she does and she certainly doesn't try very hard to do otherwise.If we look at things from the police's perspective for a moment Gtten is supposedly a terrorist. While we're not shown anything confirming this we're not shown anything denying it either. We don't know what kind of evidence the police have on Gtten. And here is a woman who is apparently helping him out. So obviously they're going to question her and police will ask you all kinds of questions that you don't have to answer. As shown in the film it is suggested that Blum is actually lying about the extent of her interactions with Gtten. If she just met him many plot points make little sense. Further Schlndorff and von Trotta suggest in subtle ways that Blum's circle of acquaintances might not just be ideological leftists. Given all of this the police aren't really shown doing anything out of line except asking questions that Blum wouldn't have had to answer.The Paper gets more out of line but we're actually only shown a couple incidents where they change words in someone's statement. The idea is that Blum is being tried and convicted in the tabloid. Yet tried and convicted in the press is hyperbole certainly. Blum remained free. She wasn't proved guilty of anything. The emotional turmoil she experiences which leads to a much improved climax seems more a result of her own odd disposition and the character is quite odd and somewhat volatile in the film than blamable on stories in the newspaper. The only person who ruins Blum's life is Blum.If you haven't seen the film yet it might seem odd that I'm hanging on narrow points so much. You're probably saying But what about the plot? Isn't this a good suspenseful film? The bulk of the film consists of the police questioning Blum and reporters trying to interview her family friends and associates although that takes up a lot less time than the police questioning Blum. This is nothing if not a talking head film. It succeeds or not largely based on that talking. There are stretches where the talking is engaging even if it's not making the point that Schlndorff and von Trotta want to make. It's a good idea and could have worked with a better script. But there's not much else to praise including the technical elements which are just average.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum or The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum is a West German movie from 1975 so this one already had its 40th anniversary last year. the title certainly sounds like a Rainer Werner Fassbinder movie and the time when this came out also fits but actually this is a film directed by Volker Schlndorff with his wife Margarethe von Trotta her first directorial effort and the duo also adapted Heinrich Bll's novel together for the screen here. The lead actress is played by Angela Winkler around the age of 30. It was not her first successful performance but maybe her first careerdefining. She won a German Film Award for her turn here. The supporting cast consists of a bunch of male actors who were all among Germany's finest around that time and are still very wellknown today such as Mario Adorf Jrgen Prochnow Dieter Laser and Heinz Bennent.This 105minute movie is about a woman who really does nothing wrong yet has to face severe consequences for her actions which ultimately drive her to becoming a criminal herself. Winkler's character has a onenight stand with a terrorist. The next morning he is gone and police forces rush into her apartment. She gets taken to jail like a criminal and from that moment on not only struggles with police authorities but also with the press especially one particularly persistent journalist Laser who is not even scared of harassing the main character's very sick mother. The ending is particularly telling with the eulogy on freedom of press and the bad guy becoming a martyr although it becomes obvious that this film is actually making a statement for the opposite site namely for individual freedom and the right of not being harassed by press when you just want your calm.I quite enjoyed the watch here. The film gets a bit weaker after the first hour when it moves a bit away from Winkler's Laser's and Adorf's characters certainly the most interesting but the last 15 minutes make up for it again. I am generally not too big on Schlndorff's or von Trotta's works such as Young Trless or Hannah Arendt and I also find The Tin Drum vastly overrated but I think the spouses reached a convincing result with their collaboration here. Maybe they should have just made more films together. Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum is clearly worth checking out especially for Winkler's and Laser's performances. Give it a chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Volker Schlndorff is either a diabolically brilliant dissembler or a gifted idiot savant. His public persona of hapless twittering political correctness see the extras on this DVD comforts the intellectual and critical elite while his terse wellcrafted movies give the lie to the bloody nonsense those elites espouse. The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum 1975 is an excellent example of this. The official plot line of the film mindlessly parroted here on IMDb and elsewhere describes the young Mrs. Blum as an earnest innocent a simple housemaid unwittingly caught up in the toils of the vicious capitalist news media and Germany's cryptoNazi police bureaucracy. This summary neatly fits the pinktinged world view of Criterion creator of the DVD version. It does not fit the movie itself. If you actually watch the movie rather than just read what you are supposed to think about it you will realize about three quarters of the way through that although the police may be bumbling wretches they were right all along about Mrs. Blum. She really is a cool and calculating agent of subversion not just the passing plaything of a terrorist on the run. She is not cool enough however. Her casual contempt for everyone around her  for the lawyer and architect who employ and befriend her for her shady financier lover for her exhusband even for her own terrorist network  is expressed in her sloppy tradecraft. She drops a damning clue which leads the police directly to her terrorist contact. Oh well she shrugs he was a loser anyway just an army deserter. There are plenty more where he came from. The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum is not Volker Schlndorff's best film  The Legend of Rita 2000 The Ogre 1996 and Homo Faber 1991 are all better movies  but it is not bad. What IS bad is an insipid documentary on this Criterion DVD. It is a 1977 amateurish interview with Heinrich Bll 19171985 who wrote the 1974 novel which inspired Schlndorff's movie. Heinrich Bll was a Wehrmacht soldier in the 1940s turned Movement philosopher in the 1960s. In his stories and novels he shared with a younger generation including director Schlndorff a profound wartime insight. On the battlefield Bll had realized that the true enemy of Hitler's National Socialism had not been Stalin's International Socialism he was old enough to remember the nineteen happy years 19221941 when the USSR and Germany had been allied against the West until Hitler's jealousy had spoiled the grand Socialist coalition. No what had ultimately defeated Heinrich Bll and his fellow German National Socialists in 1945 had been America and her twin evils liberty and free enterprise. Two decades later in the 1960s America was on the way to defeating the International Socialists too starting in Viet Nam unless the American military could somehow be stopped there. Bll was a leading orator of the West European branch of the worldwide Youth Movement organized from Moscow to resist the advance of America and liberty.

	onyx:emotionText "Volker Schlndorff is either a diabolically brilliant dissembler or a gifted idiot savant. His public persona of hapless twittering political correctness see the extras on this DVD comforts the intellectual and critical elite while his terse wellcrafted movies give the lie to the bloody nonsense those elites espouse. The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum 1975 is an excellent example of this. The official plot line of the film mindlessly parroted here on IMDb and elsewhere describes the young Mrs. Blum as an earnest innocent a simple housemaid unwittingly caught up in the toils of the vicious capitalist news media and Germany's cryptoNazi police bureaucracy. This summary neatly fits the pinktinged world view of Criterion creator of the DVD version. It does not fit the movie itself. If you actually watch the movie rather than just read what you are supposed to think about it you will realize about three quarters of the way through that although the police may be bumbling wretches they were right all along about Mrs. Blum. She really is a cool and calculating agent of subversion not just the passing plaything of a terrorist on the run. She is not cool enough however. Her casual contempt for everyone around her  for the lawyer and architect who employ and befriend her for her shady financier lover for her exhusband even for her own terrorist network  is expressed in her sloppy tradecraft. She drops a damning clue which leads the police directly to her terrorist contact. Oh well she shrugs he was a loser anyway just an army deserter. There are plenty more where he came from. The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum is not Volker Schlndorff's best film  The Legend of Rita 2000 The Ogre 1996 and Homo Faber 1991 are all better movies  but it is not bad. What IS bad is an insipid documentary on this Criterion DVD. It is a 1977 amateurish interview with Heinrich Bll 19171985 who wrote the 1974 novel which inspired Schlndorff's movie. Heinrich Bll was a Wehrmacht soldier in the 1940s turned Movement philosopher in the 1960s. In his stories and novels he shared with a younger generation including director Schlndorff a profound wartime insight. On the battlefield Bll had realized that the true enemy of Hitler's National Socialism had not been Stalin's International Socialism he was old enough to remember the nineteen happy years 19221941 when the USSR and Germany had been allied against the West until Hitler's jealousy had spoiled the grand Socialist coalition. No what had ultimately defeated Heinrich Bll and his fellow German National Socialists in 1945 had been America and her twin evils liberty and free enterprise. Two decades later in the 1960s America was on the way to defeating the International Socialists too starting in Viet Nam unless the American military could somehow be stopped there. Bll was a leading orator of the West European branch of the worldwide Youth Movement organized from Moscow to resist the advance of America and liberty. The Movement as it selfconsciously styled itself did defeat America in the early 1970s   not in Viet Nam but in Washington  leaving much of the world to languish under Communism for another decade and a half and leaving tens of millions of Asian African and East European people to be butchered their blood spilled on the altar of Marxism.

With his new film Tideland coming out soon Gilliam chose to focus his efforts on molding it while allowing The Brothers Grimm to go wherever the studio wanted to take it. The result is by far the most commercial film to Gilliam's name but in this case watereddown Gilliam is better than no Gilliam and his first film in seven years Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in 1998 is a fun one.The Brothers Grimm certainly looks like a Terry Gilliam movie loaded with extravagant visuals and wide angled shots although the 80 million budget did allow for his first use of CGI it really isn't too bad though and it does not have the incredibly surreal feeling to it that most Gilliam films have. It takes a bit of time to get used to Matt Damon as Will Grimm and Heath Ledger moreso Damon as Ledger is surprisingly good as Jacob Grimm. The film was much more humorous than I had expected and has plenty of subtle Gilliam humor. Many will find Peter Stormare' Cavaldi character to be extremely annoying but I thought he was hilarious and one of the highlights of the movie. Jonathan Pryce returns to another Gilliam movie as Delatombe and does a decent job although his character was a little overly obnoxious at times. Lena Headey is good as Angelika and Monica Bellucci also pulls off a good performance although unfortunately she does not get a significant amount of screen time.The plot of The Brothers Grimm wanders a lot and I actually thought the movie was winding down at around the 90 minute mark but this works somewhat to the film's advantage as it makes a fairly straightforward plot seem slightly less predictable. The film is much sillier than the promos may lead to believe and that probably will not come us much of a surprise to big Gilliam fans. Unlike previous Gilliam movies however there really is no substance behind what we see on screen so what we get is really the first 'popcorn flick' with Gilliam's name on it. Like all Terry Gilliam movies the reaction will be mixed and there will be some people who absolutely love it and some who name it their worst film of the year. As far as I'm concerned Grimm does not hold a candle to Terry Gilliam's previous films but it is one of the better 'big summer movies' and I certainly felt my time was well spent watching it.3 stars out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "Well my friends I have just returned from the earliest possible showing of Brothers Grimm in my area and I can assure you it was well worth getting up a few hours earlier than usual to watch. However I would caution anyone who doesn't like Terry Gilliam's work Matt Damon and Heath Ledger or the REAL brothers Grimms' stories that this is not your average fantasy. The story is set in frenchoccupied Germany in the 1700s a real time in which real people actually lived. Even some of the magical aspects of the story are explained by real events I won't spoil it for you. So quite a bit of the plot deals with the realities of the day and age along with the fantastical aspects of the forest and its inhabitants.That being said the story also deals with the opposite side of unreality the dark and unnaturally gruesome. This is where I think the writer hit on a brilliant point while the real brothers' stories have happy endings and some lighthearted moments most if not all of their stories involve some degree of blood and gore. My hat is off to Ehren Kruger for being true to that aspect of their work.The only aspects of this movie I disliked were the unresolved ending which I won't spoil either and some of the acting. Lena Headey's performance did not impress me but it could just be lack of material to work with a very overdone character and the fact that I've never seen any of her other work. Matt Damon is interesting to watch as usual. Peter Stormare and Jonathan Pryce are wacky to the point of annoyance as an Italian torture specialist and a French general. The only truly wonderful performance however is that of Mr. Ledger whose bumbling scholarly tagalong Jacob was both a sympathetic character and a side we rarely see from this multitalented actor.This is not a movie for everyone I wouldn't bring children with the tendency for nightmares or irrational fears for example. It's not a movie you'll learn from or probably want to see hundreds of times. But for the moviegoer looking for beautiful cinematography a few good laughs and a fairly suspenseful story look no further.".

	schema:headline " Gilliam does Hollywood ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of both good oldfashioned fantasy movies and of director Terry Gilliam I was really looking forward to this one. I was slightly put off when I heard Gilliam's complaints about the constant interference of the Brothers Weinstein but the director does have a history of being dissatisfied with the production of projects which actually turn out pretty good in the end so my hopes were still pretty high.Rather than being a historical biography of the famous authors this is a fantastic makebelieve story of the possible inspirations behind the stories of the Brothers Grimm. The brothers travel around Europe working as con artists fooling simple peasants into believing they are witchhunters and monster slayers. However when they are captured by a French general and sent to investigate a town which is believed to have been targeted by similar conmen they discover that there may be some truth behind the fairy tales. The very woods surrounding the town seem to be alive a big bad wolf stalks through the darkness and an evil power seems to emanate from a mysterious ancient tower ...So Gilliam tries his hand at doing a commercial summer blockbuster. And the results are well interesting. Primarily he shows that he can produce some great action sequences and there are some really great visual ideas here many of which I'll admit are entirely thanks to topnotch CGI work. These are the moments when the director's creative magic appears to shine through and there's enough of them to make this movie worth watching. Overall it does feel strangely derivative for a Gilliam movie but I suppose that's to be expected when he sacrifices creative control to the studio. In the past I've heard that Gilliam simply sees himself as a hired hand on such projects.However where it fails is in the mixture of action and drama in repeatedly placing it's characters in peril whilst also making us care about them.

	onyx:emotionText "Being a fan of both good oldfashioned fantasy movies and of director Terry Gilliam I was really looking forward to this one. I was slightly put off when I heard Gilliam's complaints about the constant interference of the Brothers Weinstein but the director does have a history of being dissatisfied with the production of projects which actually turn out pretty good in the end so my hopes were still pretty high.Rather than being a historical biography of the famous authors this is a fantastic makebelieve story of the possible inspirations behind the stories of the Brothers Grimm. The brothers travel around Europe working as con artists fooling simple peasants into believing they are witchhunters and monster slayers. However when they are captured by a French general and sent to investigate a town which is believed to have been targeted by similar conmen they discover that there may be some truth behind the fairy tales. The very woods surrounding the town seem to be alive a big bad wolf stalks through the darkness and an evil power seems to emanate from a mysterious ancient tower ...So Gilliam tries his hand at doing a commercial summer blockbuster. And the results are well interesting. Primarily he shows that he can produce some great action sequences and there are some really great visual ideas here many of which I'll admit are entirely thanks to topnotch CGI work. These are the moments when the director's creative magic appears to shine through and there's enough of them to make this movie worth watching. Overall it does feel strangely derivative for a Gilliam movie but I suppose that's to be expected when he sacrifices creative control to the studio. In the past I've heard that Gilliam simply sees himself as a hired hand on such projects.However where it fails is in the mixture of action and drama in repeatedly placing it's characters in peril whilst also making us care about them. Unfortunately this has been a problem in a lot of these bigbudget fantasyaction movies lately including last years equivalent  Van Helsing.

	schema:reviewBody "Like his Baron Munchhausen Gilliam's Brothers Grimm has been horridly misunderstood by critics and public alike. What I get from the comments and reviews is the sense of thwarted expectations although I have little idea what the antiGrimms expected in the first place. People dislike the kitten scene because it's a cute kitten. This I find entirely in the grotesque spirit of the original folk tales. We've learned to take our fairy tales Disneyfied apparently. I've also heard complaints about the quality of the special effects as subILM quality. Frankly that's what I liked about them. They didn't look like ILM they looked personal. I admit I found the basic premise a clich two con men who make their living on the superstitious gullible find out that in this case the magic is real but its workingout overcomes this basic flaw. This is a movie that shuns clich. The brightest scenes for example almost always contain the greatest menace. Relative safety is drab dirty brutish nasty and short. Ledger gives an amazing performance  I had previously regarded him as a Troy Donahue update. Matt Damon shows he has the chops to cross over from small indies to big performances in the old leadingman vein. Peter Stromare and Jonathan Pryce do a highbrow Martin  Lewis  Stromare all over the place and Pryce coolly selfcontained  to hilarious effect. The faces alone in this movie are wonderful hearkening back to the glory days of Leone. There are so many telling details in the background Bienvenue a Karlstadt  let alone the foreground  that show Gilliam's mastery. Harry Potter which I enjoyed Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia are for the kiddies and show us worlds we can with effort control. Gilliam doesn't offer any such comfort not even at the end. The sense of menace is overwhelming and Gilliam achieves it without superspecial effects usually camera movement the shots following Little Red Riding Hood through the forest made my jaw drop. A brilliant film operating at a high level we don't see much of these days. Someone compared the movie to Burton's Big Fish another film dismissed or ignored by critics and public. Although Burton's and Gilliam's sensibilities differ I take the writer's point. The confident poetic handling of myth and archetype in both astonishes.".

They wanted it to be a grimm tale but with a modern way of telling it. The first five minutes like I said sucked me in and I was waiting for them to build off of that moment in Jacob's life. Then it becomes a whole other movie. I was happy I didn't spend any money to see this I found myself thinking after every CGI moment What was I thinking?

Altogether things fill out quite nicely. It never comes straight out and says that Grimm's Fairy Tales comes from these stories but it gives the audience enough credit to figure that out on it's own even though it is quite obvious.Lena Headey deserves to be mentioned as the lovely Angelika. She plays a hardened and tough huntertrapper who helps The Grimms and is also the love interest which I guess is expected. Also Monica Bellucci was a good addition as the mirror queen.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Like I said more than I thought I would have. The special effects were very nice. The trees move realistically like snakes. More believable than some of the giant snake movies I have seen anyways. I can recommend this movie.

	schema:headline " Does not do justice to its subject matter";
	schema:reviewBody "People have a curious tendency not to notice how bizarre and gruesome children's fairy tales often are. Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm does notice. Unfortunately that's just about its only insight into the subject. The film shows no understanding of what makes fairy tales memorable and exciting or why they have endured through the ages.A much better handling of the subject is the 1962 film The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm which intersperses a realistic though nonfactual account of the brothers' lives with dramatic recreations of the tales they collected. I'm not saying that Gilliam had to do a retread of the same material. I would be very happy to see a remake with a radically new approach as long as it respects the underlying subject matter. Gilliam's film does not. Its storyline is mostly a long string of fantasy and horror clichs that remind us far more of contemporary movies than of classic fairy tales. The Big Bad Wolf for example has been reduced to a standardissue wolfman brought to life with digital effects that are just a tad too jerky to be excused in our age of hightech moviemaking.In this version the brothers Heath Ledger and Matt Damon both inexplicably adopting English accents are con artists who go from town to town posing as conjurers who can protect the local populace from evil spirits. A French general Jonathan Pryce catches on to what they're doing and forces them to work for him on pain of death. But when they're sent to a new town their old tricks prove useless against an ageold curse that really does haunt the woods.The movie belongs to the old genre where famous writers become characters in their own stories. It's a genre I've never much liked maybe because it suggests a failure to comprehend the powers of human imagination. No one could have made up these stories they must have really happened! But I have enjoyed a few films of this kind such as the 1979 movie Time After Time where H.G. Wells builds a time machine and travels to the 1970s in pursuit of Jack the Ripper. This type of story has to work hard to achieve the willing suspension of disbelief. The Brothers Grimm fails on that front because it changes its reality too often. In an early scene we're shown an intense battle with an awesomelooking banshee. Then the whole battle is revealed to have been staged. And then later on we're asked to believe that magic really does exist in this world after all. These repeated shifts in the story's reality are profoundly disorienting.The source of disarray in the woods is an undead queen Monica Bellucci trying to regain her youth in an elaborate spell that will be completed once she sacrifices a series of children from the town. She resides in a tower in the woods appearing as a skeleton on one side of a mirror and as a beautiful woman on the other. Her magical control over the woods serves as an excuse for numerous scenes of mysterious enchantment most of which have a very tenuous connection to the central plot. The trees in the forest seem to have a life of their own walking around when no one's looking. A mysterious creature lurks at the bottom of a well. The wolfman is a servant of the mirror queen using magic to ward off wouldbe visitors. But a coherent story never emerges from these elements. The screenplay seems to make up the rules as it goes along inventing whatever is convenient at any given moment. Every now and then some familiar quote is referencedWho is the fairest of them all? What big eyes you have You can't catch me I'm the Gingerbread Manbut always gratuitously. The movie's magical story is formless and convoluted lacking any consistent narrative logic. It comes off as a series of elements arbitrarily glued together.As a result the magical sequences lack payoff. We keep waiting for something wondrous to happen then nothing does. In one sequence for example two children named Hans and Greta are making their way through the woods leaving a trail of bread crumbs in their wake. We eagerly await the children's encounter with the gingerbread house run by the cannibalistic witch or at least something of comparable interest. But just about the only thing that happens is a mysterious sequence involving a levitating shawl. Like many other sequences in the film this one doesn't go anywhere and has only the faintest connection with the mirror queen story.No doubt there's an important theme at work in scenes like this. The movie is suggesting that the classic fairy tales are the result of accounts that have been embellished over time. But other writers have handled this theme much more effectively. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked for example turns The Wizard of Oz into a sophisticated adult fantasy with complex character motives and sly social satire. In that novel there is a definite implication that we are being told the real story and that the conventional version is the corruption. But the novel handles this conceit by expanding on the story not degrading it. There's no point in creating a revisionist fairy tale if it's going to be less fleshed out than the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to begin this review by letting you know right off that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I haven't adored everything Terry Gilliam has done but I don't hate his style either. Rather I judge each movie by its own merits.This work is adventurous exciting and storydriven. Most would probably consider this work actiondriven but I find there IS a good solid story behind the action. It has moments of suspense breathtaking imagery and stylized humor. It is a great movie.A great movie which has obvious flaws. Regardless of how much I enjoyed this movie there was one element which nagged at me the whole time I was viewing this work. Mind you I have not seen this on DVD so I am unaware if they have created the DVD fix for this yet or not. I could not help but notice in several places the editing seemed stiff. I am fervently hoping that this came from a paring down of those scenes. If such is the case then I am also just as fervently hoping they give us the US  Canada a Region 1 2disk Director's Cut with those scenes edited BACK IN! I hate it when they include the deleted scenes outside the movie. Put those back where they belong!On the flip side...With the release of Underworld in 2003 the subsubgenre of ActionHorror has taken a turn at the box office. Just as The Worst Witch revived the interest in Magick and fantasy and generated an audience for the later Harry Potter series so did Underworld revive the Horror genre and the appreciation for the blending of Horror and Action. This work The Brothers Grimm as an ActionHorror does not foot the bill. There is too little Horror and the action is sometimes a bit subdued. There are places where CGI andor choreography is obvious thereby breaking the Spell so competently woven by the story and virtue of the characters. However it IS too dark for the kiddies and still quite enjoyable.I was not disappointed but I was not elated over the final product either. Here's hoping for a GOOD fix and a timely release of the 2disk Region 1 Director's Cut DVD release.It rates an 8.610 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:headline " So there is a use to enchantment!";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think myself overly literary for reading Bruno Bettelheim's The Uses of Enchantment but forgive me for being obscure. In his book Bettelheim analyzes common fairy tales for their underlying psychological and cultural meanings. He makes a great argument for the telling of fairy tales even if they are slightly or more than slightly graphic which is why I am partly able to explain my fascination with this film.It's not really overly good really as you've probably seen more of a seven out of ten but yet it fascinates me. Perhaps it's the psychological element between the two brothers which is done quite well about the importanceexistence of magic or the surreal score peppered with Brahms and Dario Marianelli originals. I have no idea who this guy is but the soundtrack is so weird that I want it. Perhaps it's the horror invoked by the fairy tale images of our childhood brought horribly to life in the thankfully twisted mind of Terry Gilliam.Oh a little note about Terry Gilliam. You're going to have to forgive him because his pace can be a little bit feverish and he tends to lose the viewer that's not paying attention. He did make Time Bandits and Monty Python and the Holy Grail and you know how much of THAT made sense. Do not question how the Grimm boys get from one end of Germany to another so quickly. Your head will explode.Basically this film makes me happy for a couple of reasons one the dialogue. It's strangely antiquated one minute then purely Hollywood the next. Don't worry about the anachronisms they're supposed to be there they're funny. Two his name starts with Heath and ends with Ledger. Now I didn't used to like this guy. I thought he was just a deep throated Aussie but the boy's got range. I didn't know he could lack confidence so well. Now I'm teasing but really he's quite good. Damon was wonderful as always proving over and over again that he may not be the prettier but he's the smarter half of Benatt. Three they're fairy tales in their ghoulish bloody glory. Wait till you see both Little Red Riding Hood scenes you'll totally freak out. It's nightmarish in such a way that you can't take your eyes off it. It's not morbid fascination like a car accident but something deeper the sense of childlike wonder that make kids watch the most disgusting thing like insects or TOADS for hours.What is the point? You might ask. Why should I see this piece of rubbish instead of The 40 Year Old Virgin for the 6th time? Or in the long run rent The Princess Bride? You should rent both by the way it'd make a lovely double feature. Well I still can't watch the waxing scene but here's the real point Fairy tales have a purpose. They give us comfort when we are in crises and delight and frighten us when we need to have fun. What we see in Ledger's character Jacob is the child who shelters himself with fairy tales. What we see in Damon's the older Will is the adult who wants to take him away from him. And as Bettelheim says fantasy is not nearly as cruelly unforgiving as reality so let him keep them. I still need a little Sleeping Beauty now and then. There's something strangely comforting about waking to true love's kiss.".

It's funny interesting exciting and even a little scary so don't bring your little children if they get scared easily.The premise  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the Brothers Grimm famous around Frenchoccupied Germany for driving away demons though they are in fact con artists with fancy gadgets and conspirators for special effects. They use the money they collect for their services to finance their operations.

Jake Heath Ledger is the dreamer convinced that there is truth in legend and that with courage and effort any problem can be solved. Predictably but not boringly the two of them provide the perfect team to fight what turns out to be a reallife magical evil danger.The special effects aren't the best some of the cgi creatures move quite jerkily but when they're good they work.

	schema:reviewBody "The Brothers Grimm was extremely disappointing. I love Terry Gilliam movies so I was excited to see this but there is very little Terry Gilliamlike about this film. The jokes although constantly attempted are never funny and the script in general needs some serious help. The movie starts out well enough with the Brothers Grimm as conartists duping townspeople into paying a small fortune to have a witch vanquished. It could have been a very good movie if it continued along this path. Instead it degenerates into a plot of loosely thrown together bits of fairy tails and amateurish acting. The whole toughgirlwhoknowswhatshe'sdoingbutstillneedstoberescued thing with the Cursed is so played out and tired that it's almost sad. And the townspeople call her the Cursed because her father and sisters were killed? That hardly warrants spitting after saying her name another tired joke!!! The worst is saved for last with a happy ending that is SO not out of a Grimm fairy tale. It makes you wonder... has anyone working on this movie actually read any of the Brother's Grimm's work? Or did they just see the Disney version?".

Terry Gilliamdirected fantasy has incredible production values cinematography and scoring not to mention two appealing lead performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger yet it takes a good hour to get this picture off the ground. The narrative is heavygoing and while not a hodgepodge the film could certainly use a bit more heart and soul rather than CGI effects. Gilliam's handling takes on a more robust oldfashioned flavor in the second hour and the movie improves tremendously as a result. The witch's palace set atop a skyscraper tree is dazzling and the initial entrance into her ravenladen lair is deliciously giddy. Jonathan Pryce is wellcast as an evil general who attempts to torch the two men in an impressive forest fire however the charm of the piece and the glue holding the adventure together lies with Damon and Ledger and they are by turns wily funny strapping childish and heroic. 12 from ".

I was dragged to it by a friend. I can see why critics don't like thisthere are no likable characters the humor is VERY black children are constantly being attacked and in one case graphically eaten. The story has HUGE gaps in logic even for a fairy tale doesn't pull together smoothly and I had more than few questions at the end. STILL I did like it.The special effects are truly incredibleit's worth seeing for those. The acting is good tooDamon who I never liked is actually not bad in this movieif extremely unlikable Ledger manages to pull out a good performance even buried under bad makeup Hedey is full of life and very good as a woman who helps them. Only Jonathan Pryce failshe's VERY annoying and unfunny as a French officer. We're supposed to like him but I hated him VERY much halfway through. Bad accent too.Despite the many faults i got caught up in it. There are constant references to Grimm fairy tales and the visuals are stunning. There's also an incredibly sick but hysterical sequence with an adorable kitten. But this is NOT FOR CHILDREN!!! Despite the PG13 rating I would never take a child to see this. There were children in the audience I saw it with. They weren't too impressed and one told her mother she was scared. This is WAY TOO adult and violent for young kids.It's not for every one but I got caught up in it and actually enjoyed it. AgainNOT for kids. I give it an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's Bavaria in the early 19th Century and Willhelm and Jacob Grimm Damon and Ledger are traveling hucksters who trick gullible and superstitious townspeople into paying them to rid their towns of witches. They're making a good amount of money until they happen upon a situation that really does involve magic something that they're not quite equipped to deal with.Despite an interesting premise The Brothers Grimm is a dull and cheesy mess. The worst part about the movie is the script. Ehren Kruger does a horrible job of trying to mix comedy action and some horror into this fantasy film. The different genres don't fit well together and you're left with a mess. Ehren was just the wrong guy for the job and he should stick with horror films. Terry Gilliam does a decent job behind the camera but he can't save the film. At least the movie looks good though and it has that interesting Gilliam style.The acting is pretty poor and no one gives a good performance. Matt Damon is a pretty talented actor but he can't save the film. He's clearly a miscast here but he does appear to be having fun and this helps. Heath Ledger plays neurotic poorly and he's also a miscast. Monica Bellucci has a small role and she doesn't really appear until the end. She gives an okay performance nothing special.Besides for the two lead characters the rest of them are all really annoying. I guess they were trying to be funny but it was way over the top and pointless. The dialog is cheesy and most of it is pretty stupid. There were some funny lines but they were few and far in between. There's not a lot of action so don't go in expecting a lot. The running time is about 118 minutes but it feels so much longer. They could have edited a few scenes and a few characters so it wouldn't have been as long or as annoying. I know this is the type of film that's made for fun but I wasn't having any. The movie had a bunch of cool and creative ideas but they didn't mix well together and the film ended up being a big mess. In the end the Brothers Grimm may be the most disappointing film of 2005 and it's not really worth checking out. Rating 310".

However after their trick is found out the only way they can regain their freedom is by encountering and fighting a true witch in a haunted forest that makes me shudder even as I think of it right now no kidding. And believe it or not Monica Bellucci is simply horrifying as the evil queen nurturing herself on the dead bodies of little girls of the village.The toad showing the directions is plainly hilarious.The gingerbread man is a bloodthirsty alternative for Shrek's pal.I think that everyone complaining about Grimm Brothers should stop and think that this is a generally not very twisted version of what kids get to read or what is read to them at a veryvery young age at least here in Europe. I think Brothers Grimm is apart from being a really intriguing and spectacular horror movie a very wellmade and intelligent satire on the Grimms' children bedtime stories.

Though Perkins had no acting experience Stevensat the peak of his careerwas confident that he could teach Millie to act at least for this film.Although Audrey Hepburn was very interested in the part as was Stevens in her Stevens finally decided that it would be more effective to use a fresh actorone with whom the public would have no preconceptions.

Still it was a huge gamble since Anne was the pivotal role in this major production. Well the results are now history.  For many moviegoers Perkins was just fine.  While some critics easily spotted her reedy inexperience and rather sympathized with her being thrust into a superprofessional arena they conceded that Millie did do a commendable job. Unfortunately Perkins took a lashing from most critics and her subsequent acting career has been relegated to minor roles in B films.  Those are the breaks though in the fickle film world.Yet with all this many people still think of Perkins' countenance when they envision of Anne Frank.  So she and Stevens made a lasting impression.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a pleasure to report that the long wait for George Stevens' THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK to come to the DVD format has been worth the wait. The restoration is far better then the fine 1995 Laser Disc issue which was the only previous release to include the Overture Intermission and Exit Music for the film as well as the roadshow 170 minute version of the film. As Alfred Newman's score is one of his finest the addition of the extra music is a true treat. Issued as one of Fox's Studio Classics the DVD shows that a great deal of tender care has gone into this outstanding release. The complete films is contained on one side. Side two is full of some nice extras headed by a fulllength documentary ECHOS FROM THE PAST that is very informative. There is a nice excerpt from the documentary feature GEORGE STEVENS A FILMMAKER'S JOURNEY which was produced and directed by George Stevens Jr. Stevens' son also provides the commentary track along with actress Millie Perkins for the film itself. There are two interesting previews included one for the U.S. release after the film was taken off the roadshow run and CUT by almost 20 minutes and also the International version which uses Newman's music over the scenes without any dialog from the film itself. Perkins' screen test newsreel footage a number of excellent behind the scenes photographs and a restoration comparison round out the second side. The film and this DVD are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished reading the diary of Anne Frank and was moved. As you probably already know Anne Frank was a Germanborn Dutch Jewish girl who went into hiding with her family and another family during the Holocaust. The majority of the movie takes place in their hiding spot. There are also added postwar scenes at the beginning and end of the movie that Anne of course couldn't have written because she didn't survive.I was curious to see this movie which I had only seen two scenes of on TV Anne not throwing away her yellow star because it's a Star of David and Mr. Van Daan drawing fury for stealing food. Neither scene is from the actual diary. There's the rub the best parts of this movie are lifted directly from the book but what's added changed or left out is no improvement. Anne's diary reads as good as fiction already so I don't think there was much need to dramatize it. Some scenes like the characters confessing their sins on DDay come close to sappy and Anne never really reconciled with her mother. I also wasn't very impressed with the actress playing Anne in this film. By all means see the movie but don't see the movie instead of reading the real thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film The Diary of Anne Frank is not taken directly from her world famous diary but it is rather an adaption of a play based on that diary. The play was written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett and it ran on Broadway from 1955 to 1957 for 717 performances.Three members of the original Broadway cast did their roles for the screen Joseph Schildkraut Lou Jacobi and Gusti Huber. Joseph Schildkraut as Otto Frank is the backbone of the film providing the moral authority in the cast. He's a teacher and a scholar and makes sure that even under these circumstances the education of his daughters is not neglected. Gusti Huber is Mrs. Frank and Lou Jacobi is Mr. Van Daan.The Van Daans and the Franks have been offered shelter in a third floor apartment that is kept secret by a hidden door in a factory owner. The owner Mr. Kraler played by Douglas Spencer is an antiNazi and has offered to keep these two Jewish families hidden for the duration of the war in Holland. For two years they live in that apartment and aside from radio news all they know of the outside world is that street in Amsterdam where the factory is located. Director George Stevens to keep the viewer from getting claustrophobic provides us with occasional shots of the outside street and canal. This film is the ultimate in cabin fever.But it has to be so for the Van Daans and the Franks are hiding for their lives. It's a community of necessity that's created up in the third floor.Young Millie Perkins does fine in the title role originated on Broadway by Susan Strassberg. She has an Audrey Hepburn like appeal but never had the career Audrey certainly did. Her sister Margit is played by Diane Baker who's career was a bit more substantial. Two very normal average teenage girls except that Anne has a talent for writing and observing.The frightening thing about this film is the very ordinariness of the characters. What have these people ever done that the might of the Nazi war machine should be out looking for them? Some of them are certainly not noble specimens as the movie shows but their lives are so humdrum like millions of us. Simply because for politics sake someone was scapegoating a religion.Ed Wynn as Drussel the dentist and Shelley Winters as Mrs. Van Daan were nominated for supporting players in the male and female categories that year. Wynn lost but Winters won the first of her two Oscars for this film. Up to then Ms. Winters played some pretty brassy characters in film. She fought for and won this role and got acclaim worldwide for her portrayal as a wife and mother. It was a transition into those kind of roles for her.So Anne observed and wrote about her impressions of what she saw and heard and the people around her for two years. In a sense this is like Moby Dick with the Pequod being the apartment and the white whale being the Nazis. Joseph Schildkraut is no Ahab he's just trying to lead his community for survival.When the Nazis come Anne's diary is hidden and after the war one of the community comes back and like Ishmael retrieves the diary and very much tells the tale.Anne's diary the hopes and dreams of a teenage girl caught up in a world of hate she couldn't comprehend is now classic literature. It serves as a dark reminder of the bestial nature we can sink to. And it reminds us that hope courage and love can spring from the darkest places.".

No mere movie could convey the full force of the original diary which no one who has read it can forget.  But this movie version is good in its own right and it does add some memorable if sometimes nonhistorical images to the story.  The script does alter some details and it's hard to see why they could not simply have filmed a selection of actual events since that could have been more than effective enough.  But as a movie in its own right it works well.The Diary is most important for its record of the daily lives of real individuals who lived in constant fear because of the Nazis and their irrational persecutions.  It puts names and faces on the kind of human disaster that is all too often described in terms of mere numbers.  The movie does well in bringing out this aspect of the diary making the characters come to life in settings that are interesting detailed and believable.  The photography also makes good use of the settings and the details.The other significant aspect of the Diary is its portrait of Anne herself. Her writings combine observations on the overall situation with observations about her own life and self with a surprising degree of perception.  This does not come out so much in the movie though of course this would be much harder to accomplish.  Millie Perkins projects a rather different image from the original Anne but then again there is nothing really wrong with her performance in itself.  She does make a sympathetic and generally believable heroine.  The supporting cast generally does a good job.  The fine character actor Joseph Schildkraut gives the best performance as Anne's father Otto.Overall if viewed with reasonable expectations and evaluated apart from the book this adaptation is an interesting and worthwhile movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the movie it's the hopefulness that is constantly being expressed that makes this all the more sad to watch  because of course we the viewer know the hopelessness of the situation we know how it's going to end.The story is based on a stageplay which was in turn based on the actual diary of Anne Frank whose family being Jewish went into hiding in Nazioccupied Holland in 1942 sharing a very small space with several others. As the title implies the movie is largely about Anne. We watch her grow up in this claustrophobic setting  starting at age 13 and spending more than two years there until the group was discovered. Starting out as a child with a natural rebellious streak Anne grows into a young woman falling in love with a young man sharing the living quarters. Millie Perkins was excellent as young Anne and I was impressed with Joseph Schildkraut as her father Otto who was in the end the only survivor. The movie begins and ends with his postwar visit to the place where they were hidden and his grief at being the only survivor among his family is powerfully portrayed. In general all the performances in this were quite good and there was a believable portrayal of the difficulties involved in so many people sharing so little space under such stressful circumstances and there are a number of very suspenseful moments involved. It's a very moving story.".

	schema:reviewBody "From 1942 to 1944 in a Nazi occupied Amsterdam the thirteen years old German Jewish girl Anne Frank Millie Perkins lives hiding in an attic of a condiment factory with her sister her parents three members of another family and an old dentist. Along more than two years she wrote in her diary her feelings her fears and relationship with the other dwellers.When I was about the same age of Anne Frank I read her book for the first time and I recall how sad I became. Then I read it at least two times more and in the bottom of my heart I was maybe expecting a happy ending and that this teenager and the other persons were saved after their tough struggle for survival. In the 90's I visited her Museum and again I became very sad. Her story is certainly the saddest and most touching journal ever written and published and shows how cruel the human being can be. This movie has been recently released on DVD in Brazil with 171 minutes running time and I really liked it. The cinematography is very beautiful and the tense and claustrophobic story highlights some of the most important parts of the book with minor modifications to keep the movie tense and in an adequate pace. The cast is excellent and although having about twentyone years old at that time the mignon Millie Perkins performs a good Anne Frank. The person who betrayed Anne Frank and the other Jews has never been discovered. My vote is nine.Title Brazil O Dirio de Anne Frank The Diary of Anne Frank".

Before us we see a changed Anne Frank one of whose favourite activities seems to be staring at her surroundings with a vacant look in her madeup eyes or staring at Peter and waiting for him to kiss her again. She has no depth at all this girl reading off her deep insights into human nature with a cute drawl and a classic filmstar pout as if she were made of wood with little or no appropriate emotion. Yes she has emotion but when she says anything it's as if she's emphasizing words at random to add some flavour to her acting and really has no idea what she's talking about. This girl doesn't understand the intelligence and deep insight that her character is supposed to have doesn't know the endless thinking and anguish Anne went through to come to the place where she could accept her situation without flinching. This one doesn't have a problem with accepting her situation for the sole reason that she doesn't seem to get it in the first place.Don't get me wrong this movie wasn't BAD. It would have been okay if it were standing on its own but somewhere during its making the real Anne Frank got lost.

Well mostly. Someone went through the historiography of Anne Frank's diary and found it had been sanitized over the years first by Mr. Frank then by the playwrights. She was pretty candid about her sexual development and not nearly as forgiving as the movie makes her out to be. She was more nearly human than the figure we see on the screen.Millie Perkins is Anne. She's not bad considering her age but there are some painful moments too. Everyone else is professional at least. The director George Stevens started his career with Laurel and Hardy two reelers and masterpieces like Kentucky Kernels but went on to develop an extremely effective directorial approach that was his alone in movies like Shane and A Place In The Sun. He's very good here and uses the Cinemascope screen like a master.There are moments of suspense terror sentiment and even some comedy but the film can't escape it's historical roots.

	schema:headline " Good movie of inspirational Anne Frank outlook on life.";
	schema:reviewBody "Anne Frank and her family were German Jews during World War II and to avoid being sent to a concentration camp hid out with another family in some secret rooms above Mr. Frank's office in Amsterdam. They managed to remain undetected for 25 months until someone gave them up and they were then sent to a camp. Anne Frank took ill and died less than a year later not yet 16. During the 25 months of hiding Anne kept a diary and in addition wrote hundreds of pages of various stories and had begun her novel. When they were forced to leave their hide out hurriedly she left behind her diary which is the basis for the Anne Frank story and this movie.This 1959 movie was appropriately shot in black and white which fits perfectly with their bleak existence. Of course food had to be rationed and spirits were low but Anne was unique in her outlook. She considered the war and the Nazi terrorism just a speck of time in the history of man and in spite of everything people are really good of heart. She was a religious person in times of difficulty finding myself in God. She urged her friend Peter to get some religion any type as long as he could believe in something because she found it so important.The movie depicts their situation at one point listening to a radio hidden within the cutout pages of a book hearing of the DDay success of the Allies in 1944 hoping that the war would end soon and they could be free again. They watched out of a window to see the local butcher hauled off to a camp. When it was finally their time and the Nazis were pounding on the door of the building they knew it was their time and sat or stood calmly waiting. They had only a minute to gather up a few essentials Anne had to leave her diary behind and was writing a message to whomever might find it and it was terminated in mid sentence...Anne Frank was played by Millie Perkins who was 20 during filming. Although she was a bit old to play a 1415 year old with makeup and costume she looked amazingly like the photos of the real Anne Frank. In spite of the ending of the story it is an uplifting movie as it shows how attitude and perspective can mean so much. It lends a true meaning to the old phrase When life gives you lemons make lemonade.".

	schema:reviewBody "How to criticise such a wellintentioned film on such a worthy subject? Anne Frank has come down the ages as a universal symbol of youthful innocence in the face of inhuman oppression and must therefore in any cinematic telling of her tale be accorded proper respect all the more so when unlike other nearhistoric sacred cows for example Winston Churchill or Gandhi she was destroyed even before she came to adulthood. Not only that but the filmmaker has another major problem in holding the viewer's interest with a narrative which by dint of its content must include periods of inaction and in a greatly confined space at that. Therefore in judging the film on purely cinematic terms I have to say I found the movie overlong and also guilty of some uneven acting although the latter point is excused somewhat by the youth of the perpetrators of which more later. George Stevens's later work tends to longplaying at the best of times Giant anyone? and here again perhaps as I said out of overrespect for its source material the film runs to a draining 170 minutes a good hour too long I would say. Of course with all that time at his disposal the director delivers lots of characterisation but there's little he can do to inject genuine action and tension and as we know in advance that the moment of discovery has to come at the film's finish attempts to heighten tension at other points are weakened accordingly also by their being drawn out inordinately over several overlong minutes. I also have a major problem with said moment of discovery coinciding with Anne and Peter's kiss for me a distasteful Hollyood bowdlerisation of events as of course no such event ever occurs in the diary itself. Which leads me to the acting... The seniors are all very good and believable particularly Joseph Schildkraut playing Otto Frank and Shelley Winters in one of her first older character parts but the juniors are inconsistent not even trying to adopt a Dutch accent and therefore jarring on the soundtrack. Again I hesitate to be overcritical of Millie Perkins in the title role but I did find her too certainly old and also dare I say it almost cute and subsequently unconvincing in her attempt at realism despite the care and camerafriendly treatment the director gives her. It's no great surprise to me that adult stardom seems to have evaded her. It would be easy to sign off and just point everyone at the book itself but clearly this is a great story which will live forever and no doubt be retold again and again on TV and on the big screen as it deserves to. This first portrayal seems to me too much a child of its era the black and white stolid 1950's and with a director too much in thrall to his subject. That said everyone should watch the film especially if they haven't read the book but your time will pass slowly and I don't think you'll be moved as much as you should be at the conclusion.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Stevens' 1959 Classic 'The Diary of Anne Frank' is unique among the array of Holocaust pictures made over the years. Not only was it the first major bigbudget production to touch upon the subject except for perhaps 'The Great Dictator' which did not approach the subject directly but it is directed from the point of view of a man trying to come to terms with the unspeakable horrors he was unprepared for upon the day of the liberation of the Nazi Concentration Camps. It is told from the point of view of a man who witnessed the aftermath of genocide but who still sought to believe that there was still good in the world.Stevens could have taken many approaches to making this film but he chose to approach it with optimism a decision derided it seems from all sides. Most recently books such as Francine Prose's 'Anne Frank The Book The Life The Afterlife' and Carol Ann Lee's 'Hidden Life of Otto Frank' have taken negative approaches to the film as if the film's sole purpose had been to discredit and vandalize the Anne Frank story. They cite with dismay the footage of Millie Perkins in Auschwitz that trial audiences found distasteful as proof of the film's inadequacy never mind the fact that such footage if it exists at all cannot be viewed today.To address this point let me remind those concerned that the war had ended not even fifteen years before the film went into production. Many Holocaust survivors were beginning to start new lives for themselves including Otto Frank and his new wife. To think that the filming of the camp scenes would not have rekindled memories of such horror is simply unrealistic. And although Otto Frank would neither see the play nor the film were he to have seen it why would he have wished to see a reenactment of his daughter's humiliation degradation and eventual death? Never mind the fact that they could never have filmed onlocation at this time and that there could not possibly have been a soundstage large enough to capture the daunting horror of Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen.Rather over fifty years later after the Holocaust had been successfully explored in other mediums after the full impact of the Nazi atrocities were realized and after an appropriate amount of PostWar time the world was ready for the camp scenes which were heartbreakingly conveyed in 'Anne Frank  The Whole Story.' Like Jean Marie Falconetti in 'Passion of Joan of Arc' Hannah Taylor Gordon would agree to have her head shaven to illustrate the suffering of an innocent young heroine which brings me to my next point.. the choice of Millie Perkins as Anne.The most widely ridiculed part of this film Millie Perkins never seems to get a break. To contrast her with Gordon may perhaps be unfair and Perkins herself would be liable to conced that Gordon's is superior if only given the nature of her performance which may be one of the finest ever recorded on film. The difference between Millie and Hannah would seem to be that while Millie was playing Anne Frank and playing her very well Hannah seems to have become Anne for a brief period of time and lends her soul to the part as if they were linked for a moment.But nevertheless Millie stands on her own. Stevens' choice was widely criticized and still is for his choice of an American girl but the search itself was authentic as could be. We're looking for an actress who hasn't found out that special secret about herself yet Stevens declared at the press conference. To view her old screentest why Millie was chosen is not obvious at first but to look closer she exhibits a quirkiness fascination with small things and detailed memory that was associated with Anne Frank. Perkins had not yet seemed to have discovered her special secret. But perhaps the reason for an American girl to portray her was the need to drive home the point to the American audiences who unlike Europeans had largely been unaffected by the realization of the Nazi atrocities. No doubt they felt for the victims but could not identify with them. If one allows themselves to become so absorbed in the fate of these characters that every time a Gestapo siren wails in the background their heart pounds as theirs would and to refocus one's attention on the childlike Millie trying to lighten the situation one can appreciate the depth of her levity only to be brought back to earth with the realization of what her fate will be. We are supposed to believe that whatever happened to the real Anne will happen to her. We may find this Anne annoying whiny or brattish but never so deserving of the cruelty she would encounter in her last seven months. Perhaps Stevens understood this.".

	schema:headline " We weren't here when all this started";
	schema:reviewBody "Some stories are simply begging to be told. Since the end of World War 2 the conflict had provided inspiration for hundreds of motion pictures and most of these were for the purposes of gung ho entertainment rather than poignant reflection. There's nothing shameful in that. It is just the case that with some of the more horrific aspects of the war we needed more time to come to terms with them and understand them. And with a story like this it was also essential that it be handled by a team who could get it exactly right.The picture was based on an earlier stage play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett not too especially wellknown names in filmdom although they were responsible for some of the best screenplays of Hollywood's classic era including It's a Wonderful Life. As such it should come as no surprise then that their dramatization of Anne Frank's diary is bursting with tenderness frank humanity and above all a reverence for human life. They have often condensed several significant events into the same scene and possibly exaggerated a few characters but this is the way it must be to make it work as a play and no disservice has been done to Anne's work As a side note however I would recommend everyone read up on Fritz Pfeffer the real name of the Alfred Dussel character as his story is far more complex and tragic than what we see here. This screen version of the GoodrichHackett play was produced and directed by George Stevens and there may have been no better man for the project. Stevens's method in his 1950s pictures was to shoot from every conceivable angle and have the perspective sometimes change jarringly from shot to shot. This may seem confusing at first but it makes the audience lose track of the size and shape of rooms and focus totally on the actors. However he does things slightly differently for this picture. He begins by making us very much aware of the space with lots of foreground clutter and doorways leading off in the background. It is as if we are somehow being held back from the action as if we are looking in on it from outside. Then gradually around about the time Anne begins her diary the camera begins to move inside the space. As we get to know the characters the camera becomes more intimate and as usual with Stevens he makes us forget the place and remember the people.And this is an appropriately memorable cast. Originally Audrey Hepburn was sought for the lead role and while she would surely have been excellent her substitute Millie Perkins is perhaps a better yet for this role. She has a kind of genuine youthful exuberance to her and is able to appear much more like a real teenager. It is also appropriate to have an unfamiliar face for the part. An equally young Richard Beymer better known as Tony in West Side Story is also ideal for the same reasons. The supporting players are a delight. People like Josef Schildkraut and Shelley Winters are like a mark of quality on any picture. They did not have egos they did not want to steal the show or upstage anyone they simply undertook each part with sincerity and played it to the best of their abilities. The real surprise however is Ed Wynn a daffy comedy actor but here playing it mostly straight and even eliciting some sympathy for a character who is basically the fall guy in the absence of any tangible villain. But why is Anne Frank's story so important? It is not of great historical value. It does not make for an unflinching account of Jewish persecution by the Nazis. What it is is an incredibly touching and insightful narrative by someone in a trying and excruciating situation. It is astonishingly well written and as such has at times been denounced as a hoax although its authenticity has now thankfully been proved. Anne unwittingly made herself a spokesperson for a generation and for a people. Her story is one we are lucky enough to have handed down to us among the millions that can never be told and as such it should become known and spread. Anne herself may not have survived but her diary her diary is life after death.".

Since the end of World War 2 the conflict had provided inspiration for hundreds of motion pictures and most of these were for the purposes of gung ho entertainment rather than poignant reflection. There's nothing shameful in that. It is just the case that with some of the more horrific aspects of the war we needed more time to come to terms with them and understand them. And with a story like this it was also essential that it be handled by a team who could get it exactly right.The picture was based on an earlier stage play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett not too especially wellknown names in filmdom although they were responsible for some of the best screenplays of Hollywood's classic era including It's a Wonderful Life. As such it should come as no surprise then that their dramatization of Anne Frank's diary is bursting with tenderness frank humanity and above all a reverence for human life. They have often condensed several significant events into the same scene and possibly exaggerated a few characters but this is the way it must be to make it work as a play and no disservice has been done to Anne's work As a side note however I would recommend everyone read up on Fritz Pfeffer the real name of the Alfred Dussel character as his story is far more complex and tragic than what we see here. This screen version of the GoodrichHackett play was produced and directed by George Stevens and there may have been no better man for the project. Stevens's method in his 1950s pictures was to shoot from every conceivable angle and have the perspective sometimes change jarringly from shot to shot. This may seem confusing at first but it makes the audience lose track of the size and shape of rooms and focus totally on the actors. However he does things slightly differently for this picture. He begins by making us very much aware of the space with lots of foreground clutter and doorways leading off in the background. It is as if we are somehow being held back from the action as if we are looking in on it from outside. Then gradually around about the time Anne begins her diary the camera begins to move inside the space. As we get to know the characters the camera becomes more intimate and as usual with Stevens he makes us forget the place and remember the people.And this is an appropriately memorable cast. Originally Audrey Hepburn was sought for the lead role and while she would surely have been excellent her substitute Millie Perkins is perhaps a better yet for this role. She has a kind of genuine youthful exuberance to her and is able to appear much more like a real teenager. It is also appropriate to have an unfamiliar face for the part. An equally young Richard Beymer better known as Tony in West Side Story is also ideal for the same reasons. The supporting players are a delight. People like Josef Schildkraut and Shelley Winters are like a mark of quality on any picture. They did not have egos they did not want to steal the show or upstage anyone they simply undertook each part with sincerity and played it to the best of their abilities. The real surprise however is Ed Wynn a daffy comedy actor but here playing it mostly straight and even eliciting some sympathy for a character who is basically the fall guy in the absence of any tangible villain. But why is Anne Frank's story so important? It is not of great historical value. It does not make for an unflinching account of Jewish persecution by the Nazis. What it is is an incredibly touching and insightful narrative by someone in a trying and excruciating situation. It is astonishingly well written and as such has at times been denounced as a hoax although its authenticity has now thankfully been proved. Anne unwittingly made herself a spokesperson for a generation and for a people. Her story is one we are lucky enough to have handed down to us among the millions that can never be told and as such it should become known and spread. Anne herself may not have survived but her diary her diary is life after death.";

Add to that the fact that Anne's concluding entries in her diary as presented in the movie are totally fabricated and it's all the more disappointing.For those who haven't done any of the above the movie might be worthwhile. I felt it was a waste of three hours.  Now that I've seen it I won't have to see it again.  DIARY was awarded three OSCARS  one for Shelly Winters' performance one for art direction and one for cinematography BW.  I wasn't overly impressed with Winters' hammy performance and I'm not entirely convinced she stood out any more than any of the other supporting actors i.e. everyone other than Anne  Millie Perkins.  While the art direction was excellent I can't say that the cinematography was all that impressive either although Mellor probably got the nod over the other nominees because he worked successfully on a very restrictive site.Sometimes I encourage people to see the movie before or after they read the book because the film will add something to the experience of reading it.

	schema:reviewBody "Historical accuracy is not very likely in an epic like this but that's not the point especially after so many years have passed since it was made. Considering 'Genghis Khan' now it stands out as a dandy museum piece not only in the 'they don't make 'em like this any more' category but because it's such a fullblown try at making a splash in the epic film sweepstakes of the 1960s.Yeah it's a tinkertoy epic but great fun despite aiming at serious drama. Only 'Marco the Magnificent' outdoes it for 'Mutinational Production Prize' of its era.Interestingly it's a 'gapfiller' epic. That is in the years when every ancient or legendary subjectculture seemed to be tackled by producers hoping to strike 'BenHur' gold filmmakers shopped around history looking for unique subjects to make an impression. Sooner or later the great Khan's number was going to come up. 'The Conqueror' with John Wayne seems more like a western duh! while 'Genghis' actually has a central Asian feel to it. Like its mate 'The Long Ships' this is a Yugoslavianfilmed venture a mini attempt to emulate Sam Bronston's epic production efforts over in Spain.After Bronston's great empire unfortunately folded other attempts to take up the epic gauntlet were made. This is one of the most sincere. A great cast pretty respectable art direction a sense of epic sweep and a predictable but often witty script they're all here. I'm sure the distinguished cast did it for the money but at least they probably had a good time doing it. At its best it's a decent try at being epic. At its worst it's a curiosity but a pretty amusing one.Highlights  Dusan Radic's fantastic score. He achieves a Roszalike standard I think.Michael Hordern yelling 'TEMMUJEEN!!!' endlessly.Omar Sharif's yoke. Enthusiasts can see who wears his longer Omar or John Wayne.James Mason's Mandarin parody. Politically correct it ain't.Bob Morley steals the show as usual as the effete emperor. The only character in cinema history who is killed just by WATCHING fireworks. Best line as he hands a featherweight fan to a servant 'Take it it grows heavy'.Orson Welles WASN'T in this one but should have been.Francoise Dorleac is of course very Euro but not bad to look at.Any picture with Geoffrey Unsworth behind the camera is going to have some stuff going for it. Seeing it in full Panavision on the big screen would certainly give this picture more respectability.I await its' muchdeserved DVD appearance.".

Only 'Marco the Magnificent' outdoes it for 'Mutinational Production Prize' of its era.Interestingly it's a 'gapfiller' epic. That is in the years when every ancient or legendary subjectculture seemed to be tackled by producers hoping to strike 'BenHur' gold filmmakers shopped around history looking for unique subjects to make an impression. Sooner or later the great Khan's number was going to come up. 'The Conqueror' with John Wayne seems more like a western duh! while 'Genghis' actually has a central Asian feel to it. Like its mate 'The Long Ships' this is a Yugoslavianfilmed venture a mini attempt to emulate Sam Bronston's epic production efforts over in Spain.After Bronston's great empire unfortunately folded other attempts to take up the epic gauntlet were made. This is one of the most sincere. A great cast pretty respectable art direction a sense of epic sweep and a predictable but often witty script they're all here. I'm sure the distinguished cast did it for the money but at least they probably had a good time doing it. At its best it's a decent try at being epic. At its worst it's a curiosity but a pretty amusing one.Highlights  Dusan Radic's fantastic score. He achieves a Roszalike standard I think.Michael Hordern yelling 'TEMMUJEEN!!!' endlessly.Omar Sharif's yoke. Enthusiasts can see who wears his longer Omar or John Wayne.James Mason's Mandarin parody. Politically correct it ain't.Bob Morley steals the show as usual as the effete emperor. The only character in cinema history who is killed just by WATCHING fireworks. Best line as he hands a featherweight fan to a servant 'Take it it grows heavy'.Orson Welles WASN'T in this one but should have been.Francoise Dorleac is of course very Euro but not bad to look at.Any picture with Geoffrey Unsworth behind the camera is going to have some stuff going for it. Seeing it in full Panavision on the big screen would certainly give this picture more respectability.I await its' muchdeserved DVD appearance.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remembered enjoying this film when I saw it as a preteen on television in the '60's. I have remained an avid fan of adventure films and epics. So when it was aired yesterday on TCM I tuned in with anticipation. It had not aged well. Perhaps all of the anomalies are more difficult for a mature movie fan to accept.The best parts of this film are the locations the sets the costumes and the props. Even so the sets are never quite convincingly grand enough. They retain the flavor of sets. The photography never captures the locations in a way that conveys the vastness of Central Asia. And the impact of the costumes and props is diminished by the fact that they are at the service of a predominantly Caucasian cast attempting to portray the tribes of Mongolia.Blonde Francoise Dorleac who portrays Genghis Khan's wife is the most glaring racial anomaly. But the entire cast is similarly anomalous. At least Stephen Boyd and Omar Shariff aren't blond. But Englishmen James Mason and Robert Morley look hopelessly out of place. I personally wondered how people of Oriental heritage reacted to Mason's stereotypical pronunciation of the letter L as an R! I don't really find a lot of fault with the portrayals offered by Mason and Morley although I do agree with the suggestion of several reviewers that they seem like they wandered in from a production of the Mikado.Lastly I cringed at the soundtrack  typically Occidentalsounding pseudoepic orchestrations with grandiose flourishes. The heroicsounding 44 marches were typical of the Sword and Sandal epics of the day. Only a stray chord here and there suggested an Oriental setting. In that era it was inconceivable to cast Orientals in the principal roles of a film of this one's pretensions. Under the circumstances Hollywood would have done better to simply avoid attempts to depict tales of Asian peoples.In the end bizarre casting and completely Occidentalsounding music render this film difficult to swallow for a filmgoer looking for anything beyond a shallow adventure story. With the number of Oriental actors in Hollywood films today a GOOD portrayal of the life of Genghis Khan is ripe for filming!".

Except in 'odd man out' James Mason has never been better as an actor. Morley shines. Both of them are so much more Chinese with dignity than any Chinese could be. But this movie really belongs to Francois Dorleac Omar Sharif Stephen Boyd and a litte Telly Savalas. T and a that made a boy dream in a surrounding where you usually did not see them in those times. Pure fantasy  who cares about history it's all baloney anyway  this is as true as any history. It's fantasy and adventure and I'm looking forward to see it on DVD in widescreen  but when?".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually registered for this service and am writing this review in Defence of Omar Shariff. I saw that the only review on IMDb was rather harsh and unbalanced. Shariff's portrayal of the CHARACTER of the Mongolian Chieftain was a truthful yet poetic performance that John Wayne definitely lacked the depth of character to deliver. There was a comment in that one review about Shariff's Arabic accent. In order to enlighten readers Shariff's Arabic is not that good as education in Egypt in the old days was strictly British and Arabic was strictly forbidden. There is also no such thing as an Arabic accent. Arabs have 22 different dialects in 22 different countries with hundreds of accents per country. Moreover there is no generic Arabic accent as there is no true generic American or British accent. Yes James Mason was enchanting in his role as Chinese Ambassadorcourtier but cancelling out Shariff for his accent and his physical appearance would be a critical blunder worthy of a Junior high student with learning disability. I actually see a certain wisdom in casting the modestly framed Shariff as a warlord. This choice would emphasise the idea that the Mongol nation was built by this man using will power and cunning not mere brute force. THAT is historically accurate. The movie does have many shortcomings such as simplistic photography that is nowhere near as engaging as it could have been. The score was far too cartoonish for my taste. The Script was choppy when it needed to be flowing and vice versa. The final battleduel sequence was a serious let down and far too short for such a titanic struggle. As for historical accuracy I really don't care about that kind of this when I'm watching a movie. History doesn't exist anymore there's only mythology.".

Whilst the novels are themselves loosely based on the history this movie is way off track. It is difficult to see from this version how Temujin who later became Genghis Khan could have united warring Mongol tribes. It would have needed someone with immense strength of body and character and Omar Shrarif's character just did not portray this. Robert Morley as the Chinese Emperor was amusing but nobody else had any credibility especially Temujin's wife Bortei played unconvincingly by Francoise Dorleac as far too western. Considering Genghis Khan achieved the unification of a Mongol nation at the beginning of the 13th Century the film set looked more like early 20th Century Wild West. Give this one a miss if you are interested in the history go elsewhere if it is a good action adventure set in the Mongol steppes then look elsewhere also.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film about the great Tatar  conqueror Genghis Khan who stated as the ordinary boy called Temujin is the best film about Genghis Khan so far before the the debut of the Kazakh film Mongol in 2007. The reason for this is because its production and directing as a costume drama is good that makes it enjoyable though as a notable drama it fails to be an epic as the story line is wooden that spoils the overall film. The famous John Wayne disaster The Conqueror can compensate for this as the story line and its representation of the characters is much closer and darker to the rise of the real Genghis Khan although the advantage this film has over the central theme of The Conqueror is that it highlights Genghis Khans conquests of China and Central Asia. Despite the anecdotal and soap based story line the music costumes cultural representations and its filming locations in the beautiful former Yugoslavia which was a good choice makes this film a good costume drama on an interesting man. The only way this film could of been made as an historical epic in the era of the zenith of their productions is that the theme central to it should of been about the Khans rise as represented in the Conqueror  which should of disappeared in to the abyss before moving to his conquests and narration of his legacy which gave the film depth.  Many reviewers have said of the cast who play in this film as not being Asian enough. This is true for the Chinese who are clichd and are not correctly represented. However the characters playing Mongols such as Omar Sharif and Francois Dorleac were for the time well cast and well played and they can be accepted in their roles by being presented as Turkic Tartar as the Mongols were known at their height.".

However the characters playing Mongols such as Omar Sharif and Francois Dorleac were for the time well cast and well played and they can be accepted in their roles by being presented as Turkic Tartar as the Mongols were known at their height.";

The only criticisms of this film is the comic performance of Mason as china's ambassador and the script at times is rather flimsy and wooden but can work in its favor to make the film more fun and enjoyable.

For starters the history is all wrong. Although Subodei played by Kenneth Cope was indeed a fine general and a major figure in the Mongol conquests he was not in any way shape or form related to Bortei Francoise Dorleac. Likewise although Jamuga Stephen Boyd was definitely a rival of Genghis Khan Omar Sharif there was no Mongol duel between them which supposedly settled everything once and for all. But history aside I suppose it passes for good theater and I guess it's better to just leave it at that. Having said that however I must admit that although Francoise Dorleac was quite beautiful her blond hair and blue eyes didn't quite fit in with the features normally associated with those of a Mongolian woman. Neither for that matter did James Mason as Kam Ling as a Chinese wise man. In any case although it may not be as great as I remember it it's still not too bad even by today's standards and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Average.".

Yoko was raised by her uncle in Yubari but lives in Tokyo with her father and stepmother.

Yoko's father Nenji Kobayashi and stepmother Kimiko Yo urge her to marry though her father is uncommunicative in spite of his wife's best efforts to get him to open up. Oko's uncertainty about her parents demands for marriage is reminiscent of Late Spring An Autumn Afternoon and other Ozu films on this subject.Caf Lumire pace is deliberate painstakingly detailed and without much narrative thrust but it may be the film that Ozu would have made if he lived in the modern age. Beautifully shot by Lee Pingping the film allows us to view the world the characters inhabit providing extraordinary details of Tokyo life including outlying districts such as Jimbocho known for its many bookstores and Kishibojin with its look of old Tokyo.

	schema:reviewBody "Caf Lumiere is Taiwanese director Hou HsiaoHsien's tribute the 100th birthday anniversary of Japanese master Ozu Yasujiro. Many reviewers have mentioned the signature static images and the tatamilevel shots. Particularly noticeable in Caf Lumiere is the focus on trains. The camera brings to the audience a parade of Tokyo's subway stations underground and surfaced as well as moving trains inside and outside. One motif scene comes up regularly  a carefully framed crane shot of a busy intersection of several railway tracks at a river. The static picture accentuated by the geometric beauty of tracks and bridges crisscrossing is brought to life by trains passing in all directions along the river and over it. We don't know where they come from or go to. This perhaps is the image of life that director Hou wants us to take away when we emerge from the cinema.The story if there's any to speak of is crosssectional rather than linear. We see a point in the life of young writerresearcher Yoko where she is at a crossroad just pregnant but determined to be a single mother because her Taiwanese boyfriend is too much of his mother's boy. Her traditional father and stepmother are obviously disturbed. On Yoko's part she is more disinterested than alienated. Her stepmother mind you is not the Cinderella stereotype but appears to be a sensible and kindly woman. The communication gap between Yoko and her parents however cannot be more obvious. Their sole conversation topic seems to be the parent's kind concern that she should eat well and the conversation is forever punctuated by silences. Her revelation of her pregnancy to them could not have been more complacent as if she was just telling them that she had flu.The most mesmerising thing about Caf Lumiere is Yoko's relationship with a good friend Hajime a bookstore owner who has so much of a passion in his hobby of locomotives that he goes all over Tokyo with a tape recorder just to record the sound of passing trains at different locations. Hajime however is not a weirdo as his unorthodox hobby suggests but the exact opposite a most gentle sensitive and considerate young man who seems to be providing a shoulder for Yoko to lean on in her troubled times. Their relationship somehow reminds me of Before SunriseBefore Sunset although the circumstances are miles apart. And yet there are similarities in two people genuinely interested in what each other is doing and share blissful quiet moments together in each other's company. While the fact that they deeply care for each other is obvious in SunriseSunset it's a lot more subtle in Caf Lumiere. Consider one scene when Yoko is sleeping in her apartment with a light flu. Door bell and knocking go on alternatively for quite a long time and the audience would probably assume that it's the expectant visit of her outoftown parents. It turns out to be Haijme bringing over some graphics on his computer notebook to show her. Barely able to keep her eyes open after struggling to open the door Yoko asks politely Can I go back to sleep? and Haijme replies Of course. The next scene shows Yoko waking up apparently much recovered and a bowl of noodles placed in front of her. After the nourishment she proceeds to enthusiastically look at Haijme's computer graphic on trains engaging him in a lot of questions.Whenever we see the two together it's in mundane ordinary daily existence a lot of that in Caf Lumiere but with the screen running over with a relaxing mood of comforting tenderness. In the very last scene after a typically uncommunicative visit from her parents Yoko goes over to the bookstore to find that Haijme is out there somewhere recording the sound of trains again. A little lost she gets on a train sits down she usually stands and falls into a nap. In comes Haijme spots her and moves to stand in front of her without waking her. In the next scene we see the two of them getting off the train onto the platform. He continues with his recording while she stands a little distance away with an almost indiscernible smile of contentment. Minimalism at its best.".

	onyx:emotionText "Caf Lumiere is Taiwanese director Hou HsiaoHsien's tribute the 100th birthday anniversary of Japanese master Ozu Yasujiro. Many reviewers have mentioned the signature static images and the tatamilevel shots. Particularly noticeable in Caf Lumiere is the focus on trains. The camera brings to the audience a parade of Tokyo's subway stations underground and surfaced as well as moving trains inside and outside. One motif scene comes up regularly  a carefully framed crane shot of a busy intersection of several railway tracks at a river. The static picture accentuated by the geometric beauty of tracks and bridges crisscrossing is brought to life by trains passing in all directions along the river and over it. We don't know where they come from or go to. This perhaps is the image of life that director Hou wants us to take away when we emerge from the cinema.The story if there's any to speak of is crosssectional rather than linear. We see a point in the life of young writerresearcher Yoko where she is at a crossroad just pregnant but determined to be a single mother because her Taiwanese boyfriend is too much of his mother's boy. Her traditional father and stepmother are obviously disturbed. On Yoko's part she is more disinterested than alienated.

	schema:reviewBody "This little film has all the treatment and feel of a lowbudget indie production but it's actually directed by well known Taiwanese director Hsiaohsien Hou commissioned by Japan for the 100th anniversary of Yasujiro Ozu birthday. And it's a perfect homage to Ozu more Japanese than a Japanese film could have been notes one commentator.Partway through this film I noticed something strange about the relations between actors. I don't think there's a single reaction shot in this film. Certainly no use of the shotreaction shot technique that's conventionally used by film makers to get across how actors feel about each other. Shot actor's attention directed to another actor. Reverse shot other actor's face gives away the relationship between the two. The shotreverse shot technique seems to work so well I think not so much because it's hard to put two actors on the screen at the same time but because we audience relate uniquely to the face and emotion of a single face and it's thatthe film's relationship to its audience through the camera which places the audience in relation to actors on the screen that motivates an emotional response in the viewer that's always different with one face on screen than with two or more. Cafe Lumiere contains no shotreverse shot sequences. In fact the actors don't make eye contact. And this decision conscious or not creates a film in which its characters are always in a scene. Even when they are alone together in the smallest of bookstores we are given a scene and not a relationship. The camera's still disposition to scenes urban and interior captures a landscape of objects and places through which the trapped love of our two lead characters journey in pursuit of a way to connect. Their affections for each other play like muted horns amidst a jingle of train station announcements and contemporary piano movements there but not together. They are like two passengers at times on parallel trains and this is the film's crucial scene traveling in the same direction but separated by the window panes pains through which they direct their looks in a longing to collapse the space between the tracks able to make the journey but not together. Beneath the film's unfocused care and tenderness is the story of Yoko's adoption her pregnancy and her decision to repeat her own past by bringing up the child without a father. And her friend's nonlover's silent yearning at the edge as he puts it in one scene pictured in a rendering of his own yes the actor actually made that drawing as a lonely fetus perhaps crying he notes in an eyeball surrounded by trains and tracks alluding of course to suicide preoccupied with a passion for recording trains and their sounds in order to capture evidence he notes and does he mean of his death should he join his trains on the tracks?... This is a great little film about hesitation and the desire to overcome it a film that leaves open the possibility of redemption and which attaches it to the younger generation who in their innocence and freedom might stand a better chance than the bound generation that brought them into the world to begin with.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ozu is dead. If there's one thing that Hou manages to prove in his tribute to Ozu's centennial it is that Ozu is dead. Never is there going to be another man who can portray human relationships in the same light as Ozu. The same steadfastness they have as they try as hard as they can to hold on to each other the sadness they feel when having to leave the family the difficulties of living together in one household the moments of regret that they have when one of their family has to leave and their final acceptance that these are all but a part of life.Hou shows us a Japan that has changed so much from the Japan that Ozu so painstakingly tries to hold on to by capturing it on his camera. Each tear each regret each joy is now lost in a world that tries too hard to change. Wim Wenders first laments this in Tokyo Ga on how banal Tokyo has become and how much of an imitation culture new Japanese culture is. Cafe Lumiere while not being as impassioned as Wender's masterpiece is every bit as pensive about its regret of the passing on of the old Japan that Ozu loves so much.While in Ozu's films a pregnancy would herald a big event in a family's lifeline in Cafe Lumiere it is merely a passing thought. While in Ozu's films the lead character most often played by goddesslike Hara Setsuko would usually be selfsacrificial as best she can to ensure the family's togetherness here Yoko is determined on striking out as a single mother regardless of her father's silently burning disapproval.Undeniably Hou doesn't pass much judgment on his characters. In fact the portrayal of Yoko only shows her as a very modern and much independent Japanese female that is fast becoming the norm in Japan. The female who does not want to be tied down and holds little regard of familial values. And definitely it would be seen as regressive should Japan return to the past for the sake of the days when family was at the core of societal structure. After all the definition of progress is change right? Yet one can't help but feel the absence of Ozu in this movie the absence that makes its tone all the more poignant in spite of its spots of warmth. Ozu seems to be like the ghost of Maggie Cheung in 2046 or the missing woman in L'Avventura he is not there and is never referenced in the movie and yet the opening shot of the movie and a few scenes of familial warmth gives one such a pang in the heart that is so distinctly Ozu. In fact that Hou decides to have many shots of trains departing and leaving and crisscrossing each other in modern Tokyo and letting us hear the allfamiliar sounds of trains going across railways that is so definitive of Ozu's films only shows that he is fully aware of this fact and like Wenders is seeking to find what little there is left of Ozu's spirit. In the overwhelmingly modern backdrop of Tokyo we see how something of the past like the cafe that Yoko hunts for that some people so want to preserve has been turned into another urban development project. However in the film Hou also shows us that although the landscape of Tokyo now denies Ozu there is still decidedly some of Ozu's warmth in human relationships. Like how Yoko still feels the same kindred spirit as she tucks in to her favorite dish that her mother has prepared seeking out old sights in her hometown sights that remind her of times when she was a kid and still not thinking of independence. And just perhaps in showing all this Hou is persuading us to accept life as what we can just as how the people in Ozu's movies eventually have to accept the loss of one of their family members.I went to Tokyo last June and coincidentally Kamakura was part of the itinerary. I remember how excited I was since Kamakura was many a setting for Ozu's films and it was the place where Ozu was buried after his death. As I reached the Kamakura station on the Enoshima metroline my heart was all awashed with glee to see that the station looked almost exactly the same as it looked in Ozu's films. The same old signboard and the same railway tracks against looming mountains. And yet as I walked around Kamakura now a popular tourist spot for its famous Daibutsu or Big Buddha I couldn't help but notice how foreign it was despite its quaint Japaneseness. There were so many tourists walking around the town amidst its quiet surbuban houses and so many signboards blaring English signs. In a bid to find Ozu's grave every time I saw a cemetery I would go over to look if there was a tablet that has only a 'mu' character on it. But I never found it. Sigh.".

A writer Inoue Yoko has just returned home to Japan from Taiwan where she continued her research on the Taiwanese composer Jiang Wenye. Suffering from nightmares on her trip she calls her friend Hajime Asano Tadanobu the proprietor of a used bookstore and tells him of her nightmare about a baby whose face began to melt like ice. Later she travels to the quiet confines of the bookstore to pick up a couple of books and CDs Hajime acquired for me. Yoko then spends an inordinate amount of time wandering Tokyo before going to see her father and stepmother. Almost completely silent almost the only sentence uttered by Yoko while at home is that she would like her mother to prepare her some nikujaga beef stew. However that night after her father has gone to bed Yoko tells her stepmother that she is pregnant and that she does not plan on marrying the baby's Taiwanese father but instead that she intends to raise the child on her own. It is later revealed that she does not want to marry her boyfriend because he is a mama's boy whose mother still controls most of his life.With this information later revealed to him Yoko's father becomes even more silent and Yoko continues her day to day activities researching Jiang Wenye and enjoying the company of Hajime who helps her with her research while he continues his own obsessions of recording the sounds of trains.Although a bit vacuous Caf Lumiere is beautifully filmed. The interior of Hajime's bookstore Yoko's apartment and family home and the interiors of the cafes are stunning to behold because of the mixture of shadow and light. Hajime's bookstore has an almost claustrophobic comforting nature with its hundreds of books and dark wood. The characters come off as a bit empty but this might stem from Hou's desire to create characters who are so absorbed within the interiors of their own beings that they chose to reduce their communications with the outside world. While a decent movie Caf Lumiere is definitely not a must see unless one is either a major fan of Hou Hsiaohsien or maybe Asano Tadanobu.".

It seems to me that the resemblance to Ozu whom this was commissioned by the producer as a sort of homage to is superficial indeed. Ozu can make you cry. This despite its Ozulike structure leaves you feeling rather blank. Perhaps this is because it's essentially about people avoiding real contact with each other. That's not the same as being reserved. In fact it's extremely different. People who are shy and reserved as Ozu's characters tend to be may very often care very intensely. The impression is that these people devised for Hou's version of Japan just don't ultimately seem to feel very much. If this is how things are now in Japan too bad but would Hou really know? He's Chinese. He has even admitted in interviews that culturally he was a bit out of his depth in coming to Japana to make a film. Despite very assured style the deadpan story has no pulse. This is more a perversion of than homage to the great Ozu. Another commentator has said Caf Lumire may be the film that Ozu would have made if he lived in the modern age. It may be but I don't think so. And if it were then it is as well that Ozu did not live in the modern age because he would have ceased to be Ozu.As I have said recently in another context Hou doesn't always hit it but when he does he flies to the moon. Hou can't make a movie without stylistic and visual elegance and Caf Lumire with its cool tranquility and measured pace and its delicate light has those qualities. But he didn't make it to heaven this time. In the second part of his recent Three Times he did all the way to the moon. So he can still fly but this conscientious measured effort plods.".

Very human.Another way it was a very human hearted film was the relationships between her parents  who watch their growing daughter with concern slowly become more independent  and between her bookshop friend  having little chats in the bookshop not going into deep conversation but having lighthearted chat.It didn't have to be complicated and that's what I liked most about this film. It was something to relate to.This film is definitely a piece of art. Notice how the only soundtrack within the whole picture musicwise is Weyne's pieces that is during the film  there is a song during the credits. This brings more emphasis on the humanity of the film and the artistic camera shots used. It's a very poetic and serene film.Cafe Lumiere probably means more to Hsiaohsien Hou and Yasujiro Ozu fans than it did to me.

She wanders around rides the trains hangs out with a friend has halfheard conversations on a cell phone eats drinks milk eats some more and generally avoids the issue of what's in her belly. So yes it's pretty dull. But Hou does capture an ambiance that is pleasant at the very least. I have in the past likened Hou's work to sitting on a bus and eavesdropping. Funny as one of the main characters in this film enjoys recording ambient noises on passenger trains. At least in this film you get to hang around a pretty Japanese girl and Tadanobu Asano star of such great Asian flicks as Ichi the Killer and Last Life in the Universe. I loved the last sequence and the final shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "One needs to watch carefully and attentively this film which is not easy but reserves a lot of interesting and beautiful things despite a lack of story or actually despite the story not being in the focus of the director. It is a reverence by Taiwanese director Hou HsiaoHsien to the Japanese master director Ozu on the 100th anniversary of it's birthday. However it is not a film of quotes but rather a travel to research what is left of Ozu's world in the Japan of today and the connection between Taiwan and Japan in the world that was once Ozu's.There are a lot of trains in this film. This passion for railways may be taken from Ozu but in 'Cafe Lumiere' about third of the film happens in trains or railway stations. A memorable sequence describes the universe of metropolis with trains entering and exiting tunnels another shows in a computer generated drawing an universe of trains squeezing a minuscule uterus and a child  maybe the expected child of Yoko the principal character of the film or maybe symbol of fragility of our existence in the modern world.Another fantastic scene of cinema presents the house of Yoko's parents at her arrival. We can see just Yoko's mother in the last plane preparing food in a lit kitchen then the kitchen is framed by the house guest room which is at its turn framed by the doors and external walls of the house. Then the sound of a car is heard and we more guess than see the arrival of Yoko and her father reflected in a glass door. Four planes in the same frame with no move of the camera.The story is minimalistic and whoever looks for action risks to be deeply bored. The actors perform so well that the word 'perform' is not not adequate here they live the characters. They seldom interact they never stare in each others eyes but rather look in different planes same as the trains movements never intersect. They do however care for each other and the story is a delicate one of familial solidarity and deep friendship in a world that may look frightening. These characters could have been part of a film by Ozu.".

Each scene consists of a single medium or long shot with no closeups or edits whatsoever. The result is that we become so detached from the characters on screen that we find ourselves unengaged in their problems and their fates.

Admittedly some of the compositions are stunning and the style is intriguing and hypnotic at first but it soon loses its charm as the tedium of the narrative or nonnarrative takes over.The acting is consistently understated and naturalistic but in a movie in which everybody just looks preoccupied and pensive there really isn't much call for anything else.".

Yoko then lives her life spending time doing research with her male friend Hajime who owns a second hand store. You can tell he likes her and so do I. She wants to be independent. The use of trains long shots of street scenes and a simple but intriguing plot make this an Ozu type film.While it doesn't reach Ozu's heights that is near impossible its very good. The consistency of mood the suppression of emotions and the camera angles are also very much like Ozu. If not Setsuko Hara I could see Yoko Tsukasa playing the character Yoko in this film if she was her age at the time of this film. The constant scenes of trains made me like the film even more.

	schema:headline " Aspiration of Ozu Masterworks Muddled by Lethargic Pacing and Character Weightlessness";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur Yasujiro Ozu whose masterfully understated views of Japanese life especially in the postWWII era illuminate universal truths. Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949's Late Spring and 1953's Tokyo Story I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiaohsien's keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film. Among with coscreenwriter T'ienwen Chu Hsiaohsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable.The story concerns Yko a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang WenYe in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese. After 25 drawnout minutes of character setup she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time Yko's coffeehouse friend Hajime who runs a used bookstore has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her. Hsiaohsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains. While these techniques are consistent with Ozu's style Hsiaohsien cannot seem to dive into the characters' psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics in particular Yko's plight seems rather noncommittal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest. In fact the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it which makes the film feel interminable.The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable. Jpop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Yko while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime. The rest of the characters barely register even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Yko's parents. Cinematographer Lee PingBing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots. Hitoto speaksings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits HitoShian. The DVD includes an hour long Frenchmade documentary Mtro Lumire which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiaohsien's approach to the film. It includes excerpts from Ozu's films in particular Equinox Flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either Tokyo Story or Early Summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation setups. There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto Asano and Hsiaohsien as well as the film's trailer.".

I can hardly remember the last time my words evoked a response but if by any chance someone may be wondering about my silence I can answer in one word  disappointment. For me the main reason for writing criticism is to impart enthusiasm for works that have excited and moved me in some way which is why my eulogies far outweigh adverse comments. If I ever venture into the latter territory it is generally to question something that I feel has been excessively praised. What I find disappointing about many of the films I have chanced to see recently is that several have been made by directors I very much admire the two Chinese titans for instance Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. How could the former for instance have conceived Together a facile foray into the mystique of musical talent beside which Wes Craven's Music of the Heart seems almost something of a masterpiece or the latter's House of Flying Daggers yet another martial arts kids flick and nowhere near as much fun as Ryhei Kitamuru's Azumi. Even Michael Haneke the Austrian master of unease was way below his usual form with his Armageddon vision Time of the Wolf which somehow lacked the incisiveness that someone like Tarkovsky might have given to so potentially powerful a theme. I could go on and cite others but there would be little point. However the greatest disappointment of them all can hardly go unmentioned as it involves two directors whose work I absolutely reverence. I refer to the Taiwanese Hou HsiaoHsien's tribute to the Japanese Yasujiro Ozu on the occasion of the centenary of his birth Cafe Lumiere. How could such a great opportunity so sadly misfire? Try as I can  I have given it three viewings  I cannot discover the film's secrets. The storyline is basically very simple. A young Japanese woman returns to her home in Tokyo from a visit to Taiwan where she has been engaged on research into the work of a Taiwanese composer. She confronts her parents with the fact that she is pregnant by a Taiwanese boyfriend but is clear in her mind that she has no intention of marriage. In Tokyo her friend and confidante is a young bookseller whose main obsession is the local railway scene. When not sitting in his bookshop he is out and about making recordings of railway sounds. And that's about it. True there is a sort of homage to Ozu's minimalist style long sequences without camera movement punctuated by carefully composed shots of settings here as occasionally in Ozu trains and stations. What is missing is content. Ozu's films are carefully constructed studies of human relationship. His characters are vibrant and beautifully drawn with tensions between different generations always subtly realised. Perhaps he has only one basic message to impart that life is disappointing but the fascination of his work lies in the seemingly endless different ways he has of saying this. In Hou's tribute we have nothing but the disappointment of a curiously empty film.".

	schema:reviewBody "2003 marked the centenary of the great Yasujiro Ozu's birth and as such films in tribute were made. One such film was Taiwanese director HsiaoHsien Hou's Cafe Lumiere. With Ozu so associated with deep Japanese family drama it may seem difficult to believe that a nonnative can take on a film in tribute to him. But with subtle styling and nuances Hou shows clear touches of Ozu's influence while still maintaining enough individuality to steer it away from becoming an Ozu paintbynumbers work of nothingness. Yoko  played by TaiwaneseJapanese musician Yo Hitoto  is some sort of reportertype who switches her time between Tokyo and Taiwan. Researching Taiwanese composer WenYe Jiang for some reason she seeks out a cafebar the composer frequented when based in Tokyo. And that's about that a film low on plot and slow in pace it's in the nuances along the way that make this a tribute to the Japanese master.Family and its changing nature is a theme hinted at throughout with Yoko pregnant by her boyfriend in Taiwan. However she has a somewhat blas attitude towards the pregnancy and indeed her boyfriend unconcerned as to whether she sees him again let alone allowing him to father his child reflecting a modern decline in the nuclear family and particular Japanese attitudes to sex and declining birth rate. Her father seems unimpressed with her attitude while her step mother tries to do what she can to please her. Living in the countryside their visiting her in her small Tokyo apartment is reminiscent of Ozu's Tokyo Story with the elders feeling out of place in the modern metropolis her father maintaining a silence. Her lack of hospitality with little to offer her parents  having to borrow food and sake from her older neighbours  shows a further distance from the family unit of today's youth solely concerned by her own endeavours. This mirrors Ozu's take on the empowerment of women as seen in the likes of Late Autumn with young females shunning the traditional expectations placed upon them. Obviously four decades along the line Yoko is quite content to tackle the pregnancy alone and go about her daily life as she pleases continuing her research of Jiang  though still in early days it would be interesting to see how this would continue finding herself alone on a train station platform feeling sick. Trains are an important theme in Cafe Lumiere Hou choosing to use extensive shots of Tokyo's various forms of railed transportation. This again is reminiscent of some of Ozu's later works with Tokyo's morphing into a modern day megalopolis  a confusing and sprawling mass of rail networks  a modern equivalent of Ozu's shots of neon lights growing on the landscape. Sexpot Tadanobu Asano plays Hajime Yoko's book shop worker friend and Tokyo rail network obsessive recording the various sounds of Tokyo's trains and creating digital artwork based on trains. The sounds he records such as the infamous Yamanote Line station announcements are part of modern day Tokyo life. As an outsider it's clear that the transport network was a distinctive point of Tokyo for Hou.The extensive use of shots of changes slowly moving across bridges and weaving between bridges while a disgustingly beautiful shot the modern world summarise the film's slow pace. Low on story you can't help but feel that the film's running time could be drastically cut. Hou captures life as it happens trains trundle along Yoko walks around Tokyo's various districts taking breaks to sit in cafes and chat in bookshops. This is a documentation the cast less acting but filmed as they go about the tasks they are asked to perform. Watched in sections Cafe Lumiere can work but altogether it can perhaps be a little repetitive and needing a bit of a kickstart.This is not masterful work but a wellconsidered homage and Cafe Lumiere can stand alone as a good piece of cinema though perhaps knowing it is an Ozu tribute adds a little more to it in the audience's mind. Though perhaps this restaurant main could have been condensed to a cafe light lunch. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk".

	schema:reviewBody "Selected people in the West know Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu. They generally agree that the director's films are icons of emotional filmmaking. Watch his Tokyo Story for instance without your eyes welling up and you might be made of stone.Cafe Lumiere is a film commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Ozu. The old familiar Studio Shochiku logo  under whose banner Ozu filmed many classics  depicting Mount Fuji starts Cafe Lumiere. The next two thematic shots are emblematic of Ozu. The sights of trains chugging along and an unextraordinary girl Yoko played by Japanese pop singer Yo Hitoto whose song is heard here are emblematically Ozu. One sees the trains the girl sights and sounds of Japan and interior shots. They even borrow foodstuff and utensils from the neighbours or landlord here as in Tokyo Story. That is where the comparisons stop however. In particular where Ozu's tangible emotions were better than any in the history of cinema Hsiaohsien Hou's Cafe Lumiere is in fact the opposite. Apparently stationary tatami shots alone a masterpiece do not make. More on this a little later.Yoko is back from Taiwan and carries news. She has been teaching Japanese in Taiwan and simultaneously researching Taiwanese composer Jiang Wenye. Beyond that there is little one would call a plot. Nothing much happens and the film progresses and ends as it began which is casually and for no good reason. The sights of Tokyo trains and snippets of Takasaki where she hails from and her family still lives take prominence in a tale of indifference and lackadaisical modernity. If routine human behaviour and norms are interesting then Cafe Lumiere wins. Indeed the actors admit to a lack of rehearsals as the director enforced little practise and opted for long shots in which he invited the cast to simply be themselves in lieu of scripted acting. From this comes an everyday disengagement that is the hallmark of this film. Whereas with Ozu emotions are thick and palpable and stretch out from the screen to affect the viewer in Cafe Lumiere we find unfeeling barren asexual disengagement. This might be the director's aim  one constantly sees trains on divergent tracks either travelling in opposite directions or crisscrossing in Ochanomizu  to show how Ozu's forebodings of a changing Japan have now come to pass and nothing means anything where parents are powerless and the younger generation cares less. What is sure however is Cafe Lumiere evokes complete dismal detachment. And that is why its comparisons to Ozu's body of work is minimal only and superficial at best.If storyline and gripping involvement are as far away in this film as musicality is from a rap album what else is there? For Tokyo enthusiasts there are clear shots of Tokyo train locales and street cars. The bookstore is near Minowabashi Station. Yoko is at the Nippori Station on the Keisei line in Arakawa where she rents a locker and at Koenji when walking by and visiting a book store. Viewers also see train bridges in Ginza a clear shot of Senzokuike station entrance and the Ochanomizu Station which has an interesting name. She also travels to Takasaki and is picked up at that city's train station. It is ideal for a train enthusiast like her friend Hajimechan played by Tadanobu Asano who incidentally recently has gained prominence through his Hollywood adventures. The ordinary sights of Japan and the passersby are almost more interesting than the meagre script.Another thing bears mentioning. The film was financed by the studio to reminisce Ozu but why a Taiwanese director was brought in is somewhat questionable and especially given the debatable comparisons and result. In the DVD extras the director devotes time to his appreciation of Ozu. Hsiaohsien Hou in turn cast Yo Hitoto who is halfTaiwanese and made her quest of a Taiwanese artist the subplot. Also in Cafe Lumiere is Kimiko Yo who can be seen in the superlative Departures who is an actress of Taiwanese background in Japan.Cafe Lumiere is not alone in contemporary Japanese cinema in moving slowly or skewing convention or plot but and as much as one might casually enjoy following and observing Yoko as she goes about her day Cafe Lumiere had set itself up by associating itself with Ozu and is ultimately just mundane.".

Are you wondering why he chose Shu Qi as his muse?Shu  or is that Qi?  doesn't appear in this one. Instead we get a snaggletoothed Yo Hitoto apparently a pop star in Japan  judging by her song at the end she's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at Rockin' Curry is a actriss  and a wasted Tadanobu Asano typically an indicator of quality who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling Asian hipster and is too old to manage even that. Hou's philosophy? Life is limbo a big nothing feel it and move on. I'd like to do that but Hou gives us nothing to feel in Cafe Lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of Life in Tokyo Circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night no make that trains that pass in the day never connecting each hurtling to its own destination usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they're lucky. Yikes. Flowers of Shanghai is one of the most rarefied technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time. How could the same director who created the opening shot of that film which features about twelve actors conversing at machinegun speed for about ten straight minutes  an impossible directorial feat  get trapped making this laconic subJarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now? Millennium Mambo may be dead weight but at least it has two great shots shots that hint at Hou's true calling as the film equivalent of Odilon Redon Those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of Shu Qi floating down a blue corridor. His M.O. while making Cafe Lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from Millennium Mambo to make it more consistent. You be the judge if that sounds appealing. Hou does not need to refine  you cannot refine the limbo idea further than Flowers of Shanghai. He needs to expand to bloat outwards to release the inner expressionist and genrerevitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichd minimalism. It's time for him to do a liveaction remake of Akira or something. This kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in longshot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe ghettoized and stagnant as the Hollywood action blockbuster.  What is the connection between reality and people who can't talk? It seems to me that people in real life never stop jabbering.  Then again considering that 2005 alone brought bigbudget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as Aeon Flux The Island and King Kong it's now safe to say that even Michael Bay has surpassed Hou and that's really sad.The good news is that though Hou is in his 50s it frankly feels to me as if he hasn't even begun. There are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunsetred while Hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins. But whatever fear is holding him back however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema Hou your time as the darling of the Rotterdam Venice Toronto Berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse doublequick. Two words for you Atom Egoyan. Two more words or maybe three Tsai MingLiang. You are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever. Risk your shirt on a scifi epic sell out be reviled  but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart. Let your painterly talent express itself to the full. You're not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise.".

This is not a film everybody will enjoy or even remotely understand. This is a film for scholars and film school students and for those who love Yasujiro Ozu and admire Hsiaohsien Hou.The film is about a young woman living in Tokyo. She is researching on a Taiwanese jazz musician in the 1930s. She came home and told her parents that she is pregnant by her Taiwanese boyfriend in a matter of fact fashion and she has no intention to marry him. She likes to hang out with a friend who runs a used book store and likes to tape the sounds of trains in Tokyo. There is nothing more to the plot. It's not a melodrama although it is extremely slow.The film uses a lot low light and put the camera far away to quietly observe the daily lives of these characters without any emphasis nor judgment. Simply observe. It portraits the modern lives in our industrial society people are cold lonely disconnected and invisible even you see them everywhere. Several times in the film it shows the scene of passing trains at the same time on different levels in an overpass and toward different directions. It resembles people who run around on the streets all the time but they never interact with each other and they never collide unless there is an accident.Andrew Sun wrote this on The Hollywood Reporter about this filmThe fact is if you can stay awake through the whole 100 minutes you should get a medal for being a resilient movie diehard. I am gonna collect my medal since I didn't miss a minute during the film today.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just want to state off hand that this is my first movie review well other than just telling someone what I thought. So if you are looking for a well written witty review then.. you might want to stop reading now. But since this movie is still in production this will probably be your best bet for the time being.I just went to a free screening of Ted at the Greenback theater in Sacramento CA. And I just have to say off the bat I LOVED it. A movie hasn't made me laugh that hard in a long time. Now I'm not going to give you any more information than the description because with the movie not even being released yet I think that would be a spoiler of some sort. But I will tell you that was so much better than what I imagined it would be granted that was before I knew it was directed and voiced over by Seth Macfarlane. So if you're a fan of his you're definitely in for a treat and even if you're not I still think you would enjoy the innovative comedy that comes from a snarky and crude teddy bear companion. The acting was very solid from main characters to jerk bosses and crazy.. well crazy people.. the acting was very convincing and enjoyable. The story was great while it might sound stupid to some myself included it's very well executed. Definitely not one of the movies that left me thinking the idea was good but they could have done so much more with it it was actually quite the opposite. And this is certainly not a low budget film the CGI animation reflects this. The furry bear voiced by Macfarlane is very realistic and believable. The only drawback I could possibly see that would cause someone displeasure would be like a lot of new comedies this film pushes the envelope in raunchy vulgar humor. Plus the different amount of drugs used. This movie will receive most likely and be very deserving of a R rating. It doesn't rely solely on shock humor though there is plenty of good old fashioned clean comedy. But if your like me and that type of subject matter doesn't bother you then I HIGHLY recommend this film. And if you're a Seth Macfarlane fan then that's just a perfectly gift wrapped little bonus for you.".

	schema:headline " One of the most disappointing movie experiences I've ever sat through";
	schema:reviewBody "I like Family Guy. So much that I've always said that if I were stuck on a desert island Seth MacFarlane is one of the people I'd want to be stuck there with me. I found this movie horrible loathsome and lazy so much so that it actually made me question Family Guy. That's how bad I thought it was. It made me rethink my entire conception of humor. I did not find this movie funny at all. The style of comedy it uses is similar to that of Adam Sandler whom I loathe. There's a lot of yelling a lot of cursing and overall a lot stuff that's supposed to be funny. There are no clever jokes no sense of setup and reward. Instead it's oh look the man is dancing that's hilarious!. Not. Or haha that guy just said the fword'. Isn't that funny? Kill me. I did find exactly one scene funny the one in which Ted and Mark Whalberg have a fist fight in a hotel room. That reminded me of Family Guy and I found the idea so absurd that it made me chuckle. But this moment of hilarity is quickly diffused by a getting hit in the groin joke. Now I realize that Family Guy uses exactly this type of humor but somehow I always found it funnier. Maybe that's the problem here live action is a different medium and the same things that work in the campy universe of cartoons don't work with real people. I realize that this is a comedy but I do believe that even low brow comedy movies should have a basic story or plot. This was supposed to be a character driven movie. The idea is simple Mark Whalberg is a manchild who must learn to take responsibility and grow up. The script screws up this idea completely and instead Mark Whalberg makes absolutely no change as a person. Neither does Ted. I realize it's supposed to be adorable that a teddy bear smokes weed but the novelty wore off in 2 minutes. That and I found the accent horribly annoying. I was excited to see the supporting cast list on wikipedia. Whalberg is great but like I said his character was very poorly written. Mila Kunis does nothing in the whole movie but play a horribly clichd romantic comedy girlfriend who also has no character arc in the movie. Joel McHale is another clich in the movie and the fact that he's in the movie is a waste of a talented comedic actor. Laura Vandervoort literally does nothing. I mean I at least expected her to be the seductress who tries to veer Mark Whalberg off the path of righteousness but even that doesn't happen. So why even have this supporting cast in the movie if no one's going to do anything? The plot of this movie was equally weak. MacFarlane uses all of these clichd romcom scenes and does nothing with them. Here's a small example. This movie has 2 or 3 restaurant scenes. Now ask yourself why exactly were these scenes in the movie? Usually restaurants are used in comedy movies to employ some kind of restaurant related humor. Maybe there's a maladjusted person in an uncomfortable environment or maybe someone has an allergy and they cause a scene. At least someone falling or something. But the first restaurant scene of this movie simply has Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis sitting and talking. That could have just as easily happened in a living room. So why was the restaurant scene necessary? Why even do that? It's completely pointless. The ending to this movie accomplishes nothing. Mark Whalberg is supposed to change as a person. The death of Ted should have signified something and having him come back to life sts on the character arc completely and nullifies it. We have no reason to believe that Mark Whalberg will grow up or make any kind of difference in life. This movie had way too much product placement. Horribly obvious product placement. Here's what I think. I think Seth MacFarlane is a perfectly competent individual who chose to be lazy. He wrote a horrible script packed it with TV stars we might recognize and collected the money. It's not just that this movie had no redeemable qualities. I actually feel like my intelligence was insulted and that I was fooled out of my money. Please don't let movies like this turn off your brain. Think about what you're watching and why you're laughing and don't settle for crap like this.".

With a running time of 98 mins I could only manage to sit through the first 40 minutes before turning off this unfunny quite boring and quite disappointing film.The premise of this film is quite simple. At the age of eight 8 years old and with no real friends of his own little John Bennett Mark Wahlberg makes a Christmas wish for his teddy bear to come to life. Ted and John become life long friends thunder buddies however after twentyseven 27 years of friendship John must decide on either staying with his girlfriend of four 4 years Lori Mila Kunis or Ted.Ted is the brainchild of Seth MacFarlane Family Guy  American Dad and he voices Ted as well. Ted has no redeeming qualities and is combination of the two characters Quagmire and Brian from the Family Guy TV series. He's a potsmoking hooker dating grocery clerk humping foul mouth Neanderthal who Lori Kunis feels is preventing her and John from having the adult relationship that she so desires to have.In the 40 minutes that I managed to sit through I never laughed smirked grinned or even hinted to a gesture of happiness to any of the socalled comedy being presented on screen because there wasn't any there!!!! Unless you consider a foulmouth pot smoking teddy bear as being funny which I did not. However the scene in which I could take no more is when Ted while working as a clerk out clerk in a local grocery store gets caught bopping another check out clerk in the store room and explains to his boss that Last week he screwed her with a parsnip and sold the parsnip to a family of four  so his boss promoted him. IS THAT FUNNY?????? REALLY??? God I feel like my dad now I must be getting old!!!! Anyways the film is making money hand over fist and has already crossed the 100 million and expected to cross the 200 million mark by summer's end. I JUST DO NOT GET IT!!!!!! I cannot recommend this film I cannot even finish watching this film. It's being marketed as this year's The Hangover and I can assure you it is nowhere as funny as the The Hangover. I would say avoid at all costs but who am I???? SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB  THE FARIS REEL".

It's not a bad idea to imagine a kid's teddy bear that ages along with him  into the raunchiest version of a case of arrested development imaginable. The scenes with the supermarket manager are pretty entertaining and I found Wahlberg's offkey serenade to Kunis amusing. However 98 percent of the time I was squirming unpleasantly. Jewish jokes? How terribly fresh and original. Fart gags? That's creative. Scenes of guys getting crazydrunk knocking things over and trashing rooms? My sides were splitting. And it got better from there i.e. poop on the floor. The storyline involving Wahlberg and Kunis was strictly a retread. I tired of their petty spats and could not care less whether they stayed together or split. The fatherandson subplot seemed like something I'd seen before. I know this movie wasn't geared toward 56yearold moms. However I did expect a script from the originator of Family Guy to be significantly more clever and fun. I know many will disagree with me but this movie reeked.".

I know this movie wasn't geared toward 56yearold moms. However I did expect a script from the originator of Family Guy to be significantly more clever and fun. I know many will disagree with me but this movie reeked.";

The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release had me expecting something fresh something that would keep me laughing days after.

Having said that 'Ted' did provide some good laughs whilst they weren't exactly sidesplitting the film was entertaining and I did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The animations for Ted were of a good quality doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors rather than just a computergenerated 3D image. What I felt let 'Ted' down was it's predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15 'Ted's plot didn't seem to suit it's targeted audience I have seen similar story lines in films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of 'Ted' was clearly intended for more mature audiences therefore I felt it deserved a more mature plot. Overall I'd recommend 'Ted' to those who are looking for a relatively lighthearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing yet somehow still lovable teddy bear. It's good but nothing overly special.".

	schema:reviewBody "First there was Gollum then Caesar the ape and now ... Ted? If you thought motioncapture animation was beyond the range of foulmouthed Rrated comedy here's your evidence to the contrary. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldn't behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level and the big screen  with Ted a story of growing up  at the age of 35.Fans of MacFarlane and Family Guy will be the first to tell you that the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately I guess those manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard. It's not easy to keep scoring laughs using the same nonsequitur formula over and over again but fortunately Ted is a more comically cohesive effort than you'd ever expect from the king of unexpected random jabs references and political incorrectness.If you haven't been curious enough to find out what the film is about already Ted tells the story of how young John Bennett who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg who had trouble fitting in as a kid made a wish on Christmas Day for his teddy bear to come to life. His wish comes true and Ted becomes world famous even appearing on the Johnny Carson Show. But as Patrick Stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his role as narrator like Corey Feldman and Frankie Muniz eventually people stop giving a .Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori Mila Kunis nearly middleaged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s Flash Gordon with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend. Eventually John must start to make sacrifices if he wants to become the adult that Lori wants him to be and Ted is arguably the chief reason for his inability to shape up.There aren't exactly any curveballs in this story but that's when you realize you're watching a film in which a man is trying to stop hanging out with his profane teddy bear. Despite the obvious outcomes Ted has to be considered an original comedy.It's also consistently funny. Sure the nature of many of the jokes is that they exist in a vacuum and aren't necessarily related to what's going on or what matters but much of the references actually tie into the plot later on such as Flash Gordon ... it'll make sense when you see it and it's far less random than skeptics will come in expecting. That said some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a personal level i.e. if you watch this with a group of people you're bound to laugh really hard at times when they don't and viceversa.The only thing that feels a little out of place is a subplot involving Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy single father who has been a longtime admirer of Ted's and inquires about purchasing him for his overweight son. You've never seen Ribisi like this and that alone is amusing but the focus of the film is on how John and Ted's mischief impacts his ability to grow up and get more serious with Lori and this sort of butts into things.Yet for all its shenanigans the amount of heart and sincerity in some of the relationship drama between John and Lori is surprising. Wahlberg and Kunis are generally pretty convincing even if it's a bit weird that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to Ted's peer pressure. Bear pressure?The secret weapon is that Ted really is kind of adorable and the mocap gives him an extra lifelike quality. The film hits some emotional notes early who can't identify with loving a stuffed animal? and this helps it to reconnect later on despite all the Rrated chaos in between. That ability alone assures Ted will be seen as better than a majority of foul mouthed dirtyminded comedies.Ridiculous comes to mind as the best descriptor for Ted which one has to imagine MacFarlane aimed for in the first place. His performance as the titular bear is certainly reminiscent of Peter Griffin there's a wink to the audience about that by the way but more importantly Ted is treated as more than just an opportunity for a neverending string of jokes that are simply funnier because it's a teddy bear.Maybe having to create a complete package in the form of a movie has helped MacFarlane learn how to tone down his shtick. Audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatterbrained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives and MacFarlane and cowriters Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion. Ted is as engaging as it is clever funny and ridiculous. Steven C".

	schema:reviewBody "I am stunned by the number of negative reviews on here. We went to see Ted last night the UK release date and it was fantastic. In fact it was the funniest film I have seen for years! The humour throughout is both obvious AND subtle with masses of trademark Seth MacFarlane jokes as well as some expansion to his comedy repertoire made possible by having a live action film instead of an animation.Some people have commented on all the 80s references  that's the joke in itself  Seth always overfocuses on the 80s and he's poking fun at himself by doing it even more! He liked Star Wars Indian Jones Flash Gordon Top Gun etc. So did I  which is partly what makes it all so cool! Fans of Seth's humour will love these little and not so little references as they have all been used extensively in Family Guy. You don't have to be 'over 35' to get the references you just have to get that Seth is a big fan of the 80s and has great fun referencing stuff he likes. Some might call it selfindulgent but I thought it was very funny. Perhaps you have top be on a particular wavelength I don't know.To suggest that he's being racist is also to misunderstand Seth MacFarlane  he's actually ridiculing people with stereotypical ignorant racist attitudes. Once again he has done this in Family Guy and been similarly misunderstood. It's OK to make fun of racism or even the public's lack of knowledge on subjects such as 911  neither of these mean that you're racist or proterrorist! In reference to the acting Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis were very good especially Mila. Ted was also superbly played by Seth MacFarlane and it was interesting to note how after a while you didn't even really think of him as a bear he was just another character in the film. Lovely to hear Patrick Stewart's voice used again too. In addition there was a generous use of Family Guy people who were all great fun especially the guy who does the voice of Joe Swanson and looked like they were clearly enjoying the opportunity to be in Seth's film debut.In summary if you don't like Seth MacFarlane's humour there's a good chance you will not enjoy this film. However if you like Family Guy and you have the ability to look beyond the obvious then you might well love Ted as much as I did. I thought it was brilliant and can't remember the last time I laughed so much at a cinema!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been excited to see Ted since I saw the first preview. I read some of the initial reviews and it sounded great. I have to admit it wasn't THAT funny. First the voice of Ted. It's freaking Peter Griffin!!! It's like the creators of SpongeBob making a movie and they use the voice of SpongeBob. It's really distracting. And when Ted is making fun of someone he uses Stewie's voice?!?! Why!?!? Don't you have another voice you can use? The beginning of the film Ted is a cute and innocent bear. I felt the movie was funnier then. The vulgar smoking sexually active Ted felt forced to me.Some of the jokes fell flatter than a Kansas interstate. Seriously the movie theater was completely packed and there were jokes that didn't garner one single laugh. Sometimes I couldn't tell if they were trying to make a joke or not. Some jokes were supposed to be kinda mean but were just kinda dumb. There were times it seemed like the audience laughed because they thought they were supposed to. This is Ted!!! It's supposed to be hilarious!!! There were some funny parts. But honestly I left disappointed.".

I laughed a handful of times but that isn't enough for 100 minutes.You are just constantly pushed out of it by inept moviecraftsmanship. The casting is ridiculous. A former superhero and another former man in black have a small side role as a 'funny' gay couple.  Problem is a 12 year old makes better gay jokes. The stuff feels really outdated for me. Maybe in the early 1990s such a thing as a man who is gay but can't figure it out was funny. Plus one can see no one gave them useful direction to portray the characters as they are SO VISIBLE as the actors who did that other movie all the time.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first movie review I've ever done and after watching Ted it inspired me to write a review. How this movie has close to an 8 star rated is just sad. This movie is downright awful. I'm not really giving any spoilers because there's nothing to give away. It's pretty much an entire drawn out recent family guy episode. Mark Walberg gets picked on as a child makes a wish and gets a magical talking teddy bear. How cute. Fast forward to when he's a 35 year old loser and Ted is still his best friend. Only now Ted turns out to be a raunchy lil teddy bear who smokes weed drink all that. It doesn't match up. Mark Walberg doesn't seem like the couch sitting loser he's portraited to be. Mila Kunis is his gf of 4 years and she has her life together. But somehow they are a couple blah blah. She wants more from him and their relationship but Ted is bringing him down with his constant drinking smoking all that stupid stuff. Her boss Joel McHale is constantly hitting on her but she's happy with her boyfriend. They eventually break up she goes on a date with her boss so he can stop bothering her and then she still doesn't want him. Walberg ruins their date by performing a stupid song. Ted goes to have a serious chat with her trying to get them back together. She meets him at a restaurant then their makeup gets interrupted by Giovani Ribisi and his son who kidnap Ted. Ted gets ripped apart at Fenway Park and dies in a sense. Kunis wishes upon a star and he's magically back to life..the end. I can't forget the mention all the jokes throughout the movie. There was a scene where Kunis comes home to find Ted with hookers and there's a dump on the floor. That was kind of funny I did laugh at that scene. And the other kind of funny scene was when Ted is working at a grocery store trying to flirt with a blonde girl so he takes a bottle of lotion and pretends to ejaculate. Now other than that all of the jokes revolved around Family Guy. Yeah we get it already you made Family Guy aside from the first 45 seasons isn't funny at all but was it really necessary to make your film the same exact thing as family guy? The concept could have gone so much better. The cast in the movie is great. Mark Walberg Mila Kunis and Joel McHale are extremely funny people. And even Giovanni Ribisi. But this movie does not in any way portray just how funny they are. It was just an awful movie. Completely overrated. Seth McFarlene is just not funny. He was at one point. When Family guy first came out it was hilarious. Just such a funny show but after season 5 it's completely redundant and overused jokes don't do it. I'm not one to be easily offended I even love toilet humorall that crap but this movies sucks. You can't force offensive jokes down people's throats like he does. Being that I'm not a huge McFarlene fan I wasn't expecting to be blown away. But after how many good reviews it got I was expecting something more. Not to sit there wondering what other movies I could leave and go see.This doesn't appeal to a certain age group because on one end you have twitterFacebook references Kim Karshain jokes and other celebrities from the past 5 years or so yet the movie focuses so much around Flash Gordon. There's even a god awful Airplane reference. Two completely different time periods. Not worth seeing whatsoever. Even if it's free. I found The Other Guys to be 10000000x better. Or no scratch that. The Happening which also stars Mark Walberg is funnier than this movie. I hope in my lifetime Seth McFarlene never makes another movie again. Ever.".

It really is bad beyond belief but if you don't believe me then check it out and be prepared to see somewhat respectable actors sink to the lowest of lows.";

Roughly 50 of IMDb votes are 1 which is totally absurd. A more accurate rating is probably in the 4 to 6 range compared to all similar films. Center Stage where the central characters are dancers training to make it big in ballet is a similar film.Other commentors say Britney Spears can't sing. Those comments are equally absurd. While I'm not particularly a fan of hers she indeed can sing very well. As a singer she is as good as most of the rest of the young singers who cater to the teeniebopper audience. She certainly is a better singer than Madonna who achieved her fame on image alone.Can Britney act? Compared to good young actresses Britney is fairly amateurish. But she didn't have to stretch very far for the role of a proper studious high school valedictorian who decided to look for her mother who abandoned her as a baby to be raised by her single father Ackroyd. And along the way write poetry which was then put to music by a young man who drove the three girls west to Los Angeles.Most of the situations and dialog are silly and there are many closerange shots of a pretty smiling Britney. However I suspect they would appeal to the under15 crowd of Britney fans. I enjoyed the film from the point of view that it gave me some glimpse of the real Britney one that is not revealed in her concerts and music videos. I believe as she grows up and out of her former image she will develop a more mature singing and acting style and will continue her popularity for a long time. Year 2005 update I was wrong she's become very strange! Year 2007 update She has gotten even more strange! Year 2008 update Even her little sister has become strange and a new mother!!Critic Ebert gives an accurate review of the facts in the case I will not repeat them here.

Sob sob! Incredibly awful and idiotic drama coupled with sickeningly sweet romance make this one a nottobemissed...if you're the sort to love MST3K that is.

Definitely one of the best worst movies I've ever seen it tells the story of how Britney Spears looks like a fashion model and acts like an angel while still managing to be the most unpopular girl at school.

The story itself has been done before see Boys on the Side and you can predict the whole movie in the first 510 minutes. You also have to suspend some belief they should still be broke. If you accept the movie for what it is a coming of age story of 3 very different girls that would appeal to the tween and early teenagers it's passable. If you're a guy don't waste your time. The acting is amateurish but not nearly as bad as in Glitter or From Justin to Kelly.All in all if you have nothing else to do and it's on feel free to give it a try.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a bad movie mostly because of the simple reason that it's an absolutely horrible written one.This movie is mostly infamous and hated because of Britney Spears who plays the lead role. But really in all honesty she is far from the worse thing about this movie. It's true that she is obviously no actress but I didn't exactly hated her watching in this and her performance didn't made me cringe all that badly.It's a movie that got made at the prime of her musical career when she also was still considered to be fresh and innocent. But it does not at all feel like this movie got specifically written for her. She plays a character that is quite different from herself and in the movie she doesn't even sing or dances all that much which is good news for a lot of people. It's true that this movie is a typical chickflick so perhaps I'm not the right person to judge it but I'm still sure that I'm very well able to recognize a good movie when I see it and this movie just isn't much good to watch. The entire way the movie got written and progresses is not only boring and pointless but also lazy and too often doesn't make enough sense.I just don't get some of the stuff that this movie does. Britney Spears is supposed to be an ugly girl that gets laughed at at school which is laughable in itself. No matter how much you just don't like Britney you can't really call her ugly especially not when you also see her body as well which she shows quite a lot in this movie actually. And for some crazy and never explained reason 3 girls who used to be best friends stopped being friends at high school and even somewhat hate each other go on a road trip together and for some totally different crazy reason they also suddenly are friends again as if everything that was shown and told in the movie previously wasn't important and had even never happened.Something I also really don't understand the Britney Spears character had a nerdy boyfriend played by Justin Long of course for 3 years but as the movie goes along she totally forgets about this and so are its viewers supposed to do I suppose? Since she hooks up with a totally different guy which is something we also are supposed to cheer for. But what about poor Justin Long Brit? What did he ever do wrong to you. It just didn't feel right but it's normal for this movie to leave many loose ends like this and character just keep on changing their behavior and personalities for no logical reasons other than it's just being a very poorly written movie.The movie really doesn't progress very naturally or pleasantly and doesn't really wrap things up properly. Just think about it. The 3 main characters all go on the road trip for a specific reason but for none of them it ends up the way they were hoping for. The movie acts as if it has an happy ending but once you really start thinking about it you could wonder to yourself what exactly is so happy about it.It's actually amazing to see how many big names appear in this movie. Granted that most of them weren't really big names yet at the time such as Zoe Saldana and Justin Long but still it makes you wonder how so many great actors ended up playing in this movie. It's probably all due to it that this was a Britney Spears vehicle and lots of people tried to ride in on the success and fame of her. But as it turned out this is not exactly a project that any of the people involved with could be very proud of.Not exactly the worst movies of all time not even close honestly but it still is far from a great or likable enough movie as well.410 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

You see I am a bad movie nutand I love laughing at the worst stuff Hollywood has to offer. And based on what I'd heard about this film I assumed it was simply dreadful...painfully dreadful in fact. However while I'd never in the least say it was a good film it wasn't that badand one of the brightest aspects of the film was actually Britney Spears as she COULD act and was very effective in her roleeven though it like the others was poorly written. And this is THE reason I'd say this isn't a very good film. While the acting and direction are pretty good the script is like a string of clichs all strung together and it's pure formulawith very very few surprises other than Spears' strong acting.The film is a coming of ageroad movie involving three young ladies who are mostly stereotypes and not real people. Britney plays an overachiever whose father plans on her going to medical school Britney...in medical school?!. Her other two friends are the stuckup Black girl...with sass and attitude as well as a more tomboyish girl. All three characters do improve and show SOME life through the course of the film but especially at the beginning they are like caricaturesnot people you could suspect are real in any way...at least not on this planet.But despite the awful writing and music videolike qualities of the film the overall concoction is pretty painless for what it is and isn't totally badhence my disappointment. I also should point out that although Miss Spears' target audience is the 1015 yearold age group the film is NOT familyfriendly in its dealing with sex. While some of the messages about sexuality are good and informative such as date rapethough they sure made this plot point a tiny bit too vague the rest seem to say well if you know a guy like for a week or so...um yeah like...you should do 'it'....for sure. Isn't this sweet?!".

In 2002 Britney Spears became yet another unfortunate statistic to the sad and growing tally of can'tact singers. Mauled by critics Crossroads became a box office disappointment and finally showed the world that an Oscar is nowhere in the near future for Mrs. Spears.Crossroads is definitely a stinker. The plot is so indescribably simplistic that a 6yr old could follow it. The element of Britney's character finding and confronting her AWOL mother is disastrously underdone. At other times the acting is downright ridiculous and has some of the most uninspired direction I've ever seen closeup medium shot closeup medium shot repeat 500 times. Judging from the lead actress Crossroads is a film aimed at the preteen crowd so naturally it should have content which is suitable for that age group. So you can imagine how shocked I was at the whole plot line of Lucy trying to loose her virginity to some loser the saga of her friend being raped by her other friend's fianc who gets pregnant and then has a miscarriage by taking a header down a flight of stairs! Yes this is all in the movie folks!However those saying it's the worst film of all time have really got to see more movies. This is because Crossroads is mildly amusing to follow despite it's Goliath sized flaws. I do admit I have a soft spot for the road trip genre and the quirkiness of several characters and their offbeat adventures kept me somewhat entertained in a vanilla state. But despite this Crossroads is not worth the DVD price. You're much better off using that money to see a better film currently in theatres.So next time you visit your local video rental place I advise you skip this one. It's simple and poorly made so it's really not worth your time. If it happens to be on cable you might be amused but I'm sure you'll find yourself changing the channel not long after it starts. 410".

And he was very accurate and he never saw the movie before if you watch it twice you have too much sparetime or heard anyone tell the story of it. The director should be shot the scripwriter should have his hands cut off and the producer should be put on a spaceshuttle and sent into outer space. Yes it's really that bad. Not the worst thing I've ever seen but then again this movie had a big budget which most of the really terrible movies don't have!It is as you might expect one big commercial for ms Spears. Nothing more nothing less. The storyline has some really strange glitches and happenings that are either confusing yet not or totally uncalled for. For  example when she seeks up her mother which left her Britney and her dad when she was 3 years old. Britney goes walking up the lawn and knocks on the door. Her mother opens and Britney says Hello mother it's me Lucy!' and her mother goes Oh come in!'. Very believable and real' reaction from a woman who's not seen her child for 15 years. She doesn't even seem surprised. That's just one example of the things that are quite bizarre and disturbing in this movie.This is actually a movie everyone should see. This is a perfect example of how not to do it. This is a movie which everyone should have their own opinion about.

My personal favoritesThis is Britney's actual dialogue during the emotional scene where her friend Mimi is pouring her heart out and telling her that she lost her baby and wanted to be a mother. Britney's lines during that scene Hey then Yeah followed by Okay and finally Yeah. I had to rewind and watch it again because it was so funny! There is also a very inappropriate part during this scene where Britney tries to touch Mimi to comfort her and then Mimi snaps back Don't touch me! Britney then deliveres that third line Okay.So much for editing When Mimi and Kit are walking up the stairs so Kit could see her college boyfriend Mimi stumbles delivering her line. At this point the director already gave up and was thinking God I hope I did not ruin my career by taking this project.Even the lip synching in the end where Brit is auditioning is so bad. Jeez I mean she could've at least sang LIVE! If she screwed up then they could just reshoot the scene.If you are studying film editing and screenwriting definitely rent this! You will be laughing out loud!I'm thinking minus all the scenes where they are singing along with the radio during the road trip the story would take 30 minutes.Overall this is good to rent if you're a person like me who every now and then likes to rent films to enjoy bad dialogue acting editing and directing.".

I first saw it as a child of eleven on the second half of a double bill with Little Big Man at a retro drivein in 1974.  This is exactly the type of film my parents would have walked out on in fifteen minutes since my Dad is a strict lawandorder type and likes films where there are good guys and bad guys and the good guys win.  Lucky for me this film played FIRST so they were stuck sitting through it.  I for one loved it because it was fastpaced and actionpacked and very violent and couldn't have cared less that everyone in it was a crook.  I still don't. It's one of my favorite films of the '70's and remains one I watch again and again.The Outside Man's plot is simple  A French hit man JeanLouis Trantignant travels to Los Angeles to kill a mobster.  Upon completion of his assignment he returns to his hotel to find he has been checked out and that his belongings wallet and passport included are gone.  Upon leaving the hotel he is ambushed by an American assassin played with icy menace by Roy Scheider a million miles from his Jaws sheriff who has obviously been hired to kill him.  After an exciting chase through the streets of L.A. and a brief respite in the apartment of a dippy widow and her smartaleck son The Mary Tyler Moore Show's Georgia Engel and a very young Jackie Earle Haley he contacts his boss and is told to find the boss's exmoll Nancy Robson AnnMargret.  He meets her in a topless bar and she agrees to help him get the hell out of Dodge.  This sets up a series of chases and shootouts as she tries to help him leave town while he dodges Scheider's bullets.Sure this film is at times as trashy as it sounds.  But it's also highly entertaining and has a top cast which also includes Angie Dickinson in the small role of the gangster's widow.  In spite of the fact that he's playing a coldblooded killer Trantignant actually elicits a certain amount of audience sympathy and the mostly silent Scheider who probably has five lines of dialog total is a hairraising villain.  Dickinson is appropriately shady and Engel at times very funny and touching as the victimized housewife.  And then there's the eyepopping AnnMargret who I believe filmed this before her nearfatal Vegas accident  Her plunging neckline blond wig and minidresses alone are worth the price of rental. Add at least two exciting extended chase sequences and a uniquely filmed shootout in a mortuary where the mobster has been embalmed in a sitting position cigar in hand and you have a highly entertaining melodrama in which everyone eventually gets their comeuppance.Allinall The Outside Man is a highly entertaining film lark from an era where films were actually distinguishable from each other and didn't all look like yesterday's recycled trash.   out of ".

	schema:headline " Decent little actioner";
	schema:reviewBody "that is the embodiment of the strippeddown lean hard look of LA 'noirinbroaddaylight' crime drama of the early 70's. Trintignant plays a 'shades of Camus' hitman who's imported from France to make a completely impersonal hit on an organized crime figure he does not know Scheider is the equally stony hitman hired to kill him I get a laugh out of the mental picture of these two actors probably having onset competitions to see which one could remain the most pokerfaced throughout the shoot. Tough call as to who'd win. AnnMargaret is fetching and somewhat pathetic as Trintignant's hooker exflame who puts herself in danger to protect him in spite of his apparent coldness and indifference to her Angie Dickinson is suitably icemaidish as the crime boss's widow who has her own hand involved in his murder and Alex Rocco is suitable sleazy as her lover and the boss's heir apparent. There are also some funny bits from Georgia Engel as a dippy housewife who manages to cross the paths of both hit men and wants to know aloud 'where the TV people are' when she gets questioned by the cops a second time and quick appearances by John Hillerman and Talia Shire. The ending is a particularly bleak 'nobody wins' scenario that smacks hard of French Existentialism in fact the film's whole chill sensibility makes it easy to spot the European influence. The old Venice Amusement Pier also makes an effective guest appearance in all its rotting glory.

	onyx:emotionText "that is the embodiment of the strippeddown lean hard look of LA 'noirinbroaddaylight' crime drama of the early 70's. Trintignant plays a 'shades of Camus' hitman who's imported from France to make a completely impersonal hit on an organized crime figure he does not know Scheider is the equally stony hitman hired to kill him I get a laugh out of the mental picture of these two actors probably having onset competitions to see which one could remain the most pokerfaced throughout the shoot. Tough call as to who'd win. AnnMargaret is fetching and somewhat pathetic as Trintignant's hooker exflame who puts herself in danger to protect him in spite of his apparent coldness and indifference to her Angie Dickinson is suitably icemaidish as the crime boss's widow who has her own hand involved in his murder and Alex Rocco is suitable sleazy as her lover and the boss's heir apparent. There are also some funny bits from Georgia Engel as a dippy housewife who manages to cross the paths of both hit men and wants to know aloud 'where the TV people are' when she gets questioned by the cops a second time and quick appearances by John Hillerman and Talia Shire. The ending is a particularly bleak 'nobody wins' scenario that smacks hard of French Existentialism in fact the film's whole chill sensibility makes it easy to spot the European influence. The old Venice Amusement Pier also makes an effective guest appearance in all its rotting glory. A pretty good film in its own right and if you're feeling a degree of nostalgia for the period the backgrounds make for a good dose of the era's look and feel.";

	schema:reviewBody "This had all the makings for a first rate international crime action drama. There is a good premise of a hitman agreeing to off a powerful crime boss to pay off a debt only to discover it was a setup with himself marked for death a firstrate cast a Shaftinspired score by Oscarwinning composer Michel Legrand and excellent location photography which captures the Los Angeles landscape. So why doesn't this film work? For one thing it never settles on a tone and it swerves between character study to crime drama and doesn't have enough of either. The character being studied is impossible to care about anyway the crime aspects are never fully explored and most the action scenes are mostly ordinary. Even the climactic shootout isn't all that exciting in spite of happening in a clever location. The result is that the film is usually depressing. There are a few good scenes and the cast is more than up to the task. However most of the actors are given little to do. In the lead the great French actor Jean Louis Trintignant does little more than glower or sulk making this one of his less memorable performances. Ann Margaret is beautiful but her role is merely set decoration. Georgia Engel steals the show as a ditsy housewife who innocently gets caught up in the double cross and violence but she doesn't have that large of a role. The truth is she's the only person who evokes any sympathy with everyone else being either a vicious criminal an inept cop or an apathetic bystander. That wasn't an unusual situation in 1970's crime dramas but it doesn't make for exciting viewing. Some people like this movie a lot so if you're really interested judge for yourself but don't complain if you were also disappointed.".

Now that I have seen as much of The Outside Man as I could stomach I'm baffled by these other responses.What some film buffs will accept in the name of nostalgia for a Lost LA knows no bounds. If this movie were set in some other place no one would ever give it hisher time. It is shot like a TV movie I'm not entirely convinced that it was not a TV movie given the number of TV actors who appear. It is very very poorly written acted and directed. Shoddy even. The dialogue is stiff but not even stiff in a clipped noirish way or in a way that could provide camp value. The actors are so wooden that they often wait an extra beat and glance off camera before delivering their responses to one another. The editing is absurd.The film boils down to a series of vignettes involving our alienated French hitman encountering and negotiating LA scenesthe boring housewife the biker gang the jesusfreak the 'tough' blonde hooker etc. None of these scenes connects with any other in any significant way. They're all just slices of life in 'gritty' LA but shot in such a fake way that there is nothing whatsoever of 'the real' about them.Of course I'm not really qualified to speak about the movie as a whole because I walked out. I have now walked out of a grand total of 3 movies in my life. I felt so liberated when I left though that it almost made watching the first half an hour or 45 minutes worth it. Perhaps for many people the nostalgia factor overrides these critiques. I understand nostalgia for old LA too but for a city that was in fact entirely different than the LA of today such as the one portrayed in Mildred Pierce say. This movie however focuses on LA as a hip modern city with rivers of freeways and 6lane boulevards swamped with traffic. How different this is from today's LA is unclear to me. Sure one can look at this film and say Gee I remember when that club was still open or Oh I loved that old pier. But these feelings run entirely counter to what this film says about LA that it doesn't care about people's sentimental attachments to particular places and things so get out of the way or become part of the pavement. Let's face it post1950 or so LA became a city defined by rapid change of plowing under the old so the young citizens of today can make their mark. Of course pockets of 'old LA' still remain and always will not everything can get plowed under as efficiently as late capitalism would like. This notion of change defines LA. However some people cling to nostalgia for a particular era even if it runs counter to what LA was 30 years ago and is today. This is a typical American set of actions and sentiments destroy what is in order to bring on something new glorify this destruction and change while it's happening regret that we have brought about this change once it has been effected build monuments to that which we have destroyed lovingly remember that which has passed because it seems to come from a more innocent time rebuke ourselves for ever thinking that we should have destroyed what was repeat.I swear in a few years people are going to be saying things like I really miss that pocked old parking lot that surrounded the Cinerama Dome.".

Ann Margaret is a nude dancer with a heart of gold who helps Trintignant acquire a passport to return to France.Trintignant's character is in a state of disarray and he is reticent to American culture while he is on the run  he meets bikers a Jesus freak and a single mom and her kid with whom he shares a TV dinner. The TV dinner scene was quite good but the scenes with the Jesus freak and the bikers were poorly written.The two females in the film  Ann Margaret and Angie Dickinson are used as sex objects. There are many nude scenes including a pretty erotic nude lesbian dance inside a bar. The dancer's bodies were painted white! Michel Constantin being dragged by a funeral car across a lawn animates a dreary movie and a ridiculous shootout at the mafioso's funeral.The parts were better than the sum. Even though it is an English language film the film has a French feel to it. Maybe you were aiming for a Melville atmosphere Jacques. But Michel Le Grand's loud funky score the gaudy locales and the poor writing ruined your ambitious project.Best Regards Pimpin.610".
