It's therefore also best to watch these 3 movies in a row to appreciate it best. All 3 movies closely follow each other in which the first movie is being really used as a movie to set up things while this second movie is mostly being used to build up to its climax that will occur in the third movie.This time the movie flows better because the story gets used better as well. Like mentioned earlier the first movie was still being mostly a setup movie for the series. In this movie we actually get to see more epic moments and fights as it follows the further travels of Musashi Miyamoto on his way to become a masterswordsman. Its story and different characters all work out nicely as things also gets developed more with its drama and romance.There are a couple of really great fight sequences of course mostly featuring Toshir Mifune. It makes the movie often exciting to watch as does the overall look for the movie. The movie benefits from its beautiful natural environments as well as some nicely done studio work. Using color wasn't quite that common yet for '50's Japanese cinema since it was quite costly and not as advanced yet as in the western world. However color had always worked out nicely for these three movies and it helps to make the movie a really great looking one. You also have to give credit for this to the movie its cinematography done by Jun Yasumoto who strangely enough worked on just the first two movies but didn't shot the third and final one.A movie that really has everything in it.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It is the second part of the trilogy about Japan's most famous and arguably greatest swordsman Miyamoto Musashi author of the book Five rings. Mifune is again superb as the lone wolf hero who is torn between his love to the orphan girl Otsu and his own samurai call. Koji Tsuruta was unknown to me before this and was a pleasant surprise as the charming ambitious and cunning Kojiro Sasaki who later becomes Musashi's principal rival. Daisuke Kato one of the Seven Samurai makes a fun appearance as one of the most loathsome characters in the movie and the trilogy.The actresses playing Akemi and Otsu were quite impressive as well.Hiroshi Inagaki was a highly capable director and proves that clearly here. His attempt to cross swordfighting action with melodrama works very well. The photography is excellent and is one of the real treats of this movie. The scenery was even more spectacular in the third film but here it doesn't disappoint either. The ending might disappoint those waiting for a happy end and to see Musashi and Otsu get together at last. It is a bit of a letdown but it also makes you more eager to see the third and final part. There is nothing to criticize here those who do are missing the point and shouldn't have seen the film in the first place.1010".

Musashi is set up to choose between the way of the sword or love for the girl Otsu while having to face his nemesis foreshadowed for the closing chapter. What puts me off this second chapter which I rate the lowest of the three is that we had a set of characters in the first film and suddenly we have another set of characters. The film revolves around his feud with the Yoshioki school.So in a way this loose narrative foreshadows the third chapter. As it emerges in this second film the film is not one long epic split in three parts. Neither is each of these first two films selfenclosed. The narrative is a loose stitching together of episode and digress thrust and feint in many directions observant viewers will notice the same in the elliptical shooting mode.I will not say more about this as a film since we are still halfway there instead let's look at some context around the film here on the fluidity of self.This is a core precept of Buddhism which features prominently in the films Musashi receives key lessons by monks his journey is one of selfrealization internal abating of ego.This fluidity is seen in the transmission and establishment of Buddhism in Japan over several hundred years through several attempts several travels of Japanese monks in China. Both notable Zen schools in Japan were initiated by monks of the Tendai sect who had been to China. The film's main two centerpieces take place outside Buddhist temples one is referenced in the title the other is Sanjusangendo both belonging to Tendai. The Sanjusangendo a marvelous structure is also famous for housing one thousand and one statues of the thousand armed Kannon the boddhisatva of compassion. The little wooden statuette that Musashi is seen carving in spots is of Kannon.Now simply saying that the self is illusory sounds weird metaphysical or philosophical at best. Buddhists have many of the same lofty words as we do about 'void' and 'self' but whereas we're accustomed to theoretical construction and analytical philosophy we love words in the West they resort to words as a last means of describing a practicealso evident in Musashi's own writings where he stresses experiential appreciation.So when they say 'void' they don't mean a generality but something which can be felt has been felt as one feels the temperature of water. When they say 'self' they mean when a single thought arises while you're washing the dishes.It's a pain in the ass to talk of it because how can you say exactly how warm it is? It either is to you or isn't. Stick your hand in. Zen Masters as well as Musashi whose 'Way of strategy' is Zenflavored knew this which is why they loved paradox urged silence or beat and kicked their students when they asked logical questions. The point is to know for yourself. A similar thing happens to Musashi in the first film when he is tied by a Zen monk from a tree a fictional event.This monk Takuan existed though his interactions with Musashi in the film are fiction presumably he did know Musashi. He wrote on this business of illusion and nonself using sword metaphors because the writings were intended for Yagyu Munenori sword instructor to three shoguns and with Musashi the most famous swordsman in his day. Munenori briefly appears in the third film.Munenori and Musashi both wrote books with background in all this. Both are still being widely read in the martial arts and business worlds by people looking for insights on real or metaphorical war.Musashi's first four books comprise technique and strategy. The last one and shortest Book of the Void which is held in separate esteem probably because of the portentous title is where Musashi speaks of the Zen void as deeper principleit should be the most interesting but isn't Musashi's practical conveyance falls short. No it's the books on strategy that deserve study once you look past handtohand combat at least for our purposes here.Suffice to say both Zen and Musashi urge direct observation of mind instead of general reasoning. Suffice to say from the perspective of Zen a Kannon statue is no more sacred than the piece of wood it was carved from. And that the act of carving is the manifestation of self this can be practically observed in the carved imageis it sloppy elegant? This is important. So neither spoken word nor teachings in a book nor sacred image nor Zen or not Zen but observation of the mind behind. I'm going to wrap this in the third post.".

The first film titled simply Musashi Miyamoto introduces us to the characters of this and the third film.  Without having seen the first film and developing some interest in the welfare of the characters I certainly wouldn't have sat through the second and third films.Duel at Ichijoji Temple this film deals with Musashi's exploits as a sort of samurai knighterrant seeking glory in a very ambiguous and roundabout way.  Two women are trailing after him as Kurosawa films would say like goldfish dung.  Musashi himself is a flat character on whom Toshiro Mifune's acting skills are wasted.  He displays very little emotion or intellect despite his supposed interest in one of the women and enlightening education by his monk teacher as we saw in the first film.If Musashi is flat the female characters are steamrolled.  Their hand wringing collapsing and sobbing is typical of American movies of this time period and grows tedious in a samurai film.  Having seen other films from this time period set in the days of samurai I've seen that much more can be done with female characters.  The plot was likewise predictable and slowmoving.If you don't care about characters or plot the high points of the movie may compensate beautiful color landscapes and Toshiro Mifune's thrilling fight scenes.  Otherwise I recommend films by Kurosawa or Mizoguchi Sanjuro the mysterious Ugetsu over this trilogy.  510".

	schema:reviewBody "This comment about the Samurai Trilogy starts on the page for Miyamoto Musashi Samurai I. My first viewing of the second episode was memorable because I got to take the train into town all by myself and view it in a Tokyo theater. The first episode had just been shown on base in a sort of cultural exchange and my parents saw it and were pleasantly nonoutraged I was a 9yearold samuraimovie addict and they believed enthusiasm beyond a certain intensity should be curbed. It was the same conflict as comic books some few years earlier. Technicolor was a big deal back then especially in Japan and it became the issue on which my viewing of swordfighting movies was decided the ones in color were historical films worth viewing and even had something to teach. The blackandwhite ones shown in Irumagawa and surrounding villages I had to sneak off to see. Ichijoji no Ketto Duel at Ichijoji Temple shows Miyamotosan's achievements while barring no holds on the issue of what they cost him. The romantic subplot continues though its development in the western sense toward union wedded bliss is thwarted at every turn. The issue is always a conflict between love and duty and each deferment of gratification spells out a new step in the redefinition of the national character that is being mapped here. Again some of the importance of all this is lost even to modern Japanese audiences for whom the issues are long settled at the time though they were cliffhangers. A new character is introduced Kojiro Sasaki who will emerge in part 3 as a rival for Musashi his equal except for certain features in their respective character. By the way the score is excellent and haunting it extends like a symphony through all three parts and has a leitmotif hook that will cause your ears to pick up in recognition perhaps years from now when you hear it again.".

But considering how strong the movie began and how it finished even stronger it is natural that there was a lull in the middle. It reminds me of the Empire Strikes Backcertainly not as exciting at the first Star Wars picture they made and not as satisfying as the conclusion because nothing was particularly resolved in the flick.This movie concerns the transformation of Mifune from a young samurai warrior to a COMPLETE samurai. In other words he is learning that there is more to being a samurai than just being able to beat others in combat. Exactly what this ideal samurai is to be seems uncertain however Mifune is convinced by the end of the movie that there is no room on this path for the beautiful and ever faithful Ostu. Poor Otsu! It is important to note that these movies were made nearly 50 years ago and existing copies on DVD are in poor conditionwith fading and sepia tones instead of the vibrant original. This became VERY apparent when I saw the beginning of the 3rd film. The color was nearly perfect for the initial scene and that is great as it's a beautiful and extremely artistic shot. At times throughout the movie some of the scenes are once again vivid while others are faded and lose their impact. You can't blame the film for that but you wish Criterion would try to digitally enhance the prints they've got to improve the colors and get rid of some scratchy cels.".

With Japan's greatest actor playing one of Japan's greatest folk heroes how could you miss ? Well the first one was flat. The pace was slow and Mifune's exploding energy was kept well under control. Shame ! This second instalment corrected many of the problems of the first. The action is staged much better with one caveat  see below Mifune gets to be ferocious as well as express a range of other emotions including something close to love. The story is a bit disorienting as it shows events in a different order to the 1960s series but it still works well. The women throw themselves at our hero at a much faster rate which gets things moving along nicely.Nevertheless I have marked down this movie significantly for the incredible stupidity of setting most of the action scenes in the dark. Director what were you thinking ?! Instead of having the duels at six in the morning move them to seven or use a moonlit night. Hell what a waste.".

This is a film about personal growth  specifically that of the samurai himself who struggles to learn the key concepts of what his new life actually entails and where the rift lies between honor and reverence. We're never quite sure if Musashi takes this lesson to heart particularly since he's so keen to maintain an impenetrable outer facade in almost every situation.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Duel at Ichijoji Temple";
	schema:reviewBody "Being the middle film of a trilogy Duel at Ichijoji Temple thankfully came with a lot more battle sequences than the first film and had more finesse in its swordplay since our legendary heroic character Takezo Toshiro Mifune is now a skilled swordsman but yet to put into practice many aspects of Bushido and often criticized in the manner in which he finishes off his opponents because of his innate brute strength and force.But I guess when you're top dog criticism comes part and parcel and in his warrior pilgrimage in discovery of skill and self we see how he further develops though at time I felt that the story utilized a cheat sheet just like the first film where priest Takuan Kuroemon Onoe locked him in a castle with plenty of books. Here while Takezo is in hiding he spends plenty of time indoors under the patronage of Lady Yoshino Michiyo Kogure a courtesan who would inculcate some compassion into the gruff man's life  while he looks refined on the outside his ambition and reputation continue to earn him no favours especially since he had issued a challenge to the Yoshioka School.As a middle film it expanded the mythology and further developed the characters who made teasing appearances in the first one. For instance the young man who was smitten by Akemi Mariko Okada turns out to be none other than the leader of the Yoshioka School Seijuro Yoshioka Akihiro Hirata who in a fit of envy began to violate Akemi taking his ineptness onto a helpless girl. Such are incidents that make the character a little revolting and the members of his school showcased to be nothing more than mere bullies to the townsfolk as well as constantly sucking up to Seijuro by shielding his incompetence from the real world.The villains in this installment turn out to be more formidable than the thugs and brigands that Takezo had to deal with earlier. In fact the first duel was a battle with an opponent using a chainandsickle in compensation for the lack of a swordfight as a climax in the first film. Unfortunately I found this to be mildly exciting as the full screen presentation only allowed for that fatal blow to be delivered off screen. The middle duel with Denshichiro Yoshioka was also somewhat of a let down given the buildup because it only allowed a brief clashing of the weapons before director Hiroshi Inagaki decided to cut away to a song! It felt like a little shortchange though the result of the match was made known indirectly later.And the expansion of the characters here only made the story richer. Familiar faces like Takezo's lover Otsu Kaoru Tachigusa returns to pine a lot more for him after 3 years of waiting while her exfianc Matahachi Sachio Sakai degenerates worse in character into a good for nothing liar and a cheat married to Akemi's scheming mom Oko Mitsuko Mito. We also get introduced to sword polisher Hanomi Ko Mihashi who's supposed to play an influential role in swaying Takezo's mindset though the narrative here didn't allow too much of that on screen deflecting it towards Lady Yoshino for yet another romantic entanglement where the female characters are all weak in their knees in Takezo's manly presence.But the most important character introduced in the film would be Kojiro Sasaki Koji Tsuruta the eventual nemesis of Takezo's but you've got to wait until the next film to see them do battle. Here Kojiro's like the predator slowly studying and stalking his prey. We know little of his background apart from his certification of swordsmanship and his cool collected demeanour as opposed to Takezo's brash emotions so that already sets him up to be mile apart as a strong adversary in time to come. So far he has played things in quite a gentlemanly way refusing to take cheap shortcuts patiently and probably egoistically waiting for Takezo to attain more skills before bringing down a powerful opponent.Again the technical aspects of this DVD presentation left much to be desired especially in the night or dawn battle scenes. It's not digitally remastered so these scenes become really dark and marred the enjoyment of many outdoor fights especially the titular one where Takezo goes up against 80 opponents and learns for a start that evading battle may not be so bad an option especially when one is severely outnumbered due to a sickening dishonourable scheme to turn tables. I would have wished for a better presentation so that it would not detract your attention to pops and cackles or unintentional hues to come and stain the picture quality.Duel at Ichijoji Temple ended just like how it began with Takezo continuing his journey to seek bushidoenlightenment. It wrapped up some of the life journeys and lessons learnt by the protagonist in this episode and sets it all up for the climax to be in the last installment of the trilogy.".

In fact the first duel was a battle with an opponent using a chainandsickle in compensation for the lack of a swordfight as a climax in the first film. Unfortunately I found this to be mildly exciting as the full screen presentation only allowed for that fatal blow to be delivered off screen. The middle duel with Denshichiro Yoshioka was also somewhat of a let down given the buildup because it only allowed a brief clashing of the weapons before director Hiroshi Inagaki decided to cut away to a song! It felt like a little shortchange though the result of the match was made known indirectly later.And the expansion of the characters here only made the story richer. Familiar faces like Takezo's lover Otsu Kaoru Tachigusa returns to pine a lot more for him after 3 years of waiting while her exfianc Matahachi Sachio Sakai degenerates worse in character into a good for nothing liar and a cheat married to Akemi's scheming mom Oko Mitsuko Mito. We also get introduced to sword polisher Hanomi Ko Mihashi who's supposed to play an influential role in swaying Takezo's mindset though the narrative here didn't allow too much of that on screen deflecting it towards Lady Yoshino for yet another romantic entanglement where the female characters are all weak in their knees in Takezo's manly presence.But the most important character introduced in the film would be Kojiro Sasaki Koji Tsuruta the eventual nemesis of Takezo's but you've got to wait until the next film to see them do battle. Here Kojiro's like the predator slowly studying and stalking his prey. We know little of his background apart from his certification of swordsmanship and his cool collected demeanour as opposed to Takezo's brash emotions so that already sets him up to be mile apart as a strong adversary in time to come. So far he has played things in quite a gentlemanly way refusing to take cheap shortcuts patiently and probably egoistically waiting for Takezo to attain more skills before bringing down a powerful opponent.Again the technical aspects of this DVD presentation left much to be desired especially in the night or dawn battle scenes. It's not digitally remastered so these scenes become really dark and marred the enjoyment of many outdoor fights especially the titular one where Takezo goes up against 80 opponents and learns for a start that evading battle may not be so bad an option especially when one is severely outnumbered due to a sickening dishonourable scheme to turn tables. I would have wished for a better presentation so that it would not detract your attention to pops and cackles or unintentional hues to come and stain the picture quality.Duel at Ichijoji Temple ended just like how it began with Takezo continuing his journey to seek bushidoenlightenment. It wrapped up some of the life journeys and lessons learnt by the protagonist in this episode and sets it all up for the climax to be in the last installment of the trilogy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hiroshi Inagaki's 19541956 three part color film The Samurai Trilogy is unlike many filmic trilogies for the very fact that it is indeed one exactly five hour long film and not three separate linked films for the first two films have no real endings. In this way it has much in common with The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. However whereas those three are separate films more or less their source work is not. Yes J.R.R. Tolkien's book is often printed in three separate volumes but it is one work. This three part film is also derived from one singular literary work from Eiji Yoshikawa's 1935 novel Musashi loosely based upon the real life 17th Century Japanese folk hero the samurai Musashi Miyamoto who penned a classic book called The Book Of Five Rings. That all stated the landscapes of Japan and sheer numbers of extras in this film are far more impressive visually than the CG crap that the Lord Of The Rings films spewed. Overall The Samurai Trilogy is a good film but while the narrative story gets better and tighter with each succeeding film the visual quality of each succeeding film worsens on The Criterion Collection's three disks both in the original film stock and the poor transfers.If nothing else this film The Samurai Trilogy can be seen as a sort of training ground for the great Toshiro Mifune to try out and perfect a wide range of acting styles and characters within character that he would unleash on the film lovers of the world throughout the rest of his career be it in his films with Kurosawa or long after. And if a film can be said to have allowed something like that to happen then its merits are certainly more than its flaws melodramatic or not. But even on top of that a film like this acts as a sort of entre into the greater and deeper art put out by the aforementioned masters and allows those great works of art to be more greatly appreciated for contrast can clarify what the mists of the ineffable do not. In such a spirit thank you sensei Inagaki.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second installment opens up with a duel. Musashi arrives at a sight early at dawn and encounters a stubborn young child. The opening samurai duel sets the stage for artistic well choreographed fights with a high level of suspense. Musashi is immediately put down by a wandering Zen monk who says that he is still too wild to be considered a true samurai thus begins the balancing act and spiritual transformation of Musashi.In this film we see the tragedy of Matahachi in his relationship fleshed out. In addition the love triangle between Akemi Otsu and Musashi continues. Musashi wants to make a name for himself and ends up seeking out the master of the Yoshioka clan for a duel. The students of the master continue to try to ambush and kill off Musashi. We meet a new character that will be more fully developed in the third movie Kojiro Sasaki. Kojiro is a ronin as well seeking out to become the best samurai of the land. He is interested in Musashi's growth as a legend so that he can face him off later and gain an even greater reputation.The film is shot at 1331 aspect ratio which creates shots with greater depth within the composition. The position and use of the camera is done masterfully. One of the most memorable scenes is when Musashi leads his gang of attackers into the muddy rice fields. It creates great tension and memorable fights. Inagaki is also very skillful in setting up great scenes like a duel with snow falling and then cutting to another simple scene that takes place after the fight. He teases the audience and leaves it wanting for more.One of the most surprising aspects of the film is how forward the female characters are portrayed. They are not simple obedient women but have strong personalities and own their sexuality. Toshiro Mifune plays the character flawlessly and displays his commanding presence as a skilled swordsman that is later perfected within the great Kurosawa films.".

The disjointedness of the first movie is even more noticeable here. There are a lot of characters and subplots and characters that don't really go anywhere. Much of the movie is laughably absurd such as the way women fall at their feet over the rather bland protagonist Mifune isn't nearly as memorable in these films as in his Kurosawa movies and the determination of the students of a fighting school have in protecting their master at the expense of his reputation makes little sense especially as Musashi keeps mowing them down.The whole lookingforpeopletokill premise seems a bit weird as well in American westerns it's usually the bad guys who keep picking fights. And the rather standard there's more to being a Samurai than killing message seems murky it's no wonder Musashi takes so long to get it.Some of this may just be cultural with tropes that make sense to the Japanese. But I can't see any way to excuse the use of master swordsman Sasaki. He's a really interesting character well acted by Koji Tsuruta but the whole movie is his just happening to be in the right place at the right time and it's an incredibly lazy screen writing crutch.As in the previous movie the sympathetic Otsu and women in general are treated by dirt even by those who care about them. That may be accurate but it's also depressing.Visually the film is striking and the combat scenes are well done and pretty entertaining but overall this movie is poorly structured and generally absurd.".

Mike Nichols' first directing effort is stunning in its lack of artifice rarely do you feel that the director has done much more than turn on the camera and watch four actors all at the top of their game tear into their roles. George Segal's work in this movie is criminally underrated but his reactive work as studly ultimately disappointing Nick should be mandatory study by all young actors. Sandy Dennis' fluttery turn as mousy wifey Honey is powerful also a lot more is going on than you might think. Richard Burton is staggering as George Georgie Porgie Putupon Pie and his performance demonstrates the magic that he could bring to a worthy role. Elizabeth Taylor's work here still astounds. The physical transformation she undertook to become aging harpy Martha is amazing enough but her performance seems to channel a hurricane's force and fury. By turns hilarious maddening and then at the end exhausted and defeated yet again Taylor demonstrates acting particularly film acting at its best. The film is by no means easy or Hollywood in feel the audience is as exhausted as the characters at the end.

	schema:headline " That's what comes from too much alcohol and too few mutual respect";
	schema:reviewBody "'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' tells the story of two couples that are quite different at first sight  one used to each other for years the other one rather freshly wed in comparison. Actually it doesn't tell their story but it displays their relationships. The film begins on a Sunday morning at 2 o'clock right after a party and ends just after the sun rises. In these few hours we get to know these four people better then we might possibly want. George and Martha are the older couple. He is a history professor she is the daughter of the head of the university. Their relationship seems to be from hell full of mutual disgust and humiliation. Their guests are Nick and Honey. He is the new ambitious biology professor she is his naive young wive. As all these four characters are more or less drunk throughout the entire film alcohol works as a catalyst and we quickly see the different kind of character traits they have George is a cynic Martha loves to torment her husband Nick is an opportunist and Honey is very much a stupid blonde. The two relationships deserve closer examination We wonder why Martha and George married in the first place. They keep swearing at each other. Martha can't stop humiliating George when they are alone as well as when Nick and Honey are there. Maybe there is still a rest of love in them but there mutual respect has vanished completely. And then there is the strange story of their son who is supposed to visit on his birthday. They way George and Martha talk about him make us feel that there is something peculiar about him. At the end we get to know more about him and we can only guess how important the son is for their relationship. Nick and Honey on the other hand seem to be quite the opposite. But being used as weapons by the older couple we see that their relationship isn't as perfect as it seems to be either. Nick didn't marry Honey because he loved her but because he thought she was pregnant and because of her money. And when Martha tries to seduce him to tease George he plays the game with her always in mind that this woman's father is the head of the university. Honey on the other hand is much more emotional than her husband but she also is the most passive character and the one most affected by the alcohol. Mike Nichols assembled an outstanding cast for his film. Casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George is a stroke of genius  not only are they terrific actors but it also heats the imagination of the viewer how much their reallifemarriage resembled the relationship they had in this film. Elizabeth Taylor outshines her costars a little. Never was she any better than in this one although her character is the meanest in the film she manages that we still feel compassion for her at the end. But Richard Burton George Segal and especially Sandy Dennis deliver memorable performances too. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' succeeds at something rather difficult It makes us care for characters we wouldn't want to have anything to do with in real life. And although it actually consist of nothing but four people talking for two hours it never bored us for a second.".

It's a dramatic film but the wicked humour that permeates the film is absolutely devastating and I mean that in the best possible way. Many moments in the film I find myself laughing only to think Should I be laughing at this. Certainly the film is loaded with uncomfortable moments enhanced by the camerawork replete with uneasy closeups. Most of all this film shows how a lot can be accomplished with just a little a cast of four and minimal scenery changes. Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf has become an absolute icon of American cinema.

Also this movie only contains a couple of locations so the whole project depends almost entirely on these two actors superb performance.

	schema:reviewBody "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf leaves no scabs or stones unturned with the characters. George and Martha are a couple who have a marriage that is truly lovehate. They can never be called too unemotional though to say whether or not they're being truthful at all in the 'games' they play with married Nick and Honey is a little trickier. Martha invited them at her father's insistence he IS the chairman of the university where George and Nick are professors at two in the morning for a quick drink. Or rather make that many drinks like chain drinking if one could call it that where George and Martha prove themselves as pros in that area with bitter slinging of enraged bouts of bile at one or the other. This goes on the rest of the night also leading to a roadhouse on the way to drive a flustered Nick and hammered Honey home and then it starts all over again with Nick and Honey picking up the tortured and as well fractured personalities of this middleaged couple. Bitter enraptured hateful and in a way also sort of filling a void George and Martha become two of the most powerful characters in modern drama.Edward Albee's play is full of the kind of stinging dialog that made it controversial in the 1960s and today it still retains its potential for hitting its characters on to the audience in a shockingly overwrought and in connection with this very funny manner. How can one not cringe and give a laugh of reliefperplexity when George goes to get a shotgun after getting po'd by Martha and then opening it up to everyone's shock as... an umbrella! There's a dementia to these characters but it's one that makes for the kind of drama that is lacerating and as offputting as the guessing game that the son element becomes in the equation dead or not dead? it somehow works. This was before most dramas of today which are made with that big colossal twist that suddenly jolts the characters into perspective. Here it just makes them more human and fallible and deconstructed. As Mike Nichols directs it he doesn't shy from getting personal with his angles close and intrinsic as in a weird way comparable with Bergman's Persona also released that year.What Nichols and Albee present for audiences is a logical next step following other plays from before them that broke ground from the likes of Miller Beckett and especially Williams it's more adult or rather more for mature audiences the first quasi rated R movie ever released and it hits to a cynical nerve that was further gestating by this time in America that everything would not be alright in the American marriage that something as Martha says will SNAP! It should also be mentioned acting here is classic fearless. Burton and Taylor have rarely been as good as they are at digging so deep into these characters that especially with Burton we can't imagine these people being anyone else. It takes a little to get used to Segal and Sandy Dennis the latter because her character isn't quite as deep as the others but then again their characters are the uncomfortable outsiders us as one might say however as the play peels the layers away from the characters they're all rotten and ultimately very vulnerable instead of just normal.It packs a punch it jiggles its little glass full of bourbon or brandy or gin and as a first feature from its director it could only get better from here. It's a dangerously fun dangerously emotionally violent picture. Will look forward to seeing it next time it's on TV".

Now according to the film it's because of the death of their son but they would have been terrible people regardlessthey truly despise each other and themselves. Then as if an afterthought some guests arrive and actually stay and watch as this couple destroy each other right in front of them. And so the newcomers get drunk and the drunks get drunker. Wow...now THAT'S fun! Then tongues loosen some more and a lot of unpleasantness results.Sure having worked with alcoholics I understand that Taylor and Burton did an excellent job here. But for a twohour plus film it's an endurance contest I don't wish to do again. So the overall verdict is that it's well made but thoroughly awful. If you can endure and appreciate this fine.

	schema:reviewBody "Although Elizabeth Taylor's acting performance is excellent with the exception of a few instances of overacting I didn't enjoy this film. I thoroughly disliked the characters and the screenplay. It's a difficult task sitting through a movie this depressing and boring. I had to watch it in two sittings.The two main characters are uninteresting crude gloomy people whose dismal lives are engineered by their own dismal personalities. It held a morbid interest to me for about the first 2025 minutes but then got very old very quickly. Regarding story as far as I'm concerned there was none. The entire movie takes place during a single unbearable evening in which a new young teacher and his wife visit an unhappy unsuccessful drunken obnoxious middleaged couple of a college history department. As liquor flows the elder couple proceeds to tell the young couple the boring story of their miserable discontented personal lives including dirty laundry in a lengthy vulgar drunken loud argument. No plot no moral no endearing qualities. One descriptive adverb for this film is over overdramatic overacted and mostly overirritating another word that comes to mind is dumb and another is vulgar. The dialog of this movie is just a stream of vulgar sarcasm spewed by gloomy characters. Not my cup of tea. It gets a rating of 4 from me only because of the acting the other three actors performances were also quite good and the good film production.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard for me to accept a film as perfect. This is partly because of IMDb  the movie ranked highest on the Top 250 list 'The Godfather' has a mere 9.0 meaning there is ten points worth of things wrong with even the best film ever made. What IMDb voters fail to realize is that if a movie has an intention  a purpose  and it serves that purpose effortlessly and hits every note that it's supposed to hit without even the remotest hint of an off key it is perfect by its own right and therefore worthy of a ten out of ten. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is one of those movies.The plot is ecstatically simple a troubled married couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton has a younger and  we assume  happier couple George Segal and Sandy Dennis over late at night for quick drinks. The reason for the get together is that Martha's Taylor father runs the university where George Burton and Nick Segal work and the father told them to 'be nice' to the younger couple so Martha invited them over for a late party. Like I said the plot is simple but the characters are so deep and complex it'd take a whole lot more than 1000 words to describe them correctly but I'll try with what I got.The film starts with George and Martha coming home from a late party. Both are drunk Martha is a loud and obnoxious drunk but George just has a headache and Martha constantly berates George when he fails to come up with the name of the Bette Davis movie she's thinking of and dozens other reasons. It's early in the movie so we don't know if her insults are for real or if they're just a way of being playful with her husband. George acts to stone faced that we can't tell if he's being hurt or played with.It's when Nick and Honey Sandy Dennis come over that we get to really see how George feels. Martha insults him calls him names yells at him while Nick and Sandy look on baffled as to whether they should laugh or not. As the insults keep on coming George's anger and hurt grow and the tensions reach a high when he takes a rifle from the closet points it at Martha and fires. But surprise! It's just a toy with an umbrella that shoots out of the barrel.As the movie goes on the characters get drunker angrier and some painful secrets are revealed and the actors never lose focus. Burton is sort of disintegrating in front of our eyes both physically and emotionally from the drink and his wife. He starts off rigid and unbreakable but soon turns cruel and sadistic while still keeping his sort of suave charming personality.Taylor won an Oscar for playing Martha and it was an Oscar well deserved. At the beginning she looks like the most vile unlikable character but as thick layers are torn away we get to see the hurt and pain her character feels from years of berating George. She loves him she says but she doesn't deserve him because of how horrible she is. She doesn't want to be happy but she does at the same time. We feel for this woman because she is a person not a caricature of a drunken wife. From when we first see him we know that there is more to Nick than meets the eye. He seems in a way sort of ashamed and embarrassed of his goofy wife and doesn't put up much of a fight when Martha makes advances on him  right in front of Honey's eyes. Of course he's not just the clichd hotshot character of so many movies either. He has an agenda he feels he needs to use to further his career but he doesn't like using it. He says early that he doesn't like to get involved in other's problems and gets increasingly awkward and uncomfortable as the movie progresses. Nick also thinks he's the only sane one in the whole house even insulting his own wife.Sandy Dennis' Honey seems like the smallest character of the film but her work is in the background. Watch the movie twice and focus only on her the second time. She reacts she is always the character who's reacting never in control. And she has the hard task of acting like a drunken moron for the majority of the film a task that she excels at. But she only appears as an idiot she knows what's going on around her but she denies it and tries to act like a playful child to rid herself of the horribleness that's happening. None of this is spoken of course but we see it in her face. She won her Oscar for the movie too and deserved it.This is a horrifying film of the dangers of the lies we tell ourselves with other themes too like alcoholism and marriage. It is a perfect film. Few have reached this equality of tragedy drama suspense and dark comedy. A recommendation to all no one could turn away this film.1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edward Albee's award winning play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ran for 664 performances on Broadway and just closed down when this film version made its debut in 1966. The Broadway play was set entirely in the living room of George and Martha's home and starred Uta Hagen Arthur Hill Melinda Dillon and George Grizzard. All eminently respectable players but none of them exactly movie box office.This film was destined to make money when the most publicized couple of the decade Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton chose it as a star vehicle for themselves. Of course what was not clear was how well a one stage play would adapt to film.It adapted very well and went quite beyond one stage. The action of the film moved effortlessly to an all night diner at one point with some stops along the way. You'd hardly know the story as originally told only had one setting.There's no real plot to it. For reasons I can't fathom this middle aged and bitter couple George and Martha have a younger couple Nick and Honey over to their house at two in the morning. I don't know about you but I'm usually not my best at that time. Also they had just come from a party at Martha's father's house. Martha's dad is the president of a college and George teaches there. Nick and Honey are a newly hired professor and his wife.The late night and the liquor bring out the worst in everybody. A whole lot of ugly truths get told.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was the summit of the professional team of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Playing against type Elizabeth Taylor got her second Oscar the one she felt she earned. She always disparaged the one received for Butterfield 8 as it came on the heels of her well publicized pneumonia bout.In fact all four members of the cast were nominated with Sandy Dennis winning Best Supporting Actress. Ironically Richard Burton didn't win losing to Paul Scofield for A Man for All Seasons. I guess the Academy voters figured Burton would get another shot. He never brought home the big prize though.George Segal usually gets overlooked. This film and Ship of Fools was the start of his long career but no Oscar for him either.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is quite the indictment against marriage especially after the love has died. It's far from the whole story of marriage. There are many who stay married longer than George and Martha and happily. But it wasn't in Edward Albee's life experience to draw from. But this should be seen to see Liz and Dick at their very best.".

Being detestable is quite a bit easier than being likable so it is no great feat to write characters like George Richard Burton Martha Elizabeth Taylor and the feckless young couple they make privy to their spats. But to make such characters compelling and sympathetic as wella necessity if the audience is to care about the juvenile antics happening on screenis much more challenging. The cost of failure is the sense that the melodrama is merely contrived and devoid of relatable meaning. Ernest Lehman's adapted screenplay and Mike Nichols' directing fail to find an avenue inside George and Martha's histrionic act to make it feel like something more than merely contrived. Burton and Taylor's expert scenery chewing the movie would tolerate nothing more artful from its actors compensates to a degree and in an early scene Taylor gets the chance to impersonate Bette Davis which she does remarkably well. Still viewers seeking a more intelligent and moving film on the theme of domestic dysfunction would do better to watch Liz in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 1958.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a play with only four characters and basically one setting Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf covers a lot of ground. It mostly depends on the performances and the acidic dialog because when you get right down to it the Big Reveal isn't too big although it's plenty bizarre.George Burton is an associate professor of history at a small college. He doesn't have much in the way of ambition we gather because his shrewish and vulgar wife Martha Taylor keeps twitting him about it. Taylor is magnificently slatternly. She'd played Cleopatra a few years earlier but age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite vulgarity.George and Martha have two latenight guests a newly arrived professor of biology Segal and his naive wife Dennis. The evening begins with the four of them sitting around the living room with nothing special to say. But the booze flows like Niagara and they all loosen up  not that Martha requires much loosening.Albee's dialog is cynical bitter and exploitative. Cutting insults keep the viewer awake as do the sometimes embarrassing revelations like Sandy Dennis's hysterical pregnancies and frequent vomiting. When Albee latches on to what he feels is a good turn of phrase it gets repeated until it becomes laughable per se. It's good that you're a biologist Taylor tells Segal because you're right in the MEAT of things. She comes up with this again and again until Burton cuts her off with the observation that she's obsessed with the phrase and that it's vulgar.The comparison of Taylor's father who is president of the college to a big white mouse is repeated as well. And Taylor refers to her husband as variously a swamp a bog and a fen.Insults fly in all directions. One person may reveal a secret to another who then runs over and trumpets the information to the others. They play what Burton calls games such as Humiliate the Host and Hump the Hostess. People make things up as they go along or present fantasies as historical fact. At one point Segal knocks Burton to the floor. The exception to most of this verbal and physical violence is Sandy Dennis who is too dumb to know what's going on much of the time.The party lasts all night and peters out at dawn with Segal and Dennis leaving the house in a state of shock and Burton and Taylor exhausted by their strenuous conflict.It's directed in a straightforward manner by Mike Nichols who doesn't pull any stylistic tricks. No flashbacks no slow motion no wobbling camera. That kind of razzle dazzle isn't really needed. How can you possibly pep up a volcano? I rather enjoy it. I get a kick out of its malice. Albee is gay and perhaps it takes a gay man or a straight woman to coax ignominy into such polished form. Maybe not. I don't know. I just know I like it when Burton accuses Taylor of braying and there follows a sharp argument over whether she brays or not with Taylor sounding exactly like a mule.".

If you don't take this film's stinking bull at face value then having to endure watching the blowzy lardassed Elizabeth Taylor verbally duking it out with the loud obnoxious Richard Burton can quickly become quite humorous almost cartoonish in nature.I mean can you just imagine for over 2 frickin' hours having to tolerate that porkette Taylor and that pricko Burton a couple of real grotesque clowns indeed tearing away at each other's throats and chewing up the scenery especially Taylor nonstop? Back in its day this film was considered groundbreaking and I guess that it was for its high level of profanity and sexual implications. This was the first film to use the word bugger and the phrase screw you in its dialogue. And it was also the first to be given the MPAA tag  No one under 18 will be admitted unless accompanied by his parent. Personally I've always hated this film's title which really has nothing in the least bit to do with the story. And believe me no one will ever ever convince me that that bloated bag Elizabeth Taylor was at all deserving of the Oscar she won for her portrayal of Martha.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having heard about this alleged classic ever since it debuted when I was a child I finally got around to seeing it on DVD and I was very disappointed! I checked the contains spoiler box just in case but I won't go into the plot in detail here. First of all IMHO Albee's story was what it was and that's inescapable on its merits I would give it a five of ten stars having never read itI think the film dialogue is quite clunky at times if I was a Hollywood director long a dream of mine no way in hell would I have chosen to make a film of the play of THAT bookstory!So what is all the hype about?? Same old studio b.s. I think. It's just that with so many talents in one film the multiple Oscar nominations but thirteen?? Geez no way! were probably inevitable. As you can see I would only rate it two out of ten stars or one out of four. Here's why Both Taylor and Burton are highly accomplished skilled actors at the top of their form in this era. But I think they both overreached and overacted in this film. The script was really awful IMHO. I didn't like it enough to recall the many awkward lines but there are plenty of them the writing might have fit public taste in the 50s but certainly doesn't hold up now. This opinion has nothing to do with socalled decency or moresI'm a diehard liberal.Again I'd have never chosen to film the play of the book so that's strike one. Strike two for me was the direction... the pacing is poor it has almost no plot momentum and is filled with awkward silences which I realize were probably intentional and part of the storyNichols's choice to dramatize the heavily slanted relationships he was trying to portray. Each character seems to stand in contrast to the other as if the director said you just get into your part and don't have chemistry with the other actors as in an ensemble piece which is apparently how it was intended to happen on stage. When I read on the DVD that they spent 20 weeks filming this on the Warner lot it dawned on me here was Hollywood's top acting power couple screwing off for five months and getting paid handsomely. Well good for them but that doesn't mean I have to love it. I feel sorry for Mike Nichols being so successful his first time out it probably means his standards were that much lower and although I'm a total nobody in Hollywood they're far below mine if I had five months on sound stages to do this film I could have done it a lot better!.On the positive side I think the bw cinematography was excellent as in all of Haskell Wexler's work! and the editing too. But they couldn't compensate for lame direction and overwrought acting performances borne of ignorant selfish quirky readings of the original work. Taylor's Oscar may have in context of the year's other mostly not memorable fare been somewhat deserved she is a great American actress... but that in itself doesn't hold the rest of the parts of this film together for me.The only reason I give it any stars is that there are a few dramatic moments and the cinematography and editing like the first gun surprise that were done quite well. But I'm just sure that it must have worked far better on stage. Burton's expansive gestures and incredible dramatic voice would have been far better utilized in a film of Macbeth or other Shakespeare play not this! I think my intuition about this was right I could've waited another forty years to see it.".

She has had her nose broken by her brother for being seen holding hands with a boy and yet she can not break her mother's heart and run away. She too attempts suicide and she first approaches Cahit there at the Hospital. Sibel asks Cahit to marry her as she believes this to be the way out of her parent's house. She promises Cahit that their relationship will be like roommates not like a married couple. The film follows Sibel and Cahit as they get married become closer and eventually fall in love.";

	schema:reviewBody "Head On Gegen die Wand winner of the top prize Golden Bear at the 2004 Berlin Festival is occasionally interrupted by a panoramic shot of a singer performing in front of a small Turkish orchestra on the banks of the Bosphorus across from Istanbul. It's a simple at first incomprehensible little device that provides punctuation and clarity amid the chaos and melodrama that otherwise dominate this story of a Turkish man in his forties and a twentyyearold Turkish woman who meet in a psychiatric facility in Germany when both have attempted suicide  he by crashing his car into a wall head on she by slitting her wrists. Cahit Tomruk the sublimely attitudinizing Birol nel is a purposeless rock 'n' roll loving boozer with a deadend job collecting bottles at a club and Sibel Gner the wiry intense Sibel Kikulli is a young woman with conservative Turkish parents who wants to escape family pressures.Both are total drama queens and both are Germanborn Turks. Cahit is more assimilated his Turkish isn't even good. Sibel figures if he'll agree to marry her that'll get her away from her family. This is the irony of their situation she must capitulate to the conventions of their culture in order to gain some freedom from it and he must capitulate to society in order to get some sense of purpose. So they do get married  he somehow passes muster with the stuffy family baulking all the way  and they eventually even fall in love. Her joie de vivre is exactly what he needs and she's essentially just as wild in her way as he is in his  but his nihilism and violence continue unabated and so does her promiscuity and his brutal attack on one of her one night stands leads to jail and scandal which in turn forces her to go to Istanbul. While he's incarcerated she writes him sustaining letters from Turkey  their relationship like the staid orchestra on the Bosphorus is a stable element amid the surrounding chaos  and after jail he goes to Turkey to find her.To say this turbulent brightly colored lurid story is a realistic picture of Turks in Germany would be a total distortion of the truth. But somehow the situation of Cahit and Sibel reflects the unstable moods this half assimilated half alien population experiences and however melodramatic and unresolved the saga is the two main characters are very well realized. The actors are strong especially Birol nel whose charismatic brooding and ravaged good looks make him irresistibly watchable. Both feel real to us  he sardonic and gloomy she dangerously spirited and full of life despite her dramatic suicide attempts of which there's more than one. The story as much as the images through which it's told is both dark and vibrant.We need the Brechtian Greekchorus device of those orchestral interludes on the Bosphorus though without an occasional break the drama and darkness would be too much. We also need to go with the flow of this movie and not expect it to be more polished or more organized or even better looking than it is. It looks unlike most films we're seeing now but that doesn't mean the cinematographer hasn't done the best possible job. What it has is life tumultuous with incident strong personalities and a milieu we've not seen before. There's also a loud authenticfeeling rockpop soundtrack and a cunning contrast between Cahit's punkrock sensibility and Sibel's love of good grooming and dance. Arguably the movie is too long but that length gives it the feel of a saga which it must have because that's what it is the confused tawdry epic of a generation. Like all first films by a whole subculture it has a lot to talk about. When Sibel and Cahit discover they still love each other after everything it's the Turkish Germans discovering that they have selfworth. The last scenes are openended this generation's future is anybody's guess.Seen in Paris 17 September 2004. Opening in the US in January 2005. First German film to win a Golden Bear in Berlin in eighteen years.".

Lead actor Birol and Sibel Kekilli have done a good job . The basic story takes you in and makes you feel all the sadness craziness happiness joy and deep depressions of the characters. The bitterness of the reality spread all over the movie and kind of depressing. The story is also politically and socially a very good point expressing maybe thousands of peoples true lives stucked between two cultures. I would love to watch it once again.

	schema:reviewBody "Head On Gegen die Wand is a completely original love story and shames conventional Hollywood romantic comedies with its fresh take on love and loss as rich as Rhett and Scarlett.The closest I can think of a dysfunctional couple meeting so oddly cute and playing out an unusual relationship is in Christopher Fry's The Lady's Not for Burning which shares selfdestructive lovers. The German literal title of Against the Wall is more resonant of how they feel but the American distributors probably thought that had too much political implication.The completely selfinvolved he and she here are innately offkilter because writerdirector Faith Akin sets them within a diverse Turkish immigrant community of Germany so that their personalities are circumscribed by cultural expectations and restrictions she chafing against binds on women and he lost in the nihilistic punk rock underground.The rocky journey of how they find their own individuality within their sexual and emotional needs and ethnic identity and what each means to the other is an unpredictable thrill ride as each unexpected action leads to tears laughter poignancy and regret of bad timing. This is a baldly brash and frank exploration of the meaning of love and marriage as individuals and within a web of family friends and culture.Craggyfaced Birol nel is riveting as the older burnedout case whose past we only glimpse. Sibel Kekilli at first seems like just another pretty young thing but brings spunk and sympathy on her maturing roller coaster ride. Evidently deleted scenes that are available on the European DVD help to expand on the hints as to what her closing motivations are.Dependant on the English subtitles I'm sure I lost some significances as I wasn't sure when characters were speaking Turkish or German let alone able to discern their fluency in either with the added fillip of recognition of globalization with a sudden concluding discussion in Istanbul in English of their future.The chapter introductions by an ethnic band playing a traditional sad love song adds to the timeliness of the tale that is reminiscent of old folk ballads of tragic love stories. In between the punk rock and contemporary world fusion selections are terrific including the moving closing song.".

The location in St. Pauli close to the famous Reeperban Street could not be more perfect as the environment for such depressive story of losers. The precise direction of Faith Akin obs IMDb dictionary does not allow to write correctly the name of the director is stunning and the performance of Birol nen and Sibel Kekilli are outstanding and deserved nominations to the Oscar. When the character Sibel reaches the bottom of the well in Istanbul Sibel Kekilli shines with a mesmerizing performance.

First of all the movie explains the life of the Turkish immigrants in  Germany in a perfect way. We see how they cannot be neither German nor  Turkish anymore. They are stuck in between and they act as punks. For  instance it is really true that most of the young Turkish people in  Germany cannot speak Turkish like Cahit. We also see the ridiculous  pressure of Sibel's family For instance while her married brother  threatensbeats her whenever she has a boyfriend he and his friends  can comfortably speak about how they sleep with prostitutes!  Also the cast is very good especially Sibel Kekilli and Birol Unel. I  loved the scene where we can see the smile in Sibel's eyes in the  amusement park she is so much in love...   In addition there are so many things to say about the movie.. The  story is a very striking one itself. The hopelessness of the characters  in a world without love and moral values are explained so wellwithout  making it dramatic. Also Sibel's life in Istanbul her cousin's  lifelike many of us still single and waiting to be promoted! are  also judgements beside the main genre.

I think Faith Akin did a great job keeping this film organic and earthly.There is despair hope love then despair and hope once again. I could easily relate to the characters. Speaking of characters Birol nel is the most charismatic actor I've seen lately he dominates the screen along with Sibel Kekilli. Sibel Kekilli is an angel pure acting it is unfortunate what she had to go through in real life but she is stronger than most people and she had to prove it many times. In supporting roles there is Gven Kirac who is one of my favorite actors in Turkish cinema and Meltem Cumbul who provides good acting.By the way despite of all the tragedy there is also ethnic humor in this film which goes handinhand with the story. Especially the scenes with Birol nel and Guven Kirac are quite amusing especially if you know Turkish.Anyway all I have to say is I feel you your sun it shines I feel you within my mind You take me there You take me where the kingdom comes You take me to and lead me through Babylon ... I was riding in that car with Cahit.Tebrikler Faith Akin WE WANT MORE OF THESE!".

Especially the scenes with Birol nel and Guven Kirac are quite amusing especially if you know Turkish.Anyway all I have to say is I feel you your sun it shines I feel you within my mind You take me there You take me where the kingdom comes You take me to and lead me through Babylon ... I was riding in that car with Cahit.Tebrikler Faith Akin WE WANT MORE OF THESE!";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie last Saturday and have been thinking about it a lot over the last few days. It is truly a brilliant film. I loved the raw power and violent emotions that the characters experience and which hit the viewer like a ton of bricks.the two leads who play Cahit and Sibel are just amazing Birol Unel especially manages to convey the despair self loathing and loneliness of his character with a physicality that's just striking. it is to his credit that we the viewers can never despise him despite his violent and frequently obnoxious behaviour. In the beginning of the movie Cahit is a wreck and although it would be simplistic to say that love saves him it is certain that the collision of his life with Sibel's is cataclysmic.the movie's real power lies with the fact that the characters are truly multidimensional and complex they experience conflicting emotions and desires and ultimately it is their incapacity to understand what is happening to them which leads to their downfall. They are so used to suffering and struggling and to using people and being used that when suddenly they fall in love they can't even recognise what is happening to them until it is too late.I don't think you need to be Turkish or an immigrant to feel deep empathy with Sibel and Cahit. Their story is not just the story of two people lost in translation and suspended between different cultures. they are just a man and a woman who don't really know who they are or what they want and are looking for a slice of happiness in all the wrong places until they happen to stumble upon each other. And even then their love cannot save them from falling back through the cracks.In summary a magnificent achievement and a truly brilliant film. I look forward to seeing more from Faith Akin Birol Unel and Sibel Kekilli.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a TurkishAmerican my praise for HeadOnGegen die Wand Duvarlarla Karsi is perhaps predictable and it does admittedly contain a degree of subjectivity. But one must realize that Akin has succeeded where other talented TurkishGerman directors have not. There was a genuine noble effort called Yara an earlier TurkishGerman film which demonstrates how hard it is to make a crosscultural film which is universally accepted one which is not isolated to either one country of origin in this case Turkey or Germany or the other. Yara had many great performances and moving moments with wonderful cinematography character acting and an amazing film score but it still did not meet its overall creative objective. Head On does just that though. Birol Unel and Sibel Kekili are profoundly amazing as is Meltem Cumbul and the rest of the supporting cast. The film is also welledited and it sticks to its complicated theme throughout. We really feel for everyone involved even many but certainly not allof the antagonists and care about them. The film is brutal and harsh in its depiction of both Germany's cultural isolation towards immigrants and in backwards social mentalities in conservative Turkish circles which both oppress those who fervently oppose them and prevents those who challenge the mentality from getting past the discrimination which results from the darkest aspect of Anatolian life which alas does not change with immigration. A tough film which should stand the test of time. But it is not quite as profound as the Turkish film UzakDistant which was released here in the USA last year. Nor did I enjoy it as much as another current German film Downfall which I it alas seems to be a minority view found absolutely riveting. But along with In July there can be no dispute of Akin's talents which will be challenged by the high expectations many of us in the world Turkish community have for him. But he has clearly earned that.".

There is a wonderful powerful visceral quality to this film which is extremely rare in any artform lets be honest so credit needs to be placed where credit is due  and it is due in huge amounts here. 'Head On' takes you on an emotional journey to the edges of the human experience tempered by an nihilism and a soulsearching despair that feels all too real. These are not so much characters but real people with real dilemma's and their life experiences oozes from every visible pore. The two central performances are bloody amazing and a reminder of what real acting and characterisation is all about. The direction is profound not to mention the wonderful soundtrack the Birthday Party track much appreciated!!. I can't say anything but complimentary things about this film and in my humble opinion is a modernday masterpiece. On the small offchance that the actorsproducers director or anyone connected to this film reads this congratulations on a fantastic piece of filmmaking!".

I am a citizen of both Turkey and England and I know exactly how it feels to be torn between two cultures and how difficult it is for people like us to fit in and express ourselves. There is just no middle ground between two completely different worlds and as a result so many youths go to such extremes whilst they are in a state of complete confusion.In my opinion the film is not about a nymphomaniac as some people seem to think so. It is about a young confused lady who wants to find her identity. All she wants is a bit of affection and someone to look after her. Her family do none of these things and as a result lead her to attempt suicide.This highlights a very important truth about some Turkish families who try to 'protect' their children so much that they end up suffocating them and driving the children into hating their lives.Faith Akin puts this across beautifully in his film. The performance of the actors especially that of his lead stars Sibel Kekilli and Birol Unel is brilliant. It has been a while since I have seen such a well made film and the fact that the director is a young Turkish person is fantastic.The film is one of love hope and disasters. At times it has you crying whilst at other times you can't help but smile.This film won many awards and in my opinion it deserves every single one. The fact that Sibel Kekilli has a history in porn films caused a massive fuss especially amongst the Turkish viewers but can I just say that her past is of no concern to us. The only thing we should be worried about whilst watching the film is her acting. Everyone that has seen it will agree that she is a fantastic actress which is the only thing that matters. Those who have not yet seen it should definitely do so.Congratulations to Akin for presenting us with such a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Gegen die Wand' in German 'Duvara karsi' in Turkish or 'HEADON' in English is an explosive drama written and directed by Faith Akin a movie that may be tough to watch but a movie that has enormous impact. While other films have successfully addressed the particular problems that the immigrant Turkish community in Germany face few have come as close to examining all sides of the ongoing issues of displacement and the effects of familial dispersal in the face of a new culture.Cahit Birol nel is a thirtysomething lost soul drinking and snorting himself into oblivion over the loss of his beloved wife. He lives in a slum spends all his time in sleazy bars getting beaten up for inappropriate behavior until one night he drunkenly drives into a wall ?suicidal? and ends up in a hospital where he 'meets' Sibel Sibel Kekilli a young woman who has again attempted suicide as an escape from her strict family's prevention of her having a life. Hearing Cahit is Turkish Sibel nonchalantly suggests they 'marry' Sibel's only way to escape her family would be to find a Turkish husband. Though grossly mismatched the two agree to an 'open marriage' they satisfy Sibel's family and move in together. Sibel cooks and cleans Cahit's hovel and then goes out and sleeps around. This arrangement eventually causes problems for each of them and Sibel moves to Istanbul to escape the horrors of the life she has chosen. Once alone Cahit is confronted with the reality that Sibel is the only path to salvation for his tragic life and the story proceeds  or rather speed drives  its way to a heartrending finish.The characters in the film are generally unlikable sorts especially Cahit but each actor does so well allowing us to observe the dreary world that faces immigrants in a fractured society that we end up having an amazing amount of compassion for their character creations. Director Akin makes this twohour plus drama speed by with such solid purpose that it seems a short film. There is considerable nudity and the sexual encounters may be a problem for some viewers but Akin's cinematographer Rainer Klausmann makes everything work toward the ultimate message of the film. An interesting touch is Akin's choice of weaving a chamber music group of a female vocalist with Turkish instrumentalists as a chorus to comment on the action and keep us mindful that though the film for the most part is set in Germany this is a very Turkish story!

This arrangement eventually causes problems for each of them and Sibel moves to Istanbul to escape the horrors of the life she has chosen. Once alone Cahit is confronted with the reality that Sibel is the only path to salvation for his tragic life and the story proceeds  or rather speed drives  its way to a heartrending finish.The characters in the film are generally unlikable sorts especially Cahit but each actor does so well allowing us to observe the dreary world that faces immigrants in a fractured society that we end up having an amazing amount of compassion for their character creations. Director Akin makes this twohour plus drama speed by with such solid purpose that it seems a short film. There is considerable nudity and the sexual encounters may be a problem for some viewers but Akin's cinematographer Rainer Klausmann makes everything work toward the ultimate message of the film. An interesting touch is Akin's choice of weaving a chamber music group of a female vocalist with Turkish instrumentalists as a chorus to comment on the action and keep us mindful that though the film for the most part is set in Germany this is a very Turkish story!

It tells the story of a middleaged downonhis luck Turkish immigrant in Germany Birol nel. Hiss life is such a mess that one day he drives his car headlong into a brick wall Gegen die Wand. Reluctantly he engages in a marriage with Sibel a girl half his age who he met in the rehabilitation clinic. At first she just wants to marry him so she can get away from her overprotective father and fully engage in western hedonistic society but after a while the inevitable happens and they actually fall in love. From there things go downhill again.In terms of story Gegen die Wand offers a solid yet fairly predictable narrative. From the getgo it's pretty clear where everything is going. What really lift GdW apart though is the execution of the story. The acting is excellent and all actors turn in believable performances and come across as real human beings you can relate to and care about. Special mention goes to Sibel Kekilli who is simply enchanting. It's also refreshingly free of false sentiments overdone music and other flaws that can turn a beautiful movie into a manipulative tearjerker.What Gegen die Wand also does very well is the depiction of the clash of cultures between liberal hedonistic Germans and conservative Turkish immigrants. Like many girls Sibil just wants to have a good time which translates roughly to the traditional sex drugs and rock  roll but she is completely misunderstood by her traditional father who values family honor above everything after Sibil attempts suicide her family is angry with her instead of concerned and later she is even thrown completely out of the family for something she didn't even control. Things become even more dramatic when Sibel ends up in Turkey where women aren't nearly as free as in Germany and Sibel's liberal lifestyle gets her into serious trouble.Also cinematographically this is a very beautiful movie. It's beautifully shot and the combination of western and Turkish music fits the images very well and adds tremendously to the atmosphere. There are even some interludes of a Turkish orchestra playing on the shores of the Bosporus with the Aya Sofia mosque in the background. It's all very beautiful and very atmospheric.That being said this movie probably isn't for everyone. The fairly slow pace will likely put some people off and like I said the story is a bit on the predictable side.

Proof yet again that there is an abundance of great film talent internationally writing directing acting photography editing... all of it.The acting is nothing short of remarkable anchored by the exceptional performance of Birol Unel. Reminiscent of Mickey Rourke in Barfly or Gary Oldman in State of Grace the intensity and tragedy of the character was evidenced in every look word and gesture. It's refreshing to see this type of character in film... we don't see it much these days in American cinema. This was a truly authentic performance.Sibel Kekilli also turned in a great performance of a girl who is equal parts willful vulnerable naive and resilient.The writerdirector Faith Akin clearly knows what he's doing. Just about every element of this film was compelling. I look forward to seeing his other films.Check it out.".

Proof yet again that there is an abundance of great film talent internationally writing directing acting photography editing... all of it.The acting is nothing short of remarkable anchored by the exceptional performance of Birol Unel. Reminiscent of Mickey Rourke in Barfly or Gary Oldman in State of Grace the intensity and tragedy of the character was evidenced in every look word and gesture. It's refreshing to see this type of character in film... we don't see it much these days in American cinema. This was a truly authentic performance.Sibel Kekilli also turned in a great performance of a girl who is equal parts willful vulnerable naive and resilient.The writerdirector Faith Akin clearly knows what he's doing.

I don't know if me being Turkish is a reason to love this film. But love fear hatred passion desperation and hope are universal feelings right? There are a lot of things that break your heart in this film. To see Cahit so desperate and at the edge of the life to see his buddy in struggle of saving her friend to see Sibel while she follows her instinct to live the life she dreams...These were really touching but there are two scenes in the film that really crushed me. The look on Cahit's face in two different scene first when Sibel cooked while Cahit was watching her then when Sibel enters the bar right after Cahit killed one of her one night stands. I hope everyone manages to see the real story in the film. This film is not about a Turkish girl who is trying to escape her conservative family. This is even not the subplot. This is a dark love story that invites us in a world with people who live on the edge. People who find love but cannot live it as they want it. Real people with real lives. Now it is confirmed Fatih Akin is one of the most talented guys in the film world. One of the best films that come to your theatre in years.

	schema:headline " One of Roger Moore's Best Bond movies he ever did my all time favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "What can I say about this film that was said already? I love this film to death! It is definitely the best Roger Moore's James Bond 007 film since The Spy Who Loved Me! It is my second favorite Roger Moore film I love it to death since I was a kid. For Your Eyes Only 1981 is better then the lackluster The Man With The Golden Gun Octopussy and A View To A Kill in my honest opinion it is better then Moonraker. This is the first Bond of the 80's and it is honestly one of the best Bond films in my opinion this is just my opinion. This movie is simply action with real stunts more darker then the last one more serious. Roger Moore did one of his best performance as James Bond 007. Really good actors and really good actresses. It is my childhood. A classic James Bond adventure there is. All right maybe it was not that simple. Surprisingly this works very well with the action sequences being more realistic what with a car chase ski chase and a small scale assault on the villain's residence instead but brilliant too. For Roger Moore the film offers his best performance as James Bond. The climbing on The Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Meteora St Cyril's monastery in the northern mountains of Greece is a great realistic sequence. Bond Roger Moore climbs the cliff in the mountains to reach the hoist controlling the basket. Those were real stunts it was really dangerous for Moore and his stuntman doing those stunts. In 1993 we got Cliffhanger with Sylvester Stallone climbing the mountains even those stunts were dangerous. This stunts that Roger Moore performed were really dangerous. Bond in the beginning climbs on the helicopter another dangerous stunt that was performed from Roger Moore and his stuntman. James Bond on skies on the crosscountry skiing and he is perused by motorcycle assassins great stunts performed from stuntman's. Great car chase A Citron 2CV was used in which Bond and Melina are fleeing and are kicked by this car really badass scene. Great fights on the ship great fights with car on the beach in which Bond shoot's a guy's car. Great under water scenes in which Bond and Melina are under attack by a diver in a JIM suit. Great effects for the minisubs under water. Bond and Melina are tied up with the line on Kristatos' yacht been as bait for sharks. Great actors like are Roger Moore Carole Bouquet Julian Glover Topol LynnHolly Johnson Michael Gothard Jill Bennett John Wyman and Walter Gotell. Melina Havelock Carole Bouquet is a perfect Bond heroine determined to avenge her parents at all costs. Melina Havelock is a combination of Tilly Masterson from 'Goldfinger' and Domino from 'Thunderball.' Melina comes upon a much bigger plot involving 007 and a RussianBritish race to regain the A.T.A.C. She was really great Bond girl I enjoy the girl so much and the actress she was awesome better then Britt Ekland. Carole Bouquet did a great performance and she did a great job playing Melina Havelock she was so realistic in screen just my opinion. This movie had the absolute most beautiful Bond girl .Bibi Dahl LynnHolly Johnson really touched my heart who would do anything for Bond! She is the American figureskating prodigy who meets 007 in Cortina D'Ampezzo. LynnHolly Johnson did a great job been a victim of her uncle Kristatos Julian Glover.Agent 007 is assigned to hunt for a lost British encryption device and prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Bond investigate the murder of Timothy Havelock who was working to salvage the wreckage of a spy boat carrying a vital command system called A.T.A.C. Bond's investigation leads him to believe that the Russians are also trying to recover the system and may be using Aris Kristatos Julian Glover to carry out their dirty work. Aiding Bond is the beautiful sharpshooter Melina Havelock Carole Bouquet and an old acquaintance of Kristatos's named Milos Columbo Topol.I really miss movies like this one today I really do I miss them so much. They don't make movies like this one today they don't. The plot was about the hunt for a lost British encryption device called A.T.A.C. that was also used later in Under Siege 2 Dark Territory 1995.I really did enjoy soundtrack For Your Eyes Only by Sheena Easton and the music theme by Bill Conti. The movie is really fast paced I really wasn't bored with it it is highly entertaining. You see also the cemetery in which we see Bond on his wife's grave Tracy Di Vicenzo from On Her Majesty's Secret Service we see Blofeld and Bond finally kill's him on the end of the opening scene. For Your Eyes Only is a 1981 British spy film and the twelfth in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions and the fifth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. 1010 This in my opinion really my favorite Roger Moore James Bond 007 films I love it to death I think is my second favorite film The Spy Who Loved Me is my number 1 favorite film but this one will be the second one. This was the first movie John Glen directed and really did a good job on this film. I highly recommend for every Bond Fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "'For Your Eyes Only' starts the tenure of John Glen at the helm of the Bond series. He had worked previously on many of the Bond movies but during the eighties he directed all 5 Bond movies and with the exception of 'A View To A Kill' they are up there with the best of the whole series. Certainly 'For Your Eyes Only' and the follow up 'Octopussy' are the best of the Moore years and I don't think it would be overstating it to say that Glen may have single handedly saved the franchise.By the end of the 1970s Bond had turned from Ian Fleming's masterspy  into an entirely comic book creation culminating in the preposterous shenanigans of 'Moonraker' in 1979. At the start of a new decade a new style is clearly apparent with a back to basics story that actually involves some spying and a genuine threat to world peace. It's pushing it to say that the story is believable but it is realistically told and is certainly a more adult affair than the previous efforts.The film starts with the final nail in the coffin for Blofeld. After years of legal wrangling over who had the rights to the character the filmmakers decided to show that they didn't need him anyway and unceremoniously dumped him once and for all. We are also immediately put in the mood for a far more serious Bond when he visits his late wife's grave an unusual moment not least because the movies rarely referenced previous actors in the role. Here we are reminded that Moore wasn't playing Bond at the time of his marriage. That serious tone pervades throughout the movie with less wisecracking than usual and a subdued villain at odds with the expected megalomaniac we are used to. But the film is all the better for it. There are some fantastic action setpieces including a chase in a Citroen 2CV and a ski chase that tops even that of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' along with a tense finale that is literally a cliffhanger. Bond is actually forced to use his wits and much of the action and escapes are less contrived than one would expect. It's also good to see after 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and 'Moonraker' that the filmmakers have tried to get back to Fleming's Bond with many ideas lifted from the original stories. The scene with Bond and Melina dragged behind the speedboat for example is taken directly from the novel of 'Live And Let Die' and many characters appear in Fleming's short story of the same name.Add to the mix a fine cast notably Carole Bouquet as another strong character in the list of 'Bond women' and you have a satisfying and thrilling entry in the series.".

	schema:headline " Roger Moore's best Bond hands down";
	schema:reviewBody "After 1979's scifi cartoon called Moonraker Albert Broccoli and the rest of the James Bond producers decided to change the pace for Roger Moore's fifth adventure. This included firing incumbent director Lewis Gilbert and writing a more believable plot to begin with. The second item on the agenda was to write a script which curbed Roger Moore's obsessive tendencies to pile on the jokes. Add a few good villains and allies and voila! a classic James Bond adventure there is. All right maybe it was not that simple.This time around Bond is sent to investigate the murder of one Timothy Havelock who was working to salvage the wreckage of a spy boat carrying a vital command system called A.T.A.C. Bond's investigation leads him to believe that the Russians are also trying to recover the system and may be using one Aris Kristatos Julian Glover to carry out their dirty work. Aiding Bond is the beautiful sharpshooter Melina Havelock Carole Bouquet and an old acquaintance of Kristatos's named Milos Columbo Topol.As good as it is 'For Your Eyes Only' starts out terribly. The pretitle sequence involves an attempt on James Bond's life by a bald guy in a wheelchair with a white cat I wonder who that could be?. The scene is campy and don't get me started on the remark about the delicatessen in stainless steel obviously put in there at the request of some actor. I understand why the sequence was filmed but that does not make it good. Thankfully it would not be a barometer on the rest of the movie!It may not be among the very best in the series but believe me when I say that the difference in tone between this and the goofy 'Moonraker' is like day compared to night. It is easily the preeminent Roger Moore Bond film and is well worth watching in every area. The villain is not trying to kill a majority of the human race for some outlandish purpose. There are no extravagant weapons or billionaire lunatics no silly motives or doomsday schemes. Instead we have a lean adventure that a Bond fan can actually enjoy. There are many outstanding qualities about this film mixed in with a few notable negatives.Any list of what went right with this film has to begin with Roger Moore. After two mediocre performances he really nails down the part here. He is courageous commanding tough and most importantly serious thanks to new director John Glen who apparently had to do some prying to slow down Moore's humor blitz.Another BIG breath of fresh air is provided by the villains and allies who are also treated seriously and given unusual depth of character. Julian Glover is exceptional as the ruthless and deceptive Kristatos. It is villains like this that help make the Bond series so great and Glover is excellent indeed. No wonder Steven Spielberg cast him for Indiana Jones! In Topol most famous for his work in 'Fiddler on the Roof' we get a terrific ally who has a great chemistry with Bond. I imagine I am not the only person who found him to be much like Kerim Bey in the great 'From Russia With Love'.Then there is the matter of the women who both bring good and bad qualities to the table. Carole Bouquet is somewhat wooden as female lead Melina but can also hold her own when the heat is on which makes her the best Bond girl in some time. LynnHolly Johnson provides a lovable portrayal as Bibi Dahl a figure skater who gets the hots for Bond don't get me started on the age difference. Her bubble headed character makes for some humorous moments and is used to make the character of Kristatos stronger. Dahl is also enrapturing to look at but I find her ditzy part a little too over the top but not to the point of weakening the final product.Unfortunately there are a few items that bug me about this film. The first is Bill Conti's soundtrack. While it would be terrific literature for an uptempo jazz band it really clashes with the action more than anything. Another weakness is Roger Moore's lack of talent for fight choreography which detracts from the action slightly. The last is Eric Kriegler John Wyman another invincible Oddjob ripoff that at one point picks up a motorcycle and hurls it at a fleeing Bond !.This is all forgivable however because the action from the mountainside ski chase to the climax atop a rock cliff is of very high standards. The absurdity of the previous chapter is shed and we get a highly entertaining adventure that appeals to fans and nonfans alike. I can certainly live with all of the flaws any day. So grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy another great 007 adventure.".

	schema:headline " One of Roger's best!";
	schema:reviewBody "Undeniably one of Roger Moore's best outings as 007 For Your Eyes Only was an attempt by Cubby Broccoli to bring Bond down to earth after the over the top but brilliant Moonraker. Surprisingly this works very well with the action sequences being more realistic what with a car chase ski chase and a small scale assault on the villain's residence instead but brilliant too. For Roger Moore the film offers his best performance as James Bond. The puns are played down more here and while he does still have a little twinkle in his eye at times his performance reflects more an older 007 a man who has lost his wife and is still fighting to save the world and right wrongs. This is demonstrated in the superb pretitle sequence in which after visiting his wife's grave he is kidnapped by Blofeld unofficially Blofeld however and taken on a wild helicopter ride. The moment were he visits Tracy's grave sees Roger convey so much in one scene he shows that he is not just the comedic 007 but he can be a serious one too. We see how the character has come to view revenge on Blofeld as he tells the dream like Melina a beautiful and enchanting performance from Carole Bouquet that before setting out on revenge as she hopes to do she must first dig two graves. Some would see this as hypocrisy whereas it is the words of a Bond who has come to analyse the hardship of a licence to kill.With Julian Glover portraying a more down to earth villain and the plot centering around the Cold War For Your Eyes Only is a great 80's Bond film with scatterings of what would be developed into the Timothy Dalton years such as the serious Bond and the more down to earth story telling. Following on the heels of two of the biggest Bond films in terms of scope and financial success For Your Eyes Only was a risk but it worked. While it did not outgross Moonraker it's financial intake was close and while it does possess the entertainment factor that both Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me did it is an artistic success with great performances an engrossing storyline wonderful characterization  and superb direction from John Glen in his directorial debut for a Bond film. He stages the abundance of chase scenes well and is helped by the fact that he has a good script to go with. On top of that Sheena Easton delivers a great theme tune.A great film and one deserving of classic status.".

The Bond girl played by Carole Bouquet is very good not just a pretty girl!The acting is much better than Moonraker John Glen eases into the directing quite comfortably.The photography is wonderful very realistic colour use.There are some fun stunt sequences the ski chase is fantastic.The film score is fun but a product of its time unlike Barry the music doesn't transcend the generations!Overall 'For Your Eyes Only' is a satisfying Bond picture.

	schema:reviewBody "The discarding of Blofeld at the beginning he is humorously depictedto the offense of many! serves another purpose besides being just the discarding of Blofeldit is almost as if the film is making a statement about choosing to discard cartoonish villains and goofy humor in one move. This scene provides a convenient rug to yank out from under the audience The film that we get is more straight serious than we might suspect based on this introduction. So the beginning of this film really sets us up for a surprise. Out of all the Roger Moore Bond films this one is most reminiscent of Connery's Bond. The violence repeatedly shows a mean hard edge and the joking while there is kept to a minimum. Guess what? This film works very nicely!There are a lot of things I liked about this one. The requisite special effects models and stunts are there but used to surprisingly subtle effect. The story is simple and small and allows the film to focus on believable human character details. Carole Bouquet's vendettadriven Melina Havelock is wellacted and believably serious. She's excellent. Character actor Michael Gothard THE DEVILS WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS is very memorable as gunforhire Locque who has no lines of dialogue whatsoever! Gothard delivers his performance entirely through visual expression. I imagine he must have had a wonderful time with this role easily one of his best. Roger Moore's character generally cool and under control nonetheless grows impatient with Locque and seems to display some genuine heartfelt anger when he finally...well I don't want to spoil it so you'll have to see the movie. Suffice it to say that it is one of my favorite the bad guy gets it moments in just about any movie.I also recall that when the film was new the application of synthesizers in the music most obvious in the title song and more subtly applied in the score was very cuttingedge and tasteful there were clearly synthetic effects to be heard but they were not poured on liberally.Everything in moderation? It's a little harder to notice in this day and age of synthetic everything but the careful incorporation of obviously synthetic sounds lent extra style. Take note of those moments involving the Dove pin. It helped the film achieve a modern character and is doubly interesting and appropriate because the action scenes do not depend primarily on hightech gadgetry. All in all a classy application of synthesizer. Maybe I'm going on about nothing here but I remember noticing this quality when the film was new and I've always liked it.So basically without rambling on further this film is good and very enjoyable.".

	schema:headline " Possibly my favorite Bond film of all time...";
	schema:reviewBody "For Your Eyes Only is one of my favorite James Bond films. It and the Spy Who Loved me constantly via for the top spot in my mind. Sadly this one did not perform as well as other Roger Moore James Bond movies as it did not do nearly as well as the previous film Moonraker. I enjoyed this one more than Moonraker which I did enjoy but I felt it was a bit of a retread of The Spy Who Loved Me while this one went in another direction by not having an eccentric wealthy person wishing to establish a new world order. At the same time this one features action sequence after action sequence and location after location which made this one a fun romp. Perhaps it is the fact that this was not t he only Bond film released this particular year as Never Say Never Again featuring Sean Connery was put out the same year so it may have turned people off to see both. Me I never cared to Never Say Never as it is simply a remake of Thunderball which is one of my favorite Sean Connery Bond movies. It and From Russia With Love via for the top spot for the Connery movies. I guess it matters little these days and why should I care now that I alone think this is one of the best Bond films.The movie features a lot of action but the mission is almost a rather unremarkable one. A spy ship is sunken with a mine and a decoder device that is on board is something that the Russians would love to have. The British have a man working on retrieving it but he is promptly killed along with his wife in front of their daughter. James is sent in to find the hitman responsible but he soon finds a lot of people involved which takes him from one exotic location to another as he tracks down the one responsible for the death of the man charged with recovering the coding device. He will team up with the daughter whose parents were killed and soon try to salvage the device themselves however there is another who is after the device as well so he can sell it to the Russians.This one has so many action sequences in it that it goes by at supersonic speed. It opens with an action sequence in a helicopter that is unrelated to the decoding device plot but it is fun to watch and the only time Blofeld and Roger Moore's Bond cross paths. There is an awesome car chase scene which features a very non typical Bond vehicle a ski chase a warehouse raid a deep sea battle and a fight on a mountain monastery which has an awesome rock climbing scene. The Bond girls here are okay just not as attractive as say Goodnight from Golden Gun or XXX from Spy. A lot of people complain about Bebe being to young for Roger but he never shows any interest in her throughout the film so not sure why her character is criticized. She is just there to advance the plot in the Cortina portion of the film and to make Bond squirm a bit. The villain is good too as if you are watching it for the first time you are not quite sure who the villain is until midway through the movie.So no this Bond is nothing like the previous two Bond movies which were very similar. Heck it isn't even like Live and Let Die or Man with the Golden Gun either. It is not even like the next two Bond films. It stands on its own and is really fun to watch. I loved this one as a kid as it and Spy were tops for me at a young age too. This one I sometimes place on the top because Spy is so similar to Moonraker although this one was supposed to follow Spy but thanks to the space craze they decided to put Bond in space instead. I sometimes wonder had Moonraker not been made if this film would have been vastly different as Jaws could very well had been in this one as he survived Spy and if there is no Moonraker where he turned good he could have showed up here to torment 007. So while it is not apparently everybody's cup of tea For Your Eyes Only stands near the top and is one of the more enjoyable and fast paced Bond films there is.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this James Bond film should have been FOR YOUR UNDERWHELMED EYES ONLY. After the box office smash that were THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER the producers decided to tone down the huge sets effects and explosions after some thought the outer space extravaganza of the latter was too unBond like. They attempted to bring 007 series back to its roots and they stripped downaway everything to a point where very little of the overthetop action I usually enjoy in James Bond movies was left in the end the film plays more like a TV movie or in my humble opinion an After School Special than a cinematic adventure. I saw this film countless of times when it was released. I was a teen then and bored out of my mind and went to see it during the summer of 1981 with my high school buddies to kill time. Needless to say I know this film by heart. And it always made me and still makes me giggle every time I watch it. From the chintzy opening helicopter scene with the actionpacked disco music to the car chase scene in Spain more actionpacked disco music to the overdone ski chase scene in Italy the penultimate use of actionpacked disco music here FYEO always felt like a catalog of James Bond moments seen in countless other 007 epics but this time set to disco music.The music is hilarious. It's probably the funniest Bond score ever. From the opening and closing credits when we see Sheena Easton's Deer caught in the headlights face to the disco song heard during the pool scene which was so dated back in 1981 and even more so today. The music during the ski chase scene makes me giggle nonstop whenever I hear it. The violins the guitars the trumpets. The brilliant John Barry is sorely missed here. The whole set up for the ski chase scene always struck me as being utterly ridiculous Bond is forced to go on a ski ramp which starts off the whole elaborate chase which culminates at a bobsled track. Spectacular? Yes but it's very contrived. Speaking of contrived there's the fight scene between Bond and the hockey players. Like so many action scenes in FYEO it doesn't make any sense. Why not just shoot 007 instead coming up with colorful but corny ways of dispensing of the British secret agent? And they said back then and still now FOR YOUR EYES ONLY was supposed to be more down to earth and realistic? Hardly.Then there's Lynn Holly Johnson who's the most annoying Bond girl ever. At one point Kristatos slaps her not once but twice. God that felt so good when he did that. The bimbo deserved it in spades. Because of her presence and her totally useless character the film felt like the aforementioned After School Special.After the ski chase scene the film moves to a crawl and almost becomes inert. Like THUNDERBALL the underwater sequences are slow and dull filled with endless scenes of standins for Moore and Bouquet. We are then introduced to Topol who overacts shamelessly. There is one great scene in the second half when Bond and Melina are dragged through the ocean and coral reef. But as well made as it is it begs the usual question the other action scenes in FYEO illicit why not just shoot 007 and Melina on the spot?As for the ending it can only be described as underwhelming. Probably the limpest ending in any Bond film! The best thing about FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is Roger Moore. He actually gives a performance worth noting. He's really fun and seems to know that the whole thing is silly and goes along for the ride. It's a shame the rest is so forgettable.".

It stars Roger Moore Carole Bouquet Julian Glover Topol Michael Gothard and Jill Bennett. Music is scored by Bill Conti and cinematography by Alan Hume.Bond 12 and 007 is assigned to locate the whereabouts of the ATAC a secret device that transmits orders to Polaris carrying submarines. He must do so quickly because the Soviets are also in pursuit and they appear to be aided by a wealthy shipping magnate.In spite of the gargantuan box office garnered by Moonraker Albert Broccoli was hurt by criticism that it had strayed too far from the basic 007 formula. Making good on his word to get Bond back to reality he mostly succeeded in making For Your Eyes Only a stripped back thriller. Gone is the over reliance on hitech wizardry Moore in his best performance as Bond is back to being down to earth being a Bond using his wits and toughness to get out of tricky situations and the film goes for short sharp shock action scenes instead of giant battles enveloped by even bigger sets. There's much tension as well none more so than with the finale where again the big bang pyrotechnics have been replaced by a mountain peak accent and assault where Bond uses a boot lace to save his skin! Now that's the Bond we love and admire. We even get the return of a bit of flirting between Moneypenny Lois Maxwell and Bond while Q Desmond Llewelyn is on witty form.Characters are strong a major plus point in the film. Topol charismatic and on scene stealing form and Glover offer up fascinating characters with Glover excellent as Kristatos providing the franchise with a cultured and believable villain. Melina Havelock Bouquet convincing is tough and driven by revenge for her murdered parents adept with a crossbow she makes a sturdy accomplice for Bond and thankfully their union isn't bogged down mid mission by the between the sheets angle. Elsewhere 007 editor John Glenn directs the first of his 5 Bond movies impressive first outing with the underwater scenes particularly striking. Hume brings Corfu to life via his colour lenses and Conti oversees one of the series' best title theme songs song with deep emotional beauty by Sheena Easton. His overall score is merely adequate with decent nationalistic flavours but the theme song is so strong it lingers to this day in the memory of all Bond fans.It's not all great in this stripped back Bond world though. The precredits sequence makes the terrible mistake of negating Bond's visit to the grave of his late wife Tracy by then having him jostle and jape with a bald villain in a wheelchair is it meant to be Blofeld? with unconvincing lines and delivery in the mix as well. LynnHolly Johnson's Bibi Dahl character is as pointless as it gets out of place and superfluous to the plot. While some chase sequences as fun and pulse raising as they are are over extended and stretch the running time to longer than required. No mind though with Bond back to being a man again instead of a button pusher and brilliant scenes like the keelhauling peril For Your Eyes Only was a major hit that raked in over 195 million at the World box office. James Bond's appeal and that of the man playing him was very much in vogue. 810".

	schema:headline " Bond at his Best with magnificent girl";
	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilers but wont reveal anything very important.Now im not saying Moore was the perfect Bond but in this picture he put in a performance that could match any otherincluding any Connery one. By far the very best of Moore and what I consider the best of Bond. The filmand im very thankful for thissteers away from the ridiculous plotlines that were found elsewhere in the series such as in Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me and got down towhat could be considered as a realistic or believable story with proper espionage situations action and characters not seen since the likes of From Russia With Love.The action is exhilarating without being over the top. The climb up the cliffface was on the edge of your seat stuff and the skichase was ingeniously executed that has you willing Bond down the mountain throughout. Moore plays Bond magnificently and can actually be seen to be angry enough to push Locques'a villain who has a great mix of evil with subtlenesscar over the clifftop. A very memorable and credible performance despite clearly aging in the role. Julian Glover puts in a great effort to make his character reasonably interestingand pulls it off as well as anybody couldand it is a refreshing change to see a villain that is not after world domination or destruction. Meanwhile Topol plays Columbo with near perfection. Neither seems to attempt overplaying their part with memorable oneliners. However LynnHolly Johnsons' character Bibi may become a tad annoying after a while but does bring a little more humour into the filmnot that it needed itwith obvious moves made on Bond and his awkward reaction to them.By far the best thing for me in the film was the introduction of Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock. In my opinion she is easily the best bond girl that can be seen anywhere in the series. She has the beautiful looks great body gorgeous eyes and the most seductive voicelike at the end when she says to Bondas her gown falls For your eyes only darlingI was just so jealous of Moore at that moment but can't be seen as another blond bimbo as seen in previous Bonds as she can also act too!. She plays the part of the greek elektra wonderfullyand she cant half use a bowandarrow as well! Many bond girls have been seen in plenty of other work after their appearances but I think it is a great shame we dont see more of Bouquetshes a great actress and a feast for any mans eyes even now at 44.If Bond 20 has a bond girl that puts in a performance or looks half as good as she doeswe're in for one great film!I loved watching this movie and could quite easily watch it time and time again.I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a true bond film that is believable and down to earth.A very much unappreciated Bond that offers plenty and delivers an abundance of everything.Moore9.910 Villain810 BouquetGirl1010 easily overall 1010 if just to watch Melina do her stuff!".

Bond is dispatched to recover the device with the help of Havelock.  However when Havelock is killed his daughter Melina is set on revenge and Bond must get the device before she kills those involved.After all that messing around with special effects in space in Moonraker and too much comedy in The Spy Who Loved Me Bond goes back to basics  for the new decade.  This sees the comedy added to by a nasty streak that sees Bond pushing people off cliffs  even the opening scene is very cruel when you think about it!  It also means the film is a lot tighter and has plenty of good action scenes from start to finish.However the back to basics thing has some downsides.  The whole film is not as memorable as others because it doesn't have any BIG scenes or a BIG ending.  Also the baddie is totally forgetable and doesn't make his mark at all.  However this is still a good spy movie  even if it ranks low as a Bond.Moore is actually good  he seems better now that his humour is toned down to allow him to be cruel.  Bouquet is good but Topol is just an oddity. Glover is AWOL and the rest of the cast seem more down to earth than usual.Overall it is a really good film but the normal nature of affairs mean it occasionally doesn't feel like a Bond.  That said I still rate it as a step in the right direction as it saw Bond become a spy movie again and not just a spoof of itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was my personal favourite Moore Bond film. He seemed to find the right mixture between drama and humour in this one. Possible exception is the precredits helicopter scene where a baldheaded villain with a maniacal giggle takes over control of Bond's transport and nearly sends it crashing into various buildings. This is the best precredits in the series for me because its both extremely silly and exciting at the same time. The dialogue is pretty sharp especially Moore's banter with Topol and there's a very amusing sequence where Q uses a photofit device in order to identify one of the main killers. The skiscenes are exciting if not as good as those in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the attack on the harbour port and the clifftop monastery are very well done. Roger Moore's pose as he takes up firing position as a car hurtles towards him is almost iconic. The worst bits are the underwater sequences  although Bond swimming through the sunken Royal Navy vessel with all its corpses is pretty eerie. Overall its a classic Bond film thats up there with Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die as Moore's best 007 outing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Moore always played Bond with a little more cornball and a little more comedy than anyone else so I've always understood why a lot of people don't really like his Bond films. Moore was always slightly less physical than Connery in the part but I don't think anyone looked more like James Bond than Moore. I always thought he did a good job with the role. For Your Eyes Only is a standard Bond adventure that has the British secret agent traversing most of the known world trying to keep a piece of submarine technology out of Russian hands. Julian Glover is perfectly understated as the villain Kristatos. Kristatos isn't a typical Bond super villain aiming missiles at everyone or trying to steal a space shuttle. It's a little more of a spy vs. spy adventure that has bond taking on the usual assortment of ruthless killers and beautiful women.There are some first class action scenes in this movie including some great underwater photography as Bond the the girl battle the bad guys on a sunken ship for a very 1970s looking computer. The mountain climbing sequences are excellent as Bond attempts to scale a sheer cliff to get to Julian Glover's hideout. Those scenes have the same feel as Guns of Navaronne. Much of the movie takes place in the mountains of Italy and they managed to work a ton of winter Olympic type sports into the action. Bond gets chased on a bobsled track and the ski slopes of Veneto Italy.It's a great adventure movie even if it isn't the greatest James Bond movie ever made. It's not the worst James Bond movie either. It's got plenty to offer.".

Movie slows down a little here and there but when it picks up it rocks... literally at one point when James does a little rock climbing. And in this Roger Moore's fifth Bond film we finally get to see him playing baccarat something he hadn't previously done and something Connery did in almost all his films. So minor compared to the international intrigue and chase scenes but I thought worth mentioning. This is absolutely one Bond film I look forward to seeing again!A Kat Pirate Screener".

	schema:headline " Life Death and Alienation in Xenia OH";
	schema:reviewBody "In the first minute of the film a cat is picked up by the neck and is drowned in a garbage can of water a scene which sets the tone for much of what is to come in director Harmony Korine's debut feature. The reviews about Gummo tend to center on the sideshow that is the grotesque nature of the film's imagery. There can be no doubt that Korine has set out to shock and horrify his audience but if you can get past the almost violent nature of the repulsive imagery there is a lot of meat left on Gummo's bones. Gummo may not be a masterpiece and it's certainly not for everyone but at its core it's an effective and poignant meditation on life death and various forms of alienation which cause some to live as though they aren't really alive in the first place.Gummo is a series of dark sketches which focus mainly on the young inhabitants of Xenia OH a town that we are told has been devastated by a tornado some years earlier. The inhabitants of the town are not going to win any beauty contests. The boys of the town are personified mainly in Tummler Nick Sutton skinny and hickish in his features and Tummler's best friend the shockingly bizarre looking almost grotesque Solomon Jacob Reynolds. The women of the town are represented mainly by three sisters. There is Dot Chloe Sevigny a woman who might be beautiful if it weren't for her disastrously frayed and freakishly blonde hair and eyebrows and her two sisters one a shorter uglier and more inbred looking blonde and the other a young brunette child.The boys listlessly drift through their days killing cats in order to sell them. When they do have money in their hands they fund various forms of debauchery from huffing glue to paying to have sex with retarded women. In one of the scene's more poignant moments Tummler and Solomon break into the house of a rival catkiller and discover his grandma in a bed kept alive by a respirator. Solomon asks Tummler if she will ever wake up and we get the sense that Solomon is really asking if they will ever wake up. If they will ever wake up and live different lives where they didn't list through life high on glue where they were loved and normal. Tummler's answer is a quick dismissive hell no and he pulls the plug on the old woman as the two walk out.The females on the other hand obsess mainly about the same things you would expect young women to obsess about boys their looks and finding their lost cat. Yet they too are reminded how little the world thinks of them when an old man cons the women into getting in his car and then improperly touches one of the sisters. As he drives off he repeatedly says to the women nothing new for trash like you. Unlike Tummler and Solomon the sisters are possessed by a human spirit that is keenly alive. However in the end they wind up as isolated and alienated from society and normalcy as the boys.And that is really the core of Gummoan exploration at the ways we become alienated from life during our formative years. One by one the film displays dysfunctional family systems poverty drug and alcohol abuse degrading sexual behavior violence illness and ugliness. Each scene further isolates the characters that inhabit the world of Gummo. Each scene sucks a little bit of life out of its already lifeless characters. In the end we are left with the film's most haunting and memorable scene Solomon bathing in impossibly dirty bath water while his mom serves him grotesque looking servings of spaghetti and strawberry milk. This is oddly perhaps the most inhuman scene of the movie which is saying a lot considering as already mentioned there are some other pretty disturbing scenes and serves as a perfect metaphor for the alienation from humanity that Gummo's inhabitants feel. They don't' just feel it they bathe in it it surrounds them it is their reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harmony Korine did this when he was 24 years old and everything else aside I like it a lot that a young person gets to tell us what it can be to be young. Irrespective of whether or not a young man has yet found something important to say at 24 I don't like it that professional directors' careers start well into their thirties. There's a big age gap there that is only talked about in hindsight after the fact. Perspectives and values change as we grow older whether or not a young man will mature to the point of recognizing the follies and dreams of his youth or he'll embrace the anger and grow up to be GG Allin and whether or not settling down to a regular life is a personal betrayal of a former self I think something like Gummo needs to be made and more of it.This is punk filmmaking at its scummiest the vibe of antisocial angst despair and anger is pure necro punk rock like GG Allin throwing feces at his audience and smashing beer cans open on his head it's about being violent and eccentric right now as a means of killing time and making something out of tearing down something else. Yet it's also oddly poetic for the same reason. It's not poetic because a kid will eat spaghetti and chocolate in the bathtub or because a kid with bunny ears rides his bike around a postapocalyptic landscape of trailerpark white trash but more because it assumes important things can be said through all this. When Korine speaks of life and death whether or not life is worth living when he attakcs society as complacent and apathetic the results feel immature to me this is reaction from a vantage point of being too young to start caring an act of vandalism from the safe point of having your own thing wrecked. But it's good to have these things captured on film then thrown away for anyone who might wanna find them.I read a bit about Trash Humpers and it seems Harmony Korine doesn't feel there's anything to grow out of. Watching him in his Letterman interviews gives me a clue to all this the guy is awkward but he's cute awkward the kind of awkward women want to hold in their arms. I know a skater guy like this he's 30 years old but looks 25 has his face pierced and hair colored blue or magenta for as long as I've known him and is endearingly weird. He's never had a shortage of girlfriends. He reminds me of Gummo where despair and malaise plays like a sort of lifestyle. Real awkward people people who really can't get anywhere in life don't make movies. I'd like to see their Gummos this is a bit too cute.".

Perspectives and values change as we grow older whether or not a young man will mature to the point of recognizing the follies and dreams of his youth or he'll embrace the anger and grow up to be GG Allin and whether or not settling down to a regular life is a personal betrayal of a former self I think something like Gummo needs to be made and more of it.This is punk filmmaking at its scummiest the vibe of antisocial angst despair and anger is pure necro punk rock like GG Allin throwing feces at his audience and smashing beer cans open on his head it's about being violent and eccentric right now as a means of killing time and making something out of tearing down something else. Yet it's also oddly poetic for the same reason. It's not poetic because a kid will eat spaghetti and chocolate in the bathtub or because a kid with bunny ears rides his bike around a postapocalyptic landscape of trailerpark white trash but more because it assumes important things can be said through all this. When Korine speaks of life and death whether or not life is worth living when he attakcs society as complacent and apathetic the results feel immature to me this is reaction from a vantage point of being too young to start caring an act of vandalism from the safe point of having your own thing wrecked. But it's good to have these things captured on film then thrown away for anyone who might wanna find them.I read a bit about Trash Humpers and it seems Harmony Korine doesn't feel there's anything to grow out of. Watching him in his Letterman interviews gives me a clue to all this the guy is awkward but he's cute awkward the kind of awkward women want to hold in their arms. I know a skater guy like this he's 30 years old but looks 25 has his face pierced and hair colored blue or magenta for as long as I've known him and is endearingly weird. He's never had a shortage of girlfriends. He reminds me of Gummo where despair and malaise plays like a sort of lifestyle. Real awkward people people who really can't get anywhere in life don't make movies. I'd like to see their Gummos this is a bit too cute.";

If you're looking for plot development you'd better go rent Good Will Hunting or something like that.

I praise the director for simply doing something different.What impressed me the most about this film was the framing of one memorable image after another.  I think Director Korine was trying to leave people with impressions and feelings.  Whether you like this film or not its impossible to forget.  Plus this film has what I think is one of the greatest lines in recent movie history.  A little girl holding a picture of Burt Reynolds with the mouth ripped out chants incessantly I want a moustache dammit!This movie is worth the three bucks to rent it if nothing more than to see the scene where a fat redneck takes out his aggression on a kitchen chair while his friends cheer him on.  It's more frightening than anything in the Scream series.".

	schema:reviewBody "I described The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover as part of the urine in a bucket movement of art. That's not quite fair  Greenaway had an obvious craft intelligence and eye for stunning visual beauty. This film however is urine with or without the bucket. Its makers would no doubt hide behind that mask of realism and that's fine. But does anyone who sees this movie come away with anything other than awfulness? That's what I asked myself about ten minutes into this film. Does the movie reveal great truths about us or the world in which we live? Maybe though I'm not quite sure. If this movie has any value to the average moviegoer that's it.I'm sure that aspiring directors interested in cinema verite would gobble this up as would the selfimportant proponents of the Dogme 95 movement. Apparently Korine's next film which I have but haven't yet watched  Julien DonkeyBoy  is the first American film to use the Dogme 95 rules.I was ready to hate it. In fact I wanted to hate it. I wanted to reject this as the bowel movement of some notalent film graduate. But I couldn't and I can't.It's something like Kids a film Korine wrote or some other Larry Clark concoction. It's a hardtotake movie that would probably anger most intrigue some and bore the rest. I was angered only a few times during the scenes of animal cruelty  nothing gets me writhing in my seat quicker.The main idea or story here is just a streamofconsciousness tracking of a number of white trash kids. The main character Solomon and the kid who plays him Jacob Reynolds is very interesting. It's a shame he hasn't been in anything since 1999 according to IMDb. The narrator who to hisher credit I never did figure out who it was is only talking for a small amount of time is extremely annoying. Heshe is full of that fake outofbreath gaspiness that sounds absolutely forced. It's the only part of the movie I really didn't like. Well I guess I could have done without the pretentious slowmo. There is no character or voiceover  even that of the sometimes narrator  to inform us about these characters. By the end of the movie I knew some characters briefly glimpsed others and didn't quite know how they all fit together. This is a good thing.Maybe I'm becoming desensitized to grossness or maybe this movie exists in only grossness making individual bits of it hard to identify from one another but an early scene in the movie where a mother and I think daughter are trying to make their chest seem bigger with tape is sort of sweet.There is a lot of offensive amoral stuff here a girl describes in a voice over being molestedraped by her own father the two main character boys sell dead cats to a grocer  Solomon who looks about 13 and his older friend pay a man to sleep with an overweight dimwitted girl in her dollhouselike bedroom. There's also a sort of murder. Sort of because...well you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.I wanted to keep watching. I wasn't repulsed by the movie which early on seems to wallow in its own filthiness. Some people maybe waited for something profound to occur to legitimize the film a la Breaking the Waves. Well I'll tell you now that there isn't. And there doesn't need to be. This movie is like the enemy of another I liked Joe the King about poor children. That film was like The 400 Blows times ten  it had hope for something better. This movie has no hope  it sees nothing wrong with itself.There's a criticism people like Charles Taylor throw around about filmmakers like Korine that their characters are inspected like bugs caught in a glass jar heartlessly. The only scene in this film that felt that way to me was one where two skinhead brothers are fighting with each other in a kitchen. Aside from that the movie I thought was very inviting. It's just up to you to accept the invitation.However Korine walked a fine line here. Obviously attempting humor is always a good thing but when you're dealing with characters and subject matter such as this  it would be so very easy to mock your characters and no doubt some people misinterpreted Korine's few honest jokes as just that. Like one hilarious moment with Solomon in a grungy bathtub filled with black water where he's served supper on a platter by his mother. He takes a drink of milk and instantly pats his mouth to make sure he remains presentable. Linda Manz that wonderfully elliptical philosopher from Days of Heaven plays Solomon's mother the eccentric tap dancing kind.There's a scene and that's all the movie is  a serious of scenes when two boys shoot another boy with toy guns that seems to represent the darkest side of America. The shot boy wearing pink bunny ears on his head lays on the ground frail looking like a strange version of Jesus. It just really got to me. Another scene where a boy and a black dwarf or midget I don't know the difference  something about proportionality are sitting on a couch and the black guy says he's gay and then the other boy comes on to him. It sounds like a really bad SNL sketch but it's somehow touching.A lot of these characters I just wanted to give a hug. However hard it is to believe this film is in the end bursting at the seams with love. The rather obvious and wrongheaded claim is that all this movie does is try to shock and disgust. That's not true. It shows a vision of reality as Korine sees it and asks its audience to accept it. Very simple.If I had to guess I'd say about 75  of mainstream moviegoers including the most sophisticated film buffs would strongly dislike this movie. And judging by the IMDb rating and general consensus by most of the reviewers here I think I'm pretty close to being right. The hate and writingoff that movies like this get ultimately perplexes me. I mean I figure that if a 17 yearold relatively basic moviegoer like me can wrestle with a movie to see its faults and its triumphs then anyone else should be able to do the same. I loved reading one review of Julien where the reviewer told the readers what Korine's fans liked about his movies as if they're a group of nonthinking drones.I don't know who my top filmmakers are right now I'm so underviewed with movies in general that it's sad but Korine with this film has a special place.".

On first viewing Gummo appears to be a collection of random events but after watching it a few more times it it becomes more obvious how each scene and character link together although there are still a few that I am unsure of!!. The nearest analogy I can think of is of a music album. Each scene is like a song that can be enjoyed on its own but when the album is listened to as a whole it becomes much more than just a collection of songs all linked in their own way. Plus like a great album the more times you listenwatch the more you get out of it. People will criticise this film for having no plot and to start with I agreed but if you work hard to understand the film then you will get much more reward and enjoyment then from most Hollywood blockbuster's. The beauty of Gummo really is that there are so many questions that you can and will watch it again and again and get something different every time. This film is reasonably short but it is probably the only film I have seen where every scene has worked. I am a very difficult viewer to please but every scene in this film kept me enthralled and I did not want to fast forward once even in the times I have watched it since about 15 times!! A magnificent film and a great directorial debut from a name to watch in the future  Harmony Korine.".

Eschewing linear narrative Korine explores through the use of vignettes and bizarre episodes the catkilling escapades of its two protagonists and weaves this quest around a set of unrelated but bizarre events taking place in Xenia. There is no sense of a story only a mood and that mood fluctuates wildly from revulsion to surprise. By giving voice to those marginalized from society Korine paints a startling portrait of landlocked America one at odds with the Hollywood clich of its inhabitants.

While there may not be a plot it doesn't need one because the different stories it tells weave together perfectly and you get a great picture of the town and its residents.The film is shot brilliantly as well Korine using so many different techniques so effectively.

I have been a poor white person my entire life and although I've never come across a retarded girl being pimped out by her brother or a pair of kids killing cats to sell to a Chinese joint for meat I have cut through the back yards and sat beneath the windows of the buildings where these kinds of things may very well have happened. They most likely didn't of course. But they just might have...Gummo is a look at things that just might be. What Might Be going on down the street. What horrible secrets Might your neighbors Be hiding? We all play this game we think of the worst things that people might do and we hope in a sick way that they might actually be doing them.Old Man Johnson with the hook for the hand? You know he got that hook reaching into the woman's bathroom in the school some girl took a knife and just cut it off. The guy across the street and I heard this from Judy who is friends with his exwife she says that he used to dress up like a clown and give out candy but one day he was caught with this little kid doing stuff. What you mean what kind of stuff. Dirty stuff you know. Sometimes these displays are ridiculous and funny sometimes they're disgusting and sometimes they're truly horrible but they are always enthralling. Gummo is a series of these displays.No there isn't a cohesive plot and I know that more than a few simple film goers will be genuinely confused and possibly even angered by this point I might suggest that these people go watch some Buuel or at least try not to have such a narrow conception of film. Gummo really acts more like a portrait than a traditional film playing on the viewer's emotions through characters instead of plot.There are no social or political implications to Gummo which may lead to the mistaken but commonlyheld belief that this is somehow an exploitation film. This is not a story of a town in need of a savior that will not come or even of problems that need to be solved. The lack of narrative ensures a lack of message this is a neither a criticism nor a sympathetic portrait. It's a raw feed without morals and it's shot and acted so realistically that it might seem as if Korine were shoot a fauxdocumentary. The characters are just exaggerations of people that you may have come across characters that you've already createdthe ADD boy who plays tennis and has the world's coolest mullet the young girls who put electric tape on their nipples to make them perkier the creepy little gluesniffing boys who murder housecats and pay to sleep with a retarded girl. These aren't real people and Korine doesn't want you to think that they are. They are merely what we've always thought our neighbors capable of and we've always in a sick way almost wanted to believe. Why else would urban legends stick around so long? Why else is most disgusting gossip usually the most interesting? Gummo gives us all what we want unflinchingly and doesn't ask to be thanked.".

Too close to home and too harsh a reality but undeniably a reality that Korine is more than familiar with. Korine descends from a similar environment and I dare say that it took courage to explore such an uncomfortable background.The closest I can compare Gummo to is Werner Herzog's Stroszek not only are the filming techniques very similar whether Korine is a Herzogfan I do not know but it wouldn't surprise me in the least blending together professionals amateur and nonactors seamlessly but both films have a similar nihilist air telling stories that are free of redemption yet captivate the viewer's attention like a travelling freakshow or the birth of a twoheaded cow.One of the main reasons that I was watching Gummo in the first place before even realizing what kind of film it was was the presence of actor Jacob Reynolds. I had seen Reynolds in The Road to Wellville were he has a small but impressive scene as Dr. Kellogg's Anthony Hopkins adopted son. Apart from being an excellent actor Reynolds is ugly. His ugliness the oversized head birdlike features and asymmetric features glues itself to the eye of the beholder one could watch him for hours giving new meaning to the term so ugly that he's back to beautiful again. A shame that the young actor hasn't been starring in more films and bigger roles but like I already said the industry relies more on pretty and lifeless actors.Well this definitely isn't a pretty picture  if you want pretty or artificial I recommend films with above mentioned ladies and gentlemen  and it most likely will not make you feel better if you happened to have a bad day.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER Don't let anyone tell you you're closeminded if you hated this movie.  This movie was beyond an inkling of a flicker of a shadow of a doubt egregiously awful.  There are always going to be wannabe artsy types out there who claim to see things other people don't they get movies like Gummo or at least they pretend to so they can act as if they're in on something the rest of the world just isn't smart enough to understand.  The truth is though that there is absolutely nothing to get.  This movie is not innovative nor intriguing nor even interesting in the least.  There's no underlying meaning to it at all writerdirector Harmony Korine admitted as much in an interview.  It's just a loosely continuous assembly of vignettes depicting random scenes of filth squalor and depravity.The movie is not a social commentary as some have argued.  It offers no insight into the lives of the people it exploits.  The entire backstorythe tornadoserves only as an excuse for the rest of the thing as if it mattered.  It goes like this  first we get to watch a shirtless boy in a bunny hood spit and urinate off an overpass next we meet two teenagers who ride their bikes around the desolate and dilapidated town looking for cats they can kill and sell to a local restaurant owner then we're introduced to three bleachblonde sisters who don't seem to have any parents and who busy themselves with such activities as ripping electrical tape off their bare nipples.  These are the only recurring characters to speak of.  Nothing they do is even remotely interesting or entertaining though.  And every other character is memorable only for the few minutes it takes the viewer to rid himself of the feeling of disgust only to be disgusted again and again by characters he should be feeling sympathy for.And that's really why this movie is so awful.  Don't get me wrong it'd be awful no matter what but it wouldn't be entirely without merit if we could actually feel anything other than disdain for the characters.  But these are not real people everything is actually scripted and none of it is believable at all.The shock value is negligible it's not really shocking but even if it were there are better movies to watch if that's what you're after.  It's not innovative eitherit's actually almost a blatant ripoff of some other more noteworthy films.  It's quite obvious that the only purpose here was to be pretentious.  Of course it probably wasn't meant to be so obvious.".

There are always going to be wannabe artsy types out there who claim to see things other people don't they get movies like Gummo or at least they pretend to so they can act as if they're in on something the rest of the world just isn't smart enough to understand.  The truth is though that there is absolutely nothing to get.  This movie is not innovative nor intriguing nor even interesting in the least.  There's no underlying meaning to it at all writerdirector Harmony Korine admitted as much in an interview.  It's just a loosely continuous assembly of vignettes depicting random scenes of filth squalor and depravity.The movie is not a social commentary as some have argued.  It offers no insight into the lives of the people it exploits.  The entire backstorythe tornadoserves only as an excuse for the rest of the thing as if it mattered.

	schema:reviewBody "I have trouble with the comments of users who find no emotional attachment to sad characters. Those who state that all the characters in this film wouldn't be missed if a tornado did wipe them out  isn't this the ultimate prejudice? Isn't it telling that these people have no sympathy for characters that are children who've been given no other options? Could it be that the pervasiveness of this attitude is exactly why there seems to be no cure for the plight of poverty?Could it possibly be that THIS is the point of this film?So few want to get inside the real problems to understand what's going on. It is impossible to understand anything fully from the outside looking in. I think films and books and music and lectures etc. like this are needed to counteract the fantasies that we regularly accept as reality. Is this reality for most people? No probably not but it is for some and all stories need telling. In a worldview where wrestling chairs and killing pets are considered acceptable and worthwhile activities would we really expect to feel a sense of plot or unfolding or striving? The point it seems to me is that for people trapped in these situations there is no point no goals no worthwhile transformations. They can't even begin to see these things. All that's left by this tragedy of human existence is meaningless chaotic confusing experiences that seem to make no sense and illconceived rushes to relieve the frustration and anxiety in whatever means seem readily available. Do you understand why people cut themselves to feel better? Or starve themselves? Or abuse people? I don't. But for our culture's sake I hope some people care enough to try to find out.Tragedy for anyone who has ever personally experienced it leaves one without faith hope or any possibility of transcendence. Without these higherlevel worldviews we revert to selfprotective mere survival. When this strikes a larger community it has disastrous effects. This film shows just how fragile our safety net of community progress and culture really are  how easily they can be unraveled.I know it's hard for us to see this. How can these characters not see that there is a better way available? Don't they watch TV or movies? Don't they see what we see? But this is precisely the point we have to understand. They really don't. People who live in ghettos don't get degrees because they don't even know that they can. They believe that these areas are for others not them. We'll never understand class problems if we don't try to see them from all perspectives.I too felt horrified to find myself on the inside of this lifestyle  something I hope never to do in a nonfilmic experience. This is the genius to which people are referring  the director and actors' ability to draw those of us for whom these are alien experiences directly and completely into this hopeless pointless world. We actually feel the dread frustration meaninglessness that people caught in these circumstances experience.This is why I read go to movies listen to music and experience all art  to experience life from the many different perspectives available. If you only want to be entertained  there really are only a few stories to tell and there are many artists out there willing to serve you the same McArt to satisfy your needs but for those of us who would like to know more about something other than ourselves and our ethnocentric narcissistic experiences movies like Gummo will always be admired. And there's nothing wrong with entertainment. I like it too. But don't judge films like this based on that standard. It isn't fair. You don't say I don't like Mozart because it doesn't have a beat I can dance to. Or maybe you do. And so you should be able to understand how some people have no way to access another transcendent point of view.I also have to make a comment about the meaninglessness of the bunny suit boy. I didn't understand the symbolism either  and according the director's comments there doesn't seem to be any  at least not in any direct conscious way. And this is probably difficult for any nonartist to understand but sometimes instinct doesn't take on any direct symbolic reference but is still important. Artist's trust their instincts and don't always have to have everything make sense in a literal sense. In fact it is generally agreed that works of art that are too directly symbolic or too literal lose much of the magic that makes art special in the first place. I'm not condoning ambiguity for the sake of ambiguity but the bunny suit seemed so absurdist to me that it set the tone for the absurdity that followed. In a strange way it seemed hopeful. This effect isn't lessened by the director's inability to explain why it was important. The fact is it was important on some instinctive level or it wouldn't have been cut in.Listen to any of your favorite music and try to find a plot or a meaning for each and every line and note. Unless you listen exclusively to bad country and western I think you'll get this point. A lot of people think other forms of art have more responsibility to be crystal clear but I doubt most of us prefer these same attributes in our music. If you understand half of what you sing along to you are among the few. I think the problem is that most of us expect something different from film art novels because we've been fed so much crap that similar to my kids when they come back from a week at a friend or family member's house where fast food is the daily fare we cannot taste the goodness of real meals. Think about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "1994 is oftentimes considered to be one of the best years for cinema by both casual viewers cinephiles and hardcore film history buffs alike. We received films that would please all audiences Zemeckis' Forrest Gump Tarantino's Pulp Fiction Kieslowski's Three Colours Red Burton's Ed Wood Tarr's Satantango the list goes on. As such it's easy to pass over a film that came out that year which in reality was quite influential more so than some of the previously mentioned movies. That film was Clark's Kids IMDb has it listed as 1995 but it premiered at film festivals in '94. While it was met with mixed reviews at the time and mixed reviews now it was seen as one of the first films that really had this bold statement about American youth and that was that so many of them were these sexaddicted hopeless stoners with meaningless lives. While Larry Clark directed this Harmony Korine 19 at the time wrote the script and had a major influence on the film. Van Sant whose film Elephant as I stated previously makes him a more than capable director cited that Korine would be the face of postermodern American directors and Werner Herzog Aguirre The Wrath of God also gave similar praises. The partial writer for one film however doesn't get such praises. A mere three years later Korine released what is known now to be one of the most unsettling disturbing and downright unusual films in the form of Gummo. Surprisingly enough the critical reaction for Gummo has been worse than that of Kids. A possible explanation for this is that Kids is simply more viewerfriendly. Any 30 year old film buff with a decent taste could probably watch Kids and at least get a bit of perspective while maybe questioning the youth of the nation.Gummo doesn't have any questions to ask though. It's more of a work of art that is absolutely disgusting to look at yet fascinating in every way. So for a comparison it would be like if Van Gogh crashed two cars together at exactly 39.4 miles per hour with them perpendicular to one another with no wind in the air. It might seem pointless at first but you may need to look a bit closer to truly analyze the themes of Gummo.The opening scenes describe how a tornado has destroyed the town of Xenia Ohio and we then begin viewing the residents of the town trying to find meaning in their pointless hopeless and overall miserable lives.Korine stated once that about 75 of Gummo was scripted. Upon rewatching the film I can hardly determine where the realism starts and where the fiction ends. I've often times commended directors for having a sort of surrealism realism as Von Trier did so magically with his masterpiece Dogville and Korine takes it to a whole new level. The documentary feel adds to the film spectacularly because it forces the viewer to confront reality that somewhere in the world there are people who behave as the characters in Gummo do.Even the name of Gummo is symbolic in a few ways. The name Gummo is named after the oldest of the Marx brothers who were notable for their anarchist comedy which Gummo is to some extent. However the oldest Marx Brother never appeared on camera he was always more indirectly involved with cinema. Korine here is stating that Gummo is something new something cinema has literally never seen before even if it has seen its relatives Kids possibly?There are a number of assumptions that reviewers make when discussing the film I'm not suggesting any of these are right or wrong but they do exist. Some suggest that the town is made up of Satanists which is how they are able to live in a near trancelike state throughout the film and simply accept the horrors of their lives. These conclusions are most likely also drawn from the images of self harm used in the film as well as heavy metal taking up a good portion of Gummo's soundtrack. Other say that the film is a more reallife portrait of a post apocalyptic scenario stripping man down to his bare bones and showing what he really is. Curiously only a single character in Gummo is shown to have any pathos attached to him whatsoever. This character is Tummler who is seen to feel overwhelming depression in the film as it leaks over into the audience at times. It's not even sadness about poverty or loneliness but rather a state of hatred for anything and everything the feeling of wanting to be dead or at the very least have something to give life meaning.Gummo hits the audience over the head repeatedly with its horrors of this small town wasteland. Teens addicted to sniffing glue teens buying downsyndrome prostitutes teens making a competition over who can kill the most cats to sell to a local restaurant etc. Although his approach is heavyhanded it has an artistic purpose some people live like this and Korine is letting us see within his mind for an hour and a half. There are parts which are nearly impossible to watch but the film has this unusually captivating feel to it which is enhanced by the incredible cinematography.It's not easy to watch it's not fun to watch and it is also incoherent at times. The comparison could be made that watching Gummo is like reading about the Holocaust neither are fun to watch and the imagery is nauseating at times yet many people are fascinated by it not in a sadistic sense of the word but merely fascinated by the fact that it happened. I'm amazed that a film like Gummo was made yet I'm satisfied with its existence.".

Young urban professionals did their best to make as much as they could as fast as possible sometimes through crooked and illegal means. The idea of retiring at 40 seemed like a good notion but those same people with those thoughts are still working today they never made their millions or they made their money and ended up going into a lifetime of debt because they spent their earnings quicker than they could make it. Ultimately the 1980s was good while it lasted but good like that never lasts forever and that becomes painfully clear as Sheen's character becomes a warning to all those who think they can outthink and manipulate a strained economic system. Douglas is a complete revelation. I mean there is no doubt that he is an excellent performer but his portrayal of a money and powermad player in New York is truly one of those instances of classic career work being achieved. Superslick wickedly intelligent and definitely a thinking person's movie Wall Street continues to strike a chord when looking back at a very unique time of American economic history. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

Some economists argue money is an expanding resource and prosperity a rising tide that lifts all boats. For Gekko the truth is simpler and more brutal The rich get richer off the backs of everyone else. Money itself isn't lost or made it's simply transferred he tells his young protg Bud Fox Charlie Sheen.No question writerdirector Oliver Stone feels the same way as he presents this tale of wealth acquisition at its very apex lower Manhattan circa 1985. In practically every frame showcasing the opulent world Gekko travels can be glimpsed beggars fishermen window washers people who never will have access to the whitecollar lifestyles their lowly status perversely enables for others.For some this zerosum take of America clouds their enjoyment of Wall Street the movie. It shouldn't. You don't have to buy Shakespeare's version of history in Richard III to enjoy the morally bankrupt character at its center and you don't need to adopt Stone's philosophy to enjoy Gekko.In fact Stone's attitude about the Street presented here as a kind of Hogarth caricature helps make the film so entertaining. He captures the scenes of floor trading and calls and puts in journalistic detail but leaves room for the human equation. And he has fun a lot of fun especially with Gekko a character who makes you laugh with his pithy comments even as he sets about using poor Fox as a human ashtray.On an upcoming charity event for the Bronx Zoo That's the thing about WASPs. They hate people but they love animals. On a rival If he was in the funeral business no one would ever die! To Fox You had what it took to get into my office sport the question is do you have what it takes to stay.Fox wants to stay and allows no SEC regulation to block his wayward path. Stone's father was a stockbroker and so the director takes special care to show us that all Wall Streeters aren't bad. There's Hal Holbrook almost too saintly and somewhat detached from daytoday business of his brokerage house to the point he seems a slumming Bschool don. John C. McGinley delivers a standout performance as a vulgar greedy friend of Fox's who we nevertheless find ourselves sympathetic to especially as Fox ditches him for Gekko.But of course it's really Gekko's world as we watch him at his desk punching telephoneline buttons and encouraging subordinates to rip their throats out checking his blood pressure with one hand while smoking a cigarette in the other. His centerpiece moment his speech to the stockholders at Teldar Paper is a compelling soliloquy not because it showcases his brutality but because it allows him a chance to explain his philosophy in a way that sounds logical even honorable until you think through the implications. That's Stone's screen writing at its best.Sheen is also masterful in his role playing the naive waif who wants to swim with the sharks and thus giving Douglas daylight to run. Too bad there's a tackedon romance that never really works in part because the character of Darien Taylor is not well developed in part because Darryl Hannah hadn't yet met Quentin Tarantino. The ending is a bit too neat and loses the subtlety that makes the rest of the film so good.But the heck with subtlety when you have Gordon Gekko. Douglas is the reason for watching Wall Street and a terrific one. Just watch the way he looks at Bud eyebrows raised to hold a pregnant silence or enjoys the discomfort of his arbitragerrival Sir Larry a solid Terence Stamp. Stone knew what he had here and makes the most of it. As a twisted morality tale Wall Street is a thrilling scenic ride down a dark and dangerous road.".

Stone's father was a stockbroker and so the director takes special care to show us that all Wall Streeters aren't bad. There's Hal Holbrook almost too saintly and somewhat detached from daytoday business of his brokerage house to the point he seems a slumming Bschool don. John C. McGinley delivers a standout performance as a vulgar greedy friend of Fox's who we nevertheless find ourselves sympathetic to especially as Fox ditches him for Gekko.But of course it's really Gekko's world as we watch him at his desk punching telephoneline buttons and encouraging subordinates to rip their throats out checking his blood pressure with one hand while smoking a cigarette in the other. His centerpiece moment his speech to the stockholders at Teldar Paper is a compelling soliloquy not because it showcases his brutality but because it allows him a chance to explain his philosophy in a way that sounds logical even honorable until you think through the implications. That's Stone's screen writing at its best.Sheen is also masterful in his role playing the naive waif who wants to swim with the sharks and thus giving Douglas daylight to run. Too bad there's a tackedon romance that never really works in part because the character of Darien Taylor is not well developed in part because Darryl Hannah hadn't yet met Quentin Tarantino. The ending is a bit too neat and loses the subtlety that makes the rest of the film so good.But the heck with subtlety when you have Gordon Gekko. Douglas is the reason for watching Wall Street and a terrific one. Just watch the way he looks at Bud eyebrows raised to hold a pregnant silence or enjoys the discomfort of his arbitragerrival Sir Larry a solid Terence Stamp. Stone knew what he had here and makes the most of it. As a twisted morality tale Wall Street is a thrilling scenic ride down a dark and dangerous road.";

People preying on others a world of unscrupulous inside trading and the rise of yuppies. Oliver Stone is one of those film makers who knew the 80's inside out.

The film follows a low level day trader Charlie Sheen who strives to become a very powerful figure on Wall Street like his idol Gordon Geckko Michael Douglas. To justify his rise to power he uses his father Martin Sheen knowledge of the flight industry for his own personnel gains. He wants to get his foot into the door of the oily Geckko. Will he sell his soul for a quick buck? How far and fast will this rising star soar? To find these answers check out Wall Street.This film was made immediately after Platoon. Stone made it clear that he wasn't going to let an Oscar winning malaise effect him. He explores the two fathers theme that he used in Platton and once again makes it work. A highly underrated film that has sadly been neglected by the mainstream audience. What makes it even sadder is the fact that it still applies today.Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can watch Wall Street and take it for face value.  If you want to do that all you have to do is watch Michael Douglas probably the most underrated actor of the last 30 years give his greed speech.  You will be amazed at this man's talent for delivering a performance.  You can watch Daryl Hannah give a flawless interpretation of the high priced trophy girlfriendwife.  And you can just feel the disappointment that your father showed you the first time you let him down when you watch Martin and Charlie Sheen deliver the hospital scene.  The story is a classic.  It is purely timeless.  The setting is as grand as the money that they are playing with. The supporting cast is excellent realtor boss traders etc.  This film is everything a casual movie fan needs to sit for 2 hours and be entertained.  However if you want to look deeper into the film you will appreciate the true intent of Mr. Stone's effort.  Don't get too caught up in the faade of tall buildings trading stock and corporate tycoons.  Wall Street is not necessarily all that it seems.  Rather it is consistent with Mr. Stone's clever work in the past.  It seems that to a creative genius like Stone it is not enough to make the typical story of the kid hits it big and suddenly crashes back to earth see secret of my success cocktail top gun etc.  The intent of the picture may be completely different from the actual medium chosen.  Stone drops clues throughout the film.  It's the dawn of a new age 1987.  The journey from the old economy i.e. the airline industry and paper industry to the age of information.  The sun is rising in the east as shown in the beach scene.  A quote from Stone's character Gekko damn I wish you could see this' is the perfect hint of what Mr. Stone is trying to say.  Oliver Stone sees the future it is a future economy based on information being the most powerful resource in the world.  The eastern philosophy the greed the selfdestruction of smoking and working out. All these things brought Gekko down.  Gekko was brought down by what?  A man with a micro tape recorder.  A man armed with the medium of the new economy electronic media.  He was nailed by a person whom he trained to get information'  Well he got the information and Gekko was brought down by the fact that he was short sighted to it.  Great movie and excellent foresight by Mr. Stone as always.  I suggest you watch it again.  But this time I suggest that you look for the real intent of the film.  In my opinion this is quite simply one of the best films of all time.  Not only because of its timeliness amazing foresight see stock market crash in October 87 and the rise of silicon valley and Microsoft in late 80's and one of the best performances by an actor period in Michael Douglas' portrayal of Gordon Gekko.".

Fortunately Michael Douglas clearly added his own dimensions to the character whom if left to Stone would have been a cardboard moneygrabber.  As far as Stone is concerned Gekko wants money for its own sake but Michael Douglas manages to evince a man who revels in the power and influence that money gets him. Stone's dialogue actually undercuts this perception on occasion as when Bud Fox yells at Gekko How many yachts can you sail!? and when Gekko enticing Fox by outlining how rich he could be says Rich enough to have your own jet  as if owning a jet wasn't the minimum accoutrement you'd expect from the least successful company director or minor pop star.  Other infelicities in the script include the moment when Stone wanted to signal that Bud Fox has reached the peak of success and found it empty following the montage of the condo purchase and decoration the perfect meal for two culminating in making love to Daryl Hannah Stone has Fox standing on his balcony and apropos of nothing at all he just says Who am I?  It has to be said that Sheen wasn't really up to the task of delivering this atrocious line.I've rarely seen a film in which the female lead was so comprehensively abandoned by the director.  Stone clearly wanted to focus all his attention on Sheen and crucially on Douglas leaving Hannah floundering and unable to clearly express just how much into Bud Fox her character is at any one time. At the final breakup you almost hear Stone's sigh of relief at being able to get rid of the irrelevant female probably forced on him by the studio and concentrate on the man's world of stockbroking.I seem to be finding a lot of flaws in what is basically a most compelling and watchable film. Despite the complex jargonriddled technicalities of the subject matter the movie's plot grabs hold of the viewer from the first scene and never lets go.  Of course Douglas dominates most of the movie until Fox sr. Sheen sr. throws the spanner in the works of his son's airline deal.  Thank heavens Charlie Sheen took the unbelievably courageous decision to have his own father instead of Jack Lemmon play his character's father because the two of them perform an absolute barnstormer of a scene in which every word inflexion and facial expression is repleat with absolute truth and it's all the more poignant considering Charlie Sheen's own personal difficulties which faced him in later years and the wellpublicised ups and downs of his relationship with Martin as a result. Had those troubled times preceded this movie it's hard to imagine the performances could have been any different  that's how good they are.Fantastic character support comes from Hal Holbrook the always reliable Saul Rubinek and John C.

I have virtually no knowledge about the stock market or about stocks themselves.  Those who are in the market or have vast knowledge about stocks will probably enjoy the film much more.  However I still enjoyed the film.  When a movie's really good it doesn't matter whether or not the audience member is interested in the topic.  Besides the film boils down to basic universal themes like selling your soul to the devil and money being the root of all evil.   The characters are interesting and richly developed with the exception of Darryl Hannah's underwritten character.  I can see why she didn't like playing that role.  Douglas is always a joy to watch and makes a suave yet slimy villain.  I wouldn't necessarily say he deserved an Oscar but he did a fine job nonetheless.  So did Charlie Sheen who is actually the star of the film despite the fact that most people remember Wall Street for Douglas as Gordon Gecko.  Sheen gives a fine multidimensional performance. I love the scenes between him and his father Martin Sheen who plays his father in the film.  Oliver Stone made a great choice casting the fatherandson team since the tension in their scenes feels very authentic.There are some predictable plot turns and character arcs but altogether Stone keeps the excitement going.  I like how the climactic scene between Douglas and Sheen is shot without cuts with the camera moving from person to person keeping the tension going.  If I knew at least an inkling about the stock market I wouldn't be completely lost during certain scenes but what can you do?  I still think it's a fine film with solid performances. My score  7 out of 10".

You will love the music by Stewart Copland and Oliver Stone's direction and cowriting of a great screenplay.  I went to this film expecting to hate it and loved it.  This film will remind you of when Oliver Stone made REAL films.  Its also a perfect time capsule for what 1980's America was like.";

So with expectations a little bit primed I was underwhelmed by the opening minutes and then further discouraged as it went until by the end I was bored. Maybe the sweeping notion of a Wall Street made of day traders and pyramid schemers and runofthemill corrupt young white collar criminals is old hat. Maybe this had meaning in the Reagan years when greed really did seem to be waved like a flag.But maybe it's not such an amazing movie. It is filmed like a good night time television series though with a longer pulse to it no commercials oddly enough given the theme. But it is brightly lit and functionally photographed. The acting is all over the place but the lead the younger Sheen is just plain dull. His character Bud Fox is meant to be a hard driven risktaker conniving to see the top trader in town and wanting to succeed behind his little computer but he's kind of an everyman instead probably so we might sympathize with him. Just from his lack of energy he drags the movie down.Michael Douglas however pulls it up. He's his usual brash sharpvoiced arrogant rich man he seems to play parts that require expensive suits. Unlike his father he doesn't do humble well but his part as Gordon Gekko requires mostly hubris. And greed. The famous Greed is Good speech never actually has him say thatand if you find it and listen just to that moment in the movie you might get a flavor for the whole thing because he hesitates on just how to word it. The movie as a whole though never pausing in the kinetic sense is one big hesitation. It lacks depth and it lacks any reason that we should be compassionate.Yes the older Sheen shines ouch that was unintentionalMartin plays the father of the Charlie main character. The supporting cast is fair to middling. And the direction whatever you think of Oliver Stone is solid but uninspired. It is really the idea that drives the whole enterprise and the idea is a linear and predictable one.".

Only this time instead of caught between two opposing sergeants in the jungles of Vietnam he's a Wall Street broker and his opposing sides he must choose between are his father played by his reallife father Martin Sheen and a conniving and greedy corporate executive played by Michael Douglas who won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor the following year.Wall Street shows Oliver Stone's skill and craftsmanship as a filmmaker. There's not a badlooking or badlydone moment in the entirety of the running time. And we have some great performances especially by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen. However Wall Street is not as good as Platoon simply because I'm afraid the subject matter is not very interesting and the story is basically a standard rise and fall clich.I have some strong praises for Wall Street however a lot of complaints as well. Apart from being able to predict the story a little too easily to be shocked or absorbed I also didn't become so drawn into the story because I didn't feel a real connection between Charlie Sheen and either Michael Douglas or Martin Sheen. As a matter of fact between him and the latter the relationship seemed kind of watered down. He has no connection at all to his love interest played by Darryl Hannah their scenes just fill up time and slow things down. But my biggest complaint is that although the movie is about greed and pride preceding the fall frankly the business of stock broking is a little uninteresting to the casual viewer such as me. Maybe if Oliver Stone had chosen to explore a more human side to the story outside of the company walls  strengthen the relationship between Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen and Darryl Hannah  then he would have had a better film.Nevertheless in the end I do give Wall Street a marginal recommendation. It's a professionallymade movie and it does hold out as an entertaining and certainly interesting picture however the premise does wear out rather quickly.

	schema:headline " Brilliant look at business and greed in the capital of 1980s Capitalism with performances and manipulation of space and genre also standing out.";
	schema:reviewBody "Make no mistake Wall Street is a film written by men made by men about men and for men. It's a study of conflicting egos and the dogeatdog mentality. Wall Street also seems to double up as a 1980s version of 'dawn of man' cavemen attempting to get 'one up' on their rivals and closest friends. You can just see primate males billions of years ago scuffling over meat from the latest kill or challenging one another over territory. Wall Street is this sort of ego dominated cutthroat quick buck here and there look of oneupmanship only with skyscrapers instead of caves and stocks and shares instead of the latest kill.Wall Street unfolds in a concrete jungle of sorts. Towering skyscrapers desks lined with state of the art for the time computers screens and masses of information shooting across digital news tickers. Do we know what these numbers and fractions mean? Are we ever told what they all mean? Do we need to know? I don't think we are but I do think we are supposed to trust the lively and young Bud Fox Sheen as he translates their meanings and digits in double quick fashion. Then there are the scenes that occur within Bud's apartment as it towers over the rest of the city. It is a postmodern space that would have its wallpaper in a 'mock' style of a dull brick wall. It is a space in which Fox and his partner will just stop and look at their meals before eating them because they are able and it is a space in which we will witness Bud purchasing not because he is but because he can and I think that is the idea behind the film.But like I say the film is male dominated. Women exist in the film's world to either look pretty act as secretaries or be there to make love to epitomised by the character of Darien Taylor played by Daryl Hannah who incidentally picked up a Razzie award. But then again it's not her fault as any actress playing this role would probably have won. This is because the film adopts such a male based approach that it comes close to resembling a gangster film of sorts. The film is about one man's rise through a selected hierarchy. The protagonist wears suits mingles with those more powerful than he is wines and dines expensively will soon not have to worry about money and of course the women in the genre are a distraction they are best seen and not heard which is exactly the case here.So I would be very selective as to who I would recommend this to. I as a white male living in the 'Western' world had no problem with the film and thoroughly enjoyed every twisty turning developing curve that the film presented to me. Others on the other hand might not be so impressed. I think it is because I like the gangster genre that I liked Wall Street so much. The development of Bud is also enjoyable as is the way Sheen's father Martin plays Bud's father Carl in much the same way that suggests 'anchor role'. Carl is the voice of reason and if Gordon Gekko Douglas thinks greed is good then Carl despises the very idea. Perhaps there is no coincidence Carl and Gordon's surnames are both animals A gekko is a lizard which suggests creepy crawling and a slithery presence whereas a fox at least in English folklore suggests cunning pride and smarter than your average. These characteristics are epitomised by both men who share the respective qualities with Bud being a Fox being dragged more toward the 'Gekko' mentality.So Bud is a man with a mission he wants to elevate himself from the desk job and does so threatening to loose best friends and family members in the process his father his partner and his buddy who works behind him. Bud is a man whose quest is just the other end of the phone as he talks to rich 'made it' guys about the possibility of buying into some unknown stocks. He wants to be on the other end of that phone call. The greed and obsession to do well and become someone briefly turns Bud into a stalker as he follows Terrance Stamp's Sir Larry Wildman himself a man of great power and wealth  no surprise that he is an English character being played by an Englishman as this role usually demands some sort of 'leveller' with the narrative's antagonist if not then the Englishman is the antagonist himself. For some reason Hollywood see it fit to do this and it is best demonstrated in films like The Silence of the Lambs and Die Hard Hopkins and Rickman respectively.So Wall Street develops and develops into a cat and mouse tale revolving around an airline. What can we tell from this? Well airlines run aeroplanes obviously and the aeroplane is I think a metaphor for being 'above' everyone else.

	onyx:emotionText "Make no mistake Wall Street is a film written by men made by men about men and for men. It's a study of conflicting egos and the dogeatdog mentality. Wall Street also seems to double up as a 1980s version of 'dawn of man' cavemen attempting to get 'one up' on their rivals and closest friends. You can just see primate males billions of years ago scuffling over meat from the latest kill or challenging one another over territory. Wall Street is this sort of ego dominated cutthroat quick buck here and there look of oneupmanship only with skyscrapers instead of caves and stocks and shares instead of the latest kill.Wall Street unfolds in a concrete jungle of sorts. Towering skyscrapers desks lined with state of the art for the time computers screens and masses of information shooting across digital news tickers. Do we know what these numbers and fractions mean? Are we ever told what they all mean? Do we need to know? I don't think we are but I do think we are supposed to trust the lively and young Bud Fox Sheen as he translates their meanings and digits in double quick fashion. Then there are the scenes that occur within Bud's apartment as it towers over the rest of the city. It is a postmodern space that would have its wallpaper in a 'mock' style of a dull brick wall. It is a space in which Fox and his partner will just stop and look at their meals before eating them because they are able and it is a space in which we will witness Bud purchasing not because he is but because he can and I think that is the idea behind the film.But like I say the film is male dominated. Women exist in the film's world to either look pretty act as secretaries or be there to make love to epitomised by the character of Darien Taylor played by Daryl Hannah who incidentally picked up a Razzie award. But then again it's not her fault as any actress playing this role would probably have won. This is because the film adopts such a male based approach that it comes close to resembling a gangster film of sorts. The film is about one man's rise through a selected hierarchy. The protagonist wears suits mingles with those more powerful than he is wines and dines expensively will soon not have to worry about money and of course the women in the genre are a distraction they are best seen and not heard which is exactly the case here.So I would be very selective as to who I would recommend this to. I as a white male living in the 'Western' world had no problem with the film and thoroughly enjoyed every twisty turning developing curve that the film presented to me. Others on the other hand might not be so impressed. I think it is because I like the gangster genre that I liked Wall Street so much. The development of Bud is also enjoyable as is the way Sheen's father Martin plays Bud's father Carl in much the same way that suggests 'anchor role'. Carl is the voice of reason and if Gordon Gekko Douglas thinks greed is good then Carl despises the very idea. Perhaps there is no coincidence Carl and Gordon's surnames are both animals A gekko is a lizard which suggests creepy crawling and a slithery presence whereas a fox at least in English folklore suggests cunning pride and smarter than your average. These characteristics are epitomised by both men who share the respective qualities with Bud being a Fox being dragged more toward the 'Gekko' mentality.So Bud is a man with a mission he wants to elevate himself from the desk job and does so threatening to loose best friends and family members in the process his father his partner and his buddy who works behind him. Bud is a man whose quest is just the other end of the phone as he talks to rich 'made it' guys about the possibility of buying into some unknown stocks. He wants to be on the other end of that phone call. The greed and obsession to do well and become someone briefly turns Bud into a stalker as he follows Terrance Stamp's Sir Larry Wildman himself a man of great power and wealth  no surprise that he is an English character being played by an Englishman as this role usually demands some sort of 'leveller' with the narrative's antagonist if not then the Englishman is the antagonist himself. For some reason Hollywood see it fit to do this and it is best demonstrated in films like The Silence of the Lambs and Die Hard Hopkins and Rickman respectively.So Wall Street develops and develops into a cat and mouse tale revolving around an airline. What can we tell from this? Well airlines run aeroplanes obviously and the aeroplane is I think a metaphor for being 'above' everyone else. This company has become the centre for the film's finale and it deals in transportation that 'elevates' its customers above a certain ground level much like Gekko's skyscraper and Bud's apartment. It is also something both Bud and Gordon are in direct competition for. Like 'The Long Good Friday' this is close to England vs. USA at businessexpansion round two. Round one was in London and instigated by Harold Shand round two is in New York and involves Gekko Fox and Wildman but while the antagonism is never there between the two sides like it was seven years earlier so much more is and whatever is there is close to genius.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wall Street written and directed by multiple Oscar Winning director Oliver Stone is a remarkable picture that captures the fundamental characteristics of many of Stone's films greed ambition relationships and the seemingly inherent desire to make as much money as possible in the smallest time frame possible. And so emerges the story of Bud Fox Charlie Sheen an ambitious young executive working for a large stockbroking firm situated on Wall Street. With intense aspirations of being a Wall Street player like his personal hero Gordon Gekko an unforgettable Michael Douglas his pursuit of cash women and expensive suits lead him to a moral dilemma between his father Martin Sheen and Gekko and ultimately to a confrontation of ethics within business and personal redemption. From the amazing and unquestionably talented Oliver Stone this film doesn't quite rank up amongst his greatest achievements JFK Born on the 4th of July Platoon but nonetheless provides a piece of entertainment that is by far greater than the majority of films that end up winding through the reels at your local theatres. Stone's ability to confront controversial issues is practically unparalleled in the generally safe and conservative industry of Hollywood and this film is no exception. With its case study of corporate ethics and its comments on the concept of insider trading within the American stockbroking community this film is a success on the professional level of looking at business as well as the more personal elements including the hardline philosophies of Gordon Gekko and furthermore the nature of the ambition that eats away at Bud Fox. The acting is excellent on the part of both Charlie and Martin Sheen as their respective roles as father and son however the clear standout performance throughout the picture is clearly that of Michael Douglas in his brilliant Oscarwinning portrayal of the ruthless Gordon Gekko. Daryl Hannah however remains a substantial dent to the film's overall credibility and poses a serious case of miscasting on the part of Oliver Stone that is essentially unforgivable when watching Hannah's pathetic attempts at working alongside such greats as Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas. Her complete inability to illustrate even the most basic of emotions is ridiculous and provides many cringeworthy moments where you will invariably begin to question the integrity of Hollywood and its casting system. The cinematography and the editing are indeed top notch and Stone's direction is brilliant and true to itself as it always is. Overall an entertaining picture that is a mustsee for any filmgoer or indeed anybody interested in making or losing big bucks within the ruthless and cutthroat industry of big business. Considering Stone himself you're pretty sure that the film is going to be good yet this is unfortunately a little too thin within such a large and monumental context that can't help but detract from the film. A good film though and thoroughly enjoyable.".

He is not afraid to take on any subject portray any opinion and in the process tends to bring out the best in great actors. Even when he does a really bad film and there has been a few...Alexander for instance he still manages to make it his own and never fears to state the controversial. Wall Street is the pinnacle of what the eighties was all about greed success based on monetary value the thin line between morality and the bad guy and all this takes place on the finance capital of the world...Wall Street.Wall Street is the story of young up and coming stock broker Bud Fox. Born and raised to blue collar parents he is desperate to prove himself with monetary value and success. Unfortunately the financial world around him is cutthroat and the master of all this is a business billionaire named Gordon Gekko. Fox has spent months trying to get into Gekko's inner circle and broker for him. Finally Fox's father gives inadvertently gives him an inside tip on a very low level stock and Fox finds his opportunity to bring it to Gekko. He talks Gekko into it and it makes them a boatload of cash. Fox is now on the inside of Gekko's seedy world and he quickly realizes that Gekko didn't get rich by being on the up and up. Insider trading theft spying it's all part of the game but it's making Fox very rich gives him the woman of his dreams and he seems to have everything he's ever wanted but it's slowly causing the people he cares about to be hurt by Gekko's strong handed business tactics. When Fox discovers Gekko has double crossed him and intends on shutting down his father's business Fox uses everything Gekko has taught him to turn the tables and get revenge even if it means losing everything.Michael Douglas in his Academy Award winning role is cutthroat and not the bad guy per se but really makes you love him and hate him all at once. Charlie Sheen who was of course one of the golden boys of the eighties does a good job but I kept thinking that Tom Cruise would have perhaps done an even better job. Oliver Stone does an incredible job of making a very complex area seem easier to understand in layman's terms and perhaps the audience doesn't always know what's going on but you never lose the focus of the film. It's captivating and edgy and controversial and you keep waiting for all this stuff to catch up to Fox and even moreso to Gordon Gekko. Darryl Hannah in another common role when they were trying to make her famous but she's just kind of there and doesn't add much to the film. This is a very intelligent and interesting film and thrives on the whole eighties decade. I suggest anyone wanting to enjoy a really high strung film about finance check this one out. Performances are amazing and the story is entertaining and intelligent. 8.510".

	schema:headline " Fairly forgettable story about greed and excess";
	schema:reviewBody "In light of the recent economic crisis Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street seems as relevant as ever. While it is not about economic matters in itself it is easy to see how a market like the one depicted in the film with people like the ones in the film could spawn an economic breakdown. Unfortunately apart from that there is really nothing remarkable about Wall Street we have seen the story of a man striving for power and success a million times if not in this environment.First of all Stone's direction is nothing out of the ordinary. The music alternates between interesting song choices like the David Byrne songs and Fly Me to the Moon and being mildly annoying. The visuals are far from impressive even though there are some pretty pictures of New York to look at and the way the camera becomes a bit unsteady when something particularly intense is going on is interesting until Stone takes it too far like when he turns a scene between Charlie and Martin Sheen that could have been great into something resembling a tennis game. Furthermore I feel like there is sometimes a fine line between making a film that describes a lack of taste and simply making a tasteless film that indulge in excess. In other words Wall Street has aged badly in some aspects.That being said the film does feature some highly memorable performances Michael Douglas' deliciously sleazy Gordon Gekko being the highlight. The dialog might rely too heavily on oneliners but in a way it makes sense that in a film that is partly dealing with superficiality half of all the lines in the film sound like an advertising slogan. And at least some of them are good slogans surely it is hard not to be swayed when Douglas proclaims that greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.".

The visuals are far from impressive even though there are some pretty pictures of New York to look at and the way the camera becomes a bit unsteady when something particularly intense is going on is interesting until Stone takes it too far like when he turns a scene between Charlie and Martin Sheen that could have been great into something resembling a tennis game. Furthermore I feel like there is sometimes a fine line between making a film that describes a lack of taste and simply making a tasteless film that indulge in excess. In other words Wall Street has aged badly in some aspects.That being said the film does feature some highly memorable performances Michael Douglas' deliciously sleazy Gordon Gekko being the highlight. The dialog might rely too heavily on oneliners but in a way it makes sense that in a film that is partly dealing with superficiality half of all the lines in the film sound like an advertising slogan. And at least some of them are good slogans surely it is hard not to be swayed when Douglas proclaims that greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.";

With this performance I can see why he is an academy award winner.Michael Douglas's performance in Wall Street made me realize that each role he turns in will turn into gold.I must give credit to Charlie Sheen for his part of making Wall Street a success. This movie was not only his breakthrough film of his career but the best one to date. Rounding out the phenomenal cast is Sheen's father Martin. Martin adds so much credibility to this movie it would take so much time describe what he does. Let's just say Martin Sheen almost steals the thunder from Michael Douglas and his son.After watching awful movies dealing with the same subject such as Boiler Room and Glengarry Glen Ross I didn't want to watch Wall Street. However I was pleasantly surprised to learn that this film turned out to have a different plot. Wall Street is a rich film in plot casting direction and writing. This truly is a good film. I hope everyone enjoys this film as much as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greed is Good' Oliver Stone's satirecumdocumentary on the superficial world of Wall Street bank is among his best. After his success on Platoon' which he won an Oscar for this is a brilliant followup. Giving the rather complicated subject matter this isn't one for those with short attention spans. But if you want something complex then this is the one for you.The script is well timed and consistent over the twohour plus running time. The directing styles are typical of Stone's earlier work and there are even some nice camera angles and appropriate cinematography. For the most part of the film there is no soundtrack and no music plays. This adds to the documentary atmosphere and increases the overall effect. The film opens to a beautiful montage of a Manhattan morning showing suitandties' on their way to work on a typical day. The cast is on top form aswell. Charlie Sheen is sufficient as the nave rookie learning the tricks of the trade. He's better and more comfortable at comedy Spin City but he still does a good job. Giving he's third credited Martin Sheen doesn't receive much of the limelight and doesn't have many scenes. Nonetheless he proves that he can play American President Jed Bartlet and a mundane factory worker with equal oomph. But Michael Douglas steals the show and shows tremendous colour as the corrupt backstabbing corporate shark Gordon Gekko. He was well deserving of the Oscar he won for his performance. Daryl Hannah isn't a very good actress and she was a bad choice in this film. While she does an average job of her part it could have been done so much better. In her second time working with Daryl Hannah Blade Runner Sean Young is adequate as Gekko's wife. The rest of the supporting players include James Spader Terence Stamp Saul Rubineck Hal Holbrook and John C. McGinley. They don't give awardwinning performances but they're good as the decorations' that hold the film together. Perhaps in some scenes Wall Street' is a bit too technotalk mumbojumbo but that aside all of the good things are hard to ignore. The film amounts to a toughbutfair but overall satisfying conclusion which was probably the best way to go. The film that shattered the American Dream Wall Street' is another great film from Oliver Stone. It's a real 80's classic and one that lives up to its hype. I give it 7.610.".

This is not a purist's documentary. The seasons shift inexplicably. The pace feels a bit aimless. It contains no useful information about Warhol nor his work. Instead of cinematic orthodoxy however Absolut Warhola offers the quirky poignancy of a documentary on the Cargo Cult combined with a bizarre juxtaposition that perhaps would be found in a Lawrence Welk special on Abstract Expressionism. The filmmakers visit Warhol's cousin who recalls at one point how Andy sent them a pack of drawings and paintings which they didn't much care for so they rolled some up to use as paper cones and pitched the others into the water after the house was flooded. The curator of the Warhola Museum explains how he chose the works to be included in the collection primarily on the basis of their relevance to the local community cows butterflies Lenin and Ingrid Bergman as a nun. The touching absurdity of his discourse is rivaled only by David St. Hubbins' explanation in Spinal Tap as to why the amplifier whose dial goes up to eleven is better than the ones that only go to ten. Absolut Warhola may not be a textbook work of documentary filmmaking but it presents a consistent vision of people whose lives under the shadow of Chernobyl are somehow brightened by the memory of a man they never knew nor remotely understood.".

As someone who has researched and obsessed over Warhol for years I have to say that this film is incredibly misleading in presenting itself as a film that has something to do with Warhol.  It has in all actuality very little.  Filmmaker Stanislaw Mucha led by a man who is supposed to be the Ruthenian Andy Warhol lookalike wanders around Mikova the Czech village where Warhol's mother and father descend from. The film focuses itself on the supposed Aunts cousins and distant relations of Warhol  people who know little about his personal life and share little to no appreciation or understanding of his art.  Many of them have never even seen a picture of Warhol himself.  All of these people seem to have their own interpretation of Warhol's myth.  They all claim him as their own speaking of Warhol as though he were actually born in the Czech republic and believe he was eager to return to Mikova before his untimely death in 1987.  All of them refuse to acknowledge Warhol's homosexuality  in the only section of the film that truly makes a statement  claiming that no homosexuals ever came from Mikova so there is no way that Warhol was a youknowwhat.  They have never seen Warhol's Torso series of pornographic gay sex images or his Oxidation piss paintings nor would they understand or appreciate them.  Their interpretation of the 1969 shooting of Warhol detailed in I Shot Andy Warhol is believed by most of these men and women to be a lover's quarrel that occured when Valeria Warhol's girlfriend wanted to marry him but he turned her down.  They use this delusion to support their theory that he was not homosexual.  One woman also describes her disdain for the paintings that Warhol once supposedly sent back to her eventually throwing out what today would likely be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Warhol's alcoholic aunt comments He looks like a monkey when she sees her first picture of him.The film really never explores what is the central irony of these people  that Warhol spent his life erasing negative aspects of his personality and history from the public persona that defined him.  He would never have traveled back to such a squalid unglamorous village and when in one instance Diana Vreeland referred to him as being from Czechoslovakia he insisted that he didn't know what she was talking about  he was From Pittsburgh.  He disliked the intense ethnicity of his background and remained distant from his family except for his mother for whom he cared until he sent her to live in a nursing home where she died a few years later.  The filmmakers never really explore Warhol himself why exactly it was that he chose to erase perceived negative aspects of himself  homosexuality ethnicity  from his image.  In fact the people in the film represent the kind of puritanical bigoted and unartistic point of view that Warhol so dismayed and escaped from with both his art and his life style.  Even his close family members did not appreciate his art and he remained distant with both his brothers who swooped in upon his death to claim his fortune along with everyone else.  The villagers of Mikova who refuse to admit Warhol's homosexuality and can't understand or admire his art myopically claim him as their own but are never confronted with their own delusions. But perhaps that is not even the point.  For it is also the people who claim to appreciate his art who are also delusional.  The owner of the Warhol Museum in a nearby town sees no need to repair the leaky room which on a daily basis leaks buckets of water into a room filled with expensive prints of Warhol's work.  He also refuses to admit the gypsies of that same village into the museum.  Warhol would have been aghast at this movie in both the intrusion into the ugly minds of his ancestors and the failure to reall be anything but boring. After the interesting moments I've mentioned occured the film descends quickly into filler moments  an Andy Warhol double tries to walk to the supermarket to buy a can of soup a Slovakian rock group led by the museum's owner sings horrible songs about Warhol in the square while the squalid and impoverished villagers look on bewildered and in the final half hour of the film there is little to look at except drunken peasants singing endless Slovakian folk songs until the blissful moment of the credits fills the screen.  This is not really a film about Warhol but not really a film about Warhol's relatives either.  The filmmakers likely had wide access to archival materials detailing Andy Warhol's mother who lost her first baby and traveled to America to be with her husband but all the filmmakers give us is a tree where the two supposedly met.  It's clear that pitching this film as a film about Warhol may have enabled the filmmakers to find funding more easily but they've really squandered their opportunity to make a thoroughly effective and intelligent piece that explores all sides of the Warhol mythology.  Andy deserves a better film than this.  He would have hated it.".

	schema:headline " Moore's last decent Bond very underrated and unappreciated good 007 flick";
	schema:reviewBody "A View to a Kill 1985 is guilty pleasure of mine. I don't think it is a terrible movie like mostly people are saying. I love this film always did and it is one of my favorite Bond films. This is the last Roger Moore movie he did before he was passing on Timothy Dalton. It is very underrated and I know that Roger Moore him self has stated that A View to a Kill is his at least favorite James Bond film because Christopher Walken was machine gunning everyone. I have enjoyed the film it was fast paced entertaining and it had action. I know it does have flaws and mistakes like every movie does. I have enjoyed action and Roger Moore was good in his performance. He did 100 off him and he is acting was decent it wasn't so much goofy or terrible in my opinion.A View to a Kill is the 14th entry in the official James Bond series and the final film to star Roger Moore in the role of Agent 007. The 1985 installment follows Bond as he investigates a possible plot to destroy California's Silicon Valley. The film's cast includes Christopher Walken Grace Jones Tanya Roberts and Dolph Lundgren who made his acting debut. I will say I have simply enjoy this flick more then I did The Man With The Golden Gun Octopussy From Russia With Love Skyfall Spectre Quantum of Solace The World Is Not Enough Die Another Day and of course the worst Bond ever On Her Majesty's Secret Service.The cast Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton was in my opinion good Bond girl. I have read so many negative comments about her performance. Because she was screaming she was way too young for Roger Moore she looked like his daughter etc. I disagree she was good and I have enjoyed her performance.Grace Jones as May Day was another bad girl just like Famke Janssen in GoldenEye. Grace Jones was good as May Day Zorin's lover and chief henchwoman I thought she was really good at her performance.Christopher Walken was good as Max Zorin a psychopathic industrialist he was really a good bad guy and I have enjoyed his performance. He did his job good and convincing and it was good in his good effort.This was really the only movie that was filmed in the USA in which they used Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The movie really had a lot of action scenes. The car chases in San Francisco with fire truck the cops are chasing Bond and he with Stacey is fleeing trough the bridge. I love the mining scene in which May Day Grace Jones slide down Bond and they bring the larger bomb that would destroy the lock. They put the bomb on a handcar and push it out of the mine along a railroad line. May Day stays on the car to hold the faulty brake lever sacrificing her own life as the bomb explodes.Great stunt on Eiffel Tower in which May Day jumps off the Eiffel Tower really great stunt scene. Great car scene in which Bond is chasing May Day with a stolen car. I know it was a stuntman and Roger Moore did not drive the car. In Stacey's house the fight with Bond and Zorin's henchman that wasn't Roger Moore fighting them that was his stuntman and it was funny I thought the stuntman did a good job. But Tanya Roberts did her own stunts and she was good.I liked the opening scene in which Bond use a flare gun and shots down the helicopter that was cool. I really enjoy the song A View to a Kill from Duran Duran. I have enjoy the horse riding that was really joy able to me in which Bond races with the horse on the race track with Zorin and Zorin's henchman has set booby traps for Bond and Zorin's men get caught instead. I like Bond with a shotgun Remington and he has a rock salt in it. Pretty cool the first time we see Bond with the shotgun and rock salt.I did not thought that Roger Moore was that old or was that horrible no he was really good at acting. I am sorry just my opinion. I like the burning elevator in the building in which Bond escapes and saves Stacey I love that sequence.I miss those kind of movies like Rambo Superman and James Bond 007 Roger Moore I miss movie like this? Why can't we get movies like this one back. Again I did not thought Tanya Roberts was horrible or Roger Moore is too old and Tanya Roberts is his daughter. This movie to me is unappreciated and I wasn't bored with it! 910 better the Octopussy in my opinion it was good in my opinion. I have seen this movie so many times and I have always enjoyed it I always had fun with it.".

Moore bowed out of the series just in time well at least close to it... and with a serious bang. Christopher Walken is deliciously evil and psychopathic as Mack Zorin the Nazi engineered genius looking to take over the tech industry by destroying Silicon Valley with a major flood disaster and earthquake. He is definitely one of the best movie villains ever. Along with some of the best music scoring of all the films in the series including the fantastic Duran Duran song which epitomizes the 80's the final showdown between Zorin and Bond on top of the golden gate bridge is breathtakingly exciting. I get goose bumps watching the ending! Many people hate this entry in the 007 series calling it cheezy clichd and that Moore is just too hammy and way too old. I disagree. I claim to be a true Bondphile having seen every film many times over and have read every one of the most excellent and quite different from the films Fleming novels btw the Fleming short story View to a Kill is actually the basis for the films Live and Let Die and For Your Eyes Only and find that this is definitely one of my favourites. A great watch with amazing music villains and final action sequence.".

	schema:reviewBody "A View To A Kill seems to get more than its fair share of criticism. Often it is labelled the weakest of the Bond entries but I don't think this is particularly true. Personally I don't even rate it as the poorest of Roger Moore's Bond outings with Moonraker and The Man With the Golden Gun standing out in my memeory as less memorable escapades than this one.It's Moore's final appearance as 007 and he is trying to prevent a psychotic business magnate Max Zorin Walken from destroying Silicon Valley and cornering the world electronic market all for himself. To make matters worse Zorin is not your average adversary since he was born as the result of a Nazi doctor's scientific tamperings resulting in him being hyperintelligent but also uncontrollably murderous. The mission takes Bond from Zorin's French chateau to San Francisco and ultimately to an abandoned mine close to Silicon Valley where Zorin plans to detonate a bomb which will trigger a cataclysmic earthquake.The set pieces are memorable including a parachute pursuit from the Eiffel Tower a fire engine chase around the hilly streets of San Francisco and an airship crash on the Golden Gate bridge. Moore looks a bit old for the part and his sexual humour bears a greater emphasis than usual of the dirty old man baggage. However he still has an easygoing charisma and good comic timing. Walken makes for a good supremely confident villain and is well backed by the fearsome Grace Jones. However Tanya Roberts might be a gorgeous looker but her Bond girl character is whining and screaming so much in this film that she eventually wears out her welcome. The theme song from Duran Duran is rather too '80s but the instrumental music by John Barry is stirring and dramatic.I'm not sure what all the disappointment is about. A View To A Kill is an above average Bond flick with plenty to keep you entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "Days before the rogue Bond movie 'Never Say Never Again'  which starred Sean Connery  opened in London at the end of 1983 Cubby Broccoli managed to pull off a champion spoiler. He announced that Roger Moore  who had declared his retirement from the role earlier that year with 'Octopussy'  had signed for a seventh movie provisionally titled 'From A View To A Kill'. In other words it didn't matter whether or not 'Again' was a hit because Moore was still going to be around in the future. Loosely based on Ian Fleming's short story  which appeared in the 'For Your Eyes Only' collection  'A View To A Kill' appeared two years later again directed by John Glen. Critics who had claimed the 56year old star too old for the role had to eat their words  in fact he looks in better condition than Connery did in 'Again'. The plot by Michael G.Wilson and Richard Maibaum has Bond investigating the nefarious activities of millionaire 'Maz Zorin'  Christopher Walken . When I saw this originally I chuckled. They've remade 'Goldfinger! I thought. Only with microchips instead of gold bullion!. The two films are similarly structured. Instead of cheating at cards Zorin is fixing horse races with the aid of steroids and microchips. Whereas Goldfinger wanted to increase the value of his gold by blowing up Fort Knox Zorin wants to increase the value of his microchips by triggering an earthquake along the San Andreas Fault California thus destroying Silicon Valley.'Kill' is a long way from 'Goldfinger' in terms of quality of course but it is much better than 'Again'. The equivalent 'Oddjob' is the enigmatic 'May Day' played with gusto by singer Grace Jones. Strangely she never gets to fight Bond which is a pity as the posters gave the impression such a skirmish was going to the movie's highlight. The action scenes start with an impressive Siberian skiing sequence  marred only by the use of the Beach Boys' 'California Girls'  and go on to include May Day jumping off the Eiffel Tower Bond losing half his car in a chase Bond and 'Stacy Sutton'  Tanya Roberts of 'Charlie's Angels'  trapped in a burning lift shaft a chase involving a runaway fire engine in San Francisco and Bond and May Day in a flooding mine culminating in a climax involving an airship and the Golden Gate bridge. One of the film's pleasures is seeing Moore alongside Patrick Macnee of 'The Avengers' cast as 'Sir Godfrey Tibbett' Bond's sidekick. There is an amusing scene with Bond posing as a rich man and Tibbett as his chauffeur. It is a pity Tibbett was written out so soon. More of him and less of Fiona Fullerton's arch Russian agent  'Pola Ivanova'  would have helped the movie no end. Moore was reputedly uncomfortable with some of the more violent aspects such as Zorin machinegunning to death his own men. With its lively 'Duran Duran' theme song 'A View To A Kill' was another big hit when it opened in the summer of 1985. Though it was not formally announced at the time it was obvious that Moore was not coming back. Ditto Lois Maxwell as 'Miss Moneypenny'. His tenure as 007  seven films across twelve years  marks him as the longest serving incumbent in the role. He might not have pleased humourless Ian Fleming fans but there is no denying that he was massively popular with the general public. His successor Timothy Dalton was closer to the original Fleming character but the public chose not to endorse him. It was not until the arrival of Pierce Brosnan in 1995 that Moore was successfully replaced. The look of pleasure Moore put on the faces of cinemagoers worldwide took a long time to fade.".

Whereas Goldfinger wanted to increase the value of his gold by blowing up Fort Knox Zorin wants to increase the value of his microchips by triggering an earthquake along the San Andreas Fault California thus destroying Silicon Valley.'Kill' is a long way from 'Goldfinger' in terms of quality of course but it is much better than 'Again'. The equivalent 'Oddjob' is the enigmatic 'May Day' played with gusto by singer Grace Jones. Strangely she never gets to fight Bond which is a pity as the posters gave the impression such a skirmish was going to the movie's highlight. The action scenes start with an impressive Siberian skiing sequence  marred only by the use of the Beach Boys' 'California Girls'  and go on to include May Day jumping off the Eiffel Tower Bond losing half his car in a chase Bond and 'Stacy Sutton'  Tanya Roberts of 'Charlie's Angels'  trapped in a burning lift shaft a chase involving a runaway fire engine in San Francisco and Bond and May Day in a flooding mine culminating in a climax involving an airship and the Golden Gate bridge. One of the film's pleasures is seeing Moore alongside Patrick Macnee of 'The Avengers' cast as 'Sir Godfrey Tibbett' Bond's sidekick. There is an amusing scene with Bond posing as a rich man and Tibbett as his chauffeur. It is a pity Tibbett was written out so soon. More of him and less of Fiona Fullerton's arch Russian agent  'Pola Ivanova'  would have helped the movie no end. Moore was reputedly uncomfortable with some of the more violent aspects such as Zorin machinegunning to death his own men. With its lively 'Duran Duran' theme song 'A View To A Kill' was another big hit when it opened in the summer of 1985. Though it was not formally announced at the time it was obvious that Moore was not coming back. Ditto Lois Maxwell as 'Miss Moneypenny'. His tenure as 007  seven films across twelve years  marks him as the longest serving incumbent in the role. He might not have pleased humourless Ian Fleming fans but there is no denying that he was massively popular with the general public. His successor Timothy Dalton was closer to the original Fleming character but the public chose not to endorse him. It was not until the arrival of Pierce Brosnan in 1995 that Moore was successfully replaced. The look of pleasure Moore put on the faces of cinemagoers worldwide took a long time to fade.";

And what an exit Moore makes put simply A View to a Kill is on of the most exciting stylish well written and underrated Bond movies of all time.The basic feel of the movie is pure electric. The series is on a role after the rousing successes that were For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy. Both these movies had represented a maturing point in the series and the shot in the arm of suspenseaction and excitement that was needed. This trend is continued to the full with A View To A Kill and in his goodbye performance Roger Moore manages to remarkably combine all the best elements of his previous Bond movies and comes up with a perfect way to leave behind Bond and Her Majestys Secret Service.Cubby Broccoli could hardly have awarded Roger a better acolade in wich to leave the series than to give him the opportunity to act alongside one of America's all time best charactervillain actors  Christopher Walken. Walken as Zorin is the best villain in the series since Christopher Lee's Scaramanga in The Man with The Golden Gun. Walken brings a refreshing air of realism and menace combined to put him amngst the great villains of the series. Equally impressive is Grace Jones as MayDay. Jones is the epitomy of a shehulk and is the very fore of mid 80s femenism.She strangely manages to be beautiful and frightening in the same breath and looks fantastic in the action and love making sequences were she lets Bond know who's on top! Then there is Patrick MacNee as Tibbet. Tibbet is a fun character and when posing as Bonds servent early on in the movie Moore takes every opportunity to adlib ordering and bossing MacNee about. In truth it is very amusing to see John Steed carrying Simon Templer's Bags around. It is a petty that MacNee's character is Killed because other Bond movies would have benefited from Macnee's presence. Less succesfull on the character fronts are David Yip whos character drifts into the movie seemingly to make the numbers up and is then killed and of course Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton. Sutton makes Brit Ecklands Goodnight look impressive. Roberts looks good nd the part is well written  so perhaps it is a case of miscasting. Luckily the beautiful Fiona Fullerton who may have been a more impressive Stacey Sutton turns up as the tantalisingly sexy Pola Evanova.The action set pieces like in every Bond movie fire and work on all cilendars. There is a wonderfull precredits SkiChase battle set in a picturesque arctic glacier. The excitement begins in Parris were BJ Worth doubled for grace Jones and parachuted off the Eiffel Tower and this is imediately followed by a fantastic car chase through the Parrisian locals. This later shifts to a simmilar scene in San Francisco wich has bon Escape a burning elavator shaft and end up driving a Fire Engine dangling from one at full speed through the city. And finally to the Golden Gate bridge via Air Balloon were Bond and Zorin battle to death. Here Walken displays all the depth of his character giving a knowing giggle before plummiting to his death as though he apreciates the joke is on him.A View to a Kill represents one of the finest scripts in the series the battle for monopoly over the microchip market. Even if the climax borrows slightly from Superman the Movies flooding of St Andres Fault or in this case Sillicon Valley. All the elements work. John Barry's Score is his best since On Her Majesty's Secret Service and the title song by Duran Duran is one of the most energetic and exciting of the series and has quickly becom a standard. In all this is a most satisfying Bond movie. An adequate exit for Roger Moore and one that has stood the test of time well. Thanks Roger and goodbye.".

	schema:reviewBody "This instalment in the Bond franchise opens with 007 in Siberia retrieving a silicon chip from the frozen body of 003 of course he then has to escape across the ice on skis a snowmobile a makeshift snowboard and finally a boat disguised to look like a small iceberg! We soon learn that the chip recovered from Siberia matched those made by a government contractor recently taken over by Zorin Industries. Bond is given to job of investigating Zorin a task that takes him to France where Zorin is holding a horse sale. Bond learns that Zorin is stockpiling silicon chips but at this point he has no idea why. The only real lead he finds there is a cheque written to a Stacey Sutton Californian woman for five million dollars. It is at this point that the viewer learns his plans... he is intending to destroy Silicon Valley to give him and his associates a monopoly in silicon chip supply. Bond heads to California where he learns that Zorin is pumping sea water into a series of oil wells. He is initially told that this is routine to test the pipes but when he finds Stacey she tells him that Zorin has been trying to force her to sell her family's oil well and that pumping water into the wells is dangerous as they are on a fault. It turns out he plans to flood both the Heywood and San Andreas Faults while simultaneously blowing up the location that prevents both of them having earthquakes at the same time... Bond and Stacey only have a limited time to prevent to flooding of Silicon Valley and the drowning of hundreds of thousands of people.As with the other Roger Moore era Bond Films this one contains many elements that are fairly silly whether that makes them more entertaining or just annoying will depend on the viewer... a case in point is the use of the song 'California Girls' as Bond 'surfs' on a makeshift snowboard in the opening scenes personally I thought that was rather fun but I know others disagree. Christopher Walken who played the psychotic Zorin made an entertaining if somewhat OTT villain and Grace Jones was good as his Amazonian assistant May Day although better when doing action scenes than when talking! Roger Moore once again put in a fun performance as Bond although by now he was getting a little old for the role. It wouldn't be a Bond film without exciting stunts in impressive locations these included having Bond chase May Day in a stolen taxi as she parachuted from the Eiffel Tower Bond fleeing from the police in a huge stolen fire engine and finally a fight on the top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. It could be argued that the plot has been taken straight from 'Goldfinger' right down to killing the 'investor' who decides not to proceed when he learns just what the villain is planning while this is a fair argument I don't think it spoilt the film even if it is not in the same league as the earlier film. Overall this was a decent final Bond film for Roger Moore although it is far from his best still it is a fun way to pass a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon!".

I found his devilish laughter especially just before he dies one of the best moments in the film. Also his horse related exchanges with 007 are swiftly and enjoyable executed. Obviously Moore does it again with a fine portrayal as JB. The scene with the Iceberg the fight at Miss Suttons house the fire truck the race course are particularly enjoyable. Grace Jones is VERY scary as May Day and certainly one of the most unusual Bond girls. Tanya Roberts as Stacey Sutton is fine and does what all Bond girls are supposed to do  say oh James at the end of the film. With Lois Maxwell and Roger Moore leaving the series its a good swan song for them both. Also the title Duran Duran sequence is probably the best of the lot with its colourful 80's imagery and the punchy track from a great band!".

	schema:headline " Roger Moore's final go as Bond a nice send off";
	schema:reviewBody "For a lot of people Roger Moore is usually dismissed from the 'who was the best Bond' argument. For me he was my favorite possibly still is. Part of the reasons for this is a pure nostalgia factor in that he was the Bond when I was growing up. His films were the ones that were on television and when there was a new film he was Bond. Another reason he may be my favorite is the movies themselves. His Bond films were an eclectic collection of movies that were usually fast paced and fun. Most of his films featured multiple exotic locations  lots of cool action sequences and an awesome villain. Roger Moore's Bond got to duel with Christopher Lee and in this one Christopher Walken two of the best actors to portray Bond villains. Sure Octopussy was almost the Austin Power's of its day in that it was almost a parody but this one reigned in the campiness a bit and while not his best work still ended his tenure as Bond in nice fashion. Not perfect mind you as Timothy Dalton's 'The Living Daylights' would be better this one is still is a good Bond film that probably did represent the 80's more so than did any other Bond film from its opening featuring a Duran Duran song and lots of neon to the inclusion of Grace Jones as villainous sidekick Mayday.The story has Bond recovering a microchip from a Russian facility that mirrors one at a plant run by Max Zorin. Meaning that somehow the Russians have gotten a hold of one of these chips. James sets out to investigate Zorin at his horse staples as Zorin seems to also have an unnatural edge in the racing of horses as well. It is not too long before Zorin tries to off Bond and show himself as the bad guy and soon Bond must go to San Francisco where he must try to figure out what Zorin's plans are as Zorin seems to be plotting something large. Bond will be assisted by a lady that Zorin has been trying to pay off and intimidate and together they will find themselves in a cave that is laden with Zorin's men as they plan to do something insane to turn the world of computers and microchips decidedly in Zorin's favor.Roger Moore was quite old by this time and it was time for him to relinquish the role of 007. That being said he still did a great job as the one thing you can say about him is that unlike Sean Connery near the end of his run as Bond Moore still seemed to have fun doing it. In fact I would say had Moore started as Bond instead of Connery he would likely have kept the role up to View To a Kill. Here his age is apparent as he is older than Connery so one knows that you're mainly getting stunt doubles but they made it work. Christopher Walken is the main villain of the piece and he is crazy good. Probably one of the more psychotic Bond villains he relishes killing those who work for him and laughs as he faces death. Grace Jones is also in this film and like most of the villains henchmen she is a formidable opponent. Patrick Mcnee also does a good job as the agent initially investigating Zorin's horses. Now for the main problem with the film Tanya Roberts. She has the looks but she just does not seem like a Bond girl to me. She is perhaps my least favorite Bond girl besides Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough.So I think this film was a nice farewell for Roger Moore as Bond. I actually thought Octopussy was good too but this one was just a better send off as it had less comedic elements than did that film. Like I stated above that one was nearly a parody in areas. Roger Moore's age does show but he still carries the film well as he faces off a very nice opponent in Zorin played by Walken. I did not enjoy this one as much when I was younger but it has grown on me it is just nice to see so many very well down practical special effects rather than mainly CGI ones that accompany nearly every film released these days. It is also interesting that this is the film that sort of brought snowboarding into the open and made it quite big so Roger Moore's final Bond film did start something rather big and that is rather cool. So is this filmnot even Moore's best Bond movie but a nice cool entry into the series and a nice farewell to probably the actor who enjoyed being Bond the most.".

It's not quite as good as some of the 1960's classics and Tanya Roberts is simply awful as the heroine but Roger Moore is always a treat to watch and Christopher Walken is solid if a bit lowkey. Some of the scenes in France drag on the horse steroids subplot is tangential to the main story about microchips but A View to a Kill is still more intelligent than the mindless overthetopactionoverstoryline Bonds of the Pierce Brosnan era. Roger Moore is the secondbest bond because of his wit alone. If you have to guess who the BEST Bond is you obviously don't know your Bond history very well.".

With a supporting cast of Christopher Walken Grace Jones Patrick McNee and Tanya Roberts and locations such as Paris and San Francisco what you have is another Bond movie with the size and scope to match any of its contemporaries.To start with the good points Roger Moore is once again reliable and believable in the role of Bond and although critics of this movie maintain he was told old by now this is disputable. The script doesn't allow him as much of his custom wit and repartee with the writers dropping his usual amiability towards the villain in favour of a disgusted and repulsed tone which is quite a turn. For those sick of the movies where Bond and his enemies swap endless pleasantries despite efforts to kill each other check out the BondZorin scenes towards the middle and end of this film. Although not Moore's most memorable turn he is very solid as 007.Christopher Walken as Max Zorin the product of a Nazi genetic experiment who was artificially given both incredible intelligence and psycopathy as a side effect of his mother's treatment in the concentration camps before his birth gives us an oddball but distinctive performance and is very credible as a singleminded sociopath. Grace Jones plays MayDay Zorin's bodyguardgirlfriendpersonal trainerhitwomanseductress and whilst she won't go down as either one of the most beautiful Bond girls or one of his most feared villains Jones still comes across well with some menace and formidable qualities that even Bond struggles to get to grips with quite literally!. Both Walken and Jones were odd choices for roles in a Bond movie but both acquit themselves well and gain a respectable place in the pantheon of 007's enemies.Continuing with the positives the regulars M Q Moneypenny Frederick Gray and General Gogol with Lois Maxwell in her last Bond role are dependable as ever and are joined by David Yip as a CIA agent. As in the two previous Bond movies Moore is joined by a fellow agent on his mission this time Patrick McNee as Sir Godfrey Tibbett a horse racing expert affiliated to MI6. In some brilliantly funny scenes with Bond posing as an owner and Tibbett as his valet the pair go undercover at Zorin's stables during a horse sale with both hamming it up to distract the guards from suspecting them as impostors. Moore and McNee also appeared together in Sherlock Holmes in New York as Holmes and Watson respectively as well as The Sea Wolves and their chemistry is a highlight of the film. Too bad really that Tibbett is assassinated in unusual but chilling fashion by MayDay before the film can make more of his obvious debonair charm.Also on the plus side the action is handled very competently with a Siberian actually Iceland skichase featuring some extremesport pursuits like snowboarding before they became more wellknown an adrenalinefuelled horse race in which Bond comes under attack from Zorin's henchmen and a scene in which a Russian agent is fed into a propeller after he is found spying on Zorin. There are also some great stunts such a basejump off the Eiffel Tower and in the aforementioned ski scene. For a Bond film the plot is actually fairly logical although it seems to have borrowed some inspiration from its predecessors. Having said that which Bond film didn't?However it isn't all roses. Tanya Roberts is extremely annoying and not at all believable as California's state geologist and a businesswoman whose shares Zorin is trying to buy. Every time it comes to a fight or some action she cowers and whimpers yelling Help me James' at the top of her shrill voice and spends most of the time as some sort of damsel in distress for Bond to save. Apart from Mayday the henchmen are rather boring this time with a bunch of caricatures instead of characters a Texan oil boss a mad scientist plus monocle tweed suit wild hair and German accent and a tall silent type with a facial scar as his single defining feature. Lucky then that Walken is there to bail the movie out and prove as the tagline suggests to provide a match for James Bond.Also the technically welldone chase sequence in Paris is ruined due to a ludicrous moment in which Bonds care is hit by another and breaks in half! It looked cool driving on two wheels but it would have been better in a cartoon. In keeping with some of the less attractive Bond conventions some of the other action scenes are ruined by an overlyjokey feel  the San Francisco fire truck chase for example is played totally for laughs and like the Golden Gate Bridge scenes features so much poor backprojection it is hard not to laugh. Plus the precredits skichase is wrecked by an 80's cover of 'California Girls' being played over the action and Bond's companion and vehicle at the end of this sequence. For all the problems in this paragraph director John Glen deserves the blame although he was hardly alone in getting things wrong during 007's 40year history.Despite criticisms from some that this is a tired movie with a rehashed plot and an uninspired screenplay A View To A Kill holds up pretty well. Most diehard fans of the series don't rank this too highly amongst the others but for the less demanding viewer there is enough of the Bond formula to appreciate without a great deal of silliness. There are a few flaws in AVTAK but the positives outweigh the negatives and while Roger Moore didn't make a great success of his postBond career at least he had a very respectable signof from the series with this.Verdict 3.55 Well worth watching.".

This was a great story line especially in the 1980's when computers were becoming cool.Tonya Roberts In my humble opinion was probably the most beautiful Bond girl there was.

An amazing performance by Christopher Walken and a very sexy Tanya Roberts. This movie should at least be somewhere in the middle of your James Bond list.

	schema:reviewBody "I can say I am a Bond fan seeing as I own twenty of the twentytwo movies currently on DVD as of writing this review. So far the only film I haven't enjoyed in the series has been Roger Moore's Moonraker just because of the over the top silliness and the obvious sellout to appeal to moviegoers who had just seen Star Wars.Upon seeing 'A View to a Kill' I instantly was prepared for the worst and let me tell you this certainly is a bad Bond film. Moore is showing his obvious age making the relations with his leading ladies undeniably awkward to say the least. The plot is as simple as they come and none of the actors are really given any chance with the dialogue they have been given. Moore has very few witty comments in this movie and most of the other characters are cardboard cut outs.One thing however manages to make this film better than Moonraker. This is the underappreciated role of Max Zorin played by the always wonderful Christopher Walken. I can say without a doubt in my mind that Walken is the single saving grace in this film exhibiting everything any good Bond villain needs.Exotic locations Check! Unique henchmenhenchwoman Check! Surrounded by beautiful girls Check Cold and ruthless attitude Double check! Heartless and chilling disregard for henchmen life CHECK Walken with a horrid script every character in this movie is poorly written is able to create one of the best Bond villains I've ever seen! The way he talks the way he acts everything he does showcases his undeniable talent. So for a movie like 'A View to a Kill' Walken's performance is like shifting through sewage and finding a large diamond ring.It is because of Walken that I recommend this movie and give it a relatively good rating. Everything else about this film is really forgettable. You'd think a superstrong female henchwoman would make for a memorable moment in the franchise but this is so poorly handled that she winds up as one of the most forgettable characters in the series as opposed to one of the best.Roger Moore unfortunately ends his career on Bond in perhaps his own worst performance which is undeniably sad. It seems that all Bond actors seem to end their careers on the lowest of their films Connery with 'Diamonds are Forever' Brosnan with 'Die Another Day' and though Dalton was a great Bond I have to say 'License to Kill' was a weak film but with those films it has always been more the scripts fault as opposed to the actor's talent all three tried their best with the material. Moore is just plain stiff in his last entry! The man seems to have totally lost interest in playing the character by this point.I consider 1979's 'Moonraker' Moore's worst but like 'Diamonds are Forever' and 'Die Another Day' Moonraker was more the fault of the script writers not the Bond actor. In 'A View to a Kill' Moore really shows that he is no longer capable of playing the part and that is the saddest part of the film especially seeing Moore seducing girls much younger than himself with his developing turkey neck becoming quite obvious. Walken makes the movie an enjoyable Bgrade action movie but as for Bond this is where it becomes an undeniable fact that Moore has overstayed his welcome as Agent 007.Moore deserved a better ending and the fact is that he just shouldn't have come back for this film. Octopussy may have actually been a decent departure but Moore decided to try one last time and it really is the straw that breaks the Moore Bond's back. Enough was enough and Moore failed to recognize when he should have cried when! I give this film a decent rating for the performance of Christopher Walken but everything else is very low and forgettable. Go and see it for Walken but it is sad to see Moore's finally desperate breaths as he tries to keep the character going one last time.".

	schema:reviewBody "British secret agent James Bond is called in to investigate Max Zorin a wealthy business tycoon with an insane plan to flood Silicon Valley in California and gain control of the world supply of microchip processors. Can this madman be stopped ?This is seventh and final of Moore's outings as the suave supercool spy 007 and whilst in my view it's one of the weakest it's still cracking good entertainment. It's got all the classic elements car chases sexy women hairraising fights crazy gadgets and tons of spectacular scenes like the final showdown on top of the Golden Gate Bridge. The main reason it doesn't work so well for me is because the tone varies pretty wildly the straight ahead spy stuff is great but there are too many comedy moments like the Keystone Kops chase on a fire engine mixed with a horribly violent scene towards the end where Zorin gratuitously massacres a mine full of construction workers. The mine sequence features an incredible set and an astonishing flood sequence but is really tacky it's interesting that the BBFC rated this film as a PG as all Bond films are but if somebody like Walter Hill or John Woo had put that in their movie it would be an instant 18R. Moore is good but perhaps a little too old he was fiftyseven and mismatched against a great method actor like Walken. Jones is fun in a nutty sort of way but Roberts is a bit of a wet blanket. One of the comedy scenes that does work is the hot tub sequence with sexy Fullerton it's a bit of a shame her part isn't more substantial. The story is completely potty even by Bond standards complete with drugged horses a crazed Josef Mengele character a villainess who switches sides ten minutes from the end and a central premise lifted from Superman. As ever with this series though it is extremely handsomely produced with superb art direction from Peter Lamont stunning costumes by Emma Porteous and a thrilling score by John Barry with a huge romantic main theme. It's also worth noting that this was the last appearance of the charming Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny she was in all fourteen of the official Bond films up to this one and brightened every one of them. Look fast also for a young Dolph Lundgren Jones' boyfriend at the time would you believe as a heavy in the scene where the KGB chew out Zorin. Not Bond's finest hour by quite some way but a spectacular epic nonetheless shot in San Francisco Paris Chantilly Iceland Ascot Racecourse and at Pinewood Studios.".

And he's very funny at times especially when nagging with his servant in France. I love the classy style of the film with the upper class suits and environments. The music score by John Barry is the best ever in a Bondfilm. Even the title song with Duran Duran is great. The opening sequence is great apart from the Beach Boys music what were they thinking?. Grace Jones does a good job and so does most other actors. Tanya Roberts on the other hand brings the experience down quite a bit. So does the strange massacre at the end which is pretty gruesome actually and not really necessary. The female KGBagent is also more looks than brains and is not very believable . Other than that  great action and a really fun Bondfilm!".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't really pay much attention to the James Bond series until I saw the last half hour of A View to a Kill on TV when a channel I forget which was playing all the Bond movies all day long for a few days because Skyfall was going to be released soon. It was because of that last half hour that I decided to watch all of AVtaK and more movies in the series. I haven't seen all of them yet but I have seen Dr. No From Russia with Love Goldfinger Thunderball Live and Let Die The Man with the Golden Gun The Spy Who Loved Me Moonraker For Your Eyes Only Never Say Never Again yes I know it's not an Eon movie Octopussy A View to a Kill The Living Daylights Tomorrow Never Dies The World is Not Enough Casino Royale 2006 and Skyfall. So that's 16 movies plus one nonEon movie. It's strange I didn't realize until now that I've seen all of Roger Moore's Bond movies.Anyway I might lose all of my nonexistent credibility but A View to a Kill is my second favorite of the Bond series The Spy Who Loved Me is first. And not just because it's nostalgic. I think it's got good action scenes and locations. Christopher Walken is great. Max Zorin is definitely one of the best villains in the series. Grace Jones is pretty good too as Mayday. And Roger Moore really isn't that bad. Yeah he was 57 at the time of filming but I thought he gave a good last performance as Bond. And I must say I really liked Tanya Roberts.I'm surprised a lot of people think she's one of the worst Bond girls. The plot is pretty good. It's kind of complex without getting convoluted like some other James Bond movies like Skyfall. It's been said that A View to a Kill has a few similarities to Goldfinger but I didn't and don't really mind since I saw it first.Oh yeah and Duran Duran's title song for AVtaK is my favorite of the series GoldenEye and Live and Let Die would be a close second and third respectively and John Barry's score is also great.".

But to my mind this film is great in comparison and would actually come quite a way up my list of Bond movies. The film is the final outing of Roger Moore before he handed over the role to Timothy Dalton and I can see why as he really is looking his age. But even though he may not be as agile as he was and he may need a few more stunt doubles than is necessary he still does a pretty stand up performance. Christopher Walken also plays an enjoyable bad guy as the psychotic Max Zorin a Genetically Engineered Child of a Nazi Scientist who has incredible intelligence with the side effect of psychotic behaviour. He plays a really quite complex villain which can go from menacingly calm to psychotically overthetop.The film follows the story of Bond as he tries to stop the evil Zorin from flooding Silicon Valley near San Francisco by way of causing an earthquake on both faults located in the area. A pretty reasonable story if you think about it. How can Zorin achieve the ability to control Geomorphology? How can Bond stop him? Why does he want to destroy the Valley? Only the movie holds the key.As mentioned not over the top quite humorous in places and apart from that has the best Bond Theme I've heard in a long time up there with 'You Know My Name' from Casino Royale!".

	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin with this travesty of a Bond film...I'll start by mentioning the one good point of the film. I rather enjoyed the opening theme by Duran Duran even though I strongly disliked the visual aspect of it.Easily one of the worst Bond films in history AVTAK accomplished the same thing that Connery and Brosnan's last films did for them.With Moore now into his late 50's we see that he should have called it quits with Octopussy or even For Your Eyes Only. The films starts off with one of the absolute worst sequences with Bond 'snow surfing' to the song of California Girls. I would ask the producers what they were thinking when they decided to have an almost 60 year old looking Bond try to pull off stunts that most 30 year old can't pull off but I'm sure they are thinking that already. Also where is the classic Bond score during a scene like this??? What an abomination. I would discuss Bond's escape into a miniature submarine disguised as an iceberg but I would rather not have you think about it.I won't go into great detail concerning the plot because I feel like it isn't even worth mentioning. With some Bond films I can easily say that the plot was a great idea but poorly conceived. This is not one of those times. The plot is extremely choppy campy and drags in almost every scene. From beginning to end I kept thinking to myself 1 Is it really getting this much worse? 2 How is it possible that they messed up a Bond movie like this after two great films backtoback? The climax or lack there of was short and completely loony. Watching 57 year old Moore playing Bond in some of the most overblown stunts in the franchise's history was more than laughable. I was more than happy when the credits started to roll.Even though Christopher Walken is a great actor he played one of the worst Bond villains. He mannerisms and overall appearance were frustrating and illtimed. Grace Jones while quite gritty in AVTAK ended up falling short as well. The one thing that prevents me from watching this movie entirely anymore is Tanya Roberts as Stacey Hutton. Again why would the producers allow the footage that they shot of her to even enter into a theater? Her constant shrieking and crying is worse than that of a 2 year old. She played no part in Bond's mission and was a complete hindrance.210".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the lousy treatment that this movie has received on this site I think that this is easily one of the best of the Roger Moore 007 films and ranks among my alltime favorite Bond films.  It's entertaining the story is fresh and creative and the characters are wellcast.  Firstly Roger Moore who was 57 at the time was NOT too old to play 007 in this film. Can we really define too old when actors that are in their 50's such as Harrison Ford Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone regularly star in action films today.  If Indiana Jones 4 and Terminator 3 both came out tomorrow most of us would rush to buy tickets thinking little about the fact that Ford and Schwarzenegger might be a little old.  I think that Christopher Walken played an excellent villain.  His character Max Zorin has it all creepiness unpredictability and an appetite for death and conquest.  Some people are shocked about the segment in the mine scene when Zorin takes out a bunch of his workers with an Uzi.  To those people I say Hello!  Max Zorin was psychotic!  This scene was an excellent demonstration of his sick mind.  Had you been paying attention to the movie you'd know that!  The bottom line is that the cast is great and the story makes perfect sensemore than I can say for The Living Daylights which is somehow rated higher on this site.  In light of this I don't see how anyone could hold it with such contempt.  In a way A View to a Kill is like the New Coke which was introduced around the same time.  It's formula while deviating from the original offered a far superior taste.  Despite the excellent taste it was still shunned by the public and fans of the original CocaCola much like this movie is shunned by James Bond fans.".

I think that Christopher Walken played an excellent villain.  His character Max Zorin has it all creepiness unpredictability and an appetite for death and conquest.  Some people are shocked about the segment in the mine scene when Zorin takes out a bunch of his workers with an Uzi.  To those people I say Hello!  Max Zorin was psychotic!  This scene was an excellent demonstration of his sick mind.  Had you been paying attention to the movie you'd know that!  The bottom line is that the cast is great and the story makes perfect sensemore than I can say for The Living Daylights which is somehow rated higher on this site.  In light of this I don't see how anyone could hold it with such contempt.  In a way A View to a Kill is like the New Coke which was introduced around the same time.  It's formula while deviating from the original offered a far superior taste.  Despite the excellent taste it was still shunned by the public and fans of the original CocaCola much like this movie is shunned by James Bond fans.";

A View to a Kill marked Roger Moore's last film as 007 a forced exercise to him since he was hoping that For Your Eyes Only would be his final not much of a great exit but still a fun thing to watch. My evaluation of this film comes in light of how Bond series changed through the years stuck with some aspects characters situations his eternal drink and why even the funniest flicks of the agent still are slightly better than the ones we're seeing now. It's a generation thing I grew up watching those films and they were a lot of fun. I know the whole change behind the longest franchise so far let me know if there's any other... was to gather a new audience and maybe preserve the oldest just like the Batman reboot started brilliantly with Christopher Nolan and many other franchises went along. But that didn't meant quality in the Bond case. Fine the oldest ones like A View to a Kill were ridiculously in its editing you can clearly see the stunt double changing places with Moore or Connery or whoever is playing Bond and it's very funny and a little bit overthetop but they were fun amazing pleasant to watch. Now all we have is dramatic parts a certain reluctance in acting this never works in Bond films take a look at George Lazenby only instance an agent with so much feelings. I liked the movies but didn't enjoyed them so much Q is going to return so let's see difficult to replace the irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn.Enough with the comparisons let's see what A View to a Kill is all about. 007's mission is to investigate the eccentric Max Zorin an blonde Christopher Walken and his enigmatic Zorin Industries and the masterplan that involves the destruction of the Silicon Valley. And Bond is escorted by Stacey Sutton Tanya Roberts you all know her from That 70's Show as Donna's mom and May Day the diva Grace Jones Zorin's partner and a woman of many talents. Among the action sequences highlight to the chase at the Eiffel Tower and the fight on the blip flying over San Francisco where it also happens a strange car chase that looks more suitable on a Police Academy movie than in a Bond movie. There's excitement and good moments overall some forced moments and an almost empty plot when it comes to the villainy committed just a psycho who wants to sink Silicon Valley? We could have more. Don't even get me started on how bad edited some sequences were the car chase in Paris it's unbelievable how close they were from the stunt double obviously not Moore driving that half car or even endure with Roberts sexy hoarse voice all the time calling James! priceless! far from being perfect. But who cares? This is so much fun highly entertaining it's always a pleasure to see Moore as Bond the funniest and in a good way! and there's the best theme song ever in a Bond movie Duran Duran's title song the video clip is even better with the band members at the Eiffel tower mixing scenes with 007 chasing the mysterious killer.You can't miss this! 1010".

Eddie O'Donnell is the spunky immaculately dressed hedonist who wants to dance and carouse the night away in Swinging London and Patsy Kensit's film debut is superb as Colin'nsO'Donnel's sex kitten who's a real temptress. The music score is excellent which interwines with the plot very well and some of London's well known honey pots are featured like The Wag Club which is sadly no more. Ray Davies actually appears in the film as does David Bowie and Sade.Not forgetting the great songs by The Style Council and Smiley Culture with an underlying jazz groove by Gil Evans.

	schema:reviewBody "It is often said that the British just can't do film musicals. That even though we're pretty good at theatrical musicals the cinematic version is like gridiron football and republicanism something best left to our cousins across the Atlantic. This prejudice even survived the award of a Best Picture Oscar to Oliver! and by the mideighties the traditional style of film musical was at a pretty low ebb even in America and virtually extinct in Britain. Absolute Beginners was therefore something completely unexpected. It was a British musical which owed nothing to Broadway and very little to the sort of popandrock musicals Saturday Night Fever Fame Flashdance etc. which Hollywood had started to turn out in the seventies.The film was also adapted from an unexpected source the Colin MacInnes book of the same name about youth culture in late 1950s London. I doubt if MacInnes who died in 1976 ever imagined that his novel would ever be turned into a musical. The story is set in the long hot summer of 1958. At least that's how MacInnes describes it although Met Office records show that the summer of that year was wet and cool. The main character is Colin a young photographer. In the original novel he was unnamed but here he is named after his creator rather oddly given that the book was not intended to be autobiographical. MacInnes would have been 44 in 1958 a generation older than his character.Colin falls in love with Crepe Suzette an aspiring fashion designer but she gets engaged to her boss Henley of Mayfair motivated by career advantage rather than love as Henley is an arrogant and unpleasant individual old enough to be Suzette's father. In the book in fact the compulsively promiscuous Suzette is also not very pleasant but here her character is very much softened. The film also deals with the Notting Hill race riots shown here as having been whipped up by a Fascist rabblerouser unnamed but clearly based upon Oswald Mosley. The said demagogue is in league with a corrupt property developer who wants to drive the black inhabitants out of Notting Hill at the time a very rundown area in order to further one of his redevelopment schemes.Absolute Beginners was panned by the critics and failed at the boxoffice. Together with the commercial failures of two other films released about the same time Revolution and The Mission it led to a decline in the fortunes of Goldcrest the major British film studio of the eighties. Some even started talking of a crisis in the British film industry which had produced so many great films in the first half of the decade. The film was also disliked by literary purists who complained that it was not faithful to the original novel particularly in the rewriting of MacInnes' ending and the bowdlerisation of Crepe Suzette's character.And yet I loved the film and still do even though the critics were partly right. Yes the film has its flaws. Eddie O'Connell makes an uncharismatic hero and seems too old for the part of Colin who is supposed to be a teenager. O'Connell has faded from view since 1986 to such an extent that I have been unable to find his exact date of birth but he appears to be about thirty. The storyline does not always flow smoothly perhaps not surprisingly given that it was the first feature film of its director Julien Temple thitherto better known as the maker of pop videos and a documentary about the Sex Pistols. As for the literary purists they are certainly right about its lack of fidelity to its literary source although in its defence I should say that had it not been for this film I should in all probability never have discovered MacInnes' brilliant novel or his other writings.The acting like much in the film is deliberately stylised. Those who call it wooden are missing the point. The lovely Patsy Kensit makes a delightful heroine as Suzette in what has been described as her breakthrough role. At the time she was hailed as the British Bardot and is still a familiar face even if she has never achieved her muchquoted ambition to be more famous than anything or anyone.Despite its faults Absolute Beginners is a cool and stylish movie. It probably has little to do with the fifties as they actually were but a lot to do with the fifties as they should have been. It has an immense drive and energy with an absolutely irresistible soundtrack. Modern audiences might be surprised that this is largely jazz based given that we now tend to look back at the late fifties as the birth of the rockandroll era. At that time in Britain however before the rise of the Beatles jazz was still very much part of the youth scene particularly of the mod subculture rock being associated with the mods' rivals the rockers. A number of leading musicians such as David Bowie Sade and the Style Council contributed to the film. Bowie also makes an acting contribution as the property developer Vendice Partners.I have a personal reason why this film is a favourite. It brings back memories a long hot summer not that of 1958 when I was not even born but that of 1986. At the time I was young and in love and went to see the film with my girlfriend. I remember us coming out of the cinema together on a warm summer's evening exhilarated by what we had just seen and walking along the London Embankment laughing and singing Bowie's great theme song to one another. As long as we're together all the rest can go to hell I absolutely love you. With a memory like that how could I do other than love this film? 810".

A political piece as well as a time piece Temple captured the feel of a Broadway or West End musical perfectly. A great turnaround for Temple who really had me worried after directing 'Mantrap'. It is a musical so liberties have to be allowed but for fans of the musical this is a great one to check out. Rating 2740".

	schema:reviewBody "The overambitious Absolute Beginners is one of those films that is difficult because it frustrates you of its potential to be excellent. And while it had excellent parts those parts were better than the whole. The performances were fine although one never finds oneself caring too much about any of the characters. That point would be irrelevant in some other film. But in the last thirty minutes or so at the beginning of the race riots that caring would be the drive that would keep the viewer from turning it off. While I did not stop the film I did fast forward it. Ten minutes would have been more than enough as it never needed to be that redundant. Even at ten minutes it would have felt tacked on much less over thirty. It left a bad taste on a film that so far was pretty decent. A large musical number at the end would have been appropriate not a halfhour parade of blood fire and broken glass.But let us draw on some of its virtues which it has as many as it does faults. The opening shot is wonderful showing us a colorful Swinging London with choreographed movements by the streetwalkers some of them anyway. The songs unlike a large amount of film musicals have been welded with the story. They flow. They need to be there. The songs express what words cannot. The actors SHOULD be breaking out into song. And further than that they are good. The color is another main enjoyment as the whole story had to do with glitter flash and things that are attractive. Crammed stuffed with color as it should be. Examples of this are the opening shot the wonderful unveiling of Suzette at the fashion show the first club scene etc. While the characters are very two dimensional they are well acted and their motivations are always very clear. Yes the characters never emerge from plot points to actual human beings but that is a minor drawback.The songs. When mentioning Absolute Beginners one must mention Ray Davies and the Kinks' number Quiet Life. One of the most brilliant musical numbers in the film is not crucial to the story. However I am most glad that it was left in. Painful mildly disturbing and darkly funny at times it is catchy and simply excellent. The songs performed by the child rock star were quite annoying but then again I find a fourteen year old boy singing irritating in itself. Having it All as well as Colin's song following are both very good and as I see it essential to the story. Selling Out is wonderful and essential to making the motivations of Colin more clear. The David Bowie number Motivation is more visually stimulating than musically. The song is nothing special while its Busbey Berkely style complemented by quick editing is the main attraction. Killer Blow performed onscreen by Sade a nice bonus is a fine songsequence. Besides it not being available on widescreen DVD it is a shame that the CD is not available as it would be a nice listen every once in a while.It could have been SO much better. It should have been so much better. Whatever made the writersdirector feel that the didactic antiracism message needed to be crammed in at the end I'll never know. Note It's not the message I mind a bit but the cramming in of 30 minutes of yelling and violence. It's a musical and one which racism wasn't even its main focus. And the ending SPOILER AHEAD about Colin and Suzette back together hasn't any basis on which it should be considered a happy ending. Aren't they at heart two different people?But if you see it for rental at your video store do get it. I own it. I just know where to stop the film isn't necessarily at the end credits.".

No doubt a goodlooking picture with candycolor saturated sets and costumes but that's where its appeal ends. Mostly forgettable songs and production values that worked well for short format music videos are all too much for one to endure as a 2 hour feature. The rushed often cringeinducing dialog sloppy overdubbing endless jumpcuts even the claustrophobic framing are unsettling enough to inspire angst in anyone. There's something odd about the timing pacing and overall flow that feels so foreign and unnatural  like watching a really long television commercial. In any case this is not an enjoyable film. A 1950's story trapped in a 1980's medium. Hopelessly dated.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't exactly hold high expectations for this and I admit I watched it solely for David Bowie. But any hopes or expectations I held were speedily dashed.What the hell WAS this farrago? A British West Side Story with much less compelling music. Instead of Jets vs. Sharks it was Teds neofascists and greedy developers vs. just about the entire rest of society. In 1958the year of the story I was 12 years old on the verge of becoming a teenager this mysteriously powerful being lauded by the film as a kind of godlike figure. But the glamorization of such nasty people and the romanticism of violence improbable situations is SO unlikely and hard to swallow.

But any hopes or expectations I held were speedily dashed.What the hell WAS this farrago? A British West Side Story with much less compelling music. Instead of Jets vs. Sharks it was Teds neofascists and greedy developers vs. just about the entire rest of society. In 1958the year of the story I was 12 years old on the verge of becoming a teenager this mysteriously powerful being lauded by the film as a kind of godlike figure. But the glamorization of such nasty people and the romanticism of violence improbable situations is SO unlikely and hard to swallow.

In addition to suffering from looking too 1980s the characters have been changed rearranged and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and of course their names Suze is transformed from the narrator's flighty exgirlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money at her own admittance in the first few pages into a hapless and naive Evearchetype seduced by fame and glamour exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss who surprisingly wasn't given a Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle. She and the narrator renamed Colin after the book's author Colin MacInnes for the film are also in a relationship.Big Jill's character a lesbian seemingly butch yet fop like in her mid20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubbleheaded lesbians and one of the narrator's closest friends dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator is reduced to a sort of named extra with only a few throwaway lines and tonnes of comical outfits.The Fabulous Hoplite a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film campedup and all but ignored.The narrator's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film he's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator's mum seems for all practical purposes ignored.In its favour the music for what it is is wellcomposed and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book ...some days they'll write musicals about the 1950s... as their inspiration to write a musical but in the world of bad campedup musicals this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch. Unlike Shock Treatment or Starstruck crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts. Unlike The Apple there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue.You really can't blame it's too 1980s feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s. The film version of Annie released in 1981 pays a wonderfully wellexecuted tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s and Napolean Dynamite manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 though it's not explicitly set in the 1980s those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film feels very 1980s. Obviously it was possible to make something good out of this especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK but it fails most apparently in the look and feel and also in its treatment of the source material which is downright disrespectful.Perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late1950s Soho London's modernist jazz set. I can definitely see what the writing team were attempting but they definitely could have done better. With Boy George as a household name and mixedrace musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 UK they definitely did not need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing. In fact I'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly  it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teenaged audience like twobit idiots to make a quick buck off of.".

Obviously it was possible to make something good out of this especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK but it fails most apparently in the look and feel and also in its treatment of the source material which is downright disrespectful.Perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late1950s Soho London's modernist jazz set. I can definitely see what the writing team were attempting but they definitely could have done better. With Boy George as a household name and mixedrace musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 UK they definitely did not need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing. In fact I'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly  it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teenaged audience like twobit idiots to make a quick buck off of.";

It's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen  each one with no apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan and I really appreciate musicals.  In finality Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. The moral of the story was really befuddling.  I couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out. For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the no selling out message.  When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up.  Maybe I rented half of two different movies?  Nope there was a Keep Britain White song and dance sequence. I'm sorry but WWII is not something you can write a musical about.  At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as I have several times in this review. Overall I'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors.  And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit! My grade C".

Alas this outing proved to be a disappointment in more fields than one.The film's story is meant to tell the story of a young photographer's romance with a nightclub singer and his corruption by a greedy advertising agent. And then there's some subplot about racial tensions escalating to rioting. Sadly the story immediately falls flat on impact as soon as the protagonist begins his voiceover of the film's events. The performances of Eddie O'Connell and Patsy Kinset are particularly painful as their romantic chemistry is clearly lacking. Kinset comes off as whiny at the worst times or she is completely uninterested in interacting with her fellow actors. Her big song early in the film is instantly forgettable as she repeats the song's title over and over that it is maddeningly irritating. O'Connell as well is not much of an actor as he speaks his lines with a lack of passion like just reading the script without emotion. His own singing is also unremarkable like Kinset's lack of passion or real talent in the art.Terribly unused and meant to be a major player in the film is David Bowie as the corrupt Vendice Partners. Given Bowie's proved acting abilities in the past the filmmakers seemed to have discarded this detail except for Bowie's songwriting ability and terrific vocals. Bowie wrote the film's title song that plays over the opening credits and is the film's only memorable musical number and has his own musical number within the narrative. Sadly the performance and musical sequence is utterly forgettable after the film's end which is a crying shame for the gravitas that David Bowie brings to his film performances.If you want an example of how not to do a musical this is a sure bet.".

	schema:reviewBody "The overambitious Absolute Beginners is one of those films that frustrates you because of its potential to be excellent. And while it had excellent parts those parts were better than the whole. The performances were fine although one never finds oneself caring too much about any of the characters. That point would be irrelevant in some other film. But in the last thirty minutes or so at the beginning of the race riots that caring would be the drive that would keep the viewer from turning it off. While I did not stop the film I did fast forward it. Ten minutes would have been more than enough as it never needed to be that redundant. Even at ten minutes it would have felt tacked on much less over thirty. It left a ba d tasted on a film that so far was pretty decent. A large musical number at the end would have been appropriate not a halfhour parade of blood fire and broken glass. But let us draw on some of its virtues which it has as many as it does faults. The opening shot is wonderful showing us a colorful Swinging London with choreographed movements by the streetwalkers some of them anyway. The songs unlike a large amount of film musicals have been welded with the story. They flow. They need to be there. The songs express what words cannot. The actors SHOULD be breaking out into song. And further than that they are good. The color is another main enjoyment as the whole story had to do with glitter flash and things that are attractive. Crammed stuffed with color as it should be. Examples of this are the opening shot the wonderful unveiling of Suzette at the fashion show the first club scene etc. While the characters are very two dimensional they are well acted and their motivations are always very clear. Yes the characters never emerge from plot points to actual human beings but that is a minor drawback. The songs. When mentioning Absolute Beginners one must mention Ray Davies and the Kinks' number Quiet Life. One of the most brilliant musical numbers in the film is not crucial to the story. However I am most glad that it was left in. Painful mildly disturbing and darkly funny at times it is catchy and simply excellent. The songs performed by the child rock star were quite annoying but then again I find a fourteen year old boy singing irritating in itself. Having it All as well as Colin's song following are both very good and as I see it essential to the story. Selling Out is wonderful and essential to making the motivations of Colin more clear. The David Bowie number Motivation is more visually stimulating than musically. The song is nothing special while its Busbey Berkely complemented by quick editing is the main attraction. Killer Blow performed onscreen by Sade a nice bonus is a fine songsequence. Besides it not being available on widescreen DVD it is a shame that the CD is not available as it would be a nice listen every once in a while. It could have been SO much better. It should have been so much better. Whatever made the writersdirector feel that the didactic antiracism message needed to be crammed in at the end I'll never know. Note It's not the message I mind a bit but the cramming in of 30 minutes of yelling and violence. It's a musical and one which racism wasn't even its main focus. And the ending SPOILER AHEAD about Colin and Suzette back together hasn't any basis on which it should be considered a happy ending. Aren't they at heart two different people? But if you see it for rental at your video store do get it. I own it. I just know where to stop the film isn't necessarily at the end credits.".

Some films that influenced AB are West Side Story 1961 Tommy 1975 and Streets of Fire 1984. Streets of Fire featured a similar story of a girl choosing a rich guy trading the streets for security against a backdrop of urban nightlife and confrontation set to the lush music of the 50s and later.But the film AB reminds me of the most is One from the Heart 1982 Coppola's sound stage masterpiece. AB employs the same kind of stylish presentation with sets bathed in primary colors and moody shadows and camera movement that flows through the sets or insinuates itself through odd angles or unique perspectives.AB is very ambitious. With a talented cast of actors singers and dancers it reflects on the invention of the teenager in America the search for monetary success and the inevitable selling out the gentrification of London and its racial implications criticism of capitalism through its supposedly representative advertising and marketing industries and the proliferation of hate groups especially those grounded in racial prejudice.But the music is what drives this film and it is worth seeing for the music alone. David Bowie Ray Davies and Sadeamong many othersare showcased on a soundtrack that includes 50s rock influences from rockabilly to punk.AB stresses style over substance but there is plenty to think about. I think repeated viewings would reveal more and more as this film is dense with imagery and dialogue.Watch for the beautiful Patsy Kensit playing Suzette. And the credits show that Bruno Tonioli Dancing with the Stars plays a Maltese lodgersomething fun to look for.It is also fun to note the 50s references in the film. For example a hula hoop.

	schema:reviewBody "At its beginning Gigantic English title seems a fun story of three friends united by their shared interest in girls cars and avoiding the responsibilities the futurewill invariably bring.  By its end Gigantic has become one of the most moving and charming films about the ties that bind that I've seen in recent years.Hamburg complete with its drab industrial foreshores and sometimes uninviting urban decay is the setting for Gigantic and is as much as character as the three friends Lloyd Walter and Rocco.  It's no surprise once we've trawled past the faceless apartment blocks and rusting waterfront sheds that Lloyd wants out.  What is a surprise is that he springs his news on his great friends with no time to prepare them for the shock. He leaves tomorrow at sunrise.In spite of their anger and fear Walter and Rocco go along with Lloyd's desire to have one great final night together.  It begins fervently excitingly but as events go awry and daylight slowly inches over the horizon the crushing reality of what is to follow sets in for the trio who along the way also pick up their next door neighbour the gorgeous but self destructive Tesla.Debut directorwriter Sebastian Schipper knows the value of understatement. Instead of stuffing his screenplay full of worthy but dull ruminations on the meaning and importance of friendships he lets his characters do the talking for him.  Boldly Schipper uses a single funereal piece of music over and over to signify moments of emotional crisis for his characters. The move is risky but pays dividends  Lloyd Walter and Rocco don't have to say much to get across what they are really feeling. It's also a testament to the abilities of the actors playing these parts that you feel greatly for their pasts presents and especially futures.The finale of Gigantic is heartbreaking and deliberately ambiguous.  Not only is it the perfect conclusion to the chaotic night before it which is in itself a metaphor for the inherent turmoil of close friendships it is enough to make you want to go out and phone every friend you haven't spoken to in years to find out how they are doing.  Few films have the ability to move and entertain as well as say something about the pain and joy of simply being alive and knowing other people.  Gigantic is one of them.  It's a masterpiece.".

The music is perfect as it helps the audience realize the sadness these people must feel knowing that they will never be together again. The script is very funny and the direction is perfect as Schlipper is able to let the story pause and simply film Floyd Ricco and Walter as they sit in silence. However somehow the film does not turn into a longwinded cheesefest. Along with Tom TykwerI think that's how you spell it who produced the film I think Schlipper is a talent to watch cos if there's any justice in the world he will have a bright future.

Floyd Walter and Ricco have only one last night together to come to terms with the fact that Floyd will ship out on a freighter the next morning. They drift into that bleak Hamburg night like they would on any other and the mundane becomes suddenly extraordinary as the reality of the impending farewell percolates through their celebration . What they leave behind in the night is that  total abandon you can only afford those few years between being a kid and suddenly being old.This is one from the heart. It's got everything the riotous humor and fun of outrunning the crew of an Elvis stuntshow the tempo and jumpcuts of a strobelight punkclub a heart as big as the V 8 Walter puts in his Ford Granada and the thrill of a deathmatch...in foosball !!The film reminds us how intoxicating friendship can be and how good it can feel to be that drunk from a toast to a leaving friend. Like the perfect song  happy in its rhythm sad in its melody. Floyd says early into the film something like I wish everyone could have his own soundtrack that there would always be music. So that if you're really down there would still be the music...and when you're the happiest in your life the record would skip and the moment would never end... After their last night when Floyd looks up into the Hamburg sky one last time the soundtrack to the film DOES skip and captures that perfect moment the essence of parting that loss that really isn't and that unbearable inevitability that tomorrow your best friends will be far away.I can only hope that this  total charmer finds a distributor in the U.S.. I'm sure it would find an audience somewhere in the same aisles that loved that Big Wednesday coming of age urgency the tempo and irreverence of Go the unpretentious humor of  It's a jungle out there or  No more Mr. nice guy and the unspoken loyalty in any of the Winnetou movies. As for Sebastian Schipper the Director whose eloquence in talking about his film  and cars  at the German Filmfestival in Los Angeles rivals the ease with which this film speaks to you  In a way I'm already sorry to see him becoming famous. He'll soon join  Tom Tykwer as the posterboy for the new german film and I'm afraid he'll lose his genius eye and savant heart much like he lost his enthusiasm for foosball........".

The movie depicts the funny and sad adventures of the trio during that last night involving an argument with some diehard Elvis fans the most nerveracking tablefootball match in film history and way too much alcohol.The whole thing is so beautiful in a bittersweet way that you wish the film would go on forever. You want to see more about Ricco's family about the barflies at Horst's and especially about Telsa the girl next door who is played incredibly cute and vulnerable by Julia Hummer in her film debut. But if a film is too short it's always a compliment not a fault.Sebastian Schipper in his debut as a director really knew what he was doing although or because? he sometimes doesn't play by the established rules. For example he uses refreshingly little dialogue for a german film and he even lets it go on for a few more minutes after the last words havebeen said telling the end just with images. And those images are brilliant since the director of photography was Frank Griebe Lola rennt. IMO the movie gets 9 out of 10.".

Wellknown actors would never have this genious individual style of laughing screaming talking. The tragic melancholic style gives a perfect view which beauty lies in Hamburg in the early morning driving around with your best friends knowing that these times will be over soon.

It's one of the flicks showing that it's possible to compensate a lack of big money through passion. Schipper tells the story of three friends and their last night together as one of them Floyd feels he have to leave town the next morning  probably forever. They decide to make the best out of it in nightly Hamburg... I think this movie is mostly focused on it's characters and on it atmosphere. The cinematography everything looks a little bit cold and the great soundtrack mostly provided by Germany indieheroes The Notwist just support that atmosphere which is kind of melancholic not in a depressing but in a humorous way. The main characters are likable the viewer can relate to them within a few minutes even though only very basic informations concerning their backgrounds are given. That's also because one of the strong points of the film is the cast there's a great chemistry between the main actors and they are able to transport a lot not only by words but also by gestures and looks. So as opposite to most other German films not everything has to be discussed some things just stay unsaid. So don't expect impressing photography or any outstanding direction but if you're interested in sometimes sad sometimes funny 80 minutes give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "Absolute Giganten is one of the best examples of Neuer Deutscher Film. It's wild has a mostly young cast and feels like permanently in motion. In the film's center are three young men one of whom is going to leave for Africa in the morning as we find out 20 minutes into the film. So the trio spends a final night together and meets all kinds of strangely fascinating characters on their journey. The film is written and directed by Sebastian Schipper his first of so far 4 works. Over 15 years ago when this was made Schipper was roughly 30 years old. He is also a pretty prolific actor and aside from being a current Tatort detective his 2 most known films with regard to performing are Lola rennt and Best Picture Academy Award winner The English Patient. Actually younger than him in this film here were all 3 lead actors and Julia Hummer who was only 18 when Absolute Giganten was made her first project. This film and a couple more afterward propelled her into the list of most promising young actresses from Germany. Unfortunately she has not worked too much in the last 10 years or in not too known projects so not too many remember her.Another notable thing about the film is its runtime. You hardly find any film today which runs for only 70 minutes not counting the credits. Also the title does not bear much connection to the story and sounds a bit random. Florian Lukas is the one from the trio who got most awards recognition for its performance maybe because he was the loudest and most inyourface from the three. Monot's still beardless and Giering's tragically dead from alcohol poisoning now characters seem slightly similar actually. Lukas' most known work so far is Good Bye Lenin!. He won a German Film Award for that. Monot's is Das Experiment and Giering's is probably Funny Games two years before Absolute Giganten. Funnily enough all three of them were only supporting characters to more famous German actors in these films Brhl Bleibtreu Mhe.The German Film Awards honored this movie as the 2nd best of the year behind Oskar Roehler's Die Unberhrbare featuring Hannelore Elsner in the lead role. A deserved honor. I enjoyed watching this film and its strength is certainly its writing not necessarily all the dialogs but the action here feels very fresh and authentic. There are really not many moments that felt predictable. One would be the goalie goal during the table football game. But that is just a very minor criticism. Recommended.".

The three main characters are doing a great job especially Florian Lukas as Ricco. The table soccer scene is awesome shot.

There you go German rapper Marcnesium from 5 Sterne Deluxe has a cameo as Rastaman.

See how the master manages to introduce his characters to us and in the end we almost become friends with them. Seeing a movie like this I think of the hungry children in Africa... The money spent on this trash would certainly serve them well... In short don't waste your time. Time is the most precious thing on Earth. Do you want to see some 20 minutes of foosball playing on screen? Go and play foosball for real! It's more fun I assure you! Why the summary End of times.... I can't help it...

The money spent on this trash would certainly serve them well... In short don't waste your time. Time is the most precious thing on Earth. Do you want to see some 20 minutes of foosball playing on screen? Go and play foosball for real! It's more fun I assure you! Why the summary End of times.... I can't help it... When such a large group of people thinks this film is a masterpiece it must be the end of time when pure trash is taken for great art. Shame!";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say that I'm a big fan of director Luis Buuel. While I admire his visual flair  his movies often lack backbone and this brings them down. The Exterminating Angel is the first Buuel movie that I've really enjoyed. I enjoyed it because I never got the impression that the point of this film was simply to be weird. Buuel has found a premise  basically a satire on the behaviour of the upper class  and lampooned it brilliantly. The key to this movie is setting up the central plot and the director does such a good job of it that after a while we don't care that the film is based on an idea that makes no sense at all and are just able to run with it. The film follows a bunch of guests at a dinner party. At the end of the party none of them make any effort to go home and after a while it becomes apparent to the party that they physically cannot leave the room. We then watch as the upper class people who are used to sipping champagne and smoking expensive cigars are reduced to surviving in the most basic ways. They have to hack through the wall to find a water pipe and even begin eating paper to quench their hunger The satire works because the acting is just so different to the way that the upper class usually conduct themselves  either on screen or otherwise. The structure of the social classes is clearly defined by Buuel's film also. This is the sort of thing that would really scare the rich while other social classes have other things to worry about. Before the nightmare begins various people are commenting on the conduct of one of their own who has had slightly too much to drink. This wouldn't worry anyone who isn't 'high society' but the fact that these people do care about it shows the difference in values between the classes. Buuel directs the film with almost a complete lack of emotion towards the central ensemble  and this stood out to me as it really allows the film to be funny. It's almost like the director is laughing at the situation that he's put his cast of characters into which suggests that the Spanish director isn't the biggest fan of the upper classes. There's a million and one ways that this film could be interpreted and that is what makes it great. If you don't like films that don't make sense this probably won't do much for you. However I think that this is one of those films that need to be experienced and I definitely recommend it.".

They stay later and later and eventually it's the next day but no one has left. By that evening they're all still in the salon no one has left and no one will leave they're trapped! All the have to do is walk out the door but no one wants to be the first to leave.As time goes on one gravely ill guest dies they run out of food and eventually their genteel faade deteriorates and they become as the Spanish title suggests shipwrecked in their house on Providence St. losing all track of time. The subtitles typically leave out a lot of the Spanish dialog. Listen for the Voice of Reason el Doctor who's always saying calmanse todos everyone be calm whenever there's a confrontation. Also listen for the electric shaver at odd times much to the irritation of one of the guests.I came across this crazy film in the summer of '86 after having purchased my first VCR. I soon found myself watching it twice daily and read all the books I could find on both the film and its director Luis Buuel. I found a lot of good information along with some glaring errors regarding the film to which I attribute the possibility that the authors probably did not have access to a videotape copy of the movie and were thus unable to view it many times over.That being said I've been able to gather that the movie is primarily Buuel's impression of high society parties that seem to go on forever as he stated himself in several interviews. Much is made of the various repetitions in the film and he stated that in some cases he'd actually witnessed the same people being introduced to each other several times throughout an evening as is seen in the film itself.Beyond that I get the clear impression that a lot of this film is essential a joke in the sense that Buuel throws in a lot of stuff just to confound the viewer and make himself laugh. When the women talk of seeing eagles when relieving themselves in large vases in a closet this is in reality taken from a time in Buuel's youth when he'd visit relatives in the mountains. Their outhouses extended over cliffs and it was indeed possible to see eagles etc. flying underneath poor birds!.Then there are Buuel's favorite targets like the upper class and classical music including condutors and cellos. The dialog is rich in nonsequitors and ironic responses that are all the more hilarious when translated from Spanish. One great example is when Nobil responds to his wife after she's noticed a guest has removed his coat gasp! let us remove our coats as well to attenuate the incorrectness.I've watched a fair amount of Buuel's films and this is by far my favorite. There are others that are better in their technical acheivement e.g. The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeousie but this and its contemporary Simon of the Desert are as good as he gets in my book.I've been searching for a copy of the screenplay in Spanish.We don't want answers we want to get out of here!".

Each of these films is funny in a way some hilariously all subversively.  I also must say not to the detriment of the film necessarily that this is one of the most irritating films I've seen.  Bunuel truly gets under the skin of what gets under our skin inane quirks selfish boors groupthinkers.   The most disturbing imagery in the film suggests christian parallels with many of the guests praying or vowing to do good works if released a butler that studied with jesuits and a final service in a church as well as several lambs often representations as in Blake of Jesus.  Possible also are references to Passover's exterminating angel of death as a brick thrown through a window is at first attributed some passing Jew.  I will not presume to interpret these and I probably could not do so convincingly if I tried and much like with Eraserhead and Mulholland Drive I don't really want them interpreted for me.  This is the wonder of Bunuel.  Cinema is anarchistic is a probable misquote of him but from the time of his last film no filmmakers except those above have been able to capture the feeling while watching a film that ANYTHING can happen and very quickly and how very frightening that is.  The other reason I write is that the VHS of this film is ATROCIOUS.   The best part is where one guest babbles on for about 10 seconds none of which is shown in the subtitles AT ALL.  Most of them are difficult to read as they are against a white background the quality is true crap.

Like Dr. Strangelove or maybe more so akin to a Kafka work submerged in Catholic plague the film subverts expectations. At the start of the film Luis Bunuel makes it clear as day that his only explanation is that its nonsense. If one were wanting to dig on a pure comedy level it would work because the dialog is so strange and out of place if taken seriously but consistently so and the timing of the sort of downward spiral that plunges into the denouement if there is one. If one were wanting to look at it for more of the technical reasons its peerless Bunuel has a steady carefully controlled camera quite tradition at times. But then at others he reveals his revealing awesome flashes of symbolism which may or may not fly over some viewers heads. And then if one were to go so far on an existential level it goes into the realm of nothingness a kind of study of how a nonsensical existence trapped for reasons not made clear to the viewer barely to the rich cast of bourgeois a running gag almost which also calls in the Kafka aspect. By the hand of a surrealist comes a deadpan satire and it almost becomes a dark fable the Catholic aspect to the film by the end. It's a rather shocking film on the first try which is why it probably had some controversy when it first opened. Giving it another chance the film works better on a more sensory level almost. This is the kind of film where you're either scratching your head and turning it off midway through or laughing while in the grips of cringing perhaps and in a weird awe. One of Bunuel's very best Mexican films.".

	schema:reviewBody "I discovered surrealist cinema as an adult. Of course there are such scenes and images in many films but I saw the first complete surrealist movie as a grown up. It was Belle de jour a film by Luis Buuel whose work I knew since watching his Robinson Crusoe in my childhood. Buuel had gone a long way since 1928's Un chien andalou made in France. He had gone into exile during the Spanish Civil War first to the United States and finally to Mxico where he spent the rest of his life. But he made films in Europe now and then and had regained his status as one of the masters of world cinema. Although he did not think much of his Mexican motion pictures his masterpiece El ngel exterminador is my favorite of all his films. He once complained that Mexican actors were not able to convey the spirit of the haute bourgeoisie but what he did not take into consideration was that if he made a film in Mxico about the rich he was dealing with something else called creole oligarchies. And in this sense this farce of the 1960s' Latin American filthy rich is most accurate. Moreover with his usual affectionate treatment of the bourgeois something he rarely did with clergy female characters or street urchins he created a most believable funny portrait of the Latino rich people who do not know what is their origin who they should pay tribute to or where they are headed unlike their European ancestors. Here a group of those characters born in Mxico gather for dinner after an opera performance but when the time comes to leave the house of the Nobiles they cannot leave the room where they reunited for gossiping after meal. There is no apparent reason they cannot leave but there they stay for days going back to a primitive state in which their dearest discreet charm euphemism the rule of the game as in Renoir's 1939 film vanishes. And when they are set free and go to a church to thank the Lord... well Buuel sure knew how to make fun of them with situations verging on the fantastic and funny lines of incoherent silly or ridiculous dialogue. A wonderful movie which is always fun to watch again especially in a double bill with another gem the last one Buuel made in Mxico Simn del desierto.".

But with this it also shows how even the civilised sections of society once they are stripped of their social status their inherited manners of education and their ability to use wealth the fall into absolute decay probably falling apart greater than the lower classes with their lessened moral outlook and an almost infantile inability to deal with regular obstacles.Winner of the 1962 Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival this was to begin what become rather belatedly for the 62 year old his most productive celebrated and interesting period of his career based in Paris beginning with Belle de Jour 1967 and ending with That Obscure Object of Desire 1977.

The idea was also utilised in one sketch from Monty Python's Meaning of Life 1983 that saw the guests leaving as ghosts.

	schema:headline " Strange and fantastic picture being compellingly directed by the Spanish maestro of surrealism  the great Luis Buuel";
	schema:reviewBody "One of Bunuel's most rare and amazing  The Exterminating Angel is packed with surreal moments  criticism  absurd situations and astonishing nightmares . This is one Buuel's best  including characteristically scatological satire  fierce as well as surreal nightmares and surprising events . Dramatic film about strange relationships among various members of higher class when they remain locked into a mansion . As a luxurious mansion is the place wherein some dinner guests find they cannot for any definable reason leave the dining room . This is weird story about a group of higher class  a drama with surrealism and sour portrait upon social stratum  catholicism  with plenty of dream imaginary and many other things  being stunningly realized by the Spanish maestro of surrealism  the great Luis Buuel . This is a typical Buuel film  as there are a lot of symbolism  social critique  including mockery or wholesale review upon religion  especially Catholicism . Luis Buuel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion  issues well shown in a lot of films and that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . Here Bunuel gives a perverse studio about wealthy people  desire and tension when a misfit bunch is closed for any inexplicable reason  and even being strongly cut and banned by Russian censorship because the idea of people not being allowed to leave a party was considered offensive and antigovernment . The scene where a bear and two sheep appear during the dinner party was based on a real incident at a dinner party that Buuel once attended in New York . In his autobiography Luis Buuel claims he was asked by Warner Brothers to work on a story that eventually was filmed as The beast with five fingers 1946  it contains many of the elements of the earlier film including the large mansion piano recital and stabbing of a disembodied hand . Interesting and thoughtprovoking screenplay from the same Luis Buuel and Luis Alcoriza Buuel's usual screenwriter  they pull off a straightfaced treatment of shocking subject matter .The movie script was original and early working title The Castaways of Providence Street  then Luis Buuel took the title The Exterminating Angel from his friend Jos Bergamin the Spanish poet who had mentioned it the year before for a play he wanted to write . Out of all the films in Luis Buuel's MexicanSpanish film period this is the only film he had complete creative control over . Nice acting by allMexicanstar cast such as Claudio Brook  Jacqueline Andere  Enrique Rambal and Silvia Pinal of Viridiana  among others . The film relies heavily on the relationship between them  as are developed lovehatred conflicts . Furthermore  Buuel satirizes and he carries out outright critical to aristocracy  bourgeoisie and attack upon religion . Atmospheric as well as evocative cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa  Buuel's ordinary . This thoughtful and dramatic motion picture was well produced by Gustavo Alatriste and compellingly directed by Luis Buuel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Buuel's strange film belongs to his Mexican period  in fact  it's plenty of known Mexican actors . Born in Calanda  Aragon 1900  Buuel subsequently moved to Madrid to study at the university there where his close friends included Salvador Dal and Federico Garca Lorca. After moving to Paris  at the beginning Buuel did a variety of filmrelated odd jobs  including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal he made his first film  this 17minute Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  the scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes themes that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . That career though seemed almost over by the mid1930s as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War  where he made Las Hurdes  as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming The Great Madcap  The brute Wuthering Heights El  The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz  Robinson Crusoe  Death in the garden and many others . After returning his native country Spain by making Viridiana this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy as well as The milky way or Via Lactea  both of them were strongly prohibited by Spanish censorship .

	onyx:emotionText "One of Bunuel's most rare and amazing  The Exterminating Angel is packed with surreal moments  criticism  absurd situations and astonishing nightmares . This is one Buuel's best  including characteristically scatological satire  fierce as well as surreal nightmares and surprising events . Dramatic film about strange relationships among various members of higher class when they remain locked into a mansion . As a luxurious mansion is the place wherein some dinner guests find they cannot for any definable reason leave the dining room . This is weird story about a group of higher class  a drama with surrealism and sour portrait upon social stratum  catholicism  with plenty of dream imaginary and many other things  being stunningly realized by the Spanish maestro of surrealism  the great Luis Buuel . This is a typical Buuel film  as there are a lot of symbolism  social critique  including mockery or wholesale review upon religion  especially Catholicism . Luis Buuel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion  issues well shown in a lot of films and that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . Here Bunuel gives a perverse studio about wealthy people  desire and tension when a misfit bunch is closed for any inexplicable reason  and even being strongly cut and banned by Russian censorship because the idea of people not being allowed to leave a party was considered offensive and antigovernment . The scene where a bear and two sheep appear during the dinner party was based on a real incident at a dinner party that Buuel once attended in New York . In his autobiography Luis Buuel claims he was asked by Warner Brothers to work on a story that eventually was filmed as The beast with five fingers 1946  it contains many of the elements of the earlier film including the large mansion piano recital and stabbing of a disembodied hand . Interesting and thoughtprovoking screenplay from the same Luis Buuel and Luis Alcoriza Buuel's usual screenwriter  they pull off a straightfaced treatment of shocking subject matter .The movie script was original and early working title The Castaways of Providence Street  then Luis Buuel took the title The Exterminating Angel from his friend Jos Bergamin the Spanish poet who had mentioned it the year before for a play he wanted to write . Out of all the films in Luis Buuel's MexicanSpanish film period this is the only film he had complete creative control over . Nice acting by allMexicanstar cast such as Claudio Brook  Jacqueline Andere  Enrique Rambal and Silvia Pinal of Viridiana  among others . The film relies heavily on the relationship between them  as are developed lovehatred conflicts . Furthermore  Buuel satirizes and he carries out outright critical to aristocracy  bourgeoisie and attack upon religion . Atmospheric as well as evocative cinematography by Gabriel Figueroa  Buuel's ordinary . This thoughtful and dramatic motion picture was well produced by Gustavo Alatriste and compellingly directed by Luis Buuel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Buuel's strange film belongs to his Mexican period  in fact  it's plenty of known Mexican actors . Born in Calanda  Aragon 1900  Buuel subsequently moved to Madrid to study at the university there where his close friends included Salvador Dal and Federico Garca Lorca. After moving to Paris  at the beginning Buuel did a variety of filmrelated odd jobs  including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal he made his first film  this 17minute Un Chien Andalou 1929 and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year  sponsored by wealthy art patrons he made his first picture  the scabrous witty and violent Age of Gold 1930 which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes themes that would preoccupy Buuel for the rest of his career . That career though seemed almost over by the mid1930s as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War  where he made Las Hurdes  as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in Los Olvidados 1950 winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this newfound acclaim Buuel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultralowbudget films few of which made much impact outside Spanishspeaking countries  though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming The Great Madcap  The brute Wuthering Heights El  The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz  Robinson Crusoe  Death in the garden and many others . After returning his native country Spain by making Viridiana this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy as well as The milky way or Via Lactea  both of them were strongly prohibited by Spanish censorship . Most Buuel's films were surreal black comedies  parables that satirized moral hypocrisy  social moral  artistic pretension and  of course  the Catholic Church . In FrenchSpanish final period the collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer JeanClaude Carrire gave notorious as well as polemic films such as Viridiana  The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and Belle De Jour. His last one was the notorious That obscure object of desire 1977";

	schema:reviewBody "This film has an interesting premise a dinner party of rich bourgeoisie find themselves inexplicably unable to leave the house. They slowly devolve into savagery and vulgarity. It's sort of like the Eagles song Hotel California except that this film lasts 70 minutes longer than the song. And you can't dance to it.But the problem is not the slow pace nor is it the lack of plot. The main problem is that Bunuel fails to develop his characters so we are left with a satire of... nothing! There is really nothing to sink our philosophical teeth into. The resolution is utterly meaningless and random and it leaves you saying to yourself I could have thought of a million better ways to end that movie. But as it were Bunuel chose the most vapid resolution similar to a cheezy TV scifi drama where the solution is to switch the polarity from plus to minus! This film is utterly unfulfilling to anyone who is thirsty for philosophy and depth. Of course the Bunuel fans will retort that Bunuel never claimed to have any meaning to his films. Sadly I must agree. But what frustrates me most is that he had the perfect opportunity to deliver an insightful commentary on the human condition but instead he let it degrade into utter schlock.Bunuel loves to ridicule the rich. That's fine but maybe he should give us a reason WHY the rich are so ridiculous. It's not enough to make fun of a man just because he wears a tuxedo. Without giving us sufficient insights into the personalities of his characters that's all Bunuel is doing making fun of people because of the clothes and jewelry they wear. But I suppose back in that era it was en vogue to make fun of rich people. Come to think of it audiences haven't changed much in the last 50 years.I give this film 4 stars instead of 1 because at least in this film Bunuel doesn't slaughter any animals on camera.".

It represents its era well much the same way George Melies' A Trip to the Moon represents its era. I selected the Melies film for comparison because it is widely regarded as a watershed achievement for 1902. I can think of no other reason why The Exterminating Angel should be heaped with such praise by modern audiences  because it shaped what followed it. That alone does not make it a great film.Other better and more enjoyable watershed films include Lost Horizon Metropolis Citizen Kane 2001 Nosferatu and Casablanca. The Exterminating Angel is an unfinished thought too conventional to be considered much of an experiment it wants to be a thoughtprovoking message movie but it doesn't have anything to say and the only thought it provoked for me was how much longer until I begin to care about what's happening?

No but nor does it represent the best that cinema has to offer and deserve to populate so many the top 50 or top 100 lists.My review may very well be derided for being too narrowminded ethnocentric and corrupted by CGI. Trying to learn about the history of film I looked forward to The Exterminating Angel and was more than willing to view it in its own terms. Days after watching this film however I still can't shake my conclusion that even this agonizingly overlong movie was trimmed by threequarters the storyline and resulting teleplay wouldn't even make a memorable Twilight Zone episode.

It is a bit hard for this reason to care for any of the characters or their experience and it ends up being quite melodramatic and dreary to watch. The story is not very convincing either since it interchanges between horror and satire so that we are not sure just what exactly is keeping the characters at bay. As a surrealist piece an explanation is perhaps not necessary and although few its few surrealism bits work very well. The black and white photography is perfectly suited to the project with stark contrasts and some nice gliding shots.

Best not to try to assign any symbolic meaning to it unintended by the director as an opening note from the director states more or less. I really must see some more of Buuel's films I've only seen a few.Unfortunately the video I watched Hen's Tooth Video was a little washedout looking with definition lost most in the brightest whites and darkest blacks. Sometimes the picture jumped a little and occasionally there were jump cuts where the picture and some dialog were lost. The subtitles were white and sometimes disappeared when the picture was white. When the subtitles were particularly lengthy they sometimes got cut off on the edges of the picture. There were also a number of lines of dialog that went without subtitles.

The arch villain in Bunuel's Book of Social Crimes is the exploitative institution of the bourgeois. This ruling class is held in contempt in most of Bunuel's films but most notably in this movie.The movie opens with a Catholic Cathedral funereal music and sheep as the congregation. Bunuel's bourgeois are Catholic adherents of Karl Marx's Opium of the People his description of the role of religion in society.The scene then shifts to a plutocratic mansion where a gathering of the rich and cultured is to take place in which one of the most holy sacraments of bourgeois society is about to begin. The social ritual in which assorted bourgeois people sit at a large banquet table and are plied with different courses of elegantly prepared food by foot servants which had been anxiously and expertly prepared by the chef and his kitchen staff.Bunuel alerts us the viewers early as to the incipient chaos to follow by having the kitchen staff abandon their conventional order of events by unpredictably walking off the job. This strangepeculiar juxtaposition of that which is predictable sets the stage for the arrival of the Exterminating Angel whom we never see physically but are made aware of as the movie progresses. The evening progresses as the depleted staff serves dinner to the narcissists gathered at the table. The central theme in this movie is reached when Bunuel applies a primitive form of magic and superstition to the apparently modern man represented at the bourgeois dinner party. This tradition often described in Frazier's The Golden Bough is the drawing of a circle around a primitive victim by a shaman from which there is no escape. The victim will not because of fear and superstition step across the line and break the circle. The result is a lingering death paralyzed within the chalked circle.At the end of the dinner and after pleasantries and some cultivated appreciation of classical piano playing the invisible circle is chalked at the exit to the diningroom leaving the assorted guests unable to perform the act of taking their leave and departing.Here you have the central issue of the film as the bourgeois guests descend into a nightmarish hell of inertia apathy and utter lack of resourcefulness so that the typical bourgeois traits of herdlike conformity self interest and alienation become stumbling blocks to the simple human capacity to act. No action is possible as the vile dark side of the inner bourgeois personality is slowly revealed. They sleep they dream often surrealistically they harbour murderous resentment as scapegoats for their dilemma are sought. Everything is in stasis nothing can break the spell  a magic ritual with chicken legs is attempted but fails. People die lovers commit suicide sheep the lamb of God? are eaten as civilization of which the human social phenomenon of the bourgeois can be considered to be its apex crumbles back into the cesspool of primal soup from which it developed.The spell is eventually broken when one of the guests remembers the alchemical and ancient magical practice of reenacting the events that led up to the circle being drawn but then changing its chain of magical order by leaving like an automaton at the usual time and mannerThe movie then reverts back to the prologue with the sheep entering the Cathedral in order to worship.

His political stance clearly shows his support toward the Workers' factions and his despise for the dictatorial ruling classes that was The Spanish Civil War 1936  1939. During his stay in Mexico he was to make an enigma an insight into the principles of survival amongst the elite and their dealings of the trappings of success and the fear of failure to keep composure and dignity.Some can say that his work in El ngel exterminador may be seen as a metaphor for the eagerness of the ruling classes to rely on the lower orders to satisfy their own needs. However when these lower orders these servants' flee into the night it leaves the highranking elite in disbelief as how to continue this bourgeoisie existence without its backbone its workforce that is needed to keep this lifestyle in its perpetual splendour. It too may also be seen as the stance against the Franco regime and the working people leaving in droves from the lands the factories to retaliate against the dictatorship of the Spanish rulings classes. Without the lower classes these intellectuals' these land and factory owners' et al are powerless they have no means to continue this extravagance they have become accustomed. With this newfound realisation of alienation the implosion of morals etiquette and social order soon take effect.However this too can be seen also as a simple theory but not excluding it altogether there are deeper spiritual meanings here too apart from the physical why can they not leave the room? Are they afraid to lose all their inhibitions totally and be seen as uncouth and forward? Remembering too that this house of opulence is situated in Providence Street the name in itself is a hint of something more worthy more grandeur than those who reside in it If Divine Providence frees us we will offer a Te Deum mutters a frustrated guest. With Gods possibly guiding hand these souls are thrown into bedlam and chaos and stifled by their own virtues stripped bare to become exposed as human beings the barriers of pretence indifference ignorance and hypocrisy are thrown into turmoil and they do not like what they see. They do not like what they have become. They do not like the fact that they are no different from any other. Amusing too is the fact that when awaking on the first morning of entrapment then unknown to them after sleeping on the floor and sofas most comment on how poor their appearance is it is this outward vanity that shows us just how narcissistic and selfcentred this society has evolved.As the second act too evolves it is more than apparent that in this psychological trauma as an elderly man lies dying amongst them they are willing but at the same time incapable of helping. Penned up sheep they have become and unwilling to think and act with free will until someone can lead the way of course I'll shall fetch help if you leave first the old man dies. These are the rules of etiquette while individualism and intelligence sets them apart from the masses each one has to conform to the next the first to break the rules' of etiquette to render themselves inappropriate is seen as unsociable and in poor taste. They are truly trapped in both the physical sense and the mental. Only cowards reside here each wanting out but no one willing to try for the glory of freedom it's best to go when one is following afraid of the unknown neither Man or Woman is willing or strong enough to lead the way forward with resentment they wait they dissolve and rot.As the situation worsens so do the paranoia's disdain and trust blame turns to hate hate turns to madness and madness turns to the ultimate sin. Only God the Divine Elohim can save their Souls if not faith in something bigger because faith in one another in the human traits of companionship honesty and camaraderie are now nonexistent.Even too outside are the baying crowds eager to enter the house with police barricades they shout Let us in we're not animals they walk up to the large imposing gate and stop dead in their tracks they cannot walk any further something stops them that is also not seen. This could be representative of the lower classes who divided from this system of a higher etiquette and who in turn wishes to be treated and respected in the same capacity? With no one walking out and no one walking in it is this barrier of consciousness that is setting the narrative that we are all born free but the social ties constraints and obligations' are what sets us from the others. It isn't so much that these people are trapped within a room of no bars guards and barriers' that can be seen it is more to the point that it isn't where they are but who they are and what has lead them to become who they are. This is a prison of their own making and it could just have been one single Man in a phone box a church to a baying crowd outside as opposed to a crowded room with gentry and sophistication.If there are answers here then they are also elusive with a looming cloud over its patrons The Exterminating Angel is a prison within a prison and why pick on these Souls here?

	schema:reviewBody "Some actors upon reaching their sixties or seventies retire. Some enter into a sort of semiretirement whereby they continue to accept cameo parts but not leading roles. Some however try and revisit the triumphs of their youth by making the same sort of films that they were making twenty or thirty years earlier. There are too many examples to list them all but I was less than enthusiastic to note that Sylvester Stallone at the age of sixty has just made his sixth Rocky film and is currently working on his fourth Rambo.Clint Eastwood is a rare example of a star who managed to remain a leading man throughout his seventh and into his eighth decade but did so without a desperate attempt to put the clock back. Doubtless his status as a director and producer has given him a greater influence inside the industry than many of his contemporaries. In his early sixties he made Unforgiven one of the alltime great Westerns in which he starred as an ageing gunfighter and since then has made a number of other films such as The Bridges of Madison County and Million Dollar Baby in which an older man takes centre stage. Occasionally his roles have contained elements of an old man's wishful thinking such as his romance with Rene Russo in In the Line of Fire but even in that film his character's age was important to the plot.Absolute Power made when Eastwood was sixtyseven is another older man's film. His character Luther Whitney is a veteran burglar who has broken into the Washington mansion of an elderly millionaire named Walter Sullivan where from his hidingplace he inadvertently witnesses a killing. Sullivan's young wife Christy enters the bedroom with her lover who is none other than the President Allen Richmond. What starts out as a consensual lovemaking session goes wrong when Richmond clearly a lover of rough sex starts slapping Christy. She takes exception to this and slaps him back. Things get out of hand and she attempts to stab him with a letteropener. Richmond calls for help and his Secret Service bodyguards burst into the room and open fire killing Christy.Some reviewers have described Christy's killing as murder but legally this is not correct. Had the two bodyguards ever stood trial for murder they would have been acquitted as they were only carrying out their duty to protect the President's life but things never get that far. Richmond is too shocked to take any action but his Chief of Staff Gloria Russell realising that if the truth ever came out it would destroy his career organises a coverup. When the President's staff realise that Luther was a witness to the killing he is forced to go on the run.This could have been the plot of a very mundane political thriller but Eastwood both as actor and director is able to lift it above that level. Despite Luther's criminal tendencies Eastwood is able to make him a sympathetic figure a man with his own sense of decency and honour. He had the assistance of a very strong cast featuring some of Hollywood's most accomplished actors. There is E.G. Marshall in his last feature film as Sullivan Gene Hackman always a very watchable villain as the hypocritical Richmond Judy Davis as Gloria and Ed Harris as the police chief who is investigating Christy's death and soon comes to realise that there is more to it than meets the eye. A particularly important role is played by the very talented Laura Linney as Luther's daughter Kate. She has become estranged from her father as she disapproves of his criminal lifestyle and now works as a criminal lawyer prosecuting on behalf of the police. When she realises that her father is in danger however she comes to his assistance and they start to rebuild their relationship.The idea that their President might be a philanderer would have come as no surprise to most Americans in the midnineties even though this film came out just before President Clinton was caught up in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Eastwood was not however interested in doing something along the lines of Primary Colors or Wag the Dog there is no attempt to make Richmond a disguised portrait of Clinton and we do not even learn if he is a Democrat or Republican. Absolute Power is intended as a thriller not a satirical comedy. Nevertheless it does tap into the feeling that many Americans have had ever since the Watergate affair that their Presidents cannot always be trusted to tell the truth. It is significant that the hero of this film is a burglar by trade the implication is that such a man may be less of a crook than a politician. 710".

And the film has several tense and visually very interesting scenes which showed Eastwood's directorial talent nicely. From my perspective the problem was somewhere between the script the editing and the directing but I am not sure exactly where. About 23rds of the way through the film the Keystone Cops antics of the Secret Service members who are supposed to be taking care of the situation are no longer believable and neither is Eastwood' ability to be anywhere at any time without being detected. Further when the end finally does come it moves in pretty abruptly as something of a less than interesting anticlimax long after the plot has fully unraveled and you are left wondering just how much of the script was edited out.

Less characterdriven and less action oriented than most of its genre peers the film relies on strong but underdeveloped performances the likability of its antihero Eastwood and what could have been a very engaging string of scenarios culminating in a powerful conclusion. Plot heavy films can be good films if they stick to their heavy storylines. However and inexplicably Absolute Power derails about half way through and never really gets back on track. Instead none of these potentialities are explored fully and we are left with only petty revenge a little misapplied justice and the rebuilding of a relationship between the story's most likable characters Linney and Eastwood.

	schema:headline " Entertaining Eastwood Thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "Eastwood nobody's fool seems to alternate between quiet almost arty films and commercial thrillers or comedies. This is probably an aboveaverage example of one of his thrillers.The plot  in brief  Eastwood is a highly skilled thief and in the process of burglarizing a rich old man's house he witnesses the murder of the owner's wife by the President of the United States Gene Hackman and two of his Secret Service agents. Clint manages to get away carrying some damaging evidence with him. The police narrow down the list of suspects until only Clint is left plausible. Thereafter he is hunted by the police Ed Harris a hit man hired by the tycoon E. G. Marshall and the Secret Service Judy Davis and Scott Glen. There is a subplot involving Clint's estranged daughter Laura Linney who gets together with Ed Harris in the film's course. In the end through Clint's deft weaseling about justice is done.I had a bit of a problem with the film's moral calculus. E. G. Marshall one of the world's richest men is a good guy. We are told this repeatedly and he's shown a good deal of respect by people who should know. But then why did he give the presidency to a murdering philandering fool like Hackman? And SHOULD he have? He loses our sympathy when he hires a hit man to kill Eastwood. Evidently somehow he manages to stab the president to death. The script seems to want us to applaud him for dealing out power and justice as he sees fit and to respect him even after he kills Hackman and lies about it on TV using the pat phrase He was like a son to me. Good man my foot.It's rather a gutsy movie. In most of them when a high government official is involved in some really nefarious business like murder it's usually someone of lesser status than the President himself. Cf. No Way Out in which in a similar role Hackman is Secretary of Defense or something. In all of its aspects  its photography location shooting musical score and performances  it's professionally competent. If it doesn't probe anyone's psych it doesn't matter because it's easy to be swept up in the events and the clarity of the characterization. It even rises above that level in its dialog. The plot may be no more imaginative than is called for but the writers have thrown in some sparkling bon mots.Harris and Glenn are talking in a parking lot and introduce each other. Harris remarks that Glenn is famous as a state trooper for his heroism. Glenn I was younger and dumber then. Harris Yeah I was younger then but I think I'm dumber now. When E. G. Marshall is negotiating with the hit man he offers him three million dollars to kill Eastwood who he believes murdered his wife. Hit man You're a good salesman. Marshall Selling sin is easy. And when Harris first finishes interrogating Clint Harris says I'll see you tomorrow. Clint smiles gaily and replies Tomorrow is promised to no one.

	onyx:emotionText "Eastwood nobody's fool seems to alternate between quiet almost arty films and commercial thrillers or comedies. This is probably an aboveaverage example of one of his thrillers.The plot  in brief  Eastwood is a highly skilled thief and in the process of burglarizing a rich old man's house he witnesses the murder of the owner's wife by the President of the United States Gene Hackman and two of his Secret Service agents. Clint manages to get away carrying some damaging evidence with him. The police narrow down the list of suspects until only Clint is left plausible. Thereafter he is hunted by the police Ed Harris a hit man hired by the tycoon E. G. Marshall and the Secret Service Judy Davis and Scott Glen. There is a subplot involving Clint's estranged daughter Laura Linney who gets together with Ed Harris in the film's course. In the end through Clint's deft weaseling about justice is done.I had a bit of a problem with the film's moral calculus. E. G. Marshall one of the world's richest men is a good guy. We are told this repeatedly and he's shown a good deal of respect by people who should know. But then why did he give the presidency to a murdering philandering fool like Hackman? And SHOULD he have? He loses our sympathy when he hires a hit man to kill Eastwood. Evidently somehow he manages to stab the president to death. The script seems to want us to applaud him for dealing out power and justice as he sees fit and to respect him even after he kills Hackman and lies about it on TV using the pat phrase He was like a son to me. Good man my foot.It's rather a gutsy movie. In most of them when a high government official is involved in some really nefarious business like murder it's usually someone of lesser status than the President himself. Cf. No Way Out in which in a similar role Hackman is Secretary of Defense or something. In all of its aspects  its photography location shooting musical score and performances  it's professionally competent. If it doesn't probe anyone's psych it doesn't matter because it's easy to be swept up in the events and the clarity of the characterization. It even rises above that level in its dialog. The plot may be no more imaginative than is called for but the writers have thrown in some sparkling bon mots.Harris and Glenn are talking in a parking lot and introduce each other. Harris remarks that Glenn is famous as a state trooper for his heroism. Glenn I was younger and dumber then. Harris Yeah I was younger then but I think I'm dumber now. When E. G. Marshall is negotiating with the hit man he offers him three million dollars to kill Eastwood who he believes murdered his wife. Hit man You're a good salesman. Marshall Selling sin is easy. And when Harris first finishes interrogating Clint Harris says I'll see you tomorrow. Clint smiles gaily and replies Tomorrow is promised to no one. Now  I'm not claiming that these are Shakespearean flights of poetry but they're at least as good as a lot of wellknown lines from B movies like Detour. What is money? Just a piece of paper crawling with germs. At least after hearing them you don't want to take a can of scouring powder to your auditory canals and clean out the accumulated garbage.

	schema:reviewBody "What starts out with immense potential gradually evaporates into preposterousness in ABSOLUTE POWER. That doesn't make it an entirely bad picture but it certainly puts a damper on what could have been. Clint Eastwood is an aging thief he's been an aging something or other for his last 20 movies who secretly witnesses President Gene Hackman get rough with his mistress. The encounter ends with her being shot by the Secret Service as she tries to defend herself and the incident is promptly disguised to look like runofthemill foul play. He may be on the outside of the law looking in but Clint ain't about to let the powers that be get away with this one.The opening 20 minutes of ABSOLUTE POWER are quite suspenseful bordering on mesmerizing. There we are trapped in a walkin twoway mirrored vault along with our pilfering hero helpless to stop the horror unfolding just meters away. Eastwood may start out as the bad guy but his status is quickly upgraded as he flees the scene holding what may be the only piece of evidence that can prove his astonishing observation. From then on we find ourselves rooting him on even if he is in reality nothing more than the lesser of two evils.What unravels ABSOLUTE POWER is its laziness and improbability. In an attempt to set up one stirring scene after another the characters begin doing and saying things one would expect of a lowrate JeanClaude Van Damme movie. A onedimensionally evil Secret Service man surreptitiously hunkers down in a tall building trying to snipe Eastwood ala Lee Harvey Oswald. A police detective has no problem with Eastwood sneaking around his home at all hours of the night. A threeminute argument by Eastwood's thief is enough to convince the mistress's widower of the involvement of the most powerful man on earth. And to call the ending outlandish and unsatisfying would be a pair of understatements.As well though it's usually the other way around ABSOLUTE POWER would have benefited from a longer running time. One comes away with the sense that Eastwood who also directed tried to cram too much into too little. The film certainly had the material to go longer and its compactness gives the whole endeavor a choppy feel at times.ABSOLUTE POWER is a film you really want to like. There is considerable talent involved here and the movie's heart seems to be in the right place. But like that one photo we all have in our album this one didn't turn out as good as we would have hoped.".

However the film is always tense and engaging especially the beginning which was definitely one of my all time favourite openings to a crime film. Tense exciting and with a few twists it presents a realistic view of a robber caught up in what will surely be a huge case.The story justifies the genre by being focused upon murders and robberies and adds sentimental value in the form of family and friendship values. Laura Linney The Truman Show is terrific as Eastwood's daughter and adds a great sentimental value to a heavy crime film. She is involved in a great twists towards the end which is a must watch.The ending surprised me. Although there were great twists the final few scenes and the way the narrative came to never felt quite justified in my opinion but then again I may have been expecting too much from a film that was consistent and engaging from the beginning. The film is always kept exciting through the tense robbery scenes character actions and a plot about a man and his power.Direction.Eastwood's direction is simply breathtaking. The opening sequence where he explores the neatly kept mansion for his robbery is the best moment in the entire film I was literally on the edge of my seat. Dark quiet and with a grace that any director would be proud of I held my breathe from start to finish. Heavy critics may argue it conforms too much to an action styled genre with many shots appearing focusing in or around the main priority but I appreciated it for what it was which was sheer brilliance.Eastwood is outstanding in the whole of this film. Not only his ability to pull off a stern ageing character but this direction is also worthy of huge praise.watch it if...you enjoy the crime genre and appreciate tense dramatic sequences.but its simply just worth watching for the beginning.".

This is a stunner that keeps your pulse pounding in places and slows down to a normal pace in other spots and it all works perfectly. Eastwood's style is second to none as he makes his way through this thrillride of an enthralling story. He is very thoughtprovoking as he works to figure his 'escape' then a moral dilemma of major proportions hits him like a ton of brick!! His whole mission has changed at that point and he knows it. From then on he is set on a new course of decisive action. Next to actors like Scott Glenn and Ed Harris Laura Linney Judy Davis Dennis Haybert that is pretty solid for a cast all the players pull their own weight. But then with the addition of Gene Hackman this is a frantic paced unveiling of events.This for sure rounds out my top of the top great films... This is recommended as a Clint Eastwood fun solid action white knuckled thriller that is satisfying for most discreminating moviemogals I would believe. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scenes of this classy thriller are so gripping that watching the rest of the action becomes totally irresistible. A cat burglar witnesses a murder in highly unusual circumstances and then has to go on the run to escape those who want to make him the fall guy for the crime. The fact that his pursuers are intent on assassinating him then turns his already dangerous mission into a desperate race against time.Luther Whitney Clint Eastwood is the veteran thief who for the last heist of his career breaks into the mansion owned by political power broker Walter Sullivan E.G.Marshall when he and his family are apparently away on a short vacation. After making his way to the vault that adjoins the main bedroom Luther steals large amounts of jewellery and cash but then suddenly has to stop when he hears people heading in the direction of the bedroom. Hidden in the vault Luther watches silently through a twoway mirror as the President of the United States Allen Richmond Gene Hackman and Walter Sullivan's much younger wife Christy Melora Hardin enter the bedroom and start indulging in some sexual foreplay. The exchanges between the drunken couple quickly turn violent and when Christy stabs Richmond in the arm with a letteropener a couple of Secret Service agents rush into the room and shoot Christy dead.White House Chief of Staff Gloria Russell Judy Davis arrives on the scene and organises a coverup to make it look as if Christy had been killed by a burglar and shortly after Luther makes his escape with his loot and the letteropener. In the days that follow Luther changes his original plan to leave the country and becomes determined to bring the President to justice. Some complications develop however as his estranged daughter Kate Laura Linney who's a prosecuting attorney and Detective Seth Frank Ed Harris cooperate to search for evidence and both the Secret Service and Walter Sullivan attempt to have him killed.By using his trump card the letteropener with the President's fingerprints and blood on it Luther then tries to trigger a sequence of events that he hopes will lead to the President ultimately being made accountable for his role in Christy's murder.The pacing of this movie is masterful as it contributes both to the tension that's such a strong feature of what happens as well as being conducive to developing the relationships between the story's interesting characters. Clint Eastwood's direction is also impressive especially during the opening scenes and in a later sequence where Luther meets his daughter at a caf in very dangerous circumstances.Absolute Power is a fine adaptation of the best selling novel of the same name by David Baldacci and features a terrific cast of top actors who all contribute very good performances. A scene in which Detective Frank talks very affably to the man he suspects of carrying out the heist at Sullivan's mansion is a real highlight as Ed Harris makes his comments so loaded and Clint Eastwood responds in the same style. Judy Davis also adds a lot of humour as the Chief of Staff who's in charge but not in control. Her eccentricities and constant state of panic add a more sympathetic dimension to her amoral character whilst also adding an effective counterpoint to the high level of tension that runs right through this entertaining thriller.".

Luther is soon pursued by two cops Ed Harris  Penny Johnson  a hit man Richard Jenkins and the President security guards Dennys Haysbert  Scott Glenn. This is a light thriller in Hitchcockian style including action  suspense  thrills  improbable events and twisted intrigue . It is about the ruthlessness of people in power but the plot lacks even a political analysis or comment . This Eastwood film is solid but nothing really stick out . It is hard to take against contemporary time  as portraying a coward  cynical  traitor President  being politically incorrect for Hollywood standards . In addition  it contains some unlikely scenes as when the silly dancing between PresidentGene Hackman and his cabinet chiefJudy Davis who wears a robbed necklace . Based on the novel by David Baldacci  being screenwriter the notorious William Goldman  who wrote such important successes as Marathon man  Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid  All the President's Men  The princess bride  Misery  among others . This Absolute power 1997 was wellreceived as well as the subsequently shot Space Cowboys  however  both of them don't rank with Clint's best jobs as actorfilmmaker . Adequate Clint Eastwood in his ordinary stoic acting as a professional burglar who witnesses both a crime and a coverup . Nice acting by Gene Hackman as a philander President believes that everything he does is beyond reproach . Support cast is frankly well such as Laura Linney  Melora Hardin  Kenneth Welsh  Mark Margolis Penny Johnson  Richard Jenkins and cameo of Alison Eastwood  Clint's daughter . Furthermore  the picture displays an atmospheric and sensitive musical score by means of piano composed and performed by Lennie Niehaus  Eastwood's usual . Colorful cinematography by Jack N. Green filmed on location in Washington and Los Angeles . The film was professionally performed and directed by Clint Eastwood . It has some flaws and gaps  but it's nevertheless solidly agreeable . The picture is far from his other big hits such as his first directed western  Unforgiven 1992 also with Gene Hackman  which garnered him an Oscar for Best Director and a nomination for Best Actor . Then he took on the secret service in Open fire 1993 which was a success  followed by the interesting but poorly received drama  A perfect world 1993 with Kevin Costner as a thief . Next up was a love story  Bridges of Madison 1995 which was yet again a hit . Subsequent pictures were enjoyable but nothing to do with previous works . Among them were the and the badly received True crime 1999 and Blood work 2002 . Then in 2004 Eastwood surprised yet again when he produced directed and starred in Million Dollar Baby 2004. The movie earned Eastwood an Oscar for Best Director and a Best Actor nomination for the second time . He had other successes directing the multiawardwinning films Mystic River 2003 Flags of our fathers 2006 Letters from Iwo Jima 2006 and The changeling 2008 . After a fouryear hiatus from acting Eastwood's return to the screen in the successful Gran Torino 2008 .".

Support cast is frankly well such as Laura Linney  Melora Hardin  Kenneth Welsh  Mark Margolis Penny Johnson  Richard Jenkins and cameo of Alison Eastwood  Clint's daughter . Furthermore  the picture displays an atmospheric and sensitive musical score by means of piano composed and performed by Lennie Niehaus  Eastwood's usual . Colorful cinematography by Jack N. Green filmed on location in Washington and Los Angeles . The film was professionally performed and directed by Clint Eastwood . It has some flaws and gaps  but it's nevertheless solidly agreeable . The picture is far from his other big hits such as his first directed western  Unforgiven 1992 also with Gene Hackman  which garnered him an Oscar for Best Director and a nomination for Best Actor . Then he took on the secret service in Open fire 1993 which was a success  followed by the interesting but poorly received drama  A perfect world 1993 with Kevin Costner as a thief . Next up was a love story  Bridges of Madison 1995 which was yet again a hit . Subsequent pictures were enjoyable but nothing to do with previous works . Among them were the and the badly received True crime 1999 and Blood work 2002 . Then in 2004 Eastwood surprised yet again when he produced directed and starred in Million Dollar Baby 2004. The movie earned Eastwood an Oscar for Best Director and a Best Actor nomination for the second time . He had other successes directing the multiawardwinning films Mystic River 2003 Flags of our fathers 2006 Letters from Iwo Jima 2006 and The changeling 2008 . After a fouryear hiatus from acting Eastwood's return to the screen in the successful Gran Torino 2008 .";

	schema:headline " A fine intelligent thriller with thanks to Clint Eastwood Gene Hackman and Judy Davis among others";
	schema:reviewBody "So the president of the United States may not be the nicest guy in the world. Well we've known that can be the case since 1789. So the idea of our presidents engaging in sexual shenanigans may be as uncomfortable as realizing our parents do it. Well we've learned more than we want to know over the last few decades about how our presidents spend their time when they aren't bringing peace to the world and ensuring our domestic tranquility. One of the reasons Absolute Power is such a fine thriller is that it involves the dirty doings  murder coverups selfserving righteousness  of those in high elected office. Absolute Power is the story of Luther Whitney Clint Eastwood one of the great thieves of the world who breaks into the mansion of Walter Sullivan E. G. Marshall a very rich very powerful and very old political kingmaker. But then Luther hears voices and has to hide in a bedroom vault with a oneway mirror. He has to watch the rough sex between the rich man's much younger wife and a friend of hers. When things get out of hand and she angrily starts to do some stabbing suddenly two very competent men break in and shoot the lady dead. They're followed by an aggressively competent woman who proceeds to clean things up and spin a story that a thief must have killed the lady of the house. Luther comes to realize that the two shooters are Secret Service agents the competent woman is Gloria Russell Judy Davis the president's chief of staff and the man is Allen Richmond Gene Hackman the unscrupulous president of the U. S. Luther is spotted and barely escapes but Russell and the two agents manage to identify him. They also learn he has an estranged daughter Kate Whitney Laura Linney a young prosecutor. At first Luther decides to take his accrued wealth and flee the country. Then he sees a press conference on television where Richmond uses the griefstricken Sullivan who made him president in a smarmy soap opera of shared grief. Luther changes his mind and decides to see that justice is done. Luther's brand of justice is resourceful clever and dangerous. All the while he has to deal with an honest homicide cop Seth Frank Ed Harris who is on his trail an assassin hired by Sullivan to kill whoever killed his wife and the machinations of Gloria Russell determined to shield Richmond aided by the two Secret Service agents. One Bill Burton Scott Glenn has a conscience. The other Tim Collin Dennis Haysbert does not. Eastwood and writer William Goldman have in my opinion concocted a fine intelligent thriller that plays off Eastman's age Go down a rope in the middle of the night? If I could do that I'd be the star of my AARP meetings. gives us some fine set pieces the breakin killing and cleaning up the attempt on Luther's life by two separate assassins when he meets his daughter and the wonderfully played dance at a White House ball between Hackman and Davis and which is told at a moreorless humansized scale. While I think perhaps too much time was spent on the relationship between Luther and his daughter it's this relationship well acted between Eastman and Linney that helps raise the movie beyond just another thriller. Three things make this movie so good. First there are two sets of intriguing relationships one of which is poignant and tender the other almost grotesquely amusing. The Eastwood Linney situation is the first. And then there is the Allen RichmondGloria Russell pas de dieux. He depends on her but we know he'd toss her out in a minute if he needed to. She depends on him probably loves him and would gut her mother to protect him and her power I'll take care of everything. Like I always do.. It's fascinating especially as played out by Hackman and Davis. Their White House waltz at the ball where Davis is coy because she thinks the necklace she received was a present from Richmond and Richmond knows and tells her that the necklace was the one worn by Sullivan's wife and that it had to have come from Luther Whitney is a classic lesson in acting. The two of them play every emotion you can think of all the while dancing in closeup and smiling for the admiring guests. The scene is a tour de force and immensely funny. Second this movie is so good for what Eastwood and Goldman don't do. This is a thriller without explosions without wild car chases and without star posing. We're left to focus on the story on the intelligence of the dialogue on the cleverness of the situation. As Roger Ebert said it's a thriller not upstaged by its thrills. Third and most importantly is the casting. The impact of the movie primarily rests with Eastwood Hackman and Davis. Each one has shown many times that they can carry a movie by themselves. Judy Davis is the least known and has been stuck in character roles for years. However just watch her in My Brilliant Career A Passage to India or Children of the Revolution to see an actress who can dominate a movie. The second tier made up of Ed Harris E. G. Marshall Laura Linney Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert are just as effective. These are experienced actors who work well together and who know how to deliver their stuff. E. G. Marshall at 83 gives a performance that combines great sadness with an implacable sense of retribution. And Scott Glenn such a good actor who has slowly slipped down to smaller secondary roles gives a performance of such regret it nearly distracts us from the story.".

	schema:headline " Absolute Power???? Absolute rubbish more like.";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan and I think I'm dangerously close to being in love with the beautiful Laura Linney. Combine the two and what do you get? A film made in heaven? No  nearer to hell in fact.I read somewhere that Eastwood was so methodical and resolute in his film making that he managed to shoot Absolute Power 3 weeks ahead of schedule and 24 million under budget. Now I don't know if he had spent that money and time on the film if it would be an improvement but it couldn't be any worse.Right from the getgo this film is doomed. Hackman a criminally underused Hackman is the President having some midnight fun with the wife of his biggest supporter. He gets a little rough she fights back too much for the liking of the secret service men who in the end shoot her dead in her own bedroom. All of this is witnessed by Eastwood hiding in a secret vault room. The chase is now on. But the thing is  nothing  not one single thing afterwards fits. There is NO suspense no drama a sequence of events that would make your eyes water with incredulity and enough plot holes to drive a truck through  sideways.I won't can't  don't have the space nor the time go into all of the issues with this film but here's a flavour 1. Eastwood abseils out a window of the crime scene with a pack that must weigh a ton on his back  filled with jewelscash and then manages to outrun 2 trained secret service agents through a forest. Now the fact that Eastwood is quite obviously an old man carrying substantial weight doesn't seem to matter. The two guys following him must be 25 years younger are armed and even have night vision goggles !!!! Yet cannot catch him.2. The day after the theftmurder Ed Harris the police investigator walks into his office holding Eastwood's file. He says something about how a friend of his told him there are only 6 guys IN THE ENTIRE WORLD that could pull off that theft and only 1 of those 6 lives in D.C.  Eastwood! Is this how police investigation works??!! Very convenient that he just lives right under their noses too.3. Harris then persuades Eastwood's daughter  Linney again criminally underused to set up her dad and bring him in. She agrees. Why? I don't know. But the setup goes wrong and she is shot at by 2 snipers one SS guy and another hired killer. Then Harris takes her home and starts flirting with her. Embarrassingly. I would have thought she would be a little aggrieved that he nearly got her and her father killed a few hours previous but no... she invites him in for water and flirts back! This stretches believability to the max here. Why would a beautiful successful lawyer even look at a small balding cop who almost got her killed? To make matters worse Eastwood  at the end of the movie encourages his daughter to get together with this cop. WHAT?!! 4. One of the snipers is set up in a hotel room of some sort with a big window. After building his rifle like something from an airfix kit the SS man is simultaneously building his clicktogether gun too he HOLDS THE RIFLE OUT OF THE WINDOW waving it about. The place is in the middle of a high traffic public domain SWARMING with cops as well in daylight! 5. Eastwood turns up in disguise. My dog would come up with a better disguise. A hat and a Mac left over from Columbo. Terrible.6. The President then sends the SS guys to find Eastwood's daughter. I thought they would bring her in for questioning or put the squeeze on her but they simply follow her until she parks her car at the edge of a cliff prior to a run. Rather than arrest her and bring her in for questioning or use as bait they simply push her over the cliff and drive away? What purpose does that possibly serve?7. After Eastwood finds out that the SS is taking over surveillance of his daughter he drops a public phone speeds across the city from a phone booth in the middle of who knows where screeching his tires and blowing his horn repeatedly through traffic to the same spot where Linney has just been pushed over the cliff. How did he know she would be there? At no time did he see his daughter's car or talk to his daughter. How did he know to find his daughter there ?8. At the end when the billionaire husband walks in to the President with the knife in his hand  confronts the President and CUT there is a scene cut  and later it is announced that the President stabbed himself to death. WHAT? I could go on for another 5 pages with things that were just happening for the sake of it or Eastwood appears out of nowhere but I won't bore you any longer.Given Eastwood's pedigree behind the camera I am majorly surprised at this shoddy effort. He had a good cast Linney Harris Glenn Hackman Haysbert and a decent premise of a story  but the haphazard way this is thrown together is nothing short of abysmal.310  5 points for Linney alone 1 point taken away for Harris' terrible flirting and another point taken away for the serious amount of plot holes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood makes two kinds of movies. He cranks out surefire popcorn hits such as Dirty Harry 1971 and Pale Rider 1985. At the same time he gambles with unproven oddball projects such as Pink Cadillac 1989 and A Perfect World 1993. Eastwood's latest opus Absolute Power costarring Gene Hackman Judy Davis Ed Harris Laura Linney and Scott Glenn combines elements of both kinds of Clint flicks. Altogether Absolute Power is a laid back efficient potboiler that avoids rabid sensationalism but delivers the goods.In Absolute Power Clint plays Luther Whitney a elderly but hitech cat burglar. During a jewelry heist at the posh estate of a wellknown Washington D.C. power broker a drunken couple interrupt Luther as he's cleaning out the safe. He is trapped in a closet that houses the vault and valuables but he remains undetected throughout the tryst. Suddenlythings get rough and the man Gene Hackman finds himself in a deadly fight with a scorned woman. She stabs him once in the arm and is poised to plunge a letter opener into his chest when his Secret Service bodyguards scramble in and gun her down. Meanwhile a shocked Luther sits quietly in the closet behind a twoway mirror and grimly contemplates his future. The man responsible for the murder of the socialite is none other than the President of the United States!Republicans will no doubt stand in line and argue that Alan Richmond Hackman is a Democrat. The President in Absolute Power is insidious. Gene Hackman a gifted actor who can turn his emotions on and off as easily as a water facet excels in his portrayal of a philandering President. The President's Chief of Staff Judy Davis struggles to keep a lid on the murder. The Secret Service agent Scott Glenn who shot the girl bows to the Chief of Staff's decision not to summon the police. They clear the room of all evidence. But they lose the incriminating letter opener. When they go back they find it gone and a rope hanging out a bedroom window. They realize somebody witnessed the murder but they fail to capture him.Absolute Power contains a couple of classic scenes. The President's tango with his chief of staff in a room full of guests while they discuss the murder is superb. Eastwood's clash with a Secret Service agent at the hospital is hardedged Old Testament revenge. If you're looking for a dandy confrontation scene between Eastwood and Hackman like the one they had in Unforgiven prepare to be disappointed. The Eastwood and Hackman characters never cross paths. Scriptwriter William Goldman of Heat has retooled David Baldacci's bestseller. Notably he's changed the ending. Absolute Power has enough scenes from the popcorn style Clint movies to get it over the rough spots but it strives to be different. Clint fans will approve of their hero's invincibility. As Luther Whitney Eastwood doesn't miss a trick in besting the bad guys. But he doesn't play his usual taciturn loner. His role emphasizes him as his father figure more than his action figure. Absolute Power is rated R but there's no nudity little blood and moderate profanity.".

	schema:headline " Killing The Trophy Wife";
	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood directs and stars in Absolute Power a film based on a book about a philandering president that came out in 1997. Now I wonder just who they could have had in mind?Gene Hackman who played so well against Eastwood in The Unforgiven is the president who has made a carefully arranged rendezvous with Melora Hardin the trophy wife of a very powerful and elderly Washington insider E.G. Marshall. When the sex starts to get rough because the two are quite inebriated the noise attracts secret service bodyguards Scott Glenn and Dennis Haysbert. They shoot Hardin down as she's about to stab Hackman with a letter opener. What nobody knows is that Eastwood is hiding in a vault in the bedroom. Clint's a professional burglar who decided that night to pick that expensive townhouse to rob. After that the power of the federal government comes down on him because he can topple that selfsame government.Absolute Power is a nicely paced politicalcrime thriller combining those two genres nicely for most of the film. But an incredibly muddled ending will leave you completely in the dark as to what exactly has happened or what the future will be.Other performances of note are Laura Linney as Clint's estranged daughter who is of all things a junior prosecuting attorney Ed Harris as the tough homicide cop from the DC police force who's good on his job but slow to realize the implications of what he's investigating. But best of all is Judy Davis as the hard as nails presidential chief of staff who tries for a coverup and would have succeeded but for Clint's unplanned presence at the crime scene.When Absolute Power came out no one could have missed the illusions to the Clintons. The first lady is never seen she's on a mission to Africa while all the action takes place. But E.G. Marshall is very suggestive of Averill Harriman who was gone eleven years at that time but who held that kind of influence within the Democratic party. He also had a much younger wife but not quite the difference in ages between Marshall and Hardin. This film also marked the farewell big screen performance of E.G. Marshall. Marshall's scene with Eastwood in the limousine is the best in the film.I can't comment on how Daniel Baldacci's novel ended from which this film was adapted but Clint should have opted for a much clearer ending. Then again such things even after Watergate are horrible to contemplate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goodness me I'm surprised at the low overall rating of this movie to say nothing of the caustic commentaries of those who gave it the thumbsdown. I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I certainly don't dispute the fact that there were some gaping plot holes but the tension the psychological baiting and the stellar acting quality from some of my favourites were more than enough to make up for any shortcomings. Knowing what we know about Bill Clinton's philandering or Kennedy's come to that the idea of such a death and its monstrously hypocritical concealment doesn't seem so farfetched. In fact conspiracy theorists have been hot on the Kennedy trail for years. Perhaps they were the inspiration for the original David Baldacci novel upon which this movie was rather loosely based. I myself have not read it through so cannot judge. Eastwood acts and directs himself in a role that carries far more depth and conviction than I have seen him play in any movie except perhaps 'Bridges Of Madison County'. Here he gets to play an ageing and unscrupulous thief an estranged but doting father and at last an avenging agentprovocateur. Simplistic shoot'emup Dirty Harry is long gone. Ed Harris plays the investigating police officer who gradually realises that there's more going on than meets the eye. There's a sly little thing begins developing between him and Eastwood's daughter. He offers a nice pitch between candour and suspicion.Gene Hackman plays the president using his 'obnoxious' method style to full advantage. There is excellent support all round. Scott Glenn is very good as the conscientious lieutenant torn between conflicting loyalties. And I particularly like E G Marshall as the president's favourite who is similarly trapped between grief anger and shame. This guy seems to have been playing thoughtful old men in movies for as long as I've been going to the cinema. The script is fair rather than clever but the quality of the players make the often mediocre lines seem perfectly normal and genuine. There are some fine moments of tension especially during the assassination attempts. The pacing camerawork and lighting are competent if not imaginative. And the incidental music and sound effects are all that a good thriller should possess. The ending is a little weak. The fate of the president seems implausible to say the least. Yet for the most part you get a good run for your money up to that point. It is considerably better than the remakes of 'Get Carter and 'The Italian Job'. I bought the DVD. Admittedly I only paid 3.00 at the supermarket but I'm perfectly happy to have it in my collection. If you like Eastwood in his more thoughtful oldage give it a whizz. He's as good as he is in 'Unforgiven' even if that movie itself is ultimately better.".

During a carefully planned burglary at the home of wealthy Walter Sullivan Whitney is disturbed to hear voices coming from outside the room he is in. Hiding in a secret room he observes from behind a twoway mirror the cheating wife of Sullivan with her lover for the night. Whitney is further startled to find that the man in the company of Mrs Sullivan is none other than the current president of the United States Allen Richmond. He is then horrified to witness the couples union getting out of control Richmond starting to get far too heavy handed with the lady in question. Things spiral out of control and during the fight Mrs Sullivan goes to stab the President with a paper knife thus giving the entering secret service agents no choice but to gun her down. Sensing a political scandal the agents and Richmond's Chief Of Staff Gloria Russell decide to cover the incident up. Whitney after making his escape doesn't know what to do who's going to believe a renowned thief but crucially will he be allowed to live if he comes forward? Dastardly goings on and government cover ups are merely part of what is going on in the search for Absolute Power.Absolute Power is a fine film but I'm a little biased because I really like the pacing of the picture and more importantly I like the plot. It's true that the film fails to capitalise on its first hour set up we are brought into Whitney's world and given reminders of dodgy doings that blight so many countries political machinations but then director Clint Eastwood and his team fall in to the trap of adding strands that merely alter the viewers attention span thus taking us away from what was a concrete and wholly engrossing plot arc. But with a truly diamond cast of professionals in the piece the film manages to stay the good side of good tho the ending is one that is sure to be a divisive one for any prospective first time viewers. Eastwood stars as Whitney and is joined by Gene Hackman President Allen Richmond Ed Harris Laura Linney Scott Glenn Dennis Haysbert Judy Davis and E.G. Marshall. William Goldman adapts from David Baldacci's popular novel and Eastwood's direction is the usual steady professional job that he would further enhance down the line with the likes of Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby.Should have been a truly great political based thrillerdrama but as it is I settle for it being a way above average one that has far too many good points to ever see it as being below average or bad. 710".

Also the screenplay contains only simple sentences what makes the characters quite flat. This is projected to the acting which is not really good. I haven't noticed one actor that would really try to do his best. All of the main actors can perform much better. But again this script wouldn't allow them.

I thought True Crime was mediocre Space Cowboys nothing but a gathering of names Bloodwork pretty lame and boring and Million Dollar Baby...well it's not really a Clint Eastwood film is it? It is a Hilary Swank film although Clint made perhaps his greatest performance ever in it.Anyway the first couple times I watched Absolute Power I thought it was OK but didn't do anything special for me. It is only now after seeing it again after many years that I see its' quality. Not among Eastwood's greatest works or roles but another exciting and pleasing work. After the sappiness of Bridges of Madison County this came as a breath of fresh air for us who appreciate the real Clint Eastwood. I am not putting down on that film either but such roles are not really where he is best put at use.This film boasts a really marvelous supporting cast consisting of Gene Hackman Laura Linney Scott Glenn Ed Harris and Judy Davis. All class acts. So if you have never seen it and are a fan of Eastwood see it! If you have seen it before but didn't quite get into it give it another try. This really is one of Clint's last good thrillers perhaps the last one that resembles his true classics.".

I was torn between empathy and disgust for her at times but she definitely succeeded at captivating me with their lives and story.  Predictable in parts but it still leaves you guessing. This was a quality ghost story with an old fashioned ambiance downright spooky. I was in awe of the ending a fairly intelligent premise.

In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucketloads of blood and grossout effects Amenbar actually reteaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish overconcerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world daylight in particular. She lives in a remote mansion and waits along with her 2 children for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay  by Amenbar himself  is not totally unique filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenbar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genrefilms of the last few decades.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow and uncomfortable ride.The story is simple. Grace lives in a mansion with her two children both allergic to sunlight. That little twist on the story was just great. It makes the film completely opposite than other ghost stories with Grace not afraid of the dark and making sure to keep the light out to save her children. This provides us with a very creepy and dark atmosphere. Plus the mansion is also a creepy place. Not to mention that in the film everyone who enters the house must close the previous door before opening the next.Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast in The Others. This may be one of her best performances ever She was also great in this years Moulin Rouge. She was really very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently who played Nicolas really seemed like siblings. Awesome job by both. Fionnula Flanagan was also fantastic as Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out and I didn't know where she stood. Was she good or bad? I didn't know but her acting was right on the ball.Alejandro Anemabar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy and the cinematography is beautiful. This guy's has got a bright future. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director Alejandro Amenabar. The music is creepy and really adds to the feel of a 50's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film and makes the scary scenes even scarier. The score is fabulous. Not only did Alejandro Amenabar direct and score but he wrote the great and welldeveloped screenplay.The Others is not without a great twist ending that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well and I was speechless after the film. Outstanding finale.This film is yet another horror film that proves that big budget special effects suck! This film is scary and it only had a 17m budget. The Others did great at the box office and deserved every buck it earned. It's a creepy film that has its very scary moments. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. This really reminded me of an old 40's or 50's film. I highly recommend this film to every fan of ghost stories.The Others 1010 A".

This movie is chilling very spooky with a few moments that will make you jump but it's a movie that works itself up and by the end of the movie you feel scared and like someone has zapped you a few times chilly from inside out but fulfilled.People have been comparing this to Sixth Sense. Though the movie may share similarities this stands on it's own. It's content is not trying to send a message except for a universal theme that you want to grasp onto. There is historical and religious content purely in context for the twists and turns and nuances to make this film so complete in every aspect. Everything works so well. This movie takes pride in each scene and each is set up so that you get the most of it. Everything relates to everything you are given clues the entire movie but it's set up so masterfully the ending is the suprise you've been waiting for.The performance by Kidman and the two children are one of a kind. It's a realistic interaction between siblings and a controlling dysfunctional but loving mother. The acting and writing the script is so well done it adds for scattered scenes that will hopefully stick around with you for a long time. There's this one beautiful scene in the movie it's where Grace Nicole Kidman is hugging her son and her daughter who is slightly estranged from her mom runs up and hugs her and there this look of absolute release on the face of Grace. Another great scene is when Grace carries her rifle around the house shoot the ghost! and she's desperately trying to protect her house and children.  There are more like that so keep your eyes open.The cinematography is innovative and brilliant camera angles and the lighting set everything up so well. The lighting is very important as well in fact the subject of light is so well mixed into the story the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does. There are times when you long for the darkness just as the characters long for the darkness due to a part of the plot including a health condition of the children which serves a basis for the mental thrill fest to come. To finish off this concoction try to listen to the score because it's very fitting.This is more of a drama than a thriller though it deserves to be a thriller it's scary but the power of it's dramatic side comes bursting through. This is a beautiful movie it has overtones of a more serious side and it's a movie that hardly belongs in  the horror section because of it's beauty but it's too darned eerie weird and chilling to fit anywhere else.".

And then the children held their own and even stole a few scenes from the more experienced players were just hellishly creepy.  The little girl was one of the most ominous characters I have ever seen in a film.  And the servants who were also finely played will keep you guessing the whole way through.  Every time you think you have it figured out some of the household help will pop up and throw the whole framework offkilter.The real attraction in this film is Nicole Kidman following up her bravura performance as Satine in Moulin Rouge with a woman teetering between insanity and iron control.  Grace has so many layers and Kidman reveals almost all of them through her face.  The film is anchored by her presence and she plays off the other actors extremely well  note the tense relationship she has with Anne her daughter.  When the two lock eyes it's like watching two trains crash headfirst into one another.The only disappointment in this movie is the ending which is slightly anticlimactic.  When you get to it you'll be satisfied and it ties up everything that's happened in the movie up to that point quite well.  But it seemed almost anticlimactic and I was left feeling a little bit let down.Overall I gave The Others a 910.".

The children Alakina Mann and James Bentley are also fantastic. Finally I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film many people don't realize this is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamn Fernndez and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt light and shadow reveal the objects and the people. I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain La stanza del figlio The shipping news The hours and Italiensk for begyndere but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 1010 is really fair for a film that has it all a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of bigtime projects that waste his potential. It is a film to feast on.. to savour to enjoy to remember....".

	schema:reviewBody "The others  The Others is a suspenseful horror film unlike many these days. Most are concerned with blood and gore teenage girls getting naked body count and not scary. The Others is atmospheric spooky bloodless and carried by strong acting and fleshed out characters. Yet it takes too long to make an impact and the final payoff is not as shocking as it should be. The plot is simple and not especially innovative your average ghost story but it seems fresh thanks to strong acting and a wellcrafted eerie atmosphere that rivals that of a Tim Burton film. Nicole Kidman is Grace a beautiful young married mother who must raise her two children Anne Alakina Mann and Nicholas James Bentley alone in their gigantic actually ridiculously large mansion on a British isle around the end of WWII. They are alone for the husband and father has been at war and has not returned and their housekeepers mysteriously vanished. Suddenly a trio of friendly caretakers arrive one day. Mrs. Mills Fionnula Flanagan is the amiable old lady Lydia Elaine Cassidy is a mute young girl and Mr. Tuttle Eric Sykes is the notsosocial gardener. However there is a strange arcane facet to the trio they have little background and had no way of knowing that Grace was offering positions at her manor. Aside from this Grace must deal with her children who have a deadly allergy to light which means that the house must be dark all the time allowing for a spooky dark shadowy ambience. Anna and Nicholas most importantly have been visited  by a family of ghosts. Noises  crying piano music and running  have been heard. And curtains that stop light from entering the house are opening and closing by themselves. The film is based around Grace's efforts to solve the enigma.I love the atmosphere of The Others set in a nostalgic and ominous 1940's estate. Snowy mist blankets the grass and crisp fall leaves. Murky waters of a lake border the chateau. Elegant furniture polished marble and wood floors neatlywoven blankets tautly fabricated furnishings of wood and olive green cloth coal black German sedans lightly wrinkled sweaters and jackets are all seemingly authentic from the era. One spectacular and tense scene has Grace haplessly stumbling through an impenetrably thick ocean of milky fog that weaves through overhanging trees and a ground of crunchy bronze and russet leaves.The action takes a while to get started up which is a major negative. This is due to the director Amenabar spending time to develop an involving plot 3D characters and the aforementioned dcor. While Amenabar succeeds in those respects we find ourselves wishing something would happen. Many people will easily become bored feel tempted to sleep or leave etc. but I while not exactly enthralled by that point in the film was still enjoying it.When we finally are treated to doses of suspense and chills not so much horror and terror it is satisfying. You most likely will find yourself on the edge of your seat or huddled in a ball anxiously awaiting the potentially fatal results of Grace's investigation. This is not so much because you care about her character but really because you expect a sudden scream and heartstopping outburst of maniacal ghosts. Most scenes are chilling including the door shutting in the piano room the old lady in the white dress and the final chaotic conclusion. However I can not say that I was truly horrified and paranoid from this film unlike The Sixth Sense where I was freaked out for months. I was still very entertained.I must commend all the actors in the film especially Nicole Kidman. The acting was down to earth and realistic despite Nicole Kidman forced into saying some foolish lines Something.. Diabolical!. The two child actors Mann and Bentley were excellent in a fairly difficult role for children. Another important downside to the film was the shocking conclusion. While I must admit that I found it brilliant it lacked the powerful punch I wish it had. I don't know why this is it just isn't. I am disappointed at how much potential the ending could have packed and how little it did. Overall I found The Others a highly entertaining thriller with magnetic milieus and plenty of startles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others' directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar Abre los Ojos is a stylish spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England and Grace Nicole Kidman is the mother of two small children Charles Christopher Eccleston and Anne Alakina Mann who are allergic to the sunlight so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously the mansion's staff left the week before which precipitates the arrival of three new servants a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child and unexplained footsteps opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uberfragile Grace until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others' Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion the dark rooms lit by candles within the house both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool haughty faade the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves particularly Alakina Mann who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and wellwritten regardless but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent. 'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means but it is a refreshing change from the standard thrillersuspense fare because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children obviously this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic jumpcut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal and it is worth every minute. 710Shelly".

	schema:headline " Fairly decent and original concept.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because scary movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B horrorthriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However I was pleasantly surprised.First off I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.Grace Kidman and her two young photosensitive X.P. children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later she will have to come to terms with what's going on...Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn hard nosed uptight tart and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive the house must always be dark and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well the fog which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well and is well placed and executed.Overall I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband I would have ranked it higher.Easily a solid 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because scary movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B horrorthriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However I was pleasantly surprised.First off I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.Grace Kidman and her two young photosensitive X.P. children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later she will have to come to terms with what's going on...Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn hard nosed uptight tart and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive the house must always be dark and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well the fog which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein.

The plot is very well disclosed and the entire cast has magnificent performances. Nicole Kidman is very beautiful before her plastic surgery of the nose and has a topnotch performance.

Grace is an absolute nutter isn't she ? But then the story twists and turns a little and then I thought she might be a victim  I mean these servants ... But the story keeps twisting along nicely so that the script is one step ahead of the audience . There is a slight problem though if you're familiar to Amenabar's work  especially ABRE LOS OJOS and that is that he's a master of the shock twist ending and I thought with the appearance of Eccleston's Charles Stewart half way through the movie I had the story sussed . I actually did work out how he fitted into the story and was correct in guessing his fate but I never believed in what the twist ending was so well done Senor Amenabar There is a problem with this type of story and THE OTHERS is no different in that respect  You can only enjoy the movie once since you know the shock twist at the end when you see it a second  third  fourth time and there's another very successful film  No clues but you'll know the one I'm talking about after you see this  that has the same idea which means comparison's are inevitable  but it's difficult to compare to one another . Certainly THE OTHERS has a more creepy atmosphere and probably a better pace and cast with special mention going to Alakina Mann as Anna who plays her role as a totally convincing horrid brat  nice to know Amenabar has resisted the temptation to portray the children as sugery sweet little cherubs which is often the case in Hollywood movies  you might not believe this but THE OTHERS in fact is a Spanish film".

The Others in particular while devoid of OTT performances costumes and sing along songs will appeal to a lot of people.  People who enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' in particular will enjoy it and those who're into XFiles' will surely enjoy this too.  However it isn't a slasher thriller with some ditzy teenagers running around a school chased by a homicidal fisherman. No it's much more intelligent and to me seemed a far slicker movie than even  'Sixth Sense'It's focus is on a family after the war living in an old mansion prime ghost story location!  Why can't they have a nice semi detached?!.  The children are photosensitive and the house must be kept in darkness and this creates an imposing atmosphere from the off.  The characters including the mother played by Kidman seem to have more to them than we are led to believe at the start.  There are noises in the house the children say they've seen people walking around the mother seems to on the edge and about to break and all the while the creepy atmosphere grows and grows.It's strength lies in the fact that it doesn't simply throw the characters into scary situations e.g. some man chasing them around the house to get a reaction from the audience.  It instead creates a sense of dread.  The director uses the camera and sound to merely suggest what's there.  The viewer's mind is allowed to make up the rest and is much more effective than several million dollars of special effects.  The sound of whispering in an empty room or the haunting sound of a piano playing from a locked room.  And having creepy maids and gardeners puts the audience at unease trying to second guess if they're good bad or evil.The story takes a lot of dramatic twists and turns.  And in the end everything is to paraphrase one of the characters ...Changed.  It'll never be the same again.  The conclusion is one to rival 'Sixth Sense'. You're feelings are towards the characters are completely different and The Others of the title are not who you'd have thought they were.The mother is of course the main focus of the story.  Treading it would seem a fine line between exploding and being ready to give up.  At first it seems sure fire who's good and who's bad.  But then you feel a growing antipathy towards some characters and to a certain extent the mother.  In the end though you only feel extremely sorry and sad for the characters yet angry at some of them too.This movie along with Moulin Rouge' was a pleasure to see well it was a pleasure in hindsight.  It was definitely in the too engrossed to move' range when I was in the middle of watching it and I would recommend it to anyone except those with baby's or heart conditions".

It's an exciting  bizarre film  skillfully written and proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling .The basis for this movie is an episode of the British series 'Armchair Theatre' called 'The Others' made in 1970 and remade as a movie called 'Voices' in 1972  this version is more elaborate but the story is the same. Los Otros comes from a peculiar crosssection of production cultures  it stars an Australian woman playing an Englishwoman  it was written and directed by a Spaniard backed by Americans set in Jersey but filmed in Spain. Plenty of twists and turns  the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling musical score by the same Alejandro Amenabar . He along with screenwriter Mateo Gil appear in one of the photographs of dead people . Furthermore  Alejandro also wrote the interesting plot  embarking into the phantasmagorical psychological or even quasisurrealist story . Intelligent edition special use of luxurious sets by Benjamin Fernandez and slick utilization of shock images make this one a magnificent film . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe which heightens the suspense . This was the first film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas Spain's national film awards with not a single word of Spanish spoken in it and his film went on after its release  to become Spain's biggest grossing domestic film of all time. The film opened in the US at number 4 in the box office charts and stayed around that figure for its initial run. Seven weeks into release it actually climbed up to the number 2 spot. The picture was very well directed by Amenabar in his third movie after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps bestknown early shortfilm Himenptero in 1992 in which he directed  produced acted and wrote the script and the music Amenbar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with Thesis Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut  a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And Abre Los Ojos that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky 2001 starring Tom Cruise who in The others was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . Los Otros 2001 was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky 2001 the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabr''s Abre Los Ojos 1997. Ironically it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . Los Otros confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenbar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the alltime worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music as well as composing the music for other films  most notably Butterflies tongue 1999. He subsequently directed Mar Adentro with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epichistorical Agora with Rachel Weisz . Rating  Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .".

Since his perhaps bestknown early shortfilm Himenptero in 1992 in which he directed  produced acted and wrote the script and the music Amenbar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with Thesis Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut  a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And Abre Los Ojos that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky 2001 starring Tom Cruise who in The others was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . Los Otros 2001 was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky 2001 the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabr''s Abre Los Ojos 1997. Ironically it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . Los Otros confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenbar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the alltime worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music as well as composing the music for other films  most notably Butterflies tongue 1999. He subsequently directed Mar Adentro with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epichistorical Agora with Rachel Weisz . Rating  Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .";

	schema:reviewBody "The Others is directed and written by Alejandro Amenbar. It stars Nicole Kidman Fionnula Flanagan Christopher Eccleston Elaine Cassidy Eric Sykes Alakina Mann  James Bentley. Amenbar also scores the music and the cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarobe. Plot sees Kidman as Grace Stewart the mother of two children who have an allergy to sunlight. With her husband still missing in action during WWII Grace and the children reside in a remote mansion on the isle of Jersey. When one day a trio of house servants turn up looking to fill the vacancies at the mansion it coincides with strange supernatural occurrences around the home. Are the children being mischievous? Is Grace losing her mind? Or is there indeed something not of this world at work?The haunted house creeper has had a number of film version tellings over the years. A different kind of horror film it's a subgenre that relies on suggestion and atmospheric shocks instead of rampant blood letting. The Others is one of the finest of its type a wonderfully crafted chiller that thrives on old fashioned values to deliver its scares. The set up is standard formula stuff a big gloomy mansion that's nice and remote with rolling gardens and finds itself often cloaked by impenetrable fog. A couple of cherubic kids classically inviting creepy activity and servants that have foreboding written all over their respective foreheads. Throw into the pot the lonely female trying to hold her self together as things threaten to unhinge the family bond and it's so far so formulaic. But Amenbar for his English language debut has a great sense of mood and pacing slowly unwinding the coil to reveal a sense of impending doom playing it out amongst eerie sounds and deft camera movements about the house. That the kiddies have a light sensitive problem gives Amenbar the perfect excuse to keep the whole thing dimly lit to great eerie effect.With unease in place and the small band of characters firmly established the other key element of the film starts to kick in namely the mystery element. Just what exactly is going on here? The children excellently played by dbutantes Mann  Bentley garner much sympathy but at the same time we suspect they might be at fault for the ghostly activity. The servants are led by the officious looking but gently spoken Bertha Mills Flanagan superb you sense something isn't quite right but all cards are played close to the chest so as to not reveal anything. So much so that when the reveal does come it's a doozy firmly rounding out The Others as a classic of its type. The trump card here tho is Kidman. Pale faced and cold to the eye she nails the plummy English accent whilst turning in a classic performance of a repressed woman battling againstit seemseverything and everyone. Following in the footsteps of Deborah Kerr and Julie Harris Kidman's ability to make Grace's mental disintegration believable marks it out as one of the best horror subgenre performances ever.Suspense scares and some tricks up its sleeve The Others is every inch a quality bit of psychological horror. 910".

The problem for me was that as soon as I saw Christopher Eccleston Kidman's husband in the movie appear out of nowhere in the fog the twist became pretty clear to me. Also the servants' clothes gave them away as ghosts too oldfashioned. Having seen The Sixth Sense I just knew that if the husband and the servants were ghosts then Kidman and the kids must be ghosts too. I quite enjoyed the ending but it wasn't half as scary as the ending of The Sixth Sense. I know it's not fair to compare films in this way but I can't help but do it in this case simply because they are based on the same premise and quite frankly The Others jumped on the bandwagon in that sense.As far as Kidman's muchperformance is concerned I thought she was good but not impressive.

It goes back to the roots of the horror genre employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.'The Others' is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photosensitive children tenyearold Anne and sixyearold Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness in deference to the children's condition and Grace's husband is lost in war only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there's noone in the room. Grace deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don't exist initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can't deny there is something ominous about the house...Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace who does love her children dearly even if she doesn't always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy as the three servants are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors Alakina Mann and James Bentley who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience both children given firstclass depictions of their characters showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann in particular excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.'The Others' is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film in the tradition of 'The Exorcist' and 'The Devil's Backbone' it instead relies upon more oldfashion methods of frightening the audience which are far more effective. The story is wellpaced leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters' motives are right to the end.This film has to be one of the best horror films I've ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright.".

Take The Sixth Sense or Vanilla Sky for instance. They had plots and made you think. But take say House on Haunted Hill the remake? Blood. Sex. Gore. Bad special effects. Scares? A real plot? Any reason for making the movie whatsoever besides cheap thrills and money? I think not. The Others isn't gross at all. The character development is good and the musical score and sound is outstanding. And Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances to date.Kidman is Grace a prim religious 1940's mother with two photosensitive children Anne and Nicholas. Every day instead of school the children study the Bible by candlelight. By the way the setting for the story is great too. Almost the entire film is shot inside the beautiful but very dark house. At the beginning three mysterious servants come to work at the houseeven though the advertisement Grace meant to send out never got mailed. This is because they say the servants worked in the house before.Soon Anne begins mentioning Victor a boy that assumingly keeps talking to her. While at first it looks like a good plan to scare Nicholas eventually Grace hears noises in the abandoned room upstairs. The old forbidden piano starts playing after the children and servants are asleep and even though a door isn't supposed to be opened without the previous one being closed first Grace keeps seeing the door behind her in the corner of her eye open.This might not sound interesting or scary but you have to see it. The setup for each sudden frightening moment is about threequarters of what really scares you and that's true for most other movies too. I probably shouldn't go on with the plot because this is one of the only movies where just one little spoiler ruins the entire movie.The Others is also probably the only movie that scares you out of your wits every time not just the first time and at the same time doesn't give you nightmares for weeks. Probably because none of the scary images are really enough to stick in your head.The children Alakina Mann and James Bentley are excellent young actors especially James Bentley. He deserves the Young Artist Award he received for this picture no question about it and Alakina Mann deserves her nomination.I hate to break it to you fans of gory thrillers but blood and guts just aren't scary. Sure they're gross but they're more hokey than frightening and it looks as if the filmmakers haven't got anything better to lengthen the movie with like actual content. Movies like The Others really deserve praise for using things important to the plot or at least explaining them at the end. I recommend this to anyone who's in the mood for a good scare without the gore.".

But today it isn't there any more. That's really unfair. It largely deserved its place and to occupy it as long as possible.After Tesis 1996 and Abre Los Ojos 1997 Amenabar goes up a notch and signs with the Others 2001 a masterful masterpiece which refreshes fantastic cinema and breathes new life into the theme of the haunted house. He largely deserves his nickname of new young prodigy of Spanish cinema. With Tom Cruise partly responsible for the production one could fear a strong Hollywood influence in Amenabar's opus. But fortunately it's nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact just like the great M Night Shyamalan Alejandro Amenabar appears as a real author on the fringe of the Hollywood industry and he's got enough character to let his style nurture. Let's hope he won't be crushed by the Hollywood machine. The movie was shot in Spain with eventually a modest budget 17 millions of dollars and it was a surprise to see it doing brilliantly a little everywhere in the world.Amenabar had already ventured in the dreadful world of the snuffmovies with his debut movie Tesis and had succeeded in mixing several films genres in one cohesive narrative line with Abre Los Ojos. But with the Others one didn't suspect a real ease in the In Camera. It's a quite dramatic change of style and in the end a successful translation in the fantastic.Amenabar's references are easy to guess. They're three cornerstones in fantastic cinema the Innocents 1961 the Haunting 1963 and the Sixth Sense 1999. The Others can be considered as the meeting of these three opus. All the elements of the fantastic movie with Gothic nature are gathered and perfectly used. There's no shortage of examples an austere mansion with a sinister architecture which hides a dark secret big rooms half obscured a mist which tends to thicken throughout the days characters with sinisterlooking faces. All these features blend themselves to create a nearly stifling universe. Moreover Amenabar favors a calm and quite slow rhythm to play with the spectator's nerves as much as possible and we are entitled to real moments of fear. It is also interesting to write that a minimum of special effects is just enough for the director to maintain anxiety. He also weaves a more and more threatening atmosphere marked out by the progressive reversal of situation in the beginning of the film Nicole Kidman dominated Fionnula Flanagan but in the middle of the film it's the contrary which happens. And of course like in a successful suspense movie virtually all the obscure or ambiguous points are clarified making the story incredibly coherent and after the final conclusion which of course I won't reveal the very last sequences have a strong emotional power and it would take a heart of stone to resist them. On another extent let's also take down the omnipresence of religion supposed to be a sort of protection for Nicole Kidman but which in the end turns out to be useless. One can put forward that Amenabar had surely a strong catholic education and he must have lost his faith...But the qualities of the Others don't stop here. It is visually and technically an appealing movie with a gorgeous photography certain images are breathtaking and there's also a careful work on sound and the original soundtrack. On of the most important characteristics from Alejandro Amenabar is that he composes the music of his own films and her very simply he excels himself. The delicate and disturbing sounds we can hear contribute to reinforce the threatening atmosphere of the film and makes us feel a little more illatease again.The Others was released when Nicole Kidman had just divorced Tom Cruise and I had thought that she gave the image of a more mature and ambitious actress. Amenabar's flick confirms it. One is really under the impression that she gives the best that she can. There's nothing to say about her role she takes with consummate skill. Her role of haughty middleclass housewife with a cold and penetrating look is sufficient to make one shudder. What is strange is that her name in the film is Grace and her hairstyle is reminiscent of Grace Kelly's. Is it a nod to the actress? Be that as it may it would be unfair to forget the rest of the cast especially Fionnula Flanagan who under a docile and frail appearance can easily become disturbing. At last Amenabar made quite a creditable job of the directing of children who are in general difficult actors to direct.A chilling and great movie from start to finish. To fully savor all lights turned off. Highly recommended. Hats off to Mr Amenabar he is one of the main leaders of Spanish cinema and his career is starting well as the triumph of Mar Adentro 2004 testifies.".

The script has a story that doesn't contain any slow spots and slowly raises the tension as things progress. There is also a twist near the very end that will surprise some viewers though I must admit I had a little idea that not only were things not quite what they seemed but also that a character who appeared sporadically up to that point would have to have some play in the end since otherwise he didn't seem to have any purpose in the movie.

	schema:headline " Twistladen suspenser. The surprises are well disguised but ultimately they run out of credibility.";
	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Shaffer's scripts are nearly always identifiable by the way they stay cleverly one step ahead of the viewer. In his original scripts such as The Wicker Man and Sleuth Shaffer skilfully hides shocking and memorable twists right up to the films' conclusion. Also in his adapted scripts  such as Frenzy and Death On The Nile  Shaffer manages to generate lots of mystery and suspense before delivering his trademark surprisesolutions. However in Absolution a 1978 film scripted by Shaffer and directed by Anthony Page the twists are somewhat overdone. Indeed the film becomes positively excessive in its determination to lead the viewer up various blind alleys in pursuit of countless red herrings. Slowly but surely credibility is strained until it collapses altogether at the film's preposterous climax. This is a shame as the film has an intriguing concept and contains some good performances.At a particularly strict Catholic boarding school a pupil named Ben Stanfield Dominic Guard grows fed up with his reputation as the teacher's pet of priest Father Goddard Richard Burton. In a moment of outrageous mischief he speaks to Father Goddard in the confession box and confesses to him that he has murdered a fellow pupil named Arthur Dyson Dai Bradley. Goddard is understandably distraught to learn of this more so because he is bound by duty to keep secret all confessions that are made to him. Later Goddard goes to the place where Ben claims to have buried the corpse but discovers when he digs it up that it is merely a scarecrow and that he has been the victim of a nasty prank. The plot thickens when Ben again tells Father Goddard that he has murdered his fellow student but this time a real body turns up. The mental strain on Goddard is immense. On one hand he knows who the killer is but on the other he can do nothing because his religion says that whatever is passed in confidence in a confession box must remain forever secret. Mad with despair Goddard takes desperate measures to put a stop to these evil pranks only to learn too late that all is not what it seems.Burton's performance as the priest is pretty good. One must admit that the film is farfetched and reaches a delirious hysterical tone by the end but throughout Burton manages to give a believable and absorbing performance. The pacing is quite good too with a deliberately slow buildup that lures the viewer into a false sense of security before the genuinely nasty stuff gets underway. In some ways it seems churlish to criticise Shaffer's script for its twists because they do at least keep the audience guessing and few will predict what is coming next. But the thing that makes most of Shaffer's earlier works so effective is that the twists fit in to the overall narrative with eerie plausibility whereas in this one they seem extremely contrived and overthetop. I certainly don't agree with some reviewers who suggest that the film is an unmitigated disaster and the fact that U.S distributors shelved the film for 10 years is very unfair in light of some of the absolute rubbish they release straight away. Absolution is a midquality audience teaser not plausible enough to have any longlasting resonance but tangled enough to keep its audience guessing.".

Anyway Burton gives a great performance as a man of the cloth. He's conflicted and pained and when he even hears about a sin you can see him struggling not to take it as a personal insult. He's a teacher and mentor in a boys' Catholic school and during one of his lessons the boys ask about the rules during confession. If someone confesses to a crime will the priest turn him into the police? Burton answers almost directly into the camera for the audience's benefit that the priest is bound to silence and can't call the police if he's told of a crime. Then surprise! One of his students confesses a murder.Granted if this movie had been made today it would be a lot more gruesome and probably have a few more twists and turns. But it was made in 1978 and so if you watch it keep that in mind. There are a couple of violent scenes but nothing overly graphic. And I thought it was thrilling with enough twists and turns to keep me on the edge of my seat. It's a lot of fun to watch a manipulative snotnosed student take Burton to the brink of insanity!".

And this coldness and inflexibility will eventually be his undoing.In the course of his work Father Goddard has also managed to alienate a strangera drifter and a bit of a rogue Billy Connelly. Instead of showing the love of God Goddard is cold and dismissive of the man. However because he does treat this man so poorly as well as students one of the boys finds a kindred spirit in this drifter. They become friends and the boy starts sneaking out at night to spend time with the guy. Where does all this lead? Well certainly NOT where you'd expect it to go!!! The film turns out to be a dandy suspense filmand one that kept me guessing many times. It's very interesting and worth seeing though I have one reservation. While the teens playing the students were pretty good actors occasionally Burton seemed to overact. I know he's well respected by many but here he did seem to overdo it just a bit. By the way another part that didn't come off well was the violent scene involving a shovel to the head. However I would say that although it looked fake I am happy it wasn't more graphic!".

It is absurdly easy to guess who the real villain is by the 23 mark.Added to which the plot would have us believe that said villain is able to predict with almost clairvoyant certainty what other characters will do  and fail to do  in the situations he's set in motion. And at a certain point this becomes preposterous.Finally while the movie is wellacted all of the characters including Burton's are insufferable.So an easytospot a villain unbelievable plot twists and characters you despise. Only a solid first hour and fine performances save it from a lower rating. My score 6.".

It's not what Father Goddard does but how he's manipulated and later drove to the brink of madness and suicide that's so disturbing. All this while Father Goddard is trying to help one of his students Benji Stanfield Dominic Guard who had gone astray from the schools teachings to the point of murder.Being looked upon as his best pupil Father Goddard has Benji set up to all the students in his Latin class as an example of what a good and intelligent young man should be. This has the nerdy and crippled Arthur Dyson David Bradley always try to hang out with Benji in order that some of his popularity with both the administrators and students in the school would rub off on himself. Benji tolerates the oddball Dyson up to a point but gets a bit turned off by his always through no fault of his own screwing things up for him in his fumbling and butterfingered ways.It's when Benji doing his morning run which the lame legged Dyson couldn't participate in runs into this easy rider type hippie Blakey Billy Connolly that he starts to change for the worst. Blakey putting ideas into Benji's head about drugs and sex together with his hippie girlfriend LouellaSharon Duce that has Father Goodard put his foot down and forbid Benji never to see Blakey again. Benji trying to mend fences with Father Goodard asks him to receives his confession which the Father reluctantly does and gets all the steamy and unholy details of his relationships with both Blakey and Louella.Father Goddard not being able to really do anything since the things that Benji confessed to him are between him and Benji and God tries in a round about sort of way to get the young man back on the right track. Benji who was getting fed up with the restrictions of his Catholic faith in how it keeps him from doing the things that he really wants to do starts to play games with the concerned Father Goddard. Benji goes out and committing a number of horrendous acts that included the murder of his good friend Blakey who was about to leave him. Confessing those acts or crimes to Father Goddard Benji knows full well that he couldn't tell the police or even have him expelled from the school.Playing Father Goddard for a fool Benji starts to enjoy his driving the very serious and strict man almost insane. Running to where Benji told him that he buried the murdered Blakely Father Goddard only finds out that the whole story about murdering him was a joke. Later Benji again confesses that this time around he really did in fact murder Balkey and when the now almost hysterical Father Goddard goes to the place where Benji told him that Blakey was buried he indeed finds the man dead and buried! The movie then takes a sudden Uturn when it comes out with yet another confession on Benji's part that the lame and dejected Dyson was also a victim of Benji's insanity. These revelations drives Father Goddard over the top which is exactly what Benji was planning to do to him right from the start. Bringing Father Goddard to the brink of condemning himself in the Catholic tradition to eternal damnation or in the eyes of the law a life behind bars in either a prison or mental institution.The movie has a very out of left field surprise ending where we see what was really behind all this manipulating of poor Father Goddards mind. This act of revenge and jealousy that went as far as driving the man to not only lose his faith and sanity but his life as well. Father Goddard demise came about by him innocently going along with those who were using him and his good will in helping them for their own sick selfish and ungodly purposes.".

Here however the twist was pretty lame and illogical and it almost seemed comical. Without giving anything away I'll just say that I felt as someone in the writing room threw this ending out and it only made it in the movie because no one could think of something better. As a payoff I found it to be slightly insulting. I focus so much of my attention on the ending because the whole movie is in the last five minutes. Every other part of the movie is fine. Solid acting a script that set up the ending beautifully and Billy Connolly was a great casting choice but all that lost when the writer hit a block. Since the whole movie was in the ending I would have to say this is one to stay away from unless you're a Billy Connolly fan in which case just watch the bits where he's in. Rating 2140".

I instead found myself moved by the determination of these young boys to survive. The plane crash the avalanche starvation illness...all insurmountable odds stacking themselves against them and they STILL found the strength to preserve their own lives.

The movie version is no less engrossing the entire story being made absolutely gutwrenching by the fact that it's true. A South American rugby team is stranded in the remote heights of the Andes after a plane crash and has to find a way to survive the freezing temperatures their injuries and a variety of other challenges not the least of which is a lack of food. The acting in it is good but the situation itself becomes the focus rather than the actors and so I can't really say that anyone in particular stood out to me but that doesn't come across as a weakness here. After all the story of survival was a story of teamwork a star to the movie would have detracted from that.This is literally gutwrenching stuff and I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher rating. It is not an easy movie to watch at times. The injuries are graphically portrayed the suffering of the injured very realistic and the ultimate solution to the food problem will upset some people but in spite of what I've heard some say about this movie it isn't the focus of the story. It's just an example of what had to be done to survive in an impossible situation. It also has a surprisingly strong spiritual component to it.Truly excellent.1010".

Exactly how would you pass the time in conversation if you survived the plane crash freezing temperatures hunger and watching other people die in front you for 72 days? I don't think the dialogue was that bad considering the time slot and trying to keep the story interesting for its two hours. When I first saw it I was shocked by the plane crash sequence. I first thought it was all about cannibalismlike the Donner party but it wasn't. It was more about keeping hope alive and working together even when despair and dying seems easier to give in to. What the rugby teammates did under the circumstances was incredible until they made the solution to hike out and get help. I haven't read the book its based on yet I read a little about the actual people who went through the ordeal. There are similarities and contrasts with the reallife story and the movie. I appreciate the movie after seeing several times and the actual story behind it.  I think it's one of the most fantastic films that I have seen.".

If you didn't know better you would say it was all made up by some scenarist with too much of inspiration looking for a spectacular and sometimes shocking script. But unfortunately enough it all really happened which makes the movie interesting to watch.For those who don't know the story yet it is based on what happened to the Uruguayan rugby team during and after their plane crash in the middle of the Andes mountains in 1972. Some of them survive the initial crash some wounded others only with some minor scratches. They pray that they will soon be found but no search team is coming to rescue them. At first they keep themselves alive by eating what they find in the luggage of the passengers but soon that food is also gone. If they don't eat they will all die. And they need to gain strength because they need to try to get help themselves. There is only one horrible solution they will have to eat the dead people...Despite the fact that this may sound horrible to many I must say that it isn't as bad as you may think. Of course you'll see them cut a piece out of the bodies and eat it but it is done in a watchable way. I'm sure that only the very faint of heart will not be able to watch it. It's a part of the story but it is never shown in a too spectacular or sensational way.All in all this is a very interesting movie. I asked myself several times 'What would you do if you were in that situation? Would you eat it or not?' I'm not sure but I guess I would but that's not why I tell you this. Just the fact that I was able to think about it in this way shows that it wasn't too bloody or with too much gore I really don't like that. That's why I reward this movie with a 7.510.".

The actors went to extrodinary lengths to look the part and they all played their parts extremely well and handled the roles sympathetically. Top grade movie all round!";

	schema:reviewBody "Given the knowledge from the onset of the movie that the story and characters are real we are plunged into a world where man must choose whether or not he wants to survive and live to see the world as he knows it once more. The reality i felt when watching this movie was how easily we take for granted things like food to eat clean clothes to wear and warmth that comes from blankets and heaters. By the middle of the movie when watching it last night after nearly 10 years i was aghast at the sheer strength of some of all of the people that survived the initial crash of the actual plane. And when the deciding moment arrives where they must choose whether they are willing to eat human flesh to survive and find a way beyond the Andes I found i asked myself 'what would you do?'. The answer is i don't know. i truly don't. This movie makes you realise how precious life is and how we should never take anything for granted. How we should be thankful of all that we have and yet how easy it is to lose all that just by a bad twist of fate. Call this movie what you will I think it's a mustsee for everyone because it really happened. There are lessons to be learned morals to be recognised and questions to be asked and somehow solved. Each personcharacter you will encounter in this movie is unique which makes it all the more worthwhile to watch. Because you find yourself sympathetic with the viewpoints of all the men and women in the movie yet at the same time questioning what decision you would make if you were in their place. Maybe we never will know or understand what they went through. But by watching this movie and reading the book it will help us become wiser people and possibly open our minds to the endless enigma that is life God and the vastness and emptiness of the world that lies not so beyond our reach.".

If you really want to know everything about the accident read the book.Some thoughts and factsThe movie is faithfull to the book of course the book has much more information.The survivors had plenty of offers for a book deal and they took the one that gave them almost not money at all because they didn't want their tragedy to become a shocking Stephen Kinglike novel with gore etc. The book documents facts it has no teardropping dialogue or 2020like lines.Some points about other comments and criticsYes they were nice boys. They were the rugby team of the Old Christians School I'm not translating the name of the school that's the actual one an English catholic school for boys only at that time at least private and expensive where only highclass boys attended.Also to the previous point Maybe none of the survivors looks exactly like Ethan Hawke but YES... some of them WERE blonde with blue eyes. Most people especially in the US and Europe tend to think that in Uruguay a country with a weird name i give you thatwe all look like nativeamericans. PLAIN WRONG. Almost all of us are Europeanamericans... the 95 of the population is white and the rest is black or else. As a matter of fact this is the ONLY American i mean North Central and Southamerica country that has no nativeamerican population at all. This territory had a very small population when it was conquered by Spain and they were later killed by our government about 150 years ago we are not proud of that but that's the awful truth.Yes it was a charter flight not an airline flight in an Air Force rented plane to carry the players and some relatives and acquaintances to Chile. Remember this was people with money and good social positions therefore connections... and this is a small country.Yes the avalanche DID take place.Yes the Andes are nice I myself flew over them twice breathtaking sights TRULY beautiful but this movie was shot in the Canadian Rockies hehe Bottom line you can't compress 72 days into two hours and give each one of the people involved enough screen time to understand the part they played in that complex society they constructed in order to survive. Some of the most interesting characters are barely mentioned in the movie. If you are really interested in knowing what happened in that ordeal again READ THE BOOK.".

A notable example is the depiction of Roberto Canessawhoin the book Alive is a complex and slightly volatile character. The very duality of Canessa who is both aggressive and bullying and at the same time frightened and vulnerablephysically and emotionally makes him compelling and memorable. I also felt the film trivialized the bravery and heroics of Parrado and Canessa's astonishing trek out of the mountains. The film shows us nothing of the ten day journey which made the rescue occur. Face it the film is a rather flimsy vehicle for Ethan Hawke. The depth of emotion so lyrically described in the book is absent in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Marshall's account of the plight of the survivors of a Uruguayan rugby team stranded in the Andes after a horrific plane crash features a startling and impressive crash sequence in which the fuselage is ripped apart and passengers still buckled to their seats are flung from the gaping hole like flies from the windscreen of a moving car.   It is a superlative sequence that skilfully encapsulates the helplessness and horror of those trapped in such a situation.After such an explosive start the movie quickly settles down to depict the struggles of the survivors of the crash to survive the bleak and freezing conditions.   The first night is a subzero nightmare filled with the groans and cries of the fatally injured as they gradually die.   Ominously perhaps the bodies of the dead are not buried beneath the snow but laid on top of it.That the writer chooses not to focus entirely on the cannibalism in which the handful of survivors partake strengthens the film and prevents it from becoming a sensationalist gorefest.   Instead their decision to eat the dead is just one aspect of a multifaceted tale of the will to survive against seemingly impossible odds.One problem I had with this movie is that the makers fail to cast actors who look dissimilar enough for the viewer to be able to differentiate one from another.   At times it is difficult to follow the narrative thread because of this making it hard to be sure what is going on and what frictions exist within the gradually dwindling group.   The impact on the group of the deaths of individuals as the film progresses is also weakened because the viewer is left unsure of who has actually died.   While the movie does occasionally focus on the psychological effects their dilemma imposes on individuals and the group as a whole it does so only fitfully as if the task is too daunting.The movie is very gripping however and never drags throughout its 2 hourplus running time and the makers can perhaps be forgiven for an ending that seems just a little too sentimental.".

Watching those around you die to avalanche the loss of the human spirit health deterioration gangrene and hunger trying to maintain your resolve and hold onto faith and eventually summoning the guts to brave the great white unknown of the mountains and snowy terrain in the hopes of finding rescue all could make or break the best of us. Alive made some notoriety in its cannibal scenes where those still alive needed to eat from those that died during the crash and afterward but to simply identify that to the film alone doesn't do it justice. This film pulls no punches in showing that surviving isn't easy and the arduous journey to a rescue comes with great sacrifice a strong will to live and making difficult decisions that few would ever wish to be burdened with. The desperate times call for desperate measures phrase certainly applies to the harrowing travail that all the survivors are up against. Ethan Hawke Vincent Spano and Josh Hamilton lead a strong cast of relative unknowns who all lend gravitas to their roles as struggling members of the rugby team praying to God at night and holding on to what little hope still exists after 60  days out in the cold enduring a blizzard no food besides the dead they have to feed from and dwindling morale not to mention the cold's physical effects on their bodies. Hawke's young man stepping up as a leader when few still have the ability to do so is a great part for him considering his age at the time really consider what kind of career this man has had he is a fine actor with a nice resume under his belt while Hamilton's unsure but vocal character seesawing about leaving to find that green valley of Chili somewhere over the mountains is another solid character within the film. What I think this film does well is establishing strong characterizations allowing us to get to know these innocent people fated within an unfortunate situation who had plans for the future enduring and often losing to the tragic nature of the unavoidable harshness of inclement weather and freezing environment that befalls them. A riveting frighteningly realistic and quite incredible true story that is at times really hard to watch and all the while always gripping.".

Despite having the extra money and time not wasted on producing a killer screenplay they'll all have tiny budgets and gaps in the story where the commercials go. And oh yes they will be madeforTV  the kiss of death for any movie project as far as I'm concerned. This was the kind of prejudice that almost made me avoid watching this movie when my Better Half threw in the DVD. So it says something when I found my attention diverted to this harrowing and beautifully shot drama based on a horrifying true story.In 1972 a plane carrying a Uruguayan rugby team was crossing the Andes when their plane crashed in bad weather in the mountains. A number were killed and the survivors quickly began to realise that the unforgiving weather lack of supplies and a calledoff rescue mission would mean certain death. But some weren't ready to give up without a fight meaning that they would have to overcome impossible odds just to survive. Faced into an unimaginable situation what lengths would they go to in order not just to survive but to escape the icy grip of the Andes? Looking and feeling the business Alive is a genuine triumph of filmmaking. Filmed high up in the mountains with little else to see besides snow and rocks it forces home the hopelessness of the unfortunate souls trapped up there. Featuring a largely unknown cast the horror of their predicament is all the more real. Ironically the person who dispels the illusion that this is drama and not documentary is the biggest star on screen  Ethan Hawke though his performance is as faultless as the rest. So with a truly inspiring story of how difficult the human spirit is to defeat an jawdropping vision of brutal isolation and hardship and a cast who give it their everything why doesn't Alive score higher than it does? The simple reason is that despite the story and everything going for it Alive is the sort of film that you can only watch once. It reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption another great film with a rousing finale and a touching tale of spirit but a film that I have little or no resolve to watch again. Watch them once certainly but after the magic has gone what's left? The other thing that works against this film is it's sheer unrelenting sense of disaster. At times you can't help but feel that it is just too much even for a film like this. It's just one thing after another but of course it did happen exactly as you see  the survivors who worked as technical advisers made sure of that. In short this film is a stunning testament to those who survived the most traumatic of experiences and a solemn memorial to those who lost their lives. Alive is a real achievement both in its making and its watching.".

As such most of them high tail it out of town asap leaving only a handful of people to deal with the problem. The 5 people that decide to remain do have some varying degree of special skills however and include a money hungry scheister looking to make a name for himself a shaman that can see spirits with his mystic eye an engineer that designs all types of ghost hunting equipment a pretty fortune teller who can see the past and a young boy who can see the future.The 5 remaining ghost sweepers are joined in their endeavor by a spunky reporter who's down on her luck. Together they all set off to solve the mystery of what's going on in town. From there it's a mish mash of varying back stories unnecessary side plots and so on until the main ghostly story line finds its way to a conclusion. There's also a considerable amount of unnecessary filler that unfolds along the way regarding various familialfriendshiplove relationships among the characters.Each of the primary cast members are given a brief albeit promising intro that provides some insight into the characters they portray. Unfortunately there's too little time spent on them in favor of emphasizing an overly lengthy ghost story to allow the viewer to better invest and care about any of these people over the long haul. Two of what could have been some of the more interesting characters the pretty fortune teller and the young boy are so underutilized that they were almost pointless in the overall scheme of things. There is simply just too much going on here to make all of this effectively work in the context of a theatrical movie format. None of what is going on is complicated or confusing but when you add up the fatherson story reporterdad story love interest stories friendshipkinship stories etc. well it's a lot to digest  process all at once and I haven't even mentioned the primary story about the sunken Japanese treasure shipghost story angle the village idiots who work at the behest of the ghostly presence the unnecessary side plot involving some company that wants the reporter dead etc. This film would have been far better served if it were turned into a KTV series where the characters could be better fleshed out and various story lines and relationships could be more fully developed over time and where new ghostly occurrences could be solved every few weeks etc. But this is a 2 hour movie so it is what it is!This is an average movie at best. I suppose you can kill two hours watching it if you have nothing better to do on a rainy afternoon. Otherwise this is a forgettable and underwhelming flick that can easily be skipped over.Bottom Line A very generous 6 out of 10 stars.".

Almost everything about it is technically bad. I was a bit bummed that the trailer gave the whole movie away and in my opinion was more entertaining than the movie! Even still this is a super fun piece of 80s camp. We have an allgirl rock band a la The Bangles who go out to a condo for a slumber partyband practice weekend. The lead character is a grownup Courtney the youngest girl who survived the original SPM played by Crystal Bernard of TVs Wings. She has terrible nightmares about her institutionalized sister and the Driller Killer. Except the killer isn't the nasty old schizo from the original. He's a sexy leatherclad psychobilly think Lux Interior of the Cramps with a spiky red electric guitar that has a drill coming out of the neck! Courtney's dreams start to seem all too real and just when her friends begin to think she is insane the driller killer crosses over from her dreams into reality and starts offing her friends performing an obligatory song and dance before each kill. The basic plot is a ridiculous cross between A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th but that doesn't matter because the movie is just an excuse to be hilariously twisted the driller killer a flying dead chicken a gigantic exploding zit. This movie clocks in at 75 minutes with most of the drilling occurring in the last 20 minutes or so. But if you like cheesy 80s horror and sleazy rocknroll then Slumber Party Massacre II is for you. I loved it! My rating 710".

The death scenes are very twisted as you can probably imagine because the killer plays the guitar and sings as he kills his victims.

It is one of those movies that is so horrible so cheesy so nonsensical and so bizarre that you will simply be thinking to yourself the entire way through I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS EXISTS. Somehow it's disturbing simply because it is an actual movie! This is an effect that a lot of B movies and horror movies can produce especially from the 80's  but I think SPM2 just might wear the crown as the king of that specifically.I definitely do not agree with the movies IMDb rating of 2.8 out of 10. Not in any way. You should feel privileged to be viewing something that is this BONKERS and was somehow actually greenlighted financed and released as a real movie!!! It is a rare occasion. It is a diamond in the rough. It's one thing when a movie like this is created and it's not entertaining but this movie will light your brain on fire and keep it torched. You won't stop WTF'ing for its entirety.This is a rare movie that screams with it's own innovative personality. This is a movie that doesn't care what makes sense to you or any of it's viewers. It's wigged out to the max and that's the way it wants to be. Even the editing was stylish impressive and effective during the nightmares sequences and some of the more horrific parts. This movie has more style than the majority of horror  just like the Driller Killer himself.This one isn't even about the gore. Although there is enough gore to keep any horror fan satisfied. It's about weird ideas and one of the most ridiculous and pointless in a good way BAD GUYS ever! No one can forget the goony Driller Killer in this. The guitardrill is probably the coolest horror villain weapon in history. It never gets old.Forget linear stories. This is a ride I wouldn't mind taking over and over and OVER again. Let it drill into your mind!!!! If anything it's worth it just to see the most intense zit popping scene I never could have imagined...".

Somehow it's disturbing simply because it is an actual movie! This is an effect that a lot of B movies and horror movies can produce especially from the 80's  but I think SPM2 just might wear the crown as the king of that specifically.I definitely do not agree with the movies IMDb rating of 2.8 out of 10. Not in any way. You should feel privileged to be viewing something that is this BONKERS and was somehow actually greenlighted financed and released as a real movie!!! It is a rare occasion. It is a diamond in the rough. It's one thing when a movie like this is created and it's not entertaining but this movie will light your brain on fire and keep it torched. You won't stop WTF'ing for its entirety.This is a rare movie that screams with it's own innovative personality. This is a movie that doesn't care what makes sense to you or any of it's viewers. It's wigged out to the max and that's the way it wants to be. Even the editing was stylish impressive and effective during the nightmares sequences and some of the more horrific parts. This movie has more style than the majority of horror  just like the Driller Killer himself.This one isn't even about the gore. Although there is enough gore to keep any horror fan satisfied. It's about weird ideas and one of the most ridiculous and pointless in a good way BAD GUYS ever! No one can forget the goony Driller Killer in this. The guitardrill is probably the coolest horror villain weapon in history. It never gets old.Forget linear stories. This is a ride I wouldn't mind taking over and over and OVER again. Let it drill into your mind!!!! If anything it's worth it just to see the most intense zit popping scene I never could have imagined...";

I like the song's that they played in the movie like the convertible song. i like when the two girls in the car sing it together. i wish there was a soundtrack to the movie with the song's in it it would be cool to have.".

It is funny gory bizarre a raw chicken attack the zit scene features good acting has a unique location and stars Crystal Bernard! There is even a musical murder number! The real scene stealers are Joel Hoffman as TJ doing Spicolli meets Chrisitan Slater and Atanas Ilitch as the Driller Killer looking like a cross between Elvis Corey Haim and Andrew Dice Clay.

SPM2 is far worse than it's original and I'm not saying the first one was award winning material but it somehow creates the ambience of USA movie upallnite fun when there's nothing to do around the house. The film rollicks with its utilization of psychobilly incidental music akin to Little Richard meets Tangerine Dream. As mentioned above the Killer has that Elvis slicked look about him and you call that scary? and sings gradeB 50's Rock n' roll tunes. Driller Killer's as he is mentioned in the credits kicks off hit after hit of RB flavored tunes  i.e. the classic 45 Let's Buzz' featuring stupid lyrics as Got a penthouse at the Ritz I bought it with all my hits.' I can't even tell if he's really trying to be Elvis or Pat Boone! Likewise the films jumps around with its scenes of dweebs and chicks covered in homemade gore half naked girls running like chickens with their heads drilled off stereotypical cops who are always disbelieving and other assorted elements that make up a Bmovie. To be frank if there were more sex and gratuitous nudity in this film it would be more enjoyable for the majority  a trait most 19902000 films exhibit.

In this installment scantily clad sorority girls move into the house where the original took place.  There are flash backs but not to the original Sorority House Massacre but to the original Slumber Party Massacre I guess even the film makers got confused but who cares?  This movie is chopped full of hilarious dialogue and nudity.  Lets not forget Orville Ketchum who gives a stunning performance as the neighbor.  Is he the killer or is he out to help the girls?  You'll have to see for yourself and you won't be disappointed.  This is a classic slasher flick with all the ingredients to keep you entertained for 90 minutes.  I mean these girls take 30 minute showers to just clean their breasts there isn't any hot water but they can't sleep if they feel dirty and they search the house for their missing friends in their underwear.  This flick is awesome! Check it out you won't be sorry.".

The music in the style of Phantom Of The Opera and the orange bright letters are indication of something. The movie follows the bright tone of the opening credits until the end.For about 90 minutes we have hot and I mean HOT women in skimpy lingerie running around the house and some bar while escaping from a possessed butcher. That's all you have to know.Sorority House Massacre is an entertaining 80's flick but it isn't for everyone who is into the Slasher genre. There is minimal gore violence or even suspense. True the House is creepy enough but mainly because of the decent cinematography and correct use of lightning and thunders. It's also true that this movie fits better in the cheesy category because there isn't room for logic or common sense.So I would only recommend this movie for a teenager male audience who will be cheering our hot heroines anytime they run or scream.This is sexy material in the Slasher genre. Nothing more or less.Jim Wynorski created a decent cheesefest with lots of hot women. The man truly knows the business.Gail Harris and Melissa Moore are excellent. They are truly beautiful and had some skills to become scream queens. Too bad it didn't happen.".

Oh well when you start looking for whodunit campus slashers to make sense you are getting yourself stuck in a vortex of puzzles more mysterious then the ingredients of Col. Sanders secret blend of herbs and spices. Back to the movie there is a good enough story tongue in cheek style and a decent enough amount of TA to keep any true 80's cheesy horror filmster happy. Watch for adult film's Savannah to show up in her attempt to break into mainstream Hollywood film making. That alone helped me decide to give it a 7 12 for 10! Now go out and take on the day!".

He does manage to work in all of the tropes of this sub genre while winking at them at the same time. That makes it pretty hard to resist. With a formulaic predictable script a tantalizing female cast who do show us their goods and some decent atmosphere he makes Sorority House Massacre II into an engaging bit of nonsense.Working in footage from The Slumber Party Massacre he spins a yarn about five sorority babes who move into an old house that wouldn't you know it was the site of a mass murder perpetrated by vile Clive Hochstatter long ago. The girls play with fire when they find a Ouija board and attempt to call upon Clives' spirit. Later that night the nasty things start happening while suspicion falls on the head of the intimidating and eternally tired looking next door neighbour Orville Ketchum Peter Spellos a character also seen in Wynorskis' Hard to Die.You get what you expect in this thing. There's some graphic gore devised by Dean Jones and William Starr Jones appropriate lighting by J.E. Bash and costar Jurgen Baum who plays the intrepid Lt. Block and a fairly fast pace. The acting is standard for this sort of thing with the lovely Gail Harris doing well as one of the gals. The movie costars Playboy Playmate Melissa Moore Toni Naples one of the villains from Wynorskis' Deathstalker II as Blocks' partner and Bridget Carney as foxy stripper Candy but the show is stolen by the deadpan Spellos who's as indestructible as any horror movie psycho.Those who like their slashers on the sleazy side should have a pretty good time with this one. It has sufficient enough nudity to keep ones' attention.Seven out of 10.".

Sadly it is mostly a mixed bag.Newspaper headlines try to fill in the viewers to the history of the house in this story but Elvis Lives! headline was moronic and turns the entire scene into an unfunny joke. When a Satanic serial killer in plaid rears his bloated flabby face near the house on a rainy night the girls strip to their undies and consult a Ouija board for help.Lightning flashes are lifted from the title scene from Gilligan's Island! At one point it takes the killer about five minutes just to walk across a two lane street while stalking the girls. It's pouring down with rain when he begins walking but by the time he gets across the street and at the house it has stopped raining. The film's pacing is as slow as the killer's walk because it takes forever for anything to happen.Linda played by short little Robyn Gail Harris is my favourite of the lot but there are no decent nude scenes or sex scenes. It seems more like a PGrated lingerie shoot than a slasher flick for the first 30 minutes then some mostly mild violence is brought into the mix as the girls are stalked very slowly by Captain Happy in his plaid overalls throughout this old mansion.This oneact story stretched out to 77 minutes basically climaxes about 60 minutes in and then it falls back on the undying killer clich before resorting to the demonic possession clich in a surprisingly blooddrenched ending.

Proving yet again that you don't need a budget for atmosophere laughs and that enjoyable driveinesque feel director Jim Wynorski tells us the tale of a group of five siliconenhanced coeds who've just purchased a new house for their sorority. They must stay the night to await the power and telephone crews to arrive in the morning coincidentally the water was on before the girls arrived leaving plenty of opportunity for the gratuitous shower sequence. Once they arrive they're informed of the house's morbid past Described as a flashback with unrelated scenes from The Slumber Party Massacre by creepy overweight neighbor  Orville Ketchum. Ketchum is immediately suspected when the girls begin to disappear and the body count rises but is it really him or is there another force at work bent on revenge...It's a rhetorical question but since Ketchum returns in the sequel Hard To Die I guess it's pretty obvious.".

Proving yet again that you don't need a budget for atmosophere laughs and that enjoyable driveinesque feel director Jim Wynorski tells us the tale of a group of five siliconenhanced coeds who've just purchased a new house for their sorority. They must stay the night to await the power and telephone crews to arrive in the morning coincidentally the water was on before the girls arrived leaving plenty of opportunity for the gratuitous shower sequence. Once they arrive they're informed of the house's morbid past Described as a flashback with unrelated scenes from The Slumber Party Massacre by creepy overweight neighbor  Orville Ketchum. Ketchum is immediately suspected when the girls begin to disappear and the body count rises but is it really him or is there another force at work bent on revenge...It's a rhetorical question but since Ketchum returns in the sequel Hard To Die I guess it's pretty obvious.";

The funniest to me was Ketchum's never say die attitude okay I know that sounded dumb but I couldn't resist.It's an okay low budget slasher but there's not much blood for gorehounds. I still don't understand why they used the Slumber Party Massacre footage. What's the story there?".

Perhaps not for everyone but it was an entertaining midday movie if nothing more.This movie is definitely more for kids and families. Some of the elements verge on magical which has got some of the commenters on this site up in arms but I think the point is to suspend your disbelief  it's an adventure flick for children morality plays a huge role and the line between good and evil is clearly defined.Basically it's the story of how 2 children Bonnie and Sam find their way to safety after their plane crashes in the wilderness helped by natureloving wildernessman Khonanesta and hindered by a group of greedy selfish poachers with guns. The kids sort of find themselves the middle of an existing battle over the bears.There are a few moral issues raised which is standard and I think appropriate for the target audience. The conservation of nature vs the greed of the poachers who are clearly defined as bad guys from the getgo. Acceptance and looking beyond first impressions are major themes  the kids have to learn to trust Khonanesta who seems strange to them at first they also have to trust the bear to a degree. There is also an ongoing moral subplot about how they can't let go of the memory of their dead father and have a strong resentment towards their stepfather which Khonanesta tries to help them resolve.Kirsten Dunst is always good and always seems to have a knack for actionadventure which this movie is certainly equal parts of. The Home Improvement kid was pretty stilted didn't seem to really make much of his character which made parts of the script drag. Their relationship could have been more convincing. The Khonanesta character was a bit clichd in the way he spoke but I can't really see any other way they could have got the story across in a way that English speaking children could understand.If you're looking for gritty realism you won't find it here but if that's the case get outta the family section and grab something based on a true story. If you're after a story of hope and courage  family style  then you're on the right track with this one.".

The plane goes down and the adults in the plane appear to be dead so they are left on their own until an old Indian finds them and offers to help them get back to civilization.  He says they will need his help because of the bad men.  It turns out there are poachers in the area and the teens would have been in trouble without him.  The kids offer to find help once rescued to do something about the poachers but the Indian does not want help we later learn one reason why this might be true.  The Indian teaches the kids a lot about getting along in the wilderness and rescues them from several dangerous situations they also get to rescue him once or twice.  We also learn that the teens are brother and sister and that they lost their father.  Their mother has remarried and Bonnie in particular doesn't like their stepfather.  Among other things the Indian teaches the kids that they still have their father inside. Later the Indian goes back to the plane without the kids fearing that the people searching for the kids will encounter the poachers.This was pretty good though it may not be a classic. August Schellenberg gave a fine performance as the Indian though he talked like Tonto and that may offend some people I assume this reflects a lack of contact with white people since the Indian seems very intelligent.  And I've liked Kirsten Dunst ever since she was a little girl in 'Little Women' she didn't disappoint here.  The scenery is magnificent and wildlife shots quite good. The credits say nothing about animatronic bears but assure us animal action was carefully monitored so that no actual harm came to the bears. Some good work then was done with those bears.  And the music was quite distinctive nearly all of it sounded Native American or close to it with some really good vocal performances in what sounded like Indian languages there was even one song with children.  Speaking of children the youngest ones probably shouldn't see this.  Among the reasons  the plane crash itself is quite scary and there are several scenes where the poachers fire shots at people who they believe might be interfering with them when the Indian is around he fired back using arrows but no one appeared seriously injured. The poachers threaten the children with guns when the Indian isn't around and there are the usual scenes with one or both teens in danger. Also one of the bears steps into a painful trap gets taunted by the poachers and is finally shot.  The extent of the injuries to the poachers involved is not quite clear but the other bear attacks several poachers.  This was an edited version I saw but there were still a few curse words nothing too major.  SPOILER  Also one of the poachers is apparently killed by a bullet.".

Speaking of children the youngest ones probably shouldn't see this.  Among the reasons  the plane crash itself is quite scary and there are several scenes where the poachers fire shots at people who they believe might be interfering with them when the Indian is around he fired back using arrows but no one appeared seriously injured. The poachers threaten the children with guns when the Indian isn't around and there are the usual scenes with one or both teens in danger. Also one of the bears steps into a painful trap gets taunted by the poachers and is finally shot.  The extent of the injuries to the poachers involved is not quite clear but the other bear attacks several poachers.  This was an edited version I saw but there were still a few curse words nothing too major.  SPOILER  Also one of the poachers is apparently killed by a bullet.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw True Heart a couple of weekends ago and I must say that it was a good adventure story with great music. However it's quite heavyhanded in its message of nature conservation. Kirsten Dunst and Zachary Ty Bryan were quite good in this one as Bonnie and Sam two siblings who survive a plane crash deep in the woods of BC Canada. They learn how to survive the hazards of the forest with the help of the native woodsman Konanesta in the process the two learn about the spirits of the woods' creatures and they also learn about themselves and their relationships with each other and with their parents. The lead poacher was just plain evil personified complete with a hook for a hand! We also see the big grizzly bear emerge as the great hero of the movie. Now I couldn't get past the grizzly bear being referred to as a Kodiak a Kodiak is a subspecies of grizzly that lives in Alaska. Which brings me to the portrayal of Konanesta he acted like the stereotypical Native American one sees in movies in many ways like being one with Grandfather Nature however Konanesta looked less like a typical Indian brave and more like Sean Connery with a long ponytail. I more than half expected him to talk to Sam and Bonnie in that classic voice saying something like You are at one with all living things. Each man's thoughts and dreams are yours to know. You have power beyond imagination. Use it well my friend. But I digress True Heart was still a good family adventure.".

Kirsten Dunst and Zachary Ty Bryan were quite good in this one as Bonnie and Sam two siblings who survive a plane crash deep in the woods of BC Canada. They learn how to survive the hazards of the forest with the help of the native woodsman Konanesta in the process the two learn about the spirits of the woods' creatures and they also learn about themselves and their relationships with each other and with their parents. The lead poacher was just plain evil personified complete with a hook for a hand! We also see the big grizzly bear emerge as the great hero of the movie. Now I couldn't get past the grizzly bear being referred to as a Kodiak a Kodiak is a subspecies of grizzly that lives in Alaska. Which brings me to the portrayal of Konanesta he acted like the stereotypical Native American one sees in movies in many ways like being one with Grandfather Nature however Konanesta looked less like a typical Indian brave and more like Sean Connery with a long ponytail. I more than half expected him to talk to Sam and Bonnie in that classic voice saying something like You are at one with all living things. Each man's thoughts and dreams are yours to know. You have power beyond imagination. Use it well my friend. But I digress True Heart was still a good family adventure.";

No wonder none of these blokes is capable of catching or even tracing Nikos and the body count increases immensely. Whenever George isn't barbarically killing someone using band saws surgical devices or axes Absurd is rather dull slowmoving and borrowing story ideas as well as direct quotes from John Carpenter's landmark slasher Halloween. There's babysitters in peril young kids spotting the bogeyman everywhere around the house and dangerous killers escaping from hospital beds. Still if you're looking for really good horror cinema just wait for the climax which is quite suspenseful and it makes the popular title Absurd all the more meaningful.".

	schema:reviewBody "This cult film is both the followup to Joe D'Amato's notorious shocker 'Antropophagus' and one of the nastier films on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list. Those two facts alone will give many fans of cult horror reason enough to see it and I'm pleased to say that the rest of the film isn't bad either and while it's not quite as great as D'Amato's earlier film Absurd plays out well as an overly gory slasher flick. Of course you can't expect things like great acting and a plausible story line going into a film like this and rather unsurprisingly this film has neither. However what it does have is a great gritty atmosphere which is bathed in a scintillating soundtrack that succeeds in making the thrill scenes more exciting. The plot is silly in the extreme but is somehow easy to buy as we follow a priest who travels to a small town on the trail of a supposed monster who is currently lying on a hospital bed. The doctors are baffled to learn that his blood clots far faster than normal and this somehow makes him immortal. It's not long before the monster awakes and naturally goes on a killing spree.George Eastman takes the lead role again and just as it did in Antropophagus his imposing presence provides the film's main standout despite him basically marauding around rather than actually acting. Obviously the most important thing about this film for many will be the gore and overall I'd say it just about tops Antropophagus. It was only two scenes that made the earlier film such a notorious shocker and while there aren't a great number of highly nasty scenes here they're more common and the film is more violent on the whole. Sequences involving a drill a table saw and a severed head are among the best scenes in the movie. Director Joe D'Amato receives a lot of criticism and while some of it is deserved it has to be said that he has elevated this film over and above what you would expect of a grisly slasher. The atmosphere is superb while the locations are well used and selected  and best of all the director clearly knows how to build suspense as the last twenty minutes of this film are truly gripping...and that's not bad at all considering that the characters are impossible to care for. Overall anyone seeing this film will know not to expect great things  but its well worth seeing for the Video Nasty fan and overall I'd say it's almost on par with the first film.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Absurd' is Joe D'Amato's followup to the notorious 'Antropophagus' and it often referred to as its sequel. However apart from the same director and having the looming George Eastman once again wandering around killing people there is very little similarity save the fact they are both poor filmswith 'Absurd' definitely trumping its predecessor in the low quality stakes. Gone is the setting on a remote and eerily empty Greek island which characterised 'Antropohagus ' instead supplanting the socalled action to a small American town. In doing this 'Absurd' is clearly going for a 'Halloween' nightmareinsuburbia vibebut in lacking any of the character development script or technical craft of Carpenter's flick 'Absurd' flails about limply with a lame premise zero suspense and only manages to glimpse redemption albeit unattained with the makeup effects on the killswhich is no doubt why is got on the DPP's list of Video Nasties.The plot as some would have it is that Eastman has undergone a scientific procedure which has enabled his body to regenerate itself quickly a la Wolverine and consequently can only be killed with a shot to the head. Oh and he's insane. As such a killing spree ensues and the Priestcumscientist who created him hooks up with the town Sheriff to hunt him down. The showdown takes place in a house with a girl for some reason recovering from a spinal operation her nurse and a really annoying kid. I've always found a house to be a great setting for a suspenseful horror movie e.g. 'Last House on the Left' 1972 'Black Christmas' 1974 'Halloween' 1978 but the pacing of 'Absurd' is so slow and the acting so bad on all counts that none of the suspense and tension which is so abundantly present in these other movies even threatens to show its headlet alone eviscerate you.Okay putting on my positive cap some of the kills are pretty cool e.g. the buzzsawinthehead scene as well as the oven scene and the soundtrack has its momentsbut even in a 90 minute film with competent acting and a decent story this wouldn't cut it let alone a movie as deplorable as this. The film is quite hard to come by as it hasn't been reissued in the UK which maybe adds a mystique to it but as far as video nasties go it's clear that boredom more than moral outrage is the reason why.".

Also the Anthropophagus beast is a cannibal but in absurd the killer just seems to murder his victims. Also he was left dead on a Greek island and he turns up in Absurd suddenly in normal clothes and in the U.S. There is no recalls whatsoever from the first movie the priest who is chasing him just says he is a killing machine. The killer in Absurd looks a bit like the beast from Anthropophagus due to the moustache but that is it! Another similarity is it is made by the same directer from Antropophagus the beast. Anaway the story.....The killer it MITE be the Anthropophagus beast is injured on a fence at a family home while trying to brake in. He is taken to the hospital where the doctor operating on him is shocked at his ability to recreate dead cells and dead tissue. A police officer forgot his name finds a Greek man who is walking out in the middle of the night in the middle of the road. Later on the policeman is at the hospital and finds the Greek man there. The officer puts the two together and starts asking questions as the killer also comes from Greece another similarity from Anthropophagus about who he is and what he is trying to do. It turns out he is a priest and is here to stop the killer. Meanwhile the killer awakens kills a nurse by drilling a whole slowly through her brain and then pops off for a killing spree. In the meantime people are cooked heads chopped off hacksaws through skulls and people are strangled and beaten. This movie would easily make an uncut 18 certificate appealing to UK readers who films like this are always cut or banned and is on the list of infamous Video Naties.

Because between the handful moments of gore you'll have plenty of time to doze off  catch a nap since there's hardly anything going on.The mighty George Eastman wrote the script and I'm sure it must have read a little something like this when he handed it over to his buddy D'Amato I say nothing in this film I'm indestructible and I kill everybody. Now you just figure out how to turn this into a movie Joe.And so did Joe being the talented man that he is. Also some distributors tried to market this as a sequel to D'Amato's Antropophagus aka The Grim Reaper. But it's not. Just because Eastman looses his intestines again in this film doesn't make it a sequel.D'Amato pretty much turned it into a plain slasher flick. In a way Absurd is like John Carpenter's Halloween only with Eastman's evil bearded face to scare you instead of a masked Michael Myers and without the likable Jamie Lee Curtis to root for. Eastman escapes a hospital kills his way through a whole town eventually ending up in some house to do some more killing. All this while a priest  a cop are on his trail blabbering on about Eastman's character being some ultimate creature of evil. So it's more or less the same movie. Plus it's a lot worse too of course. Still as far as slashers go there are also a lot worse out there.Now I was under the impression that this was supposedly one of the goriest  most demented horror efforts ever to come out of Italy. Sadly it's not all that exciting. There's a handful of gory scenes yes drill through the head saw through the head etc. and they are amusing to watch but nothing we haven't seen before. All the rest of the film is just plain dullness I'm afraid. The climax features a blinded Eastman his eyes stabbed out versus a physically disabled teenage girl. You can imagine how exciting them two stumbling about in a darkened mansion turns out to be. The ending tries to be shocking but it's basically just a happy end.I remember once being impressed with Beyond The Darkness aka Buio Omega. Maybe I should rewatch it to see if it still holds up well because D'Amato is rapidly loosing some filmmaker credit with the stuff I've recently seen by him.".

	schema:reviewBody "As is the case with many lowbudget horror films released numerous times with different cuts and ratings in various different continents Joe D'Amato's Absurd is known under a wealth of alternative titles. Also known as Horrible Rosso Sangue and Monster Hunter the film was labelled as too gruesome for British audiences in the 1980's and found itself on the dreaded Video Nasty List. The most bizarre title to make its way onto its VHS cover is Anthropophagus 2 although the film has little in common with DAmato's Anthropopogus The Grim Reaper apart from the lead casting of George Eastman as yet another impossibly strong manmountain with a fondness for gruesome murder.The film begins with Mikos Eastman a beast of a man with an unnaturally fast healing factor fleeing a priest. As he tries to escape by scaling a fence Mikos is impaled on the railing spikes which disembowel him. It is while at the hospital that the doctors discover his amazing ability to heal but he is soon on the loose after murdering a nurse. The madman is eventually hit by a car driven by Mr. Bennett Ian Danby who flees the scene and returns to his wife son and bedridden daughter Katia Katya Berger. The family soon finds themselves under attack from Mikos while police officer Sgt. Engleman Charles Borromel and the priest Edmund Purdom attempt to hunt down the rampaging savage.Apart from a couple of entertainingly gory murders a buzzsaw to the temple and a head in the oven are particular 'highlights' Absurd suffers from some serious pacing issues. As the story bobbles around between the various characters having inane conversations the film becomes incredibly boring and short of action. It's debatable as to whether Anthropophagus 1980 or Absurd takes the prize for the most tedious 90 minutes but I feel that Absurd just edges it. Although Eastman does little more than stumble around with a crazy look in his eyes he certainly has a presence but here he is given a disappointingly short amount of screen time. By the time the climax finally arrives it plods on and on as Katia is forced to learn to walk again to escape the bogeyman which does not make for exciting viewing. Absurd indeed.".

This is not really true as while both films star George Eastman as the vicious villain and both films are extremely gory the story lines have nothing at all to do with each other. I loved Antropophagus which is not only tremendously gory shocking and disturbing but also scary as hell. I also enjoyed Rosso Sangue but it is not nearly a great as its aforementioned predecessor. The film is once again extremely gory and exploitationicon George Eastman is once again predestined for the role but the film is not nearly as scary as Antropophagus and neither is it anywhere near as shocking. A small town is infested by a genetically mutated man Eastman who has the urge to brutally murder everybody he sees as a result of a nuclear experiment gone wrong. Not only does he have the urge to murder however his mutations also made him very strong and immune to injuries... The film's main qualities are the great score the extreme gore and George Eastman. The huge Eastman really is one intimidating fellow who always fits in his mostly sardonic roles. His greatest moments were Mario Bava's 1974 masterpiece Cani Arrabiati Rabid Dogs and Antropophagus but Eastman truly is an enrichment to any of the films he starred in and Absurd is no exception. While he is not quite as scarylooking as in Antropophagus here Eastman singlehandedly carries the film with his maniacal performance. The other performances are quite forgettable but this is not really of any importance. Overall this is not nearly as great as Antropophagus but it is definitely a film that any fan of the very brutal kind of HorrorExploitataion should enjoy. Recommended to my fellow Italian Horror buffs.".

But the second half was relentless suspenseful brutal and agonizing. I've seen hundreds of horrorgoresplatterslasher films but the infamous 'oven scene' which I won't spoil had me literally covering my mouth to keep from making too much noise.The rampage of the second act works well because the horror comes from the THOUGHT of what is happening rather than the more visceral deaths of the first half. There is blood and gore to be sure but Joe D'Amato shows a modicum of restraint letting the suspense build in a way it was unable to in the first act.So if you decide to give this film a try and I hope you will stick with it.

In Absurd soporific longeurs are broken up by overblown murder setpieces. The killings are undoubtedly nasty bandsaw through the head axe in the head head in the oven etc. but the director offers so little explanation as to whyhow these killings occur that the film doesn't feel horrifying just ridiculous. George Eastman is competently creepy as the monster but we know almost nothing about his character and he goes out of his way to kill each victim in the gruesomest way he can no matter how impractical that course of action might be.

I've seen many of these nasty features just to see what all the fuss was about to be frank they weren't as brutal as you'd expect. Naturally this was 25 years ago so the cinematic standard of what was conceived as vile has changed dramatically in recent times. Nevertheless The UK's Video Recordings Act of 1984 was a notable era in horror some titles on the list are still banned today while others have been lifted years ago. After I finish my review I'll mention some of the films I've seen from the Video Nasty collection.Horrible is an effort made by Joe D'Amato. A shameful effort indeed among a long list of shameful attempts in general. Yes unfortunately he brought you Antropophagus another bottomdwelling disgrace. D'Amato is just slightly a step above the status of a porn director. This is why myself and many others refer to Italian horror cinema during the 70's and 80's as schlocky virtually every facet and production value is so pitifully executed that is requires your utmost devotion to be fully appreciated. Luckily Horrible is not a pornhybrid so I'll be able to spare you the misery of hearing about it.The plot tells the story of a large superhuman male who escapes from a medical facility after an experiment goes horribly wrong. A priestscientist works with the police and with their combined efforts they attempt to apprehend the murderous fiend. Yep...that's about it. The same large villain who's featured in Anthropophagus is also the main attraction here. As usual the dubbing is inconsistent and at times sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage. Even the film stock will change quality without a moment's notice...all typical factors to reaffirm my feelings of detestment. D'Amato is without a doubt the WORST Italian horror director I've seen. Of all the times I've discussed how inconsistent Fulci or Argento can be or even how terrible I think Bava is at times they simply don't match up to the worthlessness of D'Amato's nonexistent directorial skillset. What's left to say? It's particularly painful to sit through 90 minutes of this. Some of you may wonder Hey why even sit through it at all? You don't have to! Yes...but it's all part of my mission and if there wasn't at least one person on the planet that could report back the results of movies like this who else would? Now if you'll excuse me I have to go and fetch my mail...if I'm not back in 5 minutes assume D'Amato supporters snatched me up and threw me into a white van.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whilst looking round the secondhand video shops in Soho London I stumbled upon this gleaming copy of Absurd as it was released in the UK uncut for only 4.00 8.00. Seeing how the movie had been banned in Great Britain for the past twenty years or so I knew that the guy behind the counter wasn't sure what he was loosing out on and I purchased it straight away. Finding a copy of Joe D'amato's follow up to The Grim Reaper completely unedited and at an extreme budget price was indeed great luck on my behalf. This movie is not a direct sequel to his previous effort although the effectively monstrous George Eastman returns as a demented bogeyman once again. The secluded Island has been abandoned as a location and instead the demented psychopath roams a small supposedly American town and hospital obviously inspired by Michael Myers' exploits in John Carpenter's Halloween. Eagle eyed viewers will spot Britishborn actor and defined slasher star Edmund Purdom whom was certainly slumming it after already starring' in Pieces and following this up with Don't open til Christmas! His choices for roles over those years were indeed questionable perhaps like myself he found something he couldn't get enough off in the slasher genre!In the beginning a priest Purdom is seen chasing Eastman I didn't catch what they called the psycho so I'll identify him by his real name through a forest. The pursuit continues until the visually deranged giant reaches a huge gate. As he begins to climb over the clergyman grabs him and pulls him on to the sharp spikes effectively disembowelling him! Eastman crawls up to the house that was behind the fence and staggers in to the kitchen where he falls to the floor clutching his entrails. A quaint family owns the mansion that he stumbles in too and as you can well imagine they're pretty shocked when they see the bearded beast collapse in their doorway with his guts in his hands! Literally! Eastman is taken to a nearby hospital where surgeons are bewildered by his impressive recovery and before long he's up on his feet drilling through the head of an unsuspecting nurse as he goes! For some bizarre reason he seems to have taken a liking to the house that he chanced upon earlier so he heads back there taking the time to kill off any bystanders that he runs into on the way. A disabled teenage girl a young extremely obnoxious boy and a babysitter now inhabit the home and before long our unstoppable maniac is skulking in the shadows with an axe and generally making a nuisance of himself. Meanwhile perhaps the family's only salvation is the priest from earlier who has joined forces with the local constabulary in a bid to stop the maniacal Eastman! We soon learn that the only way that he can be killed is by completely destroying his brain which sounds like the perfect cue for a goretastic showdown!    Grim Reaper made good use of its effectively foreboding locations to create an overall feeling of uneasiness that sat heavily on your shoulders throughout the movie. Absurd rarely if ever touches on any kind of fear or apprehensiveness and instead the movie's real impact is displayed visually in the decidedly gruesome murders. Perhaps the most disturbing is when a particularly unfortunate guy is caught off guard whilst sweeping a warehouse and gets his head chopped in half by a band saw which of course is all filmed in a graphic closeup! D' amato tries to add as much suspense as he can to the stalking scenes more often than not his results are inconclusive but on occasion he manages the odd effective shock. The most memorable is when Eastman springs on the unsuspecting Emily as she attempts to cross the spacious kitchen to reach the child that she's protecting. He then continues the savage brutality by attempting to cook her head in an oven whilst she's alive and screaming for mercy! I'm not joking! Her fate proves to be especially unforgiving.           Absurd's roots of inspiration are grounded in the consistently American genre pieces. Surprisingly the director avoids the typical Giallo approach that is far more commonplace with his native counterparts relinquishing the black hat and gloves of a mysterious killer in favour of a hulking bogeyman that stays on screen from the outset. Perhaps the only influences taken from his own countrymen is the excessive use of gore that would become the trademark of helmers such as Lucio Fulci whom perhaps D' Amato's work can be most closely compared with. He lacks the immense style of Argento or Bava instead opting for the shock tactics of excessive blood to make his point respectively. Seeing far too much of Eastman's growling insanity sadly breaks the less is more' guideline that proved most effective in consistently  acclaimed' slasher outings. Extreme violence is sadly a poor substitute for claustrophobic fear and this is visually sickening instead of scary which doesn't prove to work as sufficiently.A movie where Edmund Purdom gives the best performance no seriously has got evident problems and this cast are markedly appalling. Perhaps the poor translation of an Italian script is to blame for the awful dialogue but there's no excuse for the flat as pancake actors to add the most minimal effort imaginable. The youngster who played the preteenage Willie was extremely annoying and this proved to be the only time when I actually would have condoned the brutal murder of a child in a movie just for the pleasure of shutting him up! Quite why D'Amato decided on a semiparalysed girl as the unlikely heroine is beyond me he certainly showed a unique flair for the bizarre in places! For a movie that bases itself so relentlessly on its use of gore there's not really overly enough to make this especially memorable. Oh sure there are a couple of exquisitely nasty scenes but they hardly warrant the somewhat excessive purchase price that is paid by collectors seeking a precertificated video release.To be honest if you really want to enjoy this you must have a strong stomach for grotesque Italian horror which is something that I really haven't got. I found little to be impressed about apart from the odd bloody slaughter and generally wouldn't have perceived this to be worthy of its cult classic' status. Whilst I was watching Absurd to write this review I missed Rob Reiner's The American President that was playing on television which I thought was quite unforgivable. If this gets released as Grim Reaper has on budget DVD then by all means pick up a copy. But don't pay the extreme price that it is often labelled with on VHS. It doesn't quite manage the stomach churning precisely the right description shocks of its predecessor and frankly it's not vulgar enough to remain banned for much longer".

This really has nothing to do with Anthropophagus well D'Amoto and Eastman were involved there too and that movie ends with Eastman's guts all over the place and this one starts that way as it's more of a Halloween ripoff. And I don't mean that as an insult.Mikos Stenopolis George Eastman starts the film as he's being chased by the Vatican priest Edmund Purdom of all people who created him. So let's get this crazy setup out of the way a Greek monster who can't be killed because his blood coagulates very quickly was created by the Roman Catholic church somewhere and when that maniac escaped he ended up in some small American town that only cares about the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Los Angeles Rams so I'm just going to assume that they're in New Castle or Zelienople.The chase leads to a fence where Mikos is impaled. He makes his way to the front door of the Bennett house holding his bloody guts as he passes out. He's revived in a local hospital  shades of Haddonfield Memorial  and escapes after murdering a nurse with a drill. This being an Italian film that entire murder appears in great detail.The priest  let's call him Father Loomis cousin of the other Father Loomis in Prince of Darkness  informs that there's only one way to kill Mikos destroy his cerebral mass.Synchronicity rears its head when Mr. Bennett in a hurry to get home and watch Terry Bradshaw thread the needle to Lynn Swann hits Mikos with his car. He just keeps going. When he gets home he's brusque with his wife and kids. Seems that his daughter Katia has a spinal condition and must stay in traction. All she wants to do is use a compass to continually draw the same drawing over and over again while her brother Willy is obsessed that the Boogeyman is coming to kill him. Guess what Willy? You're right.Mikos spends the rest of the movie randomly killing anyone who gets in his way like a young Michele Soavi playing a biker and a butcher who gets the top of his head sawed off. He finally makes his way to the house. Peggy is on her way to watch the kids when she gets a pickaxe to the head. And the other woman who was watching them? Well she gets her head forced into a lit oven that bakes the flesh off of her face in an extended sequence before being stabbed in the neck with a pair of scissors.Willy goes all Tommy Doyle and runs to get help while Katia finally frees herself from her bed. She stabs him in the eyes with her compass and leads the killer on a chase throughout the house using loud music to distract him. The priest arrives and struggles with Mikos just in time for Katia to chop off the killer's head with a ceremonial axe.The police arrive late but Katia assures her little brother that everything will be fine as the camera reveals that she is holding Mikos' bloody head.Absurd inspired the German black metal band who took their name who eventually went from watching gore films to killing people for real as their music went further and further into far right extremism.Your enjoyment of this film will be colored by how much you like gore how much you understand that Italian movies are often very hard to understand and how much you're willing to forgive a film. Personally I loved it. The oven kill scene is really uncomfortable to watch and the gore is incredibly effective.Severin Films has just rereleased this film with all of their trademark quality and insanity. It's the first uncut release of the film in the U.S. and features an interview with Eastman and Soavi as well as a bonus soundtrack CD. They've also rereleased Anthropophagus and also offer an amazing bundle that comes with pins of Niko and Joe D'Amoto as well as a George Eastman stuffed doll. I love that Severin gives films as disreputable as these all the care and concern that Criterion would to a movie from a director much more esteemed and talented but so much more boring.".

I love that Severin gives films as disreputable as these all the care and concern that Criterion would to a movie from a director much more esteemed and talented but so much more boring.";

	schema:headline " AN APT TITLE";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay so yes that may be an apt title for this movie but none of that matters to fans of the film director Joe D'Amato or the film ANTHROPOPHAGOUS. Why mention that last film? Because this film is directly related to that one a quasisequel to the gore fest that fans have loved for years. I wrote in my review of that film that fans have been clamoring for a great quality version of the film and that Severin has just released it in the best version ever seen. What I didn't mention is that they are releasing the sequel at the same time and in just as fantastic quality.The movie doesn't exactly tie in to the first film but with the same director same writer same actor playing the monster and a taste for gore on hand it is done in the same vein. The movie opens with a man on the run Luigi Montefiori aka George Eastman who also wrote the screenplay from another man in a long black coat who finds himself impaled on a spiked fence outside a house where a young girl confined to her bed is recovering. Taken to the nearby hospital he is worked on by the doctor there and his team who marvel at the speed that his body is mending itself.Police investigate the incident and on their way back from the house the incident took place they pick up the black coated man who claims his car broke down while visiting here from Greece. The police begin to question his story when they find Greek coins in the victim's pockets and find him checking in on the victim. They soon discover that he is actually a priest and he informs them that he worked in a secret Vatican sponsored lab where they were looking into the victim a man named Mikos Stenopolis. It seems his body can regenerate cells so he will live indefinitely but the end result is that his brain cells don't do the same and he's gone mad.This becomes obvious when Mikos wakes and kills the nurse watching over him using a drill to her head all captured on screen. He escapes from the hospital and sets out on a murderous rampage with his only goal being to kill anyone he meets. As he cuts a bloody swath across the countryside the police aided by the priest search for the killer. Of course he ends up back where he started the home where the young girl is bedridden and only her nurse and small brother are home.While interesting to watch I didn't find this one near as enjoyable as ANTHROPOPHAGOUS. If felt like there was less story than in the first film and much of the time spent on camera was of different people searching or moving from one spot to another rather than moving the story along. In spite of that it was still interesting to watch and to try and connect with the other title.As with their release of ANTHROPOPHAGOUS Severin has done an amazing job of offering this in the best quality release possible with another 2k scan of the original negative making this the cleanest version you will find. They've also loaded it with plenty of extras as well including either the American release of the film or ROSSO SANGRE the original Italian version of the film THE RETURN OF THE GRIM REAPER another interview with Luigi Montefiori aka George Eastman D'AMATO ON VIDEO an archive interview with director Joe D'Amato A BIKER an interview with filmmakerextra Michele Soavi and the trailer for the film.If you loved the first film the odds are pretty good that you'll enjoy this one as well. Fans of D'Amato will definitely want to add this to their collection and those who enjoyed ANTHROPOPHAGOUS will need to pick this one up to make sure their collection is complete. For horror fans I'd suggest making sure you get the chance to see this one and enjoy it. The concept may by as the title suggest a tad bit absurd but it will still provide enough chills and gore to make fans happy.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's too bad this typical madslasher movie got released at one point as ZOMBIE 6 MONSTER HUNTER.  It's a misleading title and while viewing it I felt let down and disapointed.  I've been amused by great movies good movies soso movies and allout bad movies but this devastatingly uninterested film didn't entertain me in the slightest.     Gore can be entertaining but I really think the script need to be interesting enough to make it worth while.  The script in this movie is so simple that it's practically nonexistent.  The story seems vaguely explained when some priest explains briefly that some guy was experimented on and made to be invincible.  The catch being that his cell regeneration makes him crazy enough to kill anybody and everybody.  So from here on it's just some guy going around hacking people up.  Worse yet the only real subplot seems to be about a bunch of people at a cocktail party watching a Football game!  So we go back  forth from people watching a sporting event to some idiot prowling around at night.     A couple gory scenes a girl holds a decapitated head and anelectric saw goes into a janitor's scalp were somewhat interesting I guess but by that time I was already hitting the scan button to get the movie over with. The pacing is slow and the premise stinks.  I'm not a fan of madslasher movies but now I finally have some respect for the HALLOWEEN series and the FRIDAY THE 13TH series because although they aren't my bag at least they had enough tension and atmosphere to make the carnage have SOME impact.     Whether you choose to know this hasty Italian farce as ZOMBIE 6 no zombies ABSURD or ESOPHAGUS 2 or whatever it's clearly a thrill for madslasher enthusiasts exclusively.  I'll choose to refer to it under the title Absurd because that's exactly what this stinker is.".

What an utter disapointment I spent most of my time laughing at the cheesy effects  all fair and well due to the age of the film though.  Unfortunatly not a lot turns my stomach and im far from easily scared so this film really didn't live up to all the hype I had heard about it.  There is some quite graphic gore like a nurse getting a drill through her head quite close up and even better a man with a bandsaw going through his skull.  Towards the end there is a scene where the killer puts a womans head in the oven and turns it on but it is dragged out for about 20 mins and just spoils the whole film entirely.  The only other scenes of gore are a young girl getting a pick axe through her head but not in any detail and the killer getting a compass poked in his eyes.  The final scene is of a young girl hacking off the killers head with an axe and presenting it to her family when they finally return home stating theres no need to be scared anymore and then the film ends abruptly.  Maybe I am too young to appreciate this film entirely but its definatly not one I would rush out to buyrent etc as to me it was a big disapointment. o".

	schema:headline " Gory Italian nasty by king D'Amato";
	schema:reviewBody "Rosso sangue 1981 or 1982 is also known as Anthropophagous 2 or Absurd as this is supposed to be a sequel to Italian director Joe D'Amato's legendary cannibalistic horror tale Anthropophagous the Beast 1980 that starred Luigi Montefiori as the title character that becomes a cannibalistic monster at an abandoned Greek island. Montefiori also wrote both of these films and according to him they wanted to make the films as shocking as possible as he has admitted in an interview that can be found in the Spaghetti Nightmares book. That definitely shows in this sequel Absurd.This time George Eastman Luigi Montefiori's US alias plays Mikos Stenopolis a man who has gone through some kind of an experiment that has made him immortal which means he can be killed only by damaging the head. He is a beast as his creator a priest tells so he just must be killed and trying to speak to him or beg for mercy won't help as the unlucky victims soon learn. It is said that the experiment took place in a Greek island so that is possibly the only connection with the first film otherwise this is pretty much an individual piece as if the target audience would care less. The beast arrives in small American town and naturally starts to kill people and we follow this at times very slow ride for about 90 minutes until the once again predictable climax comes.The film is a very traditional eighties slasher gore film with some atmosphere and genuinely creepy scenes mostly because of the fact the Montefiori is a really scary looking and big guy! One standout shock scene comes at the beginning where he suddenly opens his eyes on the operation table. The look in his eyes accompanied with the effects in the soundtrack is very evil and makes the film much more real horror than those overthetop splatter effects. Another similar scene comes near the end involving a poor girl the beast and his face of course and a sharp pickaxe. The film is very dark too and again the cinematography is by the veteran cameraman and the film's director that is D'Amato himself. Overall the film is very close to John Carpenter's 1976 classic Halloween in its setting darkness and the character that is not human only pure evil and to be destroyed.The gore scenes are very strong and more graphic than in the first film. They include a small drill forced through the skull of a female in close ups an extremely brutal bandsaw killing that is ten times nastier than the similar drill scene in Lucio Fulci's atmospheric and gothic Paura nella citta dei morti viventi aka City of the Living Dead 1980. The oven burning killing is sadistically prolonged and also close to the similar scene in D'Amato's sick Beyond the Darkness 1979. The scenes of often very misogynistic violence tried to be as graphic as possible in these films and as noted above Montefiori admitted they intended to write these as strong as possible as that was the taste of the driveinhorror audience at the time. Scenes like these would never be shown in a mainstream picture which is not necessarily a bad thing at all.The actors are mostly below average and some of them look like they're in a severe problems with for example alcohol. The dialogue is outrageous at times as the characters speak to each other harshly and are pretty sleazy and unappealing overall but don't have sex all the time which is pretty unusual as this is a D'Amato film. Especially the little kid must be the most irritating and stupidest one I've ever seen. The only great character here is the monster himself all other are more or less unconvincing and boring to look at.The film is too slow and just plain boring at times. Nothing would have been destroyed if they had shortened it by some 15 or 20 minutes. The ending however has some clever ideas as the beast has been blinded and searches for the remaining girl in the apartment by following her voices and sounds. Still the painfully long scenes depicting the girl trying to release herself from her bed are just too much and should have been shortened dramatically in order to make the film and the ending work better.Absurd is an okay attempt in the colorful filmography of D'Amato. It is extremely dark extremely gory and also extremely slow at times first two of these things being more noteworthy merits than the remaining one. The lovers of Italian horror cinema will find out it still could be much worse than this. 410".

It is extremely dark extremely gory and also extremely slow at times first two of these things being more noteworthy merits than the remaining one. The lovers of Italian horror cinema will find out it still could be much worse than this. 410";

Something like Carpenter's score for Halloween it was more akin to the intro music to the Incredible Hulk TV show with a repeating piano tidbit. The direction was adequate. I enjoy a lot of Joe D'Amato's work. Compared to it's sortof predecessor Anthropophagus this film is actually tame. There are no scenes of fetus ripping or selfmastication. On that front Anthropophagus really excels but as story lines and pacing go I feel Absurd was better. Oh there are a few gratuitous scenes of a televised football gameand I was rather surprised they used the actual game's announcers instead of dubbing something else that kill some time between scenes.Really I only have a few beefs with this movie overall. First I didn't much care for the oven scene. It took forever! And it was a very sloppy way for a maniac to dispose of someone. And when she was stabbed with the shears you don't get to see anything good. I was expecting a little more from Eastman's fight with the priest.The best moments besides the kills are during the chase sequence at the finale.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll start by attempting to summarize the difference between American comedy and East European comedy in broad terms. Trust me this is going somewhere...American comedy focuses on characters. Gags rely on the personalities of the people involved facial expressions closeups voice tones and what we the audience are led to feel about these characters. For example when Christopher Walken says It needs more cowbell that's all she wrote. A million intricate nuances of Walken's personality and delivery are what make that joke fly.East European comedies I'm thinking mainly of films by Kusturica Paradjanov and early Forman which remind me of Absurdistan seem to rely on situations and surroundings rather than close characterizations. Shots are filmed from a distance so that we take in more of the scenery and atmosphere and we rarely get lingering closeups the way we do in American comedies. For example in Forman's hilarious The Fireman's Ball one of the funniest scenes is the chaotic madness at the beauty competition where the camera stays far from the action and we don't really see any faces. We just take in the absurdness of the whole scene.OK FINALLY... THE REVIEW OF ABSURDISTAN Absurdistan falls squarely in the East European comedy category. The characters are deliberately 2dimensional as if the director is telling us that the story is what's important not the actors. Like a Paradjanov film it's a fairytale that doesn't want to be upstaged by human interference. Thus no time is wasted on personal backstories dramatic emotions or charisma. None of the characters even have names except the main two. There aren't many pauses for reflection and there's only one real monologue scene showing us the girl Aya's inner self.Normally I would have no problem with this presentation. Like I said Forman's The Fireman's Ball is one of the funniest films I've seen even though I couldn't name a single character or describe their personalities. But in Absurdistan it presents a noticeable void in that this is a love story. For a love story to have maximum effect the director must invest some time creating an emotional connection between the lead characters and the audience. Here instead most of the characters are caricatures of vices making them thoroughly unlikeable. Even the two lead characters commit certain acts that may make you dislike them.So if you decide to see this movie don't expect a very personal story. This Ain't no Hugh Grant flick. Instead take Absurdistan at a distance as the movie is probably intended to be watched. This movie is a metaphor a fable a fairytale and we aren't supposed to get caught up waiting for some personal emotional payoff.If you've seen Viet Helmer's prior film Tuvalu it has much of the same approach. Except Tuvalu is not a love story so the disconnection between characters  audience works. Here in Absurdistan it presents a conflict which may or may not fly depending on how you like your love stories.A final note which may or may not mean anything to you is that there are a few disturbing scenes with animals. A mule getting pulled  prodded a chained dog getting soaked a horse being tied up in a nasty looking horseshoeing device and a dead chicken that looked pretty real. Since this film was made in Azerbaijan outside the American Humane  RSPCA's jurisdiction there certainly wasn't any No animals were harmed disclaimer at the end. If anyone knows how those scenes were monitored please post something about it.".

Here in Absurdistan it presents a conflict which may or may not fly depending on how you like your love stories.A final note which may or may not mean anything to you is that there are a few disturbing scenes with animals. A mule getting pulled  prodded a chained dog getting soaked a horse being tied up in a nasty looking horseshoeing device and a dead chicken that looked pretty real. Since this film was made in Azerbaijan outside the American Humane  RSPCA's jurisdiction there certainly wasn't any No animals were harmed disclaimer at the end. If anyone knows how those scenes were monitored please post something about it.";

The old men are too lazy to solve the problem and the young leave town to seek a solution but never come back. A young man who is in love with a girl in town must solve this problem in order to marry her. He works on that while the rest of the village fights the classical war of the sexes. The protagonist is very charismatic. He is naive intelligent and persistent. Since a very early age he creates ludicrous inventions being completely different from the rest of the people in the town. He completely ignores the war and confusion going on around him focused only in his objectives to solve the lack of water problem. Even his girlfriend gets involved in the disputes believing he also is involved and adding to the pressure for a solution. A lot of funny things happen in the city while the women try to force their husbands to work out the problem and the men try to avoid it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember 'Lysistrata' written by Aristophanes in 411 BC a comedy of 'one woman's extraordinary mission to end The Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata convinces the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace a strategy however that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for its expos of sexual relations in a maledominated society and for its use of both double entendre and explicit obscenities'? Writerdirector Veit Helmer with co writers Gordon Mihic and Zaza Buadze have very successfully updated this tale bathed it in magical realism and fantasy placed it somewhere along the Silk Road in the mountains where no one would want to live and have called it ABSURDISTAN. This is one of those films that very thankfully requires us to surrender the need for realism and substitute the pleasure of laughing and spend a comfortable hour and a half of parody of current sexism and the rich treasures of old movies bawdy silliness and the magic of love. For this viewer it works on every level  thanks in part to the imaginative cinematography of Giorgi Beridze and the charm of Shigeru Umebayashi's musical score. Absurdistan has a problem the water supply that comes from a complex well system in the mountains outside the town has diminished to a trickle. The men of the town ignore their wives' complaints preferring instead to gather daily in the local teahouse leaving the women to not only tend to their homes but also finish the work of the men. A significant diverting part of this community is a young couple who have been in love since childhood married in a mock ceremony at age 8 matured to teenagers Aya Kristyna Malrov and Temelko Maximilian Mauf  but warned by the girl's grandmother Nino Chkheidze that they may not consummate their union until the stars are in alignment in four years! Temelko has spent his youth inventing things not exactly in the mold of the other men of the village. He and Aya believe that their sexual union will give Aya the ability to fly and Temelko intends to keep that concept viable. The young men of Absurdistan Temelko among them are bused off to some city where they are to learn how to fix the water shortage. While they are gone the women much due to Aya's leadership decide that in order to force the lazy men to work on the problem they will withhold conjugal obligations no water no sex. The bus returns empty  and only Temelko comes back to the village because of Aya. The silly men decide to avoid being dominated by the women's rule and try multiple ways to find satisfaction first by attempting to leave town to go gallivanting into the city aborted by the wives then to invite a carnival shooting gallery into the town  the prize being a night with the shooting gallery owner's Ivane Ivantbelidze daughter Ani Amiridze. Naturally the one who can successfully hit the target is Temelko and while Aya believes Temelko will sacrifice his conjugal initiation he instead devises inventions that entertain Aya and eventually he is able to solve the water problem. And as promised with the entire village celebrating restored physical bliss Temelko sets off a fantastical machine that allows Aya to fly  and return thrilled back to his arms. Though this film is directed by the fine German director Veit Helmer the feeling is entirely that of Russian folklore. The actors selected for the villagers have the most interesting faces and bodies imaginable and the exuberance of their acting is infectious. The reference to the history of the town often tying in to old movies is photographed like scratchy old film and the active story itself is in rapturously beautiful color. The film's story is basically voice over in Russian except for Aya's protestations. This is a fable a fairytale and a pure escapist delight of a film. It would be difficult not to fall under its spell. Grady Harp".

The men are so obsessed with proving their manliness that they've ignored the aging pipe that provides the village with its water. So the women use their own power to force some change.One trick that the movie uses is to never identify the country in which the story takes place. They speak Russian but it could just as easily be Georgia Armenia or Azerbaijan or even Chechnya. The point is that this village is one of the world's forgotten places. The people rely exclusively on each other and their knowhow. It's inevitable that the two young protagonists get caught up in the village's traditions and lackadaisical attitude towards a glaring problem. For all that we know there could be places like this in the US or Canada.I recommend the movie.".

Restless Lancelot who lives by his wits falls in love with Guinevere who is due to be married to King Arthur . Meanwhile a violent warlord attempts to seize power from Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table  as they set out in fight against the traitor Prince Malagant Ben Cross a Sir Mordredalike . Whilst in the meantime the bride Guinevere and Sir Lancelot betray the king in their own way . Adding the apparition of knights of the round table as Sir Kay Christopher Villiers  Agravaine Liam Cunningham  Sir Patrise Valentine Pelka and Sir Mador McCormack  though there doesn't turns up neither Merlin  nor Morgana LeFay and all things supernatural are out of this flick . This is an overwhelming tale with adventures villainyromance and heroism in the grandeur of big screen although in television set is lost its splendor .This sweeping movie displays adventures  thrills  a romantic love story  breathtaking battles and epic confrontation with a terrific climax final for a mortal confrontation . Excellent main cast as an attractive Richard Gere  a gorgeous Julia Ormond  and exceptional  as always  Sean Connery as Arthur  an aged and warweary king who is forced to go to battle one last time .

This is a Hollywood family movie with 3 great stars fancy costumes beautiful scenery and great music. To me this is some of the best entertainment! The kind of entertainment that cinema was invented for and that was so successful in the 40s and 50s. It seems to me that people today just can't enjoy that kind of entertainment anymore.

	schema:reviewBody "The Arthurian legend gets another reinterpretation in First Knight with an impressive Sean Connery as King Arthur. The last time Connery was at Camelot was his appearance as the Green Knight in Sword of the Valiant back in 1984. Julia Ormond is a fetching and beautiful Guinevere any knight worth his salt would saddle up and rescue her.Richard Gere is Lancelot and try as he might he comes off as way too American. This role calls for someone with the dash of an Errol Flynn and I'm surprised no one ever cast Flynn in a Camelot tale. Gere is not Errol Flynn why was no one from across the pond cast? My first guess would be that Gere was a box office name but certainly Sean Connery in the cast would take care of that.Some elements of Knights Of The Round Table got into the plot here. Lancelot who is kind of a medieval sword fighter for hire rescues the evil Prince Malagant played by Ben Cross. He's the Mordred of this story not a believer in the ideals of Camelot by any means. His philosophy is that Arthur is mistaken men don't want brotherhood they want leadership and he's just the guy to provide it. Cross is also thinking in terms of real politik Guinevere's domain of Lynness lies adjacent to Camelot good base for an invasion.Gere joins the Round Table brotherhood in part because of sincerely believing in the Arthurian ideals but also to be close to Julia Ormond. If you've seen any number of Camelot based films or have read Thomas Malory you have some idea on how this will end. But in the case of this particular film not completely.First Knight is not first by any means in Camelot films. But it's enjoyable enough for the fans of the leads. And Ben Cross comes really close to Stanley Baker's outstanding Mordred in Knights Of The Round Table.".

There is no magic no Merlin  no Morgana no sword in the stone  in fact no referral to Arthur's past. This obviously changes the myth quite substantially. Merlin and the Sword were key players in the typical Arthur legend but this adaptation is good because Morgana often confuses people.It squashes what Camelot really is  an ideal  into about two and a bit hours of movie. Richard Gere is charming as Lancelot a roving swordsman and Lady Guinevere delivers an outstanding performance as the young woman torn between two loves. Sean Connery is as always fantastic. The best thing about this movie  to me  was that the love story was sensible. Instead of Guinevere and Lancelot cheating on Arthur it becomes more of a love triangle with deeper issues as all three love each other in different ways.All this said it isn't the greatest movie despite some excellent acting  the movie had a weak plot and Maligant is not a very convincing villain. But if you're bored home sick or just want to watch some light entertainment by all means watch this film  just don't expect Peter Jackson quality.".

Why does he insist on tarnishing this telling by citing irrelevant facts? Do not be influenced by his trash. This is simply a wonderful new twist on an old story and it's very well done.Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film deserves recognition for what it is  a good interpretation of part of a legend with an excellent casting.Who else but Sean Connery as an ageing and dignified King Arthur ?Julia Ormond is a convincing and stunning princess with her graceful touching beauty her looks are also refreshing and different from all the everpresent boring blondes who get a part in anything because of their hair colour.As for Richard Gere he is as handsome charming and fearless as Camelot would be.This film is not for historians or purists nor does it claim to have a documentary value. It has a sense of magic and the pace is well alternated between romance and action. The emotion and intensity are present thanks to the actors and the music appropriate to all the scenes in the movie. That is what matters.Who cares about details such as a castle looking a bit dodgy blue clothes we have seen much worse and tackier in cinema history or the odd line or fact. Never mind that. Just relax and escape  it is only entertainment at the end of the day not a time for History or Legend Reconstruction. You are better off going to a course or reading a book do not rely on films to educate you all the time.Why comparing films ? Let's just say there are different approaches to a subject that is what makes the interest. Enjoy !".

	onyx:emotionText "This film deserves recognition for what it is  a good interpretation of part of a legend with an excellent casting.Who else but Sean Connery as an ageing and dignified King Arthur ?Julia Ormond is a convincing and stunning princess with her graceful touching beauty her looks are also refreshing and different from all the everpresent boring blondes who get a part in anything because of their hair colour.As for Richard Gere he is as handsome charming and fearless as Camelot would be.This film is not for historians or purists nor does it claim to have a documentary value. It has a sense of magic and the pace is well alternated between romance and action. The emotion and intensity are present thanks to the actors and the music appropriate to all the scenes in the movie. That is what matters.Who cares about details such as a castle looking a bit dodgy blue clothes we have seen much worse and tackier in cinema history or the odd line or fact. Never mind that. Just relax and escape  it is only entertainment at the end of the day not a time for History or Legend Reconstruction. You are better off going to a course or reading a book do not rely on films to educate you all the time.Why comparing films ? Let's just say there are different approaches to a subject that is what makes the interest. Enjoy !";

	schema:reviewBody "I am proud to say this movie is among my top 15 of all time along with The Godfather I and II Shawshank Amadeus and It's A Wonderful Life.  It is not a chick flick nor is it an emptyheaded Richard Gere movie.  This movie is a compelling love triangle between King Arthur Guinevere and Lancelot while also being an exciting actionadventure involving a traitor to Camelot who threatens to destroy it literally and figuratively.Sean Connery is perfectly cast and superb as King Arthur. Richard Gere is often criticized as a poor choice for Lancelot because of his age but come on!  The whole story is a medieval fantasy.  If Gere is 8 or 10 years older than he really should be in the movie who cares?  We're not telling a true story here.  He seems a little awkward a choice in the beginning but ultimately gives a great fantastic at times performance.  Julia Ormond is who really elevates this movie.  She is stunning and radiant as Guinevere the compassionate and brave Lady of Lioness.  Every medieval word and mannerism she produces is believable.Action fans will not be disappointed as this film has some amazing sequences especially when Richard Gere runs the gauntlet.  Zucker really lets go in the battles also.  Ben Cross plays a great villain.The end of this movie is one of the more moving scenes I've ever seen.  The performances by Connery Ormond and Gere up to that point make what could have been silly or forced seem touching and beautiful.First Knight is a great and underrated film not to be missed. It's a simple story that doesn't require a lot of analysis or understanding of folklore and mythology to enjoy.  Give it a chance!".

This is a fine physical performance which only loses its edge when he is forced to think rather than do.

	schema:headline " Another take on the Lancelot Guineviere Love Affair";
	schema:reviewBody "Most people who saw this movie said that it was bad and I expected it to be as well but I decided to watch it anyway. The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair which it is not but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it.The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot  though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot Arthur and Guinevere.The changes were immense. In the original story not that I have read it but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the miniseries Merlin Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film but then it was not his film. Even so Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur.Malagant is a constant threat but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to.His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur Guinevere and Lancelot.These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure he has never married and is not interested in marriage unless the right woman comes along and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure and while talking with her he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him but he is not convinced show me the look you gave him. It is all about love and he wants the love in the heart but not in the head.Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men especially in those days would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing  something that Lancelot does not want. Of course the threat of Malagant is always present.".

	schema:reviewBody "In almost all other interpretations of this legend Guenevere is seen as a woman who cannot choose between two young men that love her.  In this movie Arthur is portrayed as a very mature older man who knows he wants Guenevere as his wife but that she might choose him for the wrong reasons.  He gives her protection of her lands without marriage and she refuses.  He never loses his wisdom and never forgets his duties as king in face of his crazy private life.  Lancelot is presented as a wandering young man who knows when a woman wants him and cannot understand Guenevere's refusal of him time and time again.  However he is not fickle and has known true loss. His love for Guenevere is always constant.  Guenevere is in turmoil but is never seen as flighty.  She loves both men in different ways but does not know why.  Instead of her having to betray either man completely the production allows for one of her lovers to die and encourage Guenevere and the other lover to be together.  I think this is a brilliant way to end the movie and one that allows all the characters complete fulfillment.This movie also simplifies the plot enough that the movie is not chopped and confusing or hours and hours long.  I never have been able to understand Morgan and appreciate a different antagonist.  I can see why this movie was not liked as it came out the same year as Braveheart and Rob Roy and wish the producers had not released for at least one year and it might have been better received.".

The word hokum is undoubtedly a compliment in this case. Surely it wasn't for money? Nobody's that greedy or hard up. Or did they all think it was a good idea at the time? If so they were badly mistaken.The supposed Norman armour looked like something that was dreamed up for and thrown out of Star Trek or Flash Gordon. Actually the styles of designer armour on display here range from the bizarre to the unbelievable with shades of the ridiculous in between. Disregarding that they were all made out of modern material uniforms were not worn by any military in Britain until Cromwell's New Model Army in the 17th century. Until then recognition of both friend and enemy alike was by banners etc. and was all a bit of a hit and miss affair just like this movie in fact. On reflection I can't recall seeing a single banner in the entire film.The fabled King Arthur wouldn't have been Norman anyway. He was supposed debatedly to have been a 5th or 6th century Ancient Briton some say with Roman ancestry and to have lived long before the Norman Conquest was even thought of. One theory even puts forward the view that he actually was a Roman who'd remained in Britain after all others had departed. Whichever of the many theories you prefer you'd have to agree that he certainly wouldn't even have seen a Gothic building let alone lived in one.The moralising or should I say demoralising script was not only absolutely dire but downright silly. Almost as silly as the gas fire in the middle of the Round Table.I don't think that Britain was actually mentioned in the script so perhaps if this retelling of a powerful story had been set anywhere a planet somewhere in the far reaches of Andromeda comes to mind instead of in and around Camelot and with a different set of characters the movie might have been acceptable. As it is it has to go down in the comedy mode. Except that it wasn't meant to be one.Richard Gere as Lancelot has to be the one of the worst casting mistakes in movie history that is if you discount John Wayne as Ghengis Khan and the Surely this must be the Son of God! Centurian or a 30 yr old Robert Taylor as Billy the Kid. And Sean Connery as King Arthur doesn't rate much better. The only good comments I can make about the whole production is that there's a rather nice musical score lurking somewhere behind everything and Adam Greenberg's cinematography is rather good. For those two points alone I've given it an extra star but it's still an awful movie.In conclusion this has to be a Follywood production that cannot be missed...otherwise you'll never know how bad it is!".

Sumptuously filmed in various picturesque British locations it moves along quite nicely showing Lancelot as a loner swordsman who finds himself drawn into something bigger by King Arthur excellently played by Sean Connery. Richard Gere isn't bad as Lancelot who joins up with the knights of the round table for reasons beyond his wish to see justice for all. His lack of an accent is probably his greatest asset as though British actors were used for the support players many of them sound surprisingly like London taxi drivers. Julia Ormond is a little trembly as Guinevere the person who wishes to do her best by her people and Arthur but cannot deny her love for Lancelot. She seems to be coming along quite nicely as the new Audrey Hepburn though she hasn't been in much of late. The villain of the piece Ben Cross as Malagant is good in his role not completely evil but bent on world conquest and jealous of all Arthur has built. From herein the scene is set for tragedy and it's all a matter of time before Arthur gets wind of the secret feelings between his wife and his best knight. Before this happens though you get treated to some excellent medieval fight scenes and more beautiful locations courtesy of the last green bits of Britain. The only things I can say to detract from it are it's confused seriousnonserious state at times and Sir John Gielgud who pops up for no reason and annoys the hell out of me. Other than that I really enjoyed it it's one of those films I feel I can watch over and over again and there is no higher praise than that.".

Sean Connery could have been OK as Arthur but he delivers a very weak performance mostly due to the horrid script I believe. Perhaps he realised what kind of sheep dung they were creating and lost interest.The story in itself is does unforgivable changes to the Arthur mythology the idea to take a minor villain from an obscure medieval romance and turn him into the one that overthrows Arthur's reign is simply atrocious. Arthur's realm is portrayed as a weak little kingdom that topples over at first sight of trouble and Arthur himself comes across as a jealous despot. The Arthur story especially the love triangle between Arthur Guinevere and Lancelot contains a lot more depth than this movie shows you.Also the fight scenes are meek and the armour worn by the knights seems more like something from Star Trek than any kind of actual medieval protective gear.If you want to see a good Arthur movie I'd recommend Excalibur Merlin or even the latest installment King Arthur. Avoid this heinous atrocity of a movie at all costs!".

Here I feel like the campiness of TCM2 met the thrills of the original TCM in a healthy middle ground. There are some ridiculous oneliners but they're placed fittingly unlike the second movie where the comedy felt forced and sloppy. The acting in the movie is above average too with your standard now famous but previously in a crappy horror sequel actor to boot. The main reason this is better than its predecessor is because it actually has suspense not a lot of it but it's there. The creepy moments somewhat resemble scenes from the original but none of it feels rehashed. There are characters you can root for and Leatherface is actually kind of scary again. There's also a satisfying climax fit with heavy metal and cheesy lines that belong in a Marlon Wayans movie. It's just a fun popcorn horror movie with some gore a couple thrills and a decent amount of laughs. All in all a movie is meant to entertain and for the most part Texas Chainsaw Massacre III did exactly that. Worth a watch for hardcore slasher fans.".

No it's not as good as the original or the sequel but what do you expect when Tobe Hooper's not on board? However if you do not compare it to its predecessors it stands alone as a fun flick. It's at least watchable unlike the Matthew McConaughey remake. The only thing I really don't like about it is the lack of continuity. The David Schow script is great it just leaves out some needed information. In essence this is the first in a long line of remakes. The director Jeff Burr does succeed in creating tension. My heart still pounds every time when they stop to fix that flat tire. Those faroff squeaking sounds are unnerving. The cast does well also. No one has the energy of Bill Moseley Chop Top from TCM 2 but he's a tough act to follow. What they do have is horror favorite Ken Foree. Foree is always great. I don't care whether he's in Dawn of the Dead or The Phantom of the Mall he's great. And you must give credit to Viggo Mortensen. He's come a long way from b horror to star in the Lord of the Rings. When it comes down to it TCM 3 is worthy of a bit more praise.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this film a lot but you have to watch it with an open mind and forget the other TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies that it follows. It in no way seems to be connected other than the name Leatherface.As far as slasher movies go with legends like Jason Vorhees Michael Myers Norman Bates etc. this film fits in well. Here Leatherface is a madman who seems to have a blood lust not to mention the mind of a madman as opposed to the mind of a retarded person as he had on the first two. I hated this Leatherface really but enjoyed him as a killer. After just a little while I forgot about the Sawyer family and enjoyed this movie for what it was and I really liked it.Bottom line is this....this move was a great film if you enjoy movies like FRIDAY THE 13TH if not then don't watch it. It's not at all like the first two TCM's so don't expect a sequel but the cast is awesome and still full of psychotic characters. 8 out of 10 stars".

	schema:headline " Okay so it's not great art....";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm actually really surprised at all the positive reviews for this film here considering its horrible reputation.Made on a shoestring budget with noname actors at least at the time obviously Viggo went on to Alistish status obviously there is nothing new or original here about this outing as can be said of most sequels. Hooper's 1974 film said and did everything that needed to be said and done the documentary styleiconic villain the creation of theslasherfilm template the unrelenting suspense the postVietnam worldview the subtle political underpinnings about consumerism greedand the decay of the nuclear family etc..... That film is an unparalleled masterpiece and even Hooper's own follow up really didn't hold a candle or need to existalthough it was crazy offbeat quality cult film making on its own termsso a third entry would seem a complete waste of time.So why even pay part III any attention? My adoration for it relies solely because of the first half of the film which is very welldone and far superior to the second half. For starters the acting is fine across the board Kate Hodge and William Butler as the film's yuppie protagonists are natural and serviceable in their roles nothing awardwinning or showstopping but subtle and absorbing enough to not take viewers out of the film like many of its lesser ilk slasher films in this era typically had bottomofthebarrel talent.The cinematography is also imaginative and stylized i.e. the entire gas station peepshow sequence is fantastically shot and executed the angle of our heroine through the cracked mirror the claustrophobic lighting the POV's from the peephole. And note Kate Hodge's reactions during this scene she genuinely seems creeped out and uncomfortable and her reactions of fear and confusion in the scenes that follow are equally convincing. It's an underrated performance in a film with uniformly underrated performances.The film's pacing in this first half is also impressive from the deceptively mundane car conversation that opens the film to the bizarre body pit sequence which was so absurd awkward yet somehow plausibly creepy indeed it bordered on parody but then this film as a whole can be seen almost as a parody to the armadillo murder scene then the gas station sequence all these sequences are knowing winks to the first film but because the film modernizes them it benefits as it places the viewers in the now instead of the then the original's documentary feel is one of the film's greatest strengths but years later it does give one the feeling of watching historical newsdocumentary footage of something that already occurredagainpart of the film's raw unnerving power to be sure. But this film is set in 1990 so a documentary approach just wouldn't work not to mention it would be derivative redundant and just simply outofplace. So it's a credit to Burr and cinematographer James L. Carter who later proved himself a real talent with more mainstream gigs that they remained faithful to the mood of the original while taking some new chances.And how about that truckchasechanging the tire sequence? I LIVE for scenes like this and sadly modern horror films just don't take us here anymore the ominous yet minimalist soundtrack slowburn pacing effective use of that lantern light and again Kate Hodge seems genuinely freaked out in this scene you can really put yourself in her shoes and the boyfriend's reaction of incredulity anger and frustration...there is some commendable attempt at realism here a truly tense and nervejangling scene. Also dare I say that the atmosphere in this scene comes the closest out of any film in the series to matching the flashlight fight between Sally and Franklin in the original film? It's that uncomfortable mix of anxietyfrustration and dread that Hooper created so well that I think is unfairly overlooked in this sequel.Okay so that's the first half. The second half is simply not as effective. It becomes like I mentioned earlier almost a parody of the first film with an uneven mix of horror and attempted black comedy. There are HINTS of wit and social commentary the mocking by one of the chainsaw clan of the elitist California couple's underwear Ken Foree's completely outofplace military survivalist and Leatherface's hilarious scene with the Speak and Spell that somehow manages to evoke sympathy from viewers but these clever bits don't really SAY anything or add insight. The one saving grace that makes the second half worth sitting through however is Kate Hodge's transformation from genteel yuppie to traumatized bad ass. A nice touch and homage to Sally in the original. But then comes the final shot which is almost as if director Burr threw up his arms and said alright time for the trendy 80's slasher movie ending....this ain't no art film after all. And of course it leaves room for yet another sequel. Shame shame Burr.And there you have it LEATHERFACE the wildly uneven sometimes ambitious but always amusing what shouldhavebeen the final word on an already dying franchise and more notably subgenre that would never quite be the same. As we all know SCREAM followed 6 years later and the slasher film became a cultural artifact only to be mocked parodied and postmodernized to a new generation of film goers most of whom ironically weren't even alive when their genre forefathers were in their heyday. So in that context we should be grateful for earnest little films like TCMIII which while far from perfect mark the end of an innocent and forgotten era of ironyfree slasher film making. Sigh.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 is the third installment in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series and proves to be much much better than the huge disappointment of the ridiculous Part 2. Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III is about a couple who are delivering a car to California and are crossing Texas country. They stop at a gas station where a creepy set of brothers work and they are back on the road again. When a tire goes out they stop to try and fix it but Leatherface emerges from the darkness with his trusty chainsaw. In a panic to save themselves they speed off and end up later crashing into another man's car. After the accident they are chased through the woods and taken to an old secluded farmhouse where more torture awaits. The family includes Viggo Mortensen far before his Lord of the Rings fame which is interesting to see him in his early movies. This movie doesn't skimp up on the gore it is an allout gorefest much like Part II was except I enjoyed this one a lot better. I rented it on DVD and watched the unrated version and it was enough to make you think twice about eating anymore meat it was pretty darn gory. Bottom line this is one of the better sequels of the series and a giant improvement from part 2. It had some suspenseful scenes that were well done and the acting wasn't bad. Overall a well paced well made sequel. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 1990Director Jeff Burr Stepfather 212outofReviewMan I really wanted to like this movie. I probably should give the movie a less then favorable review but after the special features and commentaries I feel compelled to stick with it. A step up from the previous entry there isn't a comedic aspect in sight. Some morbid humor here and there but ultimately this sequel attempts to go the serious route and for me that's good. The original movie was the landmark classic one of the only movies that I admit actually scares me on a visceral and psychological level. The sequel wasn't warranted but since the greed of the eighties thought otherwise we have a franchise. This sequel is more of a refined version of the original that hints at being a sequel while at the same time is more of just a semiremake. We have a bickering couple Michelle Hidden 2's Kate Hodge and Ryan Friday the 13th part 7's Bill Butler traveling across Texas they eventually succumb to the dirty and desolate gas station where foul play and misguided directions leads them to the clutches of Leatherface and his demented family. They are aided by survivalist Benny Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree. Thankfully he has a semi automatic and knows a thing or two about being hunted. There's also a backwoods girl running away but she is marked as expired food and we shouldn't invest too much in her. The movie has a nice music video look to it it has no grittiness like 1 but isn't overwhelming with colors like 2. It's polished bleak and has that hopeless feeling down pat. Jeff Burr actually succeeds with some tension and suspense. Just watch the changing flat tire scene alone at night by yourself and you certainly feel your adrenaline pumping. Leatherface's new look is also quite menacing and his leg brace is responsible fro some tense scenes. The family is also quite effective. I liked the chemistry and Tex Viggo Mortenson stole the show as the stylish weasel like brother. The little girl was also disturbing and ambiguous. I enjoyed grandpa's cameo. The gore in this movie is also quite effective but has the MPAA hovering over the entire show. Lot's of cuts and murky darkness hides what are obviously sick and twisted gore bits. Like the bisection of the backwoods girl or the sledge hammer to head bit. As Jeff Burr stated If your making a sequel to Texas Chainsaw you better believe it's going to be gory. Indeed. The ending is the biggest cheat I've seen from MPAA. The music by Burr regular Manzie was also a nice touch. It was a mix of action and creepiness with a dash of Metal as well that made the movie move along nicely. I especially liked the music while Benny is trying to get bullets with Tink waiting to attack. The music was also used less effectively in Burr's Pumpkinhead 2. This leaves us to the script which received the most butchering of anything involved with this production. David Schow he penned the 2005 remake and some unaccredited work for Nightmare 5 Dream Child as well. His ear for dialog is awful most of the time our couple in peril usually had to spit out some crappy lines that were laugh out loud funny why did Ryan feel the need to say things that were happening out loud? Like the Oh my god there coming from behind us or the Oh my god what do they want from us or Michelle's Violence is no answer to Violence made my ears bleed and took me out of the movie since I doubt no tolerable human being would speak in such a contrived way. Also why do the events seem a bit underwhelming and uneventful? After it was over my friends in attendance were like That's it? I feel a lot more could have happened like some decent background info on the family of loons or some more brutal events in our finale. It feels a tad flimsy. The movie alas still has an anchor and that's its good intentions from all those involved. I feel that Texas chainsaw never needed sequels they aren't as endearing as Nightmares or Friday the 13ths its story was told in one and that's that. Thankfully though the effort has a touch or horror class which makes it all the more acceptable while still being a problematic production. The more I think about it the more I believe that it is the best sequel out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie the other night I had virtually no expectations for it. As with most horror movies I see it was late at night and I just wanted to watch something to pass the time. I'll admit off hand that I have not seen the original although I've heard enough of it where I could retell it shot for shot just about. And I have seen the horrid 2003 remake I was at a party and we all found it hilarious. So given that my only true experience with the franchise was the remake and that horror series degrade at an extremely high rate I felt that this might be my first disappointment with the IFC. I was wrong.It was the acting first and foremost that surprised me. It was more than average it was actually good whereas most horror movies I find have absolutely dreadful actors. I was surprised to find Viggo Mortenson in here but I suppose you have to start somewhere. He was without question the best actor involved giving an eerie and menacing although not frightening performance. While he clearly has a way to grow from this early performance his talent is obvious.The woman who played the female protagonist did a good job in her role. She didn't degrade into a shrilly screaming mess nor did she seem immune to the terror around her. She showed a realistic and gradual development due to what was happening around her.The little girl as played by Jennifer Bonko had the only part that was frightening. Why was it frightening? She was a little girl and had the most sinister actions of the family. Her skeletonlittered room was juxtaposed beautifully with her painfully cute appearance and her doll was a disturbing touch. Why the female lead would think nothing amiss about her I have no idea. While Viggo does the best acting job Jennifer gives the most memorable performance.The rest of the cast did a good job as well. Ken Foree gives a welldone although forgettable performance as does William Butler and Joe Unger. Really that's what the entire movie can boil down to in the end well made but still forgettable.The direction was pretty well done. It has a gritty feel to it more like some lowbudget movies made in the 70's and 80's rather than one made in 1990. That I think is part of it's success with me. It seemed dark and gritty in an old and almost dated way.While this film never frightened me it does have some highly memorable moments. The dead father who was fed blood was a somewhat disturbing image especially with all of that blood staining the front of his shirt.Leatherface unlike in the 2003 remake of the original looked terrifying. In fact that whole Mr. Spell sequence with the picture of the clown was very well done. Also as I mentioned above the little girl was just allaround the best part of this movie.The forest was highly atmospheric and well shot and the crazed girl was extremely well done. I would have loved if she had stuck around a bit longer and been more developed. As it was she was used only as a plotdevice to give Foree's character the lighter and to build the clan up more in the audience's eyes.The beginning had a wellmade introduction. And the uncovering of the mass grave was an excellent way to foreshadow the movie. However the sequence between and including them hitting the armadillo and going the gas station was slow and illshot. It served a purpose but could have been made to serve it better. The ending is entirely wasted. They chose the wrong clansman to come back for the final scare. That little girl would have been perfect for the job absolutely perfect and much more frightening to boot. Other than that my only complaint is that the new shiny chainsaw didn't have the same dark and gritty feel as the old one he had.This passes off as an average horror movie. It's an entertaining way to pass a few hours and includes several memorable ingredients to it. Fans of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series I'd imagine should like this movie. Fans of Viggo Mortensen might find this early performance of his enjoyable. And fans of horror even the milder ones should find this a campy and enjoyable movie.It falls into that category of movie that pushes no envelopes one that's mild enough for the more squeamish and violent enough for the more fortified constitutions. It's not great but neither is it bad. It's only decent and will never be any more or less.".

While he clearly has a way to grow from this early performance his talent is obvious.The woman who played the female protagonist did a good job in her role. She didn't degrade into a shrilly screaming mess nor did she seem immune to the terror around her. She showed a realistic and gradual development due to what was happening around her.The little girl as played by Jennifer Bonko had the only part that was frightening. Why was it frightening? She was a little girl and had the most sinister actions of the family. Her skeletonlittered room was juxtaposed beautifully with her painfully cute appearance and her doll was a disturbing touch. Why the female lead would think nothing amiss about her I have no idea. While Viggo does the best acting job Jennifer gives the most memorable performance.The rest of the cast did a good job as well. Ken Foree gives a welldone although forgettable performance as does William Butler and Joe Unger. Really that's what the entire movie can boil down to in the end well made but still forgettable.The direction was pretty well done. It has a gritty feel to it more like some lowbudget movies made in the 70's and 80's rather than one made in 1990. That I think is part of it's success with me. It seemed dark and gritty in an old and almost dated way.While this film never frightened me it does have some highly memorable moments. The dead father who was fed blood was a somewhat disturbing image especially with all of that blood staining the front of his shirt.Leatherface unlike in the 2003 remake of the original looked terrifying. In fact that whole Mr. Spell sequence with the picture of the clown was very well done. Also as I mentioned above the little girl was just allaround the best part of this movie.The forest was highly atmospheric and well shot and the crazed girl was extremely well done. I would have loved if she had stuck around a bit longer and been more developed. As it was she was used only as a plotdevice to give Foree's character the lighter and to build the clan up more in the audience's eyes.The beginning had a wellmade introduction. And the uncovering of the mass grave was an excellent way to foreshadow the movie. However the sequence between and including them hitting the armadillo and going the gas station was slow and illshot. It served a purpose but could have been made to serve it better. The ending is entirely wasted. They chose the wrong clansman to come back for the final scare. That little girl would have been perfect for the job absolutely perfect and much more frightening to boot. Other than that my only complaint is that the new shiny chainsaw didn't have the same dark and gritty feel as the old one he had.This passes off as an average horror movie. It's an entertaining way to pass a few hours and includes several memorable ingredients to it. Fans of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series I'd imagine should like this movie. Fans of Viggo Mortensen might find this early performance of his enjoyable. And fans of horror even the milder ones should find this a campy and enjoyable movie.It falls into that category of movie that pushes no envelopes one that's mild enough for the more squeamish and violent enough for the more fortified constitutions. It's not great but neither is it bad. It's only decent and will never be any more or less.";

Now when i say sick killers i mean SICK......sledge hammers to heads hands being nailed to chairs and feeding good'ol rotting granpa blood...sorta makes the brutal scene of sally being forced over a metal bucket while the original family cheers granpa on as he tries to hammer her in the head... look mild and tame. I give this movie an 8 outta 10 for the fact that it had all the right stuff to make a good creepy killing movie give it a shot and judge for yourself.".

I like that the film followed the format of the first it lacks the cheese and goofiness of TCM part 2. Even though the family is pretty sadistic I couldn't help but laugh at what they said or how they acted with each other. The gas station attendant had some funny moments as well. The film is 1 hour and 24 minutes long and was very entertaining rarely a dull moment. The film is not as violent as part two was it's mostly just blood splattering and and the odd severed head or face we never see the chainsaw cut flesh which is what everyone wants to see. Oh well we have the newer films that aren't shy to show us what the title promises. Viggo Mortensen is in this film it was neat to see his earlier work I liked his line  Boy they just keep getting dumber. Ken Foree is the character you end up rooting for. Leatherfaces final moment before the film ends makes him out to be more inhuman then I once thought then again this is the same guy who had a chainsaw rammed through him.You may ask why I gave this a 6 out of 10 well I don't think it's all that bad it was a more enjoyable sequel than Part 2 at least from my first viewing we'll see if that changes in time once I've viewed it a couple more times. It's not bad and I don't get why fans of this cry about every new film in this franchise that comes out can't you just enjoy the film it's not art it's a horror movie.

One of the main aspects that works really well to this one is an impressive atmosphere with the film being rather creepy for the most part. There's a lot of fun to be had with this one in the desert despite being set at night but it makes the film just that much better because the majority of the action takes place at night and that is really tough to pull off yet it's done nicely here. The initial appearance by the couple changing their cartire which turns into an attack on the car and then leading into the chase down the highway where they bump into their friend gives this a strong launching pad to where the movie really works in the chasing through the patch of woods by the highway. The dark trees and nearly impenetrable layout makes for a perfect spot to unleash the series of ambushes stumbling across the traps left out and getting plenty of strong stellar stalking throughout where the killer comes out of the shadows in rather unexpected locations to catch them in the traps or stalk them with the chainsaw leading for a great time throughout here. With the family dinner scene being rather enjoyable with plenty of gruesome bloody moments that are far more squirminducing than expected and a nasty streak that runs throughout suddenly machine gun fire bursts into the room gunning down most of the family leading into the final brawl out in the swamp which has a lot to like. The gore is great as well especially in the unrated form where the gore is a little nastier and it should please the gorehounds looking for a ton of blood and guts. There are still some flaws here as there is an 'R' rated version of the film that is so heavily cut that it makes no sense why it was rated 'R.' Almost no violence at all occurs in the main cut of the film which is virtually bloodless and with a low body count to chop up it doesn't have a lot of deaths to dole out. There are way too few people to get involved in the family which keeps the bodycount to a point where it's quite obvious there's not a lot of opportunities to knock people off which is really distracting. There's also the fact that the family again changes around members needlessly offering up another change in the members and characteristics of the group which is never explained and offers up the kind of questions that shouldn't be made in this kind of situation. Ranging from who's who in relation to each other and what they're pasts were like since they're colorful enough to be memorable however too much is kept offscreen around them which is rather disappointing. Still it's far better than expected.Rated R Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "First there was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a truly remarkable horror film that has remained one of my favorites. Then there was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. It's an interesting film that is both funny and horrific. With Leatherface they got back to the original approach to this subject matter. The humor in this third installment is much more subtle like the Original TCM and this movie has a similar feel to it that is like the original though certainly not as good as the original.I guess if you looked at these movies from a realistic standpoint there would have never been any reason for any sequels after the original plus the fact that the sequels don't really follow any type of story line. It seems like you just have to take each installment as is. And this one is one of the better ones. My rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "LeatherfaceTexas Chainsaw Massacre III has to be one of the best slasher movies to come out of the late 80's early 90's horror slide. It contains genuine moments of terror and some very disturbing scenes. Its previous sequel fell down in many aspects in that it tried to mix comedy and horror at all the wrong moments however this sequel seems to get it all right. It returns the setting to the isolated house in the woods Leatherface is completely maniacal in a circus freak kind of way as in the original movie and he looks as ferocious and scary as I've ever seen him. The acting all in all is quite good especially from our heroine Kate Hodge and Ken Foree of Dawn of the Dead fame puts in a memorable performance as the innocent hunter down on his luck. It was great to see Viggo Mortensen perform in such a psychotic sick way and compare it to his more recent Hollywood successes. Overall I don't see why people had such a problem with this movie. It's the best of the sequels and although that's not saying much it's far better than Movies like Hellraiser or Candyman that we're produced during the post slasher phase. Granted the cinema version and VHS versions were hacked to bits by the producers themselves but watching this movie as it was intended on Laserdisc brings back some of the impact that people may have missed in the cinema. I give it 45".

I have always thought the first entry was very good as far as slasher movies go but I found the second movie to be a big disappointment.  The first half or so is pretty decent but once Dennis Hopper reaches the underground lair the movie quickly stagnates although the final chainsaw battle is cool.  So after a very uneven 2 Leatherface was a nice surprise.  The movie has some genuinely tense moments and is surprisingly solid all the way through.  The characters are interesting and the actors do a good job.  Maybe the movie looks like a BMovie cheapie but that's because it is!  I do like Leatherface the character less in 3 than in 1 or 2 but otherwise I'd recommend this movie pretty quickly.  For some reason two books I've seen claim 3 is more of a remake than a sequel. I do not see why someone would think this.  8 stars out of 10.".

	schema:headline " What about part II?";
	schema:reviewBody "At the end of Texas Chainsaw II there was something of a variation on the ending of the original film. The girl who spends most of her time trying to escape the family of crazed maniacs with her life ends up holding the chainsaw herself swinging it around like a lunatic exactly like Leatherface did at the end of the original film which led me to believe that it would suggest a general direction that the movies would take in any further sequels. Instead Texas Chainsaw III one of the more controversial entries in the series seems to be unaware of its predecessors.I hesitate to condemn the entire film just because it is seriously lacking in the quality department if only because I watched the 'Making Of' featurettes on the DVD and found that the cast and crew actually went through some serious trouble getting the thing made and the cause of a lot of the drops in quality was some things that they had to cut or change in order to get an R rather than X rating. You would think that all they have to do is cut out excessive blood or guts or nudity to tame the rating a bit but they had to completely change scenes in order for the blasted MPAA to allow them to release it. Wes Craven went through similar troubles in some of his earlier films like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes and when you learn what they deal with it's not so hard to figure out why the MPAA is not popular with horror filmmakers.spoilersOne thing that had to be changed for example was the ending. This is why you see a character show up grinning at the end of the film despite the fact that we watched him get his head chainsawed in half earlier in the movie. Before you yank the DVD out of your DVD player and try to stick it in the wall take a few minutes to watch the making of documentary which essentially is 30 minutes of the cast and crew trying to explain why the movie was so bad. One verbose reviewer who calls himself Duke De Mondo writes a hilarious review in which he asserts that the Texas Chainsaw sequels all seem to pay homage to the original film as though it were some kind of urban legend constantly reshuffling everything except Leatherface the only character who is expected to be in any Texas Chainsaw movie. Hence in part III Leatherface is the only returning character and as the director explains on the accompanying documentary everyone else is some sort of surrogate family brought together my similar deviations from sanity. Still a pretty weak explanation for the little blonde girl I should think.Speaking of which it should be mentioned that at one point in the film two people get chainsawed to death minutes apart and it is not until I saw that little girl standing at the top of the stairs that I was even slightly apprehensive. What is it about little kids that makes them so scary? It's the worst when they are dressed in cute little outfits that just clash so strongly with their surroundings like the little girl in this movie or probably most famously the twin girls in The Shining who I still think are some of the creepiest kids ever captured on film. This girl turns out to be an aspiring member of the family eager for her turn to put the meat hooks and sledge hammers to good use and who decorates her room not with flowers or Barbie's or anything even remotely pink but with human bones and skulls presumably left over from the original Texas Chainsaw and subsequently The Hills Have Eyes. And this is to say nothing of her doll. You know Jodie Foster had to undergo counseling in preparation for her role as a 12yearold prostitute in Taxi Driver. I really wonder if there were similar concerns for this girl whose filmmaking ordeal can't have been much less damaging.As far as the gore Texas Chainsaw III is famous for being disappointing but this is explained by the whole ratings fiasco. On the other hand there was much talk about death scene of the girl who had already been running from the crazed family for five days or so when this movie started. Supposedly she was sawed in half from the stomach up but this is simply not true even in the unrated version that I watched. Yes there is a vast quantity of blood in the scene and yes she does get brutally killed with the saw but no she does not get sawed in half and then her body peel off in two directions having been split down the middle. It just doesn't happen. Nevertheless I should think there is sufficient gore in the movie to satisfy all but the most depraved horror and Chainsaw fans especially considering the sledgehammer scene which is based on a real police photo of Ed Gein's basement and is one thing that the movie deserves at least some credit for the abovementioned chainsaw scene and the scene where one character gets his head sawed almost in half at the ear level although as we later find out does not kill him. If this is not enough for you watch Day of the Dead. And if THAT is not enough for you watch the news. There are plenty of videos coming from al Qaeda that are truly truly disturbing.Viggo Mortensen although he almost didn't get the part because his audition just didn't go very well was outstanding as Tex who is essentially the character that Matthew McConaughey plays in Texas Chainsaw 4 which is by leaps and bounds the worst of the series including the 2003 remake which I have not seen at the time of this writing but it is physically impossible that it was worse than that ridiculous mess. There is one scene where Tex nails the heroine's hands to a wooden chair and then casually asks her how she likes Texas. Pretty disturbing but it doesn't make you want to slap your forehead as McConaughey does from start to finish in part 4.Well I'm sure she's having a blast although the movie was filmed in California incidentally about a 30minute drive from where I live in Los Angeles. That's bikeriding distance for me. I was also impressed with the heroine in the movie the obligatory girl who is the last to survive running from Leatherface although this movie makes a slight variation on this trend at the end of the film. She manages to walk the fine line between sufficiently expressing her terror and not screaming mercilessly to the point where you just want her to get killed so she'll shut the hell up and that is not an easy line to walk. I hope I'm not being misogynistic but there is nothing worse in a horror film than the hysterical woman who simply screams and moans and won't respond when someone is trying to help her. I hate that. I have to admit that I was disappointed that the fancy new chainsaw inscribed with the infamous quote 'The Saw is Family' and the most famous thing about this movie was put to so little use. Not only is it not introduced until the majority of the killings are already done with another much less shiny and interesting chainsaw. And to make matters worse not only is it underwater when it does its fleshhacking I guess the ability to run underwater was another of its special features but the one character that it is allowed to sink its teeth into turns up not dead at the end of the film. Disappointing true but I have to say that Texas Chainsaw III is one of the better TCM films. Not as good as the original but as good as the first sequel and light years better than the third sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well said Rothman. Whatever this movie is supposed to be it fails on every level. It's not scary it's not disturbing it's not entertaining it's only funny periodically when you can't believe how stupid it is and it essentially killed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise until it was rebooted a decade later. The only reason anyone would have any inclination to watch this is because of its leads  Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey  who were young and naive back then but they did they best they could with the material they had. Renee played a fine damsel in distress and McConaughey was perfect as an insane cannibalistic psychopath. You can tell he was having fun with the part and the fun he has is contagious sometimes especially knowing how huge he has become since. The movie itself is downright horrendous. It starts off as a typical slasher a few teens leaving prom get stranded in the woods then they encounter strange characters and from then it devolves into a nonsensical screaming battle between everyone. Literally there are scenes in this movie where the only lines are AHHHH! Leatherface has gone full transvestite for this installment. They also end the movie with some sort of conspiracy that these cannibals have been around for thousands of years and there are men in suits that check up on them or something. It makes absolutely no sense and trying to piece it together will ensure a loss of brain cells.This is the worst of the premillennial TCMs by a long shot. Only watch if you're a diehard TCM completist or you want to watch McConaughey yell like crazy for a while. Either way you're bound to be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Insanely bad!";
	schema:reviewBody "I decided to watch the original Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE TCM 2 LEATHERFACE TCM 3 and TCM 4 in a row. I already seen the two first and I think they're great. But Leatherface and TCM 4 were new to me. Leatherface was extremely flat and boring but TCM 4 was well INSANELY BAD. I simply could not believe what I was watching. My jaw was on the floor. Is this a movie? It's a joke right? I never laughed so much in a very long time. There are simply no words to describe how bizarre SURREAL and bad this movie is. Nothing makes sense so there's no point of trying to make sense of it. It's insane. Insanely bad. Insanely funny. Insanely directed. Insanely insulting to the whole series. Insanely watchable AND unwatchable. Yes it's INSANELY entertaining to the masochist in me who likes to witness the worst of the worst in movies and TCM 4 is WRETCHED to the nth degree! It feels like the Hitchhiker from the original TCM directed this movie. I have to admit that as bad as TCM 4 is at least it's looks and feels more like the TCM world created by Tobe Hooper than the ultra boring and flat looking LEATHERFACE TCM 3.There are so many moments in TCM 4 that have to be seen to be believed. The funniest being the moment when Renee and Matthew are battling over remotes that controls Matthew's piston powered leg got that?. Or the funny scene of Leatherface a crossdresser here standing behind clueless Heather and playing with her hair. Heather has to be one of the funniest characters I've ever seen. She's played by Lisa Marie Newmyer who's a bimbo but with a lot of insight. In this movie Heather is attacked by Leatherface placed in a freezer. Then she's hung on a hook and for some unexplained reason she got off the hook and tried to crawl away from the house only to be brought back to the house where she lies on the floor too bored or lazy to runaway. LOL!!! The whole thing is played as a comedy. But the comedy is often so bizarre that it's not really funny. What's also remarkable is that Renee and Matthew do have star quality and watching these stars in this insane movie just adds a lot more bizarre wonky quality to the movie than it really deserved. The whole cast is game but I wonder what did the director or producers do to have the cast go all out like that? Was it drugs? Was the whole crew and cast on drugs or drunk?!?! Matthew is very good in his role as well I don't know a buff psycho? And Renee goes all out in her role as survivor running across the forest like an athlete trying to win a medal.After I watched TCM4 for a second time I've finally realized that it's all flippant parody of the first movie. I've noticed bizarre details like the sound of crickets during the opening scene inside Jenny's house. The director who cowrote the original TCM didn't take this new foray into the TCM universe seriously for one second. In the end TCM 4 looked like an amalgamation of 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE' and TWIN PEAKS. The director was obviously influenced by the David Lynch TV series. When you look at the movie in this light it's not the total disaster that everyone says it is BUT the movie still ends up looking pretty bad because of one major weak aspect about it it's TOTALLY POINTLESS. If there's was a movie that was totally pointless it's this one. Why basically remake the first movie a la David Lynch? What's next? The Quentin Tarantino version of TCM?Anyway personally I prefer TCM 4 over LEATHERFACE TCM 3 which is just plain bad and is the worst movie of this bizarre socalled series. At least TCM 4 is so consciously bad that even if it's an almost total embarrassment to the two first films it's actually fun to watch if you're looking for something to laugh at or with something that's insanely wacky full of energy and 100 OVERTHETOP! As a straightforward film TCM 4 rates at a big fat ZERO. But as a it's so bad it's good movie TCM 4 rates a perfect 10. It's ranks up there along with GLEN OR GLENDA PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE TERROR IN THE JUNGLE and THE LEGEND OF LYLAH CLARE as the very best of the worst.".

For me this sums up everything I like about this movie.The TCM series has  at the best of times  been about random violence...usually for the sake of sensationalism.  But underneath it all is the creepy realization that not everybody thinks like you do.  Some of them do things which make no sense to you.  When you step into their reality you're at their mercy and you'll never understand exactly why.This installment plays the why? theme to the hilt eventually copping out somewhat near the end when they should have just left us wondering. Darla is wonderful as Vilmer's girlfriend alternately getting hung up about seemingly trivial things  having a quiet dinner for a change  and goading Vilmer into continuing their twisted mutually abusive relationship. Vilmer himself has fantastic moments though none of the actors quite live up to Perensky  Zellweger's standards of convincing nuttiness and terror respectively.  Though Newmyer is also great in a role which is too small.Outside of the mayhem there's some wonderful dialogue especially the first few lines in the movie the teacher who simpers around the students and then gripes f I hate kids.  Heather's friend with the absolutely bizarre mannerisms explaining that the gossipmonger is just trying to cause trouble.  Heather saying that they might end up slaughtered and hidden away in somebody's basement with Sean retorting that's stupid the houses around here don't have basements.  And finally my favourite line Too bad about her face Leather but you can have her shoes!Despite all the bad press this movie's received I hope Kim Henkel enjoys what she created as much as I enjoy watching it.  Goofy funny real unreal terrifying and witty good job.".

Once they make about 3 or 4 movies you're a moron if you're expecting an Oscar worthy film. Matthew McConaughey is INCREDIBLE AS A PSYCHO! His lines are delivered so INSANELY mind the pun! PERFECT that you wonder if he really is a bit nutty in real life. The things he says cracks me up. When he runs over the character Sean with his tow truck saying Yep that shoulda done' it... that shoulda done it riiiight there. I just laugh so incredibly hard at how crazy he is throughout the entire movie. You have to let go of your cirtical Siskel  Ebert serious side  just have some fun with this movie! The Next Generation isn't much for blood and guts like the original it more so focuses on demented psychopaths who live amongst body parts and filth and who torture for fun. They try to give you the meaning of HORROR even that crazyskinfleshnipplering guy admits that the whole psycho killer setup is  I quote appalling as far as horror goes. So there they admit it but the characters are still great in my opinion. But the scene with the prom kids in Darla's office is a load of laughs because Tonie Perensky portrays the hot psycho chick to a T. She's completely cool and collected about her lifestyle and just pulls off the greatest pinup type homicidal bimbo character ever. And she manages to still look hot despite almost getting choked to death by a TV remote controlled leg and smacked around a few times by Vilmer. Renee is EXCELLENT as the virginal victim who unlike most innocent horror movie victims who do the stereotypical running up the stairs when they should be running out of the front door Renee gets some courage to climb a 3 story roof swing from a cable line jump out of a window  is even brave enough to point in Leather's face and tell him to SIT THE FCK DOWN! GO JENNY! Jenny's friend Heather is a little annoying with her little girl voice and airhead paranoia but she acknowledges the error of her ways and ultimately gets the grossest punishments. So we can pardon her! The only one I can say that really didn't impress me was Leather himself. This if the first Texas CM movie I've seen where Leather runs around pulling at his hair and screaming endlessly like a little girl instead of getting down to some real deal chainsaw business. After a few minutes of them introducing Leather continuously screaming like a sissy you're looking for the MUTE button on your remote. This movie doesn't lose the original concept of the Ed Gein theme by showing briefly the womanskin suit hanging behind a bathroom door however in this TCM movie we get to see Leather decked out for dinner in a fancy gown red lipstick and a black wig he must have stolen from Tina Turner.All in all I really find this movie entertaining and think that Matthew and Renee got off to a GREAT start with these characters. I give it 1 thumbs up! ".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this movie. I liked it in whole and in parts  meaning I enjoyed the film as a whole and have watched it several times inflicting it on various friends... but there were touches in it that really creeped me and that isn't something that happens every day. The film is your basic teenagers on the way home from the prom get lost and stuck and run into spooky family in the middle of nowhere  mayhem ensues. Actually this is the movie I thought of fondly when I first heard about House of 1000 Corpses. I like this movie much better and not just because I REALLY want to bring it to a Matthew McConaghy Fan Club movie night.SPOILERSIt's the details that make this movie. The wall of drivers' licenses that you can see in the background in one room of the creepy family's house which implies they've been at this for a while. The filthy bathroom where you can't see the human skin hanging on the back of the door until you're already inside with the door closed.I've always found it hard to imagine a female villain character who actually works in a movie like this unless she's either essentially browbeaten and incapable of individual action or is utterly irredeemably psychotic. This movie has a creepy female character who both casually flashes passersby from her office window explaining only that she just got implants and everyone seems to want to see them and flirts with cops while she has a girl tied up in her trunk. She also gives a variety of weird conspiracy theoryish explanations for why she goes along with what the spooky family does.Most unusual of all is the weird guy in the limousine who shows up for no particular reason and implies that he put these people here for some reason  presumably to generate exactly the type of urban legends they are generating  and who might be.... Satan? Some underling anyway. Maybe Ranger Asmodeus from Equinox has a cousin. ..The movie left me wondering  in the best possible way. Not the usual why did they make this? or how could they have thought this was good? But instead who is that guy? Does he have other enclaves of evil out there just waiting for his visits? and that woman  was she a victim at one point who talked her way into joining them as a survival mechanism and then convinced herself that it was OK? Ya know?".

I liked it in whole and in parts  meaning I enjoyed the film as a whole and have watched it several times inflicting it on various friends... but there were touches in it that really creeped me and that isn't something that happens every day. The film is your basic teenagers on the way home from the prom get lost and stuck and run into spooky family in the middle of nowhere  mayhem ensues. Actually this is the movie I thought of fondly when I first heard about House of 1000 Corpses. I like this movie much better and not just because I REALLY want to bring it to a Matthew McConaghy Fan Club movie night.SPOILERSIt's the details that make this movie. The wall of drivers' licenses that you can see in the background in one room of the creepy family's house which implies they've been at this for a while. The filthy bathroom where you can't see the human skin hanging on the back of the door until you're already inside with the door closed.I've always found it hard to imagine a female villain character who actually works in a movie like this unless she's either essentially browbeaten and incapable of individual action or is utterly irredeemably psychotic.

The craptasical nature of this movie combined with the COMPLETE seriousness with which it is delivered is perfect.

	schema:reviewBody "The third sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is now more famous for starring Matthew McConaughey and Rene Zellweger neither of whom at the time the film was made knew better than to accept such trashy roles. The film begins by asking us to care about a group of teens who leave their prom due to a couple having a fight and end up lost in the woods. This mere minutes after having driven away from their high school which presumably resides in their hometown. Clearly they have not learned their way around much but no matter. Before too long they very soon find themselves running for their lives away from the famous freaky family not only lost in their home town but before long also without their car. One of the biggest gripes that people have with this film which is saying a lot because there is nothing but stuff to gripe about is that Leatherface seems to have become a transvestite. You can almost watch the transformation in the film which seems to me to be sort of the result of trying to make Leatherface too complex. There is a point in the film where the trapped Jenny Zellweger tries to get Leatherface to help her escape talking to him exactly like a psychiatrist would talk to a disturbed child.Come on we know Leatherface is disturbed I just don't understand why crossdressing had to be added to his impressive list of deviations from the pattern of behaviors generally associated with reasonably welladjusted people. On the other hand Kim Henkel did cowrite the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Tobe Hooper and has thus been granted at least some right to tamper with the character. What you see in the movie however is a lot of tampering gone horribly horribly wrong. If it ain't broken as they say don't fix it. You may end up making it worse.What is amazing to me is how far McConaughey and Zellweger have both come in spite of this film. As I was watching the film I couldn't believe I was watching the same actor who had turned in such wonderful performances in movies like Bridget Jones' Diary and Cold Mountain as well as another actor who displayed strong acting presence in movies like EdTV and U571. Why the focus on Leatherface being a transvestite? Leatherface is a side character anyway it is Vilmer McConaughey who is the star which is sad because he plays such a belligerent disgusting character. If you don't believe me that he's more the star than Leatherface count how many people Leatherface or anyone else kills with a chainsaw in the movie hint none.Vilmer is the new head of household in the backwoods family working as a towtruck driverreckless murderer and who has the fascinating addition of an electric leg that is operated by remote control. At one point a high school kid pleads for help then when he realizes Vilmer's one of the bad guys he runs away from the truck running straight down the street rather than into the woods to relative safety of course Vilmer gleefully chases him down laughing and hooting and hollering all the while and then runs him over five or six times before stashing his body on the back of the truck to later taunt one of his little friends with.As is to be expected there is never any motive given behind any of the random killings this is all just the sickening actions of an insane family in the woods evidently comfortably separate from any sort of law enforcement or even the most tenuous interaction with greater civilization waiting for unsuspecting teenagers to stumble into their midst. Interesting that the movie starts out as such a gigantic horror movie clich and still manages to go downhill from there.Horror movie sequels are first faced with the usually daunting task of justifying themselves. A horror movie sequel has to have a premise that gives it a reason for having been made otherwise it is clearly a cash cow made to cash in on the success of the original film. Texas Chainsaw 4 instead simply passes itself off as something of a remake of the original rather than another sequel and turns from the more plodding and slowmoving original to the mindless completely overthetop belligerence that you see here. The scenes at the house are peppered with stupid violence at one point Vilmer throws Darla to the ground and steps on her neck with his powerful leg nearly killing her by suffocation or by breaking her neck clearly not caring which. Naturally she gets up and complains that she could easily leave him and go back to her husband. Charming. Add cannibalism to the mix and you have a hilariously bad movie. Jenny spends much of the latter half of the movie trying to escape from the hungry hungry hicks as we are constantly bombarded with the stupid stupid characters and plot twists that the movie makes as it ineptly tries to combine the horror and comedy that even the most mildly competent horror film can display. This is exactly the kind of thing that really makes me wonder why every time a new movie comes out in a certain series I always go back and watch the whole series before watching it. I'm still working on The Friday the 13th movies the Nightmares on Elm Street and the Child's Play films which are decidedly more fun than the Texas Chainsaws. And to make matters worse I have heard nothing but bad things about the 2003 Texas Chainsaw. And given how right all the bad reviews of this movie are that is certainly a sinking feeling.".

I preferred the trailer park babe who was constantly making references to her fake breasts. She was funny.  The movie did go downhill with the arrival of the freak in the limo.  It became very disjointed.  So did all of the others though.  All TCM movies have always been about one subject...mindless violence and shock value.If you didn't like it...fine.  I was disappointed that the two main characters are embarrassed about making the movie.  It's not something to be proud of no.  But it is still a piece of film that they got paid for. Also a break that they were given as unknown actors. Just goes to show that once actors make it to the top they forget the mere humans at the bottom that boosted them up.".

Lisa Marie Newmeyer puts in a memorable role as the mindless Prom queen and has some of the funniest lines since Clueless and Renee Zellweger is great as the mousey Jenny who goes from classroom geek to feisty survivor and gives the cannibal clan a good run for their money. It's all very purposely retro a film that would have been top notch in the 70's slasher era...when the characters sprout lines like..My flashlight's dead or Hello? Is someone there walk into old houses in the middle of the woods and split up to get help you know that the director Kim Henkel wanted to capture the innocent horror of pre Scream times. It's a pity that he got lost somewhere after the first hour and added the senseless Rothman character...instead of staying classic and ending with a great chase scene he tried to make the story a little bit different. He should have stuck with the formula we've trusted for so long and one he'd delivered so far...still not a bad sequel...better than 2 much better!!!".

Nothing is spoon fed and the performances are up to snuff. Renee Zellweger and Matthew Mc Conaughy are excellent as the wall flower lead and Vilmer respectfully. When this movie was finally released it was badly edited and it had a virtually nonexistent release. It's a shame that people have to slam this movie. I found it quite entertaining.

I wish I could provide you with a more thought out opening paragraph but what else can I say?There is absolutely zero character development in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation. Due to this we really couldn't care less about what happens to the main characters. The film's logic free story consists of several high school students becoming lost in the depth of a wooded area where they stumble upon a sickening family of psychopaths that put new meaning to the word dysfunctional. There are two deaths in the film both of side characters. One is run over with a truck. The other has his neck broken. In a movie titled The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation one would expect gory murders a plentythough that is far from reality in this case. There is no blood no guts and no chainsaw killings. The Leatherface character does absolutely nothing in the film. Excuse me. He does do something. He dresses up like a woman and shrieks his chainsaw above his head while screaming wildly.Who are the villains? What do they want? What conceivable reasons do they have for living the lifestyle they inhabit? There are no answers provided. I am not necessarily stating that the majority of viewers will even care enough about the plot to even ask any questions. I am just backing up my theory of the terrible qualities this production contains.It is quite the surprise to witness some big names in the film's cast list such as Renee Zellweger and  Matthew McConaughey. Neither of the two are capable of rescuing the movie nor are they able to perform with fine dramatic tension. What a complete waste of talent director and writer Kim Henkel constructs with this piece of trash.After screening The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I love movies so much but this socalled movie is a disgrace to all film's associated with. It is so hard to understand what the individual's intentions were when they produced this heap of garbage. Did the filmmakers desire to give movies a bad name? Or did they actually believe The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation was worth a penny? After seeing this movie's poster and seeing the tagline Still Buzzing After All These Years I had a question for it. Why is the series still buzzing when it ran out of fuel long before this film was made?".

	schema:reviewBody "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a terrible film. I knew going in it would be nothing like the original and was completely fine with that but this movie goes out of its way to be as ridiculous as possible. The genuine scares from the original have been replaced by awkward comedic bits from the cannibal family's bickering to Leatherface making silly faces yeah they had the audacity to turn Leatherface into a punchline. It's just embarrassing and this is largely due to an inconsistent script. The first act sets an ominous tone from its premise of hearing a murder live on the radio and the radio host being terrorized by the same murderers. Then the second act is silly borderline cartoonish with Leatherface acting like a hormonal teenager and the third act tries to pay homage to the original by recreating the dinner scene almost exactly as it was in the first but not nearly as effective combined with an admittedly cool chainsaw duel between Lefty Dennis Hopper and Leatherface then closing with a somewhat thrilling final struggle for the heroine to make her escape. Then it closes with another homage to the original and then credits roll and a cheesy '80s pop song ensues. If not for the second act it had potential to be an engrossing story and potentially disturbing the gore is still topnotch but the drastic shifts in tone make it virtually impossible to become immersed into this overtly fake cartoonish world.Thankfully Tobe Hooper's directing makes even the dullest moments of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 aesthetically pleasing. The location and set design is perfect  the underground lair with brightly colored lights juxtaposed with rotting corpses and leftover entrails is oddly unsettling and the scenery during the final moments of the movie is hauntingly beautiful. Hooper knows how to make these scenes look as gritty and urgent as possible. Dennis Hopper's Texas ranger was also a welcome addition. He was related to Franklin of the first movie and is out for revenge on these hillbillies so he buys the biggest chainsaw he can then storms their lair screaming his lungs out like a lunatic.What ultimately killed this movie for me aside from the script is the lead actress. She is just awful. You can't take anything she says seriously because of how poorly she delivers her lines and her screams are so forced and annoying I was practically rooting for Leatherface to chop her head off. Her relationship with Leatherface is also forced and awkward but maybe that was the screenwriters' attempt at comedy. There are a couple laughs in this movie and by that I mean two three max. Something about the bombastic chainsaw duel is undeniably exhilarating despite it not being fleshed out to its full potential.There is some fun to be had in this movie but you have to suffer through a lot of stupidity to get there. I have no idea how sequels continued coming out after this and I can even empathize why they would want to make a sequel reboot with Texas Chainsaw 3D but that was even more abominable than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's true sequel  this  and this is pretty darn bad. This movie is for Leatherface completists only.".

	schema:reviewBody "Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 when it was released in theaters back in 1986. I loved this horror flick then. But everyone else hated it. Critics trashed it. Even many horror fans of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre or slashers in general hated it and dismissed it. Now after a decade or so after its release TCM 2 is now a bona fide cult movie.There are so many things to point out why TCM 2 is a standout. The first and most important thing to point out is that back in the 1980s horror films were reduced to simple slashers. TCM 2 is totally different than the plethora of slashers that many horror fans expected to see which is one reason why many horror fans didn't get it. The body count is extremely low in TCM 2 compared to the Friday the 13th or Elm Street flicks. But that doesn't mean it's not violent. No it's VERY violent. But the violence in TCM 2 is more engrossing shocking and even at times funny and in turn less acceptable than the unreal violence found in many slasher films. Because of the amount of violence and violent imagery films critics trashed TCM 2 pointing out how the first film didn't rely on gore and violence to scare the audience.I love Texas Chainsaw Massacre as much as I love TCM 2. I understand what the critics were saying. Unfortunately they didn't get the point of the violence in TCM 2. While TCM is a sweat inducing TERRIFYING horror film in the first order TCM 2 is a GRAND GUIGNOL HORROR horror film in the first order. In TCM 2 Hooper creates a vast canvas of baroque imagery where we watch the insane and gory story unfold before our incredulous eyes. I'm amazed that critics missed the whole difference between TCM and TCM 2. It's odd that critics will rave about Peter Greenaway's THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE  HER LOVER which is a twisted drama in the the Grand Guignol style but didn't see TCM 2 in the same way. It's probably due to the fact that TCM 2 is a sequel to a quasilegendary horror film and everyone expected the sequel to be the same as the first movie.I give credit to everyone involved with TCM 2. They actually TRIED to do something different different from the equally great TCM different from the increasingly boring horror films of the 80s. And in my eye they've succeeded. There are so many memorable scenes in TCM 2 some of which are the most amazing horror moments ever put on screen when Leatherface tries to put the scalped face on Stretch the scene when Stretch finds her friend sans face etc. And there are so many quotable lines too. TCM 2 is also a very funny film Rain rain rain rain... Choptop says as he checks out records at the radio station.TCM 2 is not perfect. The ending is abrupt. And the chainsaw fight at the end is too short. Dennis Hopper is a bit hard to take as a hero. But he does play the twisted hero right. It's just difficult to see him fighting big and burly Leatherface. BTW the very last image of TCM 2 is Strecth dancing with a chainsaw in her hands at the top of that amusement park structure. In the original film and the original video release we can see cars and trucks driving by on a highway in the distance. On the DVD they cropped this shot and we don't see the traffic anymore. Personally I thought it added a LOT to the whole surreal aspect of the film. Like the world was continuing on with its relentless pace no matter what had just happened that night. I wished they didn't crop this shot on the DVD. Oh well...It's a shame few people got TCM 2 back then. After reading the reviews at IMDb and at Amazon it's great to see that some are finally getting it. For anyone who's game watch TCM 2. You'll be squealing in horror and laughing at the insanity of it all in equal amounts.".

	schema:headline " Dog will hunt!";
	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer Do NOT try to remove your hemorrhoids with a chainsaw. It will NOT save you a trip to the hospital.spoilers OK let me tell you why the Texas Chainsaw sequels don't work. The original film is slightly exempt from this but when you have someone who is screaming and wiggling so much that you wish she would just get killed so she'll shut the hell up you have lost your ability to scare. Doesn't matter how good the sets or costumes or actors are if the audience is holding their ears you have a problem.The first sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is meant to be nothing other than a bigger version of the original this time fictionalized and beefed up with the star power of Dennis Hopper. Not that the original was nonfiction. As you know it was really based very loosely as it were on the inhuman antics of Ed Gein in the 1950s the same demented nutcase that inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. Sounds like a fun guy.Unfortunately as is all too often the case with horror movies this one comes off more as a sick comedy than a scary movie. Granted there are horror movies that purposely come out like that such as most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies but the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a movie that caught people off guard because of its simplicity its unknown cast and its rough documentary feel. In Texas Chainsaw 2 every single little bit of that is lost.The set once we eventually get underground looks like they rented the Indiana Jones set festooned it with randomly placed naked light bulbs furniture made out of human bones and meat hooks and had Leatherface run around swinging a chainsaw. The atmosphere of the movie has completely lost the claustrophobic feel of the original by vastly expanding the size of the set much of which looks like a Christmas tree crossed with an esophagus and there is just too much hooting and hollering for it to be scary. The only thing more irritating than the killers is their victim 'Stretch.'The movie starts off with a couple of high school caricatures zooming down a desert highway screaming at each other at the tops of their lungs about the sheer magnitude of the party that they are on their way to. They decide to swing into oncoming traffic to play chicken with someone driving a pickup truck instantly making me eager to see them get killed. Doesn't matter that Leatherface is in that truck anyone who plays chicken with a random driver because they're driving around drunk deserves to get killed. And if it takes place in a movie they deserve to get killed with a chainsaw.So not only do we have to endure the hooting and hollering of these two jerks but they call a radio station and we are asked to believe that this station's phones get completely tied up if someone calling in refuses to hang up. Sure this is rural Texas and 1986 but are we to believe that even out there and back then there were radio stations with a single phone line and without the ability to cut off the callers? At one point the clueless tech guy is frantically pushing buttons and pulling levers trying to figure out how to clear the line. Given something so stupid however you know it was there for a reason so that they could record the phone call as the kids get chainsawed on the other end. Speaking of which the same kid that swerved into oncoming traffic at full speed finds himself stopped on a bridge as that same pickup truck sits blocking both lanes and he frantically screams 'Are you crazy?!?' out the windshield while his idiot friend in the passenger seat offers such heroic tips as 'Just keep driving!' and 'Get outta here!' Good thinking'! Speaking of driving not only can they not outrun a pickup truck traveling in reverse while supposedly holding the pedal to the floor in their Mercedes but in the shots that show Leatherface standing and swinging his chainsaw they are literally traveling all of 5mph.Dennis Hopper plays the uncle of the kids who were killed in the original movie sort of a rogue detective out of his jurisdiction and showing up at the scene of the two kids' murder. The police refuse to jump to conclusions but Lefty Hopper is sure that it's the same people who killed his nieces and nephews. Hopper makes a GREAT redneck. I generally am truly disappointed when actors take on fake accents but Hopper does this one so well that you would swear he's lived in the south his entire life it's just too bad that he's saddled with this idiot character.At one point Stretch the radio station DJ shows up at his apartment which needless to say is flooded with drunken rednecks wandering the halls with their arms around each other and tells him that she has an audiotape of the murder because the kids called in just before they were attacked and he sends her away! What the hell is that? Later he has a change of heart but only wants to hear it if she'll play it on the air. The logic of the characters' actions in this movie is not starting off on the right foot. Then later as Stretch hangs in a pit about to fall into the demons' lair you might say he tries to save her with a brittle dried out arm bone. Clever.There is a lengthy horror scene inside the radio station which looks like it doesn't know if it's supposed to be a radio station or a horror movie set so better just be a little bit of both. It's got its vast storage of records stored safely behind an open door with a heavy steel door guarding the cleaning supplies. A burglar's dream you might say. We get a scene where Leatherface is assigned to kill Stretch but when he finally gets through that steel door he starts chainsawing a tub of soda cans sitting in ice which have no reason for being there or for being chainsawed until finally Stretch screams 'Are you mad at me??' and my eyes glaze over for the remainder of the film.There's an effective scene where Leatherface puts Stretch's friend's freshly removed face over hers supposedly to help her escape but for the most part the underground portion of the film is a tired rehash of the original. Sure it's bigger there are more Christmas lights and more chainsaws but essentially it's exactly the same thing just without the surprise. They even replay exactly the same dinner scene from the end of the last movie the most unpleasant scene in the entire movie. Lefty decides that he is so intent on delivering swift poetic justice that rather than stock up on as many guns as he can carry he buys three huge chainsaws and straps them to his body and then runs screaming into the house yelling and cutting down wooden supports as the family tortures Stretch. In Commando Arnold bulldozes into a weapons store and loads up on boatloads of guns and knives and explosives. In The Terminator he does the same thing with the added bonus of killing off the proprietor before leaving. Lefty could have paid homage to both of those films establishing Lefty as a good guy since he actually paid for his. But why saws and not guns? The grandparents as is to be expected are a hideous hideous spectacle. Grandpa's 137 years old and still likes to hammer young girls on the head and grandma spends her time in a wheelchair upstairs with a chainsaw on her lap. We are treated to a finale atop a huge rock outcropping that is so fake that it almost turns the movie into a comedy all by itself. There is at least one or two shots where the underlying chicken wire is nakedly visible.We get some sort of variation on the ending of the original since the conclusion is almost a mirror image in that the girl becomes the chainsaw wielding maniac rather than looking at him out the back window of a passing motorist but I'm not sure what line of discussion led to the conclusion that this would be a cool way to end the film. Is this supposed to be the setup for a sequel? The family's dead but now there's this girl who has caught chainsaw fever and will now carry on the legacy?".

	onyx:emotionText "Disclaimer Do NOT try to remove your hemorrhoids with a chainsaw. It will NOT save you a trip to the hospital.spoilers OK let me tell you why the Texas Chainsaw sequels don't work. The original film is slightly exempt from this but when you have someone who is screaming and wiggling so much that you wish she would just get killed so she'll shut the hell up you have lost your ability to scare. Doesn't matter how good the sets or costumes or actors are if the audience is holding their ears you have a problem.The first sequel in the Texas Chainsaw series is meant to be nothing other than a bigger version of the original this time fictionalized and beefed up with the star power of Dennis Hopper. Not that the original was nonfiction. As you know it was really based very loosely as it were on the inhuman antics of Ed Gein in the 1950s the same demented nutcase that inspired Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. Sounds like a fun guy.Unfortunately as is all too often the case with horror movies this one comes off more as a sick comedy than a scary movie. Granted there are horror movies that purposely come out like that such as most of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies but the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a movie that caught people off guard because of its simplicity its unknown cast and its rough documentary feel. In Texas Chainsaw 2 every single little bit of that is lost.The set once we eventually get underground looks like they rented the Indiana Jones set festooned it with randomly placed naked light bulbs furniture made out of human bones and meat hooks and had Leatherface run around swinging a chainsaw. The atmosphere of the movie has completely lost the claustrophobic feel of the original by vastly expanding the size of the set much of which looks like a Christmas tree crossed with an esophagus and there is just too much hooting and hollering for it to be scary. The only thing more irritating than the killers is their victim 'Stretch.'The movie starts off with a couple of high school caricatures zooming down a desert highway screaming at each other at the tops of their lungs about the sheer magnitude of the party that they are on their way to. They decide to swing into oncoming traffic to play chicken with someone driving a pickup truck instantly making me eager to see them get killed. Doesn't matter that Leatherface is in that truck anyone who plays chicken with a random driver because they're driving around drunk deserves to get killed. And if it takes place in a movie they deserve to get killed with a chainsaw.So not only do we have to endure the hooting and hollering of these two jerks but they call a radio station and we are asked to believe that this station's phones get completely tied up if someone calling in refuses to hang up. Sure this is rural Texas and 1986 but are we to believe that even out there and back then there were radio stations with a single phone line and without the ability to cut off the callers? At one point the clueless tech guy is frantically pushing buttons and pulling levers trying to figure out how to clear the line. Given something so stupid however you know it was there for a reason so that they could record the phone call as the kids get chainsawed on the other end. Speaking of which the same kid that swerved into oncoming traffic at full speed finds himself stopped on a bridge as that same pickup truck sits blocking both lanes and he frantically screams 'Are you crazy?!?' out the windshield while his idiot friend in the passenger seat offers such heroic tips as 'Just keep driving!' and 'Get outta here!' Good thinking'! Speaking of driving not only can they not outrun a pickup truck traveling in reverse while supposedly holding the pedal to the floor in their Mercedes but in the shots that show Leatherface standing and swinging his chainsaw they are literally traveling all of 5mph.Dennis Hopper plays the uncle of the kids who were killed in the original movie sort of a rogue detective out of his jurisdiction and showing up at the scene of the two kids' murder.

Every scare is telegraphed nothing is a surprise. Leatherface dances around more with the chainsaw then cutting anyone. It's really idiotic. The performances aren't much better than your local churches haunted house on Halloween.First we're supposed to believe a radio station can't hang up on a caller unless the caller does first? I think the FCC would have something to say about that. It'd be impossible to censor any obscene calls that way. Also what exactly does the tape reveal that Chop Top and Leatherface need to show up and silence the girl about? Some screams and a chainsaw noise. Yeah that really points out their identities and existence. A damn autopsy would reveal the cause of death was power tool. Beyond that there's NOTHING linking them. Texas is a damn big state. And as the prologue indicates after the first girl was found alive the authorities found NOTHING to prove the events had happened. Plus they could have just torched the place when they left the girl if they really wanted to be sure.I watched it a second time last night and I have to say it's gotten dumber.

The police try to make their deaths seem like a simple auto accident but when a former Texas Ranger Lefty Dennis Hopper sees the accident scene he knows it was more than an accident.

So it had to live up to the modern day slasher film that means more blood. It's a lot more gory than the controversial first TCM. In this one you literally see a guy get skinned alive his face is almost peeled off for Leatherface to use as a mask. Oh and the family is explored more in this sequel. Jim Siedow reprises the role of The Cook Drayton Sawyer. He now sells chili to the fine people of Texas. He proclaims at a local cook off that it's his special secret recipe. Take a guess what he uses to make the chili....Yeah so as you can see TCM 2 is a little more morbid and comical in a black comedy sort of way. The maze that Stretch gets trapped in near the end is an old amusement park that the Sawyers are living in. Very creepy set they built for it as well. The acting is pretty good for this one as well. We also discover Dennis Hopper's character is related to Franklin the man in the wheelchair from the first TCM. Nice little connection. All in all a decent sequel to a 70's classic. It's not as memorable as the first or even as good but a fine slasher film nonetheless.710".

This film is not scary twisted or upsetting.THE SETTING Leatherface and his sick family have moved out of their house in TCM1 and have relocated at an amusement park! And not just any amusement park it has seemingly endless lattice of tunnels and brightlylit caverns underneath. It's hard to feel afraid of what is clearly a bad movie set.THE VILLAIN I'll start with Leatherface. In TCM1 Leatherface is a barbaric violent villain a sick effedup killing MACHINE. Here Leatherface wields his chainsaw at a 'pretty' ? girl falls in love with her and becomes a BIG OLD SOFTY. He turns into Ludo the Lovable Oaf from Labyrinth or for Harry Potter fans Grawp. I'm sorry but WHAT THE ? Is this a horror movie or a children's film??? THE HEROINE Stretch is a radio DJ who wears little denim shorts but as the face of a goat. She is also the stupidest heroine I've ever met in a horror film. She actively pursues the villains to their base with no plan and without contacting the police and falls right into their hands. It's hard to care about her suffering when she so clearly deserves it for being such a fool.THE HERO Dennis Hopper like his female counterpart also decides to take on the villains singlehandedly. He buys a bunch of chainsaws and goes after them on his own. Yep  strapping a few chainsaws to your back like Rambo is a GREAT survival technique.Now I love horror movies and I LOVE horror sequels  even bad ones. But this is neither good nor sobadit'sgood. It's just plain bad and most importantly  NOT SCARY.".

This film is not scary twisted or upsetting.THE SETTING Leatherface and his sick family have moved out of their house in TCM1 and have relocated at an amusement park! And not just any amusement park it has seemingly endless lattice of tunnels and brightlylit caverns underneath. It's hard to feel afraid of what is clearly a bad movie set.THE VILLAIN I'll start with Leatherface. In TCM1 Leatherface is a barbaric violent villain a sick effedup killing MACHINE. Here Leatherface wields his chainsaw at a 'pretty' ? girl falls in love with her and becomes a BIG OLD SOFTY. He turns into Ludo the Lovable Oaf from Labyrinth or for Harry Potter fans Grawp.

It kind of makes you realise that the whole film came about in the same way. The ideas were put to paper a little too fast there wasn't enough time just having it sit in the writers head growing and becoming refined.The nest part of the intro the ten minutes with the frat boys shooting signs and then playing chicken with the wrong hill billies was awful and leaves a bad taste in your mouth that pretty much sticks around for the rest of the movie. The tone and pace of the whole sequence is so different to the rest of the film it just doesn't even fit in right and a much better reintroduction of the maniacal family was really in order.The comical bits were pretty stupid as if that was the direction they wanted to go in it should've been very dark humour...It could've been very disturbingly funny. The end scene in the original with the grandpa trying to bludgeon the girl with the hammer is pretty powerful one of the few scenes in any movie that scares me a little it feels like your in the same messed up situation. The end scene in this is just....meh.If the film was more dark the final shot in this mirroring the final shot of leather face in the first. Again would've been powerful and really effective.Bill Moseley asking if the tape was from the Rambo 3 soundtrack was retarded not just because the movie only came out two years after this I just looked that up didn't know it off the top of my head which could've still made sense and is not necessarily a goof. But it doesn't make sense that the family would know what Rambo was as they are segregated from society and only the dad interacts with other people.I liked the chilli cook off idea. That worked well with the black humour theme it's just too bad everything else they tried didn't.Once again Tobe Hooper shows of his ability to shot the exterior's of buildings really well. Actually I think many of his shots in this were good. Just the script killed it self.510".

The sound of the killing is caught on tape by radio DJtype lady 'Stretch' who Lefty uses as bait to lure Leatherface out of the shadows. The trail leads to the labyrinthine catacombs beneath an abandoned amusement park for an epic showdown that doesn't really happen.The problem begins with the second half in which Dennis Hopper seems to wander off into a different movie and nothing really becomes of his character while Stretch runs screaming from a horny Leatherface. It's a bit disappointing in this regard but the wonderful setdesign and gore effects keep it interesting. I just wish that there was more fodder for the titular chainsaw.A lot of people consider this to be a spoof but I don't think so myself. Horror moviemaking had changed a lot by this point in the 80s. With slashers and the tools of their trade gaining popularity the genre moved away from gritty grindhouse darkness and into something more colorful and mainstream for better or worse. TCM2 is just a reflection of that. It's trash but it's highly energetic and manic trash that's never boring despite its shortcomings.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film with good intentions. Although the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre was hokey and low budget it was a fine horror film and had good characters. The family was terrific. However this movie was downright awful. I am still in awe of the badness of this film.First off what happened to their house? Somehow they went from a little home in the middle of nowhere in Texas to some sort of underground death theme park. It didn't make any sense and it was stupid. Leatherface falls in love with the DJ or some small radio station and one of the family members has a METAL PLATE in his head. There were too many unintentional laughs in this movie to make it worth your while. At times it was downright awkward watching this movie.I think the script for this movie must have been about 3 pages long because everything anyone said was just repeated a hundred times over and over again until I wanted to shoot the TV. In this movie the family isn't even exciting. They are annoying and pathetic and the one guy with the metal plate just laughs throughout the entire movie. It's awful. Everything about this movie it awful.The real kicker for me though was that in the first movie Leatherface was never reffered to as Leatherface because his real name is Bubba but his family in TCM 2 actually called him Leatherface. I couldn't handle it.Whatever you do don't see this movie. It was just horrible. Worst thing I have ever seen.".

Basically I ask why? How?OK. Maybe it isn't THAT bad.  I remember renting this with 2 of my friends a couple of years ago.  Disbelief abounded.  That is the best way I can express laconically the reaction to the sequel to the cult classic TCM. Disbelief as to how the characters could be so corny the dialogue so bad the plot so incredibly paper thin.  In all honesty it was so bad it was hilarious and we have since on many occasions recalled some of the films's more memorable scenes such as the one in the beginning when a poor young college boy gets a generous portion of his head sliced off by ole Leatherface himself despite the fact that he's behind the wheel of a speedy 4x4 and you would think that he would do whatever it took to prevent his brain from being hacked open like a ripe apple like maybe ducking.  Also the acting by the lead actress was decent.It was nice I guess to see Dennis Hopper in this film but I would seriously question his sincerity if he told me personally that the TCM2 was just the dignity injection that his career needed.1 out of 10.".

This movie didn't seem like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre film at all it was just some plain corny gory flick. One reason is because a lot of it was taken place in a radio station so the isolation and helplessness that all the other films contain is gone. It seemed like half the movie is Leatherface and ChopTop chasing this radio host around the radio station which got old really quick. Then it turns out the family's home is a maze of caverns that was formerly a Texas state national park each tunnel being decorated with lights furniture and corpses. The biggest problem that I have with the film though is that it lost all similarities with the original film which I consider to be the best horror film of all time. It's much more comical and much less serious. The powerful grainy realistic aura of the original film is completely lost this film is more of a quirky freak show of the Sawyer family. It doesn't match up with the terrifying original.Bottom line is Mr. Hooper lost what the rest of these films had  the sense of isolation in the Texas country and the serious realistic attitude that made the original movie so scary. This film is in my opinion the worst sequel of the series. If you're going to see this just don't expect anything close to the original. I think that may be the reason I didn't like it as much I had no idea that it was so different. 510.".

Simultaneously using Stretch as bait and protecting her from the Sawyers is bugeyed weirdo Dennis Hopper playing the demented chainsaw packing sheriff and uncle to one of the previous films unfortunate victims.This movie is definitely played for comedy black as it may be. It's almost a retelling of the first tale as Stretch runs screaming through the Sawyers underground abode only to end up bent over a washtub while Grandpa feebly whacks away at her head with a hammer. There's a great chainsawaspenis scene where Leatherface suddenly discovers sex and orgasms and promptly loses interest in chainsawing Stretch to death. There's also a hideous hammer murder and a gruesome defacing scene just so you don't forget that no matter how hilarious this movie is still about overthetop gore mutilations cannibalism and fates worse than death.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a cult classic and since Tobe Hooper returns to the director's chair you might think this would be a decent sequel. You'd be dead wrong.When Tobe Hooper directed the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre he did it on a shoestring budget. It ended up being a cult classic and the low budget gave it a style all its own. He was given a much bigger budget for this sequel. What he does wrong is take his big budget and try to make it look as low budget as the first film. This doesn't give it style it makes it look ridiculous. The other big problem is that this movie was turned into a comedy when it should have been horror. The family is now a bunch of bumbling fools including Leatherface. Leatherface was originally an inhuman killing machine but now he has mercy toward a woman he's supposed to kill because he's horny. The plot and dialogue are absolutely ridiculous.The acting is atrocious. Dennis Hopper is usually okay for a bmovie actor but he is especially bad in this movie. The female lead who's name I can't remember is pathetic. As I said before the cannibalistic family is played only for laughs now and it's really stupid.Overall The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 doesn't touch the original film or the remake.

	schema:headline " Charming little film with Sidney Poitier as an itinerant handyman in rural Arizona.";
	schema:reviewBody "This charming black and white film testifies to the power of faith.  Five nuns who escaped over the Wall from East Germany are trying to start a new life in rural Arizona.  Mother Superior played by Lilia Skala believes that Homer Smith played by Sidney Poitier has been sent by God to build a chapel.  Smith demurs.  He is a Baptist who isn't really religious.  He would rather eat a big breakfast at Juan's played by Stanley Adams cafe than go to church behind the makeshift altar on Father Murphy's played by Dan Frazer pickup truck.  The father describes religion graphically for Smith.  Welcome to the Poor Man's Vatican he says as he ushers Smith into his small trailer home.  You take confession provide absolution bless the babies hook up the trailer kick the tires and pray. . .pray that the old car holds together to the next stop.Faith permeates this film and it is catching.  Mother Superior shows her faith in Smith as she introduces him to Mr. Ashton a big local contractor. Ashton was played by Director Ralph Nelson and is one of the more engaging characters in the film.  Interestingly it is Ashton's skepticism about Smith's ability to the job that persuades Smith to stay.  Mother Superior's faith ultimately is transmitted to the local Hispanic community and even Mr. Ashton.  Cafe owner Juan puts the issue very much in perspective when he says that his work on the chapel is about insurance.  He doesn't really believe in God he says but just in case there is a hereafter he wants to be prepared.The characterizations in this film are wonderful and deep.  There is a strain of stubbornness in both Mother Superior and Homer Smith.  It is a miracle they are able to work together.  Indeed Smith leaves the unfinished chapel behind for several weeks at one point.  Why don't you say thank you to me he asks the Mother Superior.  You couldn't help yourself she says.Homer Smith isn't quite sure of himself.  He is very uncomfortable in the role that Mother Superior sees for him.  Later when he returns to work on the chapel he stubbornly refuses the help of the locals.  He sees himself as the one chosen to build the chapel.  Mother Superior chides him as does Juan.  Where would you like us to bury you? he asks.  Ultimately the locals take over the project with disastrous results.  Homer steps in and directs the work to its completion.Homer's disappearance in the middle of the film is a mystery.  He has a problem with being the chosen one and drives away in his station wagon. When he returns the door on the passenger side is now wired shut.  He is also dressed in an obviously loud Hawaiian shirt.  His unusual dress is topped off by dark glasses.  It is like he has returned from a twoweek drunk.  When he goes to have his big breakfast in the cafe he wants very little to eat.Juan is one of my favorite characters in this film.  I liked Juan's homespun philosophy.  The scene in which Homer eats the big breakfast at the beginning of the film is very good.  The two characters are very much alike. Both came from religious families but neither are religious. Ultimately they are both empowered by faith.Like Juan Mr. Ashton is also a businessman.  He too is enriched by the building of the chapel.  He delivers a load of bricks for the chapel. When the Mother Superior calls out to him he remarks that he should have sent them anonymously.  On the way out he complains to Homer Smith that she won't let him alone now.  Such is the price of faith.Although it doesn't really go anywhere this film has the look and feel of a road movie.  The film begins with Homer Smith's car on a lonely road. Also there are the images of the nuns trekking down the miles of empty gravel road to Sunday morning services.  Father Murphy uses the road to go from one country club to another on his circuit.  The blessing of the chapel is that it will be a focal point for the community.  Father Murphy's church won't be on the road any longer.  But Homer Smith must go.  Mr. Ashton offers him a good job as a foreman but he declines.  He is a modern day tumbleweed going where the wind blows or more accurately where the road goes.There is a racial edge to this film.  Smith is black and the nuns are white.  Juan and the members of the community are Hispanic.  Father Murphy is white.  Ultimately all of these people come together to build the chapel.  One point in the film where race becomes overt is when Homer Smith meets Mr. Ashton.  Hey boy he says to Smith.  Smith quickly turns the tables on Ashton and calls him boy.  That seems to bridge the divide between them.  In the end it is Ashton who offers Smith a position of foreman.  In another scene Smith compares Mother Superior to Hitler. Later Mother Superior returns the compliment.  Ultimately both are able to go beyond their stubbornness and work together.This movie captures for me the special spirit of rural communities.  I never grow tired of watching it.".

I expected Father Flanagan to show up any minute.Instead we got a good Baptist man played by Sidney Poitier who won an Oscar for this performance. Since he's just about the whole movie and does a great job starttofinish who can argue with his award? This certainly doesn't have the feel of a 1960s film. It must have been one of the last of its kind giving credence to Christianity and having a nice tone throughout.

In fact his character is someone still looking for his path in life. Maybe some people might say that Poitier was essentially playing the same character that he always played but we have to remember that this was a total break from the Stepin Fetchit mold that had dominated the image of black people for so long so movies like Lilies of the Field were pretty important.

His works small in number were masterfully crafted inspirational tales of faith.

That is why it works so well  Barrett is a brilliant author and a master of the telling of belief in God.  He manages this without being preachy.potential spoiler  By contrast Barrett's other work The Left Hand of God is infinitely more complex in its story line  crammed with tension and suspense the very title gives a glimpse of its irony contained within. Its premise is based on a blasphemous assumption of someone else's identity by the main character.  And yet in the end  as with Lilies of the Field  it is simple faith that wins out.When these works are translated to the screen Lilies of the Field remains largely true to Barrett's book.  This is unfortunately NOT the case with Left Hand of God.  Forget that the great Bogart is the male lead.  Forget that it also contains the worthy Gene Tierney Agnes Moorehead Lee J Cobb E G Marshall.  These stars cannot overcome the heavyhanded hatchet job that was done to the script.  After all Lilies of the Field had only Sidney Poiter with any real name recognition and him not a whole lot yet. Rather it was the story that the superb if largely unknown cast was able to pull off.If you are a fan of Lilies of the Field I suggest that you do NOT see the movie Left Hand of God.

Yes there was reason for the Church to like the way in which the Sisters were portrayed but it was for their courage overall and not the strength of their faith that they were admirable.Second it is primarily a voice for tolerance that speaks here. Sidney Poitier's character is a competent confident wellassimilated American comfortable in his own country in spite of the prevailing prejudices against Negroes. He is portrayed  as in the novel  as a capable man with a true sense of honor and genuine noblesse oblige see Luke 1248 to understand what the nuns used to pound into us in school toward a flock of poor isolated and unacculturated foreign refugees in a bewildering land of size and desolation utterly alien to everything they had ever known.Third that the tolerance is extended by a member of a racial minority group for whom tolerance was being demanded at that time with all the Civil Rights movement baggage that makes a mockery of civil rights as a concept.... Well that was remarkable.Sidney Poitier's characterization of Homer Smith served not only as a model of how my generation of mainstream White kids grew up to look upon what a Black man could be  strong and shrewd practical and yet considerate of people in need  but also of what we should be as men. It gave us cause to think seriously about what would be demanded of us in our lives and how we would respond to those demands not for the good of other people but for the sake of our own sense of honor and manhood.And I suppose that the lesson of this film is that the mark of manhood is not in crazed bravery or blind faith or passion or outrage but in the strength of your promises and the commitment required to see them through.".

Lillies of the Field was up for Best Picture Best Supporting Actress for Lilla Skala and a few other categories.

His competition that year was Rex Harrison for Cleopatra Paul Newman for Hud Richard Harris for This Sporting Life and Albert Finney for Tom Jones. Tom Jones won a host of Oscars that year including Best Picture but in 1964 in the wake of the Kennedy assassination and the news of the atrocities done to civil rights workers and the mounting pressure to pass the Civil Rights Act Hollywood was casting its own voice of support in naming Sidney Poitier as Best Actor. As you can see Sidney Poitier faced some stiff competition in the category I certainly wouldn't want to say he was better than Albert Finney or Paul Newman who got rave reviews for their performances.Sidney Poitier was something special in Lillies of the Field. As his character Homer Smith says he's a camp meeting Baptist from the south. And the highlight of the film is him teaching the nuns to sing that Baptist camp meeting song Amen. That was about brother and sisterhood and peoples of all kinds working together and respecting each other in their differences.And for that reason because that message is so vital today the Academy voters gave Sidney Poitier a well deserved Oscar for delivering that message in an underfinanced but very beautiful film.".

The positioning of the tiny cross above the door in the main house was almost heartbreaking. The positioning of the crane in 23  scenes was extremely imaginative. When Homer ran up the stairs into the light sunlight of the Nun's roof I felt myself as uplifted as Homer Smith. The technique of the camera moving away from the actors in the early scene of the Sisters following after Homer's car as he went to leave was extremely powerful. I wondered if this technique would be used again or possibly overdone. It was only used one more time very briefly so as to not trivialize its initial use... What an amazing level of artistic discipline.  I'll say it as well this may be the most perfect film ever made.".

The technique of the camera moving away from the actors in the early scene of the Sisters following after Homer's car as he went to leave was extremely powerful. I wondered if this technique would be used again or possibly overdone. It was only used one more time very briefly so as to not trivialize its initial use... What an amazing level of artistic discipline.  I'll say it as well this may be the most perfect film ever made.";

There have been better movies there have been funnier comedies there have been more dramatic dramas there have been deeper explorations of spiritual issues. But this is a very pleasant movie to watch  and even fun at times.This is Sidney Poitier's movie. He plays Homer Smith  a mysterious drifter whose past we never do learn very much about who appears at a farm needing water for the radiator in his car. The farm turns out to be occupied by a group of nuns who've recently come to the United States from Germany and who basically draft Homer to build them a chapel. The movie basically portrays the growing relationship between the nuns and Homer. Homer resents the work he's being asked to do but somehow is unable to pull away. The nuns see Homer as an answer to their prayers for someone who could help them in this task. It's good fun watching Homer teach the nuns how to speak English and how to sing some of the gospel songs he learned in his Baptist upbringing. As I said this is Poitier's movie and he was superb in it. The supporting cast was fine but not high profile. The only one I recognized was Stanley Adams from a Star Trek episode a few years later. This might be a little bit overrated but still it doesn't disappoint. Again  it's a very pleasant movie to watch. 610".

Now that I'm more well experienced  I'm trying to avoid the word debauched  it's a little more difficult to warm my heart but not yet impossible.Poitier is a happygolucky handyman who bumps into half a dozen German nuns in the Sonoran desert. They more or less force him to begin building them a chapel so that the Catholic circuit rider doesn't have to say mass from the back of his trailer. There are all sorts of travails. Obstacles must be overcome. There is neither enough labor nor materials. Does the entire Hispanic community show up to provide the missing labor? Does the local construction company provide the bricks and mortar as a result of a sort of desertparched Pascal's choice? Does Poitier build the nuns their chapel? Are you kidding? Now having seen it for the second time it's still uplifting and somewhat comic as well with occasional dramatic elements. Lilia Skala as the mother superior has the truly thankless role of the authoritarian who believes that if you trust in God you needn't worry about anything else but she delivers. You might not think so when you see her in action because the character is so stern and lacking in humor. Poitier is to Skala as fire hydrant is to dog. But it takes skill to play such an unpleasant role.And this must be ranked among Sidney Poitier's better performances. He won an Oscar for it but that means nothing. Poitier's forte was similar to Gregory Peck's. He could project sincerity and moral fury almost flawlessly. But this role gives him a chance to lighten up. There's hardly a moment when he's on screen that you can take your eyes from him. He invests the smallest moments with something unique. Nobody else could have done it quite the same way. And there are some keenly observed moments Poitier and the men have finished the chapel and are playing music dancing and getting drunk while the nuns and the wives sit on benches and glare at them. Women don't like seeing men have a good time and getting drunk with other men. I enjoyed watching it again.Having said that I'm forced to admit that a second viewing after years of marination in movie conventions means hauling one's aesthetic sensibilities stark naked through some exceedingly prickly beavertail patches.Are you familiar with the scene in which some worldly outsider teaches a couple of uptight nuns how to sing a raucous spiritual con mucho gusto? Clapping their hands and swaying from side to side? No? How about the scene in which somebody teaches some nonEnglish speakers how to speak English  in a REGIONAL DIALECT? As in Sit yo' self down y'all? Would you believe an Irishman who drinks too much? An Irish priest? There were times when I winced when I turned my face aside as I tend to do when a large animal is slaughtered on screen.Yet for all that it's still an uplifting and in its own limited way a satisfying fable.

There is no great conflict in the film only the constant threat of running out of materials.  In the midst of this Poitier manages to teach the nuns a bit of English as well as a goin' to meetin' song' called Amen' which serves as the film's theme and is played throughout.The real joy of the film is in the personalities and interactions of the characters and in the individual scenes.  Poitier is dynamic and jovial in his Oscar winning role.  It may not have been his top performance or indeed the year's best acting but it has a special lowkey charm that few other actors could have mustered. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent particularly Lilia Skala as the wily Mother Superior.  There are several touching sequences and also a richness of humor.

Ice Cube? Mekhi Phifer? As it is the story gets to the point in short order and gives a stronger lesson about teamwork tolerance and faith in its 94 minutes than most modern films do today sorry to the cynics who don't want to read another socalled 'politically correct' homage regarding positive race relations but whether you agree or not that is the world we live in. One could even argue that Poitier's relationship with Mother Superior Lilia Skala never really reaches the warmandfuzzy breakthrough everyone would expect but I accept that compromise based on the fact that the characterizations are tight as a drum and leave little room for a 180degree change. Check it out and marvel at a film that cost less than half a million dollars to create.".

Psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Banks Jude Law is exactly what the doctor ordered.For those of us who watched Contagion 2011 and wanted to focus only on Jude Law's morally ambiguous blogger Alan Krumwiede we have finally gotten our wish. Law's morally ambiguous Dr. Jon Banks and Mara's psychologically ambiguous Emily are the only two main characters. There is only one story to follow.It starts off with some strange camera angles Steven Soderbergh serving as his own director of photography as he has for the majority of his films but then settles down as a thriller or what will become a thriller once we get to know the characters better. Emily has tried many antidepressants in the past but most leave her with undesired side effects nausea dizziness or lack of a sex drive. Won't Dr. Banks please prescribe her something different? Sure how about Ablixa the new medication which Dr. Banks is being paid to try out on patients.And although we now think we know in which character evil lies we do not. Dr. Jonathan Banks is singularly the most complicated interestingly created character in recent times. He's modern selfish compassionate professionallyoriented familyoriented has respect for the legal system and will go to extremes to distinguish between right and wrong. He's the focus of this charactercentric film noir thriller which uses Mara's Emily as the vehicle for the plot.A crime is committed. It's bad really bad. But the question is not who did it the question is who is guilty? In answering that question the film weaves from deception through twist to deception never ceasing our questions of what is morally right what is morally wrong and who is guilty? The screenplay is incredibly wellwritten creating characters that amaze us disappoint us and deceive us all the while being a part of an interesting and complex story. The dialogue fits with that theme using words like hopeless to tie multiple characters together  conceptually not physically.It's more of an edgeofyourmind thriller rather than an edgeofyour seat thriller. Never really scared always questioning the moral and psychological behaviour of these characters. The ending takes some strange sexuallycharged turns and perhaps a bit more conclusive than I was originally expecting but don't worry you can still question where the line is between right and wrong and when each character crossed it.".

Well I too remember those old classics and I loved them. Side Effects is a worthy addition but be warned that it's a thinking person's movie not a chainsaw caper.I'm surprised that so many people mention the twists and turns. Yes there are some but not that many and they're what makes it all so fascinating. You think you know what's happening  but you don't! What I especially enjoyed was the gamesmanship the different characters displayed. It's like a chess match with three people and more to kibitz.And yet as we travel through the story the surprising bits do make sense and we wonder why we didn't think of those things before. We're deep into the heart of mental illness and psychopathology. Almost every character has secrets or hidden motives they would not like to see the light of day. Although the main character seems at first to be the troubled young wife it becomes clear that it is Jude Law's character as the shrink who is struggling to find the truth and do the right thing.Just when you think everything that can go wrong for him has the tide begins to turn and it's Oh My Gosh.

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects begins with the camera zooming in from the streets to an apartment window and ends in the reverse manner no I'm not spoiling anything. In a subtle way Soderbergh's final shot represents his full circle. Will he really retire from filmmaking for good? If so then we will miss him. He is a truly exceptional filmmaker  and Side Effects would be a worthy film to go out on.Indeed Side Effects is a pure thriller as it was marketed. While prescription medicine is the central plot device the film also deals with psychology law insecurity social stigma corporate greed and obsession. Not explicitly for all of them mind you but subtly enough to get the point through and not dawdling on it a second further. The taut gripping Hitchcockian screenplay by Scott Z. Burns gleefully twists and turns its way into unexpected plot developments allowing Soderbergh to roam the apartments and streets with his camera creating an intense yet unusually hypnotic atmosphere that is irresistibly gorgeous to watch.Jude Law looking more haggard here is suitably desperate and obsessive as the good? doctor who seeks the truth pervasively after a horrific act committed by his patient Emily Rooney Mara. Clues lead him to Emily's previous doctor Dr. Siebert Catherine ZetaJones which reveal that things are not what they seem. ZetaJones is juicily and devilishly icycold in her portrayal of Siebert reminding me of those wicked female villains of the 90's thrillers. Staying in the background while having an influence throughout the second half of the movie is Rooney Mara once again giving a strong performance as the conflicted Emily. Extremely vulnerable softspoken and unpredictable she continues to steadily rise as one of the best young actresses working today. Channing Tatum too as her husband Martin an exconvict fresh out of prison for insider trading portrays his character outside of the stereotype and turns him into a somewhat sympathetic and unfortunate character.Soderbergh's complete control of atmosphere would not be complete without his usual great cinematography crisp editing and unnerving music score by Thomas Newman who conjures up some interesting musical themes at the proper times to rattle the characters even further. This is extremely skillful filmmaking and although the plot has been seen and done before it is exhilarating to see how a master filmmaker commands his given material so strongly and fleshing it out with his signature style.This is a very good film. It's one of those movies that when you start watching you want to keep watching to see what happens next. Hitchcock himself would have smiled at this one. As for Soderbergh he still has that Liberace biopic due for a TV release later this year so he's not done with it yet. But well I sure hope he returns someday if he decides to do so.".

Channing Tatum too as her husband Martin an exconvict fresh out of prison for insider trading portrays his character outside of the stereotype and turns him into a somewhat sympathetic and unfortunate character.Soderbergh's complete control of atmosphere would not be complete without his usual great cinematography crisp editing and unnerving music score by Thomas Newman who conjures up some interesting musical themes at the proper times to rattle the characters even further. This is extremely skillful filmmaking and although the plot has been seen and done before it is exhilarating to see how a master filmmaker commands his given material so strongly and fleshing it out with his signature style.This is a very good film. It's one of those movies that when you start watching you want to keep watching to see what happens next. Hitchcock himself would have smiled at this one. As for Soderbergh he still has that Liberace biopic due for a TV release later this year so he's not done with it yet. But well I sure hope he returns someday if he decides to do so.";

The cast meshes wonderfully. Jude Law delivers a strong lead as the frustrated psychiatrist and Rooney Mara is mysterious and unpredictable. My only complaint is the performances were not as dramatic as they could have been. Mara was excellent at portraying her character's cold and lifeless depression but I have seen what she is really capable of Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and she could have definitely reached those heights with this type of character. Nonetheless a fine set of performances all around but they take a back seat to the intoxicating narrative.So is Side Effects Soderbergh's last hurrah?

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Soderbergh has decided to end his career what can only be described as a pharmaceutical psychosexual thriller that deals with several morally ambiguous characters all revolving around one horrible incident. Out of fear of giving away the intelligent twistfilled plot written by Scot Z. Burns that's really all I can say although I can tell you that Soderbergh directs the film with extreme confidence and it shows. He was able to convey a sort of quiet chaos with his frequent closeups and by shifting inandout of focus throughout the screen he was able to draw attention to the many small yet important details.The real strength of this film though is not necessarily the story itself but how it is presented. To be honest the story is almost too smart to the point of absurdity but it never comes off as such. By releasing only one small piece of information at a time we are kept waiting through interviews court hearings false trails and many psychiatrist visits until finally everything comes together into one neat conclusion. The entire film is very subdued but if you pay attention you will be rewarded in the end.Of course the story would not have turned out so well without the multiple impressive performances that carry it all the way through. Rooney Mara is once again stunning as Emily Taylor a woman who starts taking prescription antidepressants to cope with her husband's release from prison. Without giving much away Emily is far more complex than she first appears and Mara plays this perfectly by retaining a dark mysteriousness about her. She truly steals every scene she's in and displays such a range of emotions that at times it's difficult to tell what her character is truly thinking. This is unfortunate for Channing Tatum who does a fine job as her loving and sympathetic husband trying to make everything right after being released for insider trading but who doesn't have close to enough material to compete with Mara.Jude Law on the other hand is arguably the most central figure as Dr. Jonathan Banks Emily's psychiatrist who is thrown into a scandal when his patient is involved in a tragic accident after taking an antidepressant he prescribed for her. He slowly mentally unravels as his decisions come back to haunt him and eventually has to cross several moral boundaries in order to get his life back on track. Law shows this frustration with expert skill and gives one of the best performances of his recent career. The same can be said for Catherine Zeta Jones whoas Emily's former psychiatrist Dr. Victoria Siebertgives possibly the most complex performance and does it brilliantly despite her lack of screen time.To give away any more would be to say too much as the film is so perfectly structured it is difficult to discuss without giving away the whole thing. All I can add is it is not so simple and straightforward as it may appear. It is a complex of characters their motives and the consequences of their actions and despite taking a while to get started it is truly a spectacular thrilling and intricate journey that should not be missed.".

However that being said I went in with a certain mindset and it took me a little time to figure it out but I eventually did. Either the film was moving real slow for me or I have become accustom to seeing more action. This film is purely psychological in nature so if you are looking for some action there isn't any. It also got me to thinking how much power court appointed psychologists have and how they have the power to manipulate the system. On the other hand it also made me realize that mental patients have absolutely no control over their lives which may be a good thing. Dr. Jonathan Banks Jude Law is the psychologist on the case of a severely depressed patient. His world is quickly turned upside down by having to deal with anxiety depression pharmaceuticals and medical ethics. Emily Taylor Rooney Mara is the severely depressed woman who is desperately trying to find the right drug to cure her affliction. Dr. Victoria Siebert Catherine ZetaJones is a former attending psychologist of Emily who is consulted by Dr. Banks to try and uncover some of the dilemmas of her past. Martin Taylor Channing Tatum is Emily's husband and is shouldered with the responsibility of trying to care his wife as she tries medication after medication in addition to trying to keep the marriage together. Dierdre Banks Vinessa Shaw is Jonathan's wife and she becomes a victim and unwilling participant in the unfolding circumstances that is affecting her life. I think that the entire cast did an excellent job but as I said before it was a tad slow for me in the beginning. This film definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat and you really do not know who is playing whom. It was difficult to know who to root for until all is revealed at the end. I thought that the story was a good one and it definitely takes you on a rollercoaster ride. I am not sure that anyone could ever reach the level of a Hitchcock film but this one comes pretty close. Steven Soderbergh did an excellent job embracing this genre of film. I give this film a green light.".

It is fair to say that the movie is adequate during each of its disparate parts but overall it's a convoluted story that immerses itself in faux intrigue and wraps itself up so neatly that you can practically see the bow on it. Emily Rooney Mara is a depressive her husband Martin Channing Tatum has just returned from a stint in prison for insider trading but she feels anxious and can't sleep. She visits psychiatrist Jonathan Banks Jude Law who prescribes a brandnew drug to help her out when the betterknown brands Zoloft Paxil Wellbutrin etc. don't seem to break Emily from her ennui. But the drug as you might have guessed so expertly does have its side effects.It turns out  not a spoiler  that Emily has begun to sleepwalk. Well more than sleepwalk she does things in her sleep like cook breakfast and set the table all in the middle of the night and not remembering a thing the next day. Tragedy strikes while Emily sleeps. Is she the culprit or is the drug to blame?At first the premise seems to be that involving patients in drugs that are just approved as part of a study is pretty unethical behavior by a doctor. Dr. Banks has bills to pay though what with his wife losing her highpowered job. So he's working longer hours and taking on more work including participation in this study. When the tragedy that strikes comes back to haunt him as well as Emily the movie takes a turn  it manages to turn Banks from being just an overextended shmoe into a manipulative drug dealer who uses his patients as experiments. Up until this point we don't know whether Banks is actually innocent. From what we've seen he seems so but he could have inadvertently caused someone's death by prescribing medication to someone who reacted badly to the side effects. Naturally his reputation and marriage in ruins Banks works to clear his name. This is actually easier than it is in most movies of this ilk because he's not in prison or anything. He just needs to piece together clues.One of those clues is Emily's last doctor Victoria Siebert Catherine ZetaJones who is helpful but guarded. She relates that Emily left her care in Connecticut when Emily's husband got a job on Wall Street which ultimately led Emily to see Dr. Banks.The second half of the movie deals with Banks' efforts to find things out. Racing against time and struggling to believe various stories he is now in fullon victim mode as presented to the viewer. It's not an unusual role in fact it's sort of a trope the innocent trying to prove themselves. We're now sold on his innocence and we as the audience just want to know what's happened.I mentioned before that the movie ends rather neatly. Too neatly for my tastes although it's not as if the explanations were implausible. But there's nothing wrong with some loose ends some ambiguity and this film  the 50th and final maybe? to be directed by Steven Soderbergh  leaves nothing ambiguous behind. We know in full the motives and fates of each character. Is this a good thing? Many won't be bothered by it but for me I just prefer to have some questions left unanswered. Law is adequate although it feels like he's just stepping in for Tom Cruise when Cruise did all of those framed man on the run movies like The Firm. ZetaJones is icy and opaque two beneficial traits for her character. Mara of course steals the show simply because of this up until the last moments of the movie we don't know whether anything about Emily is true. Instead of Law being the victimaccused Mara's character slips quietly into that very role. In Emily Mara brings the ambiguity the film needs  it's just too bad that ambiguity did not spread to the rest of the film. Shame that would be a nice side effect indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steven Soderbergh is a chameleon of a director and one of the few who has the ability to move from critically acclaimed Hollywood blockbusters like Ocean's Eleven to dramatic art films like The Limey. He is also one of the hardest working filmmakers today taking on such roles as producer writer director cinematographer and editor. As a director he has been able to pump out two feature length films in a single year and he has done this more than just once. However over the last decade his films have become weaker as it seems as though not enough time has been invested into exploring the emotional depths of the stories he is bringing to life.

	onyx:emotionText "Steven Soderbergh is a chameleon of a director and one of the few who has the ability to move from critically acclaimed Hollywood blockbusters like Ocean's Eleven to dramatic art films like The Limey. He is also one of the hardest working filmmakers today taking on such roles as producer writer director cinematographer and editor. As a director he has been able to pump out two feature length films in a single year and he has done this more than just once. However over the last decade his films have become weaker as it seems as though not enough time has been invested into exploring the emotional depths of the stories he is bringing to life.

	schema:headline " Soderbergh's passable Hitchcocklike thriller doesn't always add up";
	schema:reviewBody "Steven Soderbergh's 'Side Effects' first appears as if it's designed as a critique of psychiatry and the pharmaceutical industry. Ultimately it becomes more like a Hitchcock thriller. It's a film that keeps your interest but you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit to appreciate it.Rooney Mara looking quite more appealing than her stint as angry Goth in 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' plays Emily Taylor a seemingly depressed wife of her husband Martin Channing Tatum who has just come home after doing four years in prison for insider trading.When it appears that she tries to kill herself by slamming her car into a wall in a parking garage she's assigned to a psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Banks winningly played by Jude Law. Banks is a fairly typical psychiatrist who prescribes one psychotropic medication after another hoping that Emily's mood will change. Still feeling forlorn Banks consults with Emily's former psychiatrist Victoria Catherine ZetaJones who recommends that Emily be placed on a new experimental drug Ablixa. Banks takes the pharmaceutical company's money and convinces Emily to participate in the study.The stakes are raised when seemingly despondent Emily stabs husband Martin to death but claims she can't remember anything and blames everything on the Ablixa. Suddenly Banks is no longer the complacent psychiatrist but is now a scapegoat as the press blames him for dispensing the medication which everyone assumes is the cause of Emily's violent outburst. His patients start leaving him in droves and he's investigated by the State Licensing Board. Furthermore the pharmaceutical company drops him as one of the testers of the Ablixa study.Soon Banks figures out that there's something much more sinister underfoot. Like Hitchcock's 'Wrong Man' he now must clear his name. As Emily has taken a plea bargain in which she pleads guilty by reason of insanity Banks is assigned to be her psychiatrist at the Ward's Island Criminal Psychiatric facility and has full say as to whether she will be eventually released or not. And here is where I had the biggest problem with this film. If Banks' reputation is so in tatters he's been smeared in the press and the state licensing board is investigating him why would the court even entertain the idea that he should continue to be involved with Emily? And without this caveat the film's denouement could never develop as it does.So let's suspend our disbelief over this major plot point and see whether the rest of 'Side Effects' has any more credibility. As it turns out Banks does indeed figure out that Emily was faking all along that she was depressed. He also discovers that Banks turned out to be the former lover of her former psychiatrist Victoria who convinces Emily to participate in an incredible scheme to drive the stock price down of pharmaceutical company who's been promoting Ablixa. By selling short Emily and Victoria end up making a bundle but once Banks figures everything out he forces Emily to wear a wire and rat out Victoria.It's pretty much a fantastic scheme and again it involves more suspension of disbelief since it's not guaranteed that the stock price will go down that much where the two schemers will actually make a big profit. Nonetheless it could remotely happen. Banks being in cahoots with the Assistant District Atttorney to turn Emily but then falsifying her personality profile and illegally ordering her to take mind numbing psychotropic medications such as Thorazine to shut up her up seems beyond the pale. Would an ADA risk his job to participate in such an illegal revenge scheme? I hardly think so.It's also a bit ironic that a psychiatrist who exceeds his authority by authorizing the administration of psychotropic medications when they are not needed appears justified since the patient in question has gotten away with murder. Whether you like this final scenario or not one wonders why Emily didn't have an attorney who could have worked to expose Banks' illegal actions. It just seemed a little too easy in the way that Banks along with his allies so easily were able to keep Emily as a zombie all doped up with her medications without any other third parties becoming involved in her case and perhaps discovering that the 'good guys' i.e. Banks and company were suddenly doing a bunch of bad things.'Side Effects' is a passable 'Hollywoodtype' thriller. It has the requisite good acting and interesting plot reversals but ultimately not everything adds up.".

Over the years he has provided some good and some not so good but never has he bored us. Movie lovers will always be grateful to him for his 1989 Sex Lies and Videotape which singlehandedly brought the spotlight back to indie film. While I am quite skeptical of his retirement claim it's noteworthy because the absence of one of today's true auteur's would be a loss for the art of cinema.As for this last film it begins as Hitchcockesque but concludes as more like Basic Instinct or Dressed to Kill. Put simply the first half is mesmerizing while the second half devolves into a trashy pulp thriller.The first half brought to mind the term pharmacological thriller. It seems as though Soderbergh and frequent collaborator Scott Z Burns Contagion The Informant! are making a statement about our current societal trend of seeking answers or at least treatment through medication ... despite the risky side effects. We meet Emily and Martin Taylor Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum as he is released from prison insider trading and she is falling back into her depressive ways. She is soon enough being treated by Dr. Jonathan Banks Jude Law a doctor who seems typical in his belief that finding the right pill cures most ills.Since this is a suspense thriller filled with numerous twists and double even triplecrossings it's impossible to go too deep into what happens without spoilers ... something I won't do here. What can be said is the pharmacological thriller shifts into legal drama and finally a whodonewhat kind of conclusion. The solving of the mystery comes courtesy of another oftused Hitchcock theme the wronged man seeking vindication.Rooney Mara and Jude Law are both excellent here and to whatever extent the story works for you they deserve the credit along with Soderbergh. Ms. Mara was outstanding in the American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Mr. Law continues his transition from lame romcom's to quality dramatic actor. The same shouldn't be said for Catherine ZetaJones who plays Dr Victoria Seibert Emily's first psychiatrist. Every scene she shares and every line she speaks just screams look at me not a desired quality for a supporting role.Support work is provided by Polly Draper Mamie Gummer Meryl Streep's daughter Vinessa Shaw Peter Friedman Laila Robins and Ann Dowd. Soderbergh does not disappoint from a technical aspect. His odd camera angles and unique shots are quite impressive and effective in sustaining the mood even as the story spirals towards farfetched. If it's truly his swan song it seems appropriate that we see both the highs and lows of director Soderbergh. Here's hoping he returns very soon to the medium where his impact is needed.".

	schema:reviewBody "ONE BIG SPOILER HERElet's start with reviewer Dan Franzens's good summary of the set up Emily Rooney Mara is a depressive her husband Martin Channing Tatum has just returned from a stint in prison for insider trading but she feels anxious and can't sleep. She visits psychiatrist Jonathan Banks Jude Law who prescribes a brandnew drug to help her out when the betterknown brands Zoloft Paxil Wellbutrin etc. don't seem to break Emily from her ennui. But the drug as you might have guessed so expertly does have its side effects.It turns out  not a spoiler  that Emily has begun to sleepwalk. Well more than sleepwalk she does things in her sleep like cook breakfast and set the table all in the middle of the night and not remembering a thing the next day. Tragedy strikes while Emily sleeps. Is she the culprit or is the drug to blame?Well the tragedySPOILER is that Emily kills her husband with a kitchen knife while sleepwalking. Dr. Banks decides it's the side effect of the new corporate antidepressant that has more marketing money than clinical test results behind it. He helps get her a guiltyby reasonofinsanity and a stint in a psychiatric hospital instead of life in prison for Murder 1. At the same time his reputation is in tatters for having kept Emily on a notverytested drug in spite of some warning symptoms. So he has some incentive to figure out if something else is going on.Many fairly suspenseful convolutions later here's what we're expected to believe really happened. Emily was swept off her feet 5 years before by Martin her dashing handsome affectionate rich hedge fund guy and she is about to lead the life of a fairyprincess wife in the enchanted money land of Greenwich CT. But the feds come down on her handsome prince and he is sent to a country club prison for unspecified whitecollar crimes. We know that in real life that never happens but more ridiculous things are yet to come. In her unhappiness Emily sees a shrink Dr. Victoria Siebert played with adequate professional frostiness by Catherine ZetaJones. Emily draws the good doctor into her first lesbian affair and naturally uses her jailbird husband's trader tricks to make both of them a pile of money. Either Emily has also fallen in love with Dr. Siebert in which case she will not go back to her husband but instead live happily ever after with her new girlfriend and pile of illgotten Wall Street profits OR she is toying with Dr. Siebert and using her as a trading proxy. Their is no point to this second possibility and no coherence to the idea that Emily could make a fortune with what she learned over dinner from her jailed trader husband since Wall Street makes its money on deal opportunities tied strictly to personal and firmbased relationships to which Emily ensconced in the officelove nest with her psychiatrist girlfriend has zero access. But possibility 1 is also not the case Emily displays no affection for Dr. Siebert at any point ever and stabs her in the back later onfiguratively in this case. But back to the affair itself we are told that Emily cooked up the idea of Emily killing Martin when he gets back from prison because Emily is mad at him for getting sent to prison right after he had made her into a fairyprincess. Dr. Siebert is complicit in this. But there is no possible upside for Dr. Siebert and plenty of downside she loves Emily and wants them to be together so she would encourage Emily to leave Martin and not stir up every law enforcement agency in Manhattan by killing him. So apparently Emily is a homicidal sociopath who wants to kill Martin no matter what and somehow persuades the calculating careful Dr. Siebert to go along which she would clearly never do. In addition Emily is willing to be arrested go to trial and risk being in a psychiatric hospital for years because why? A normal sociopath would pay someone to whack Martin and be done with it. Then in the end the noble Dr. Banks Jude Law persuades Dr. Siebert to keep Emily locked up even though the former's only interest is being with Emily and after Emily betrays her for Dr. Banks Dr. Banks commits Emily to the hospital for all eternity. So it's the version of noir where everybody is basically evil except that in good noir people retain coherent motives and the ability to pursue their own interests by destroying others in a semilogical way. Nobody would ever act the way these characters do whether crazy or not. It's too bad.".

Emily was swept off her feet 5 years before by Martin her dashing handsome affectionate rich hedge fund guy and she is about to lead the life of a fairyprincess wife in the enchanted money land of Greenwich CT. But the feds come down on her handsome prince and he is sent to a country club prison for unspecified whitecollar crimes. We know that in real life that never happens but more ridiculous things are yet to come. In her unhappiness Emily sees a shrink Dr. Victoria Siebert played with adequate professional frostiness by Catherine ZetaJones. Emily draws the good doctor into her first lesbian affair and naturally uses her jailbird husband's trader tricks to make both of them a pile of money. Either Emily has also fallen in love with Dr. Siebert in which case she will not go back to her husband but instead live happily ever after with her new girlfriend and pile of illgotten Wall Street profits OR she is toying with Dr. Siebert and using her as a trading proxy. Their is no point to this second possibility and no coherence to the idea that Emily could make a fortune with what she learned over dinner from her jailed trader husband since Wall Street makes its money on deal opportunities tied strictly to personal and firmbased relationships to which Emily ensconced in the officelove nest with her psychiatrist girlfriend has zero access. But possibility 1 is also not the case Emily displays no affection for Dr. Siebert at any point ever and stabs her in the back later onfiguratively in this case. But back to the affair itself we are told that Emily cooked up the idea of Emily killing Martin when he gets back from prison because Emily is mad at him for getting sent to prison right after he had made her into a fairyprincess. Dr. Siebert is complicit in this. But there is no possible upside for Dr. Siebert and plenty of downside she loves Emily and wants them to be together so she would encourage Emily to leave Martin and not stir up every law enforcement agency in Manhattan by killing him. So apparently Emily is a homicidal sociopath who wants to kill Martin no matter what and somehow persuades the calculating careful Dr. Siebert to go along which she would clearly never do. In addition Emily is willing to be arrested go to trial and risk being in a psychiatric hospital for years because why? A normal sociopath would pay someone to whack Martin and be done with it. Then in the end the noble Dr. Banks Jude Law persuades Dr. Siebert to keep Emily locked up even though the former's only interest is being with Emily and after Emily betrays her for Dr. Banks Dr. Banks commits Emily to the hospital for all eternity. So it's the version of noir where everybody is basically evil except that in good noir people retain coherent motives and the ability to pursue their own interests by destroying others in a semilogical way. Nobody would ever act the way these characters do whether crazy or not. It's too bad.";

Side Effects is a great thriller and the best work of Steven Soderbergh in the last years. The storyline is very similar to the Jagged Edge but updated and using more characters and a more sophisticated plot. The smart conclusion seems weird since the double jeopardy prevents Emily from going to court again but she is punished by Dr. Banks evaluation of her mental condition.

However once the twists start and the cover ups and the introduction of new ideas and possibilities it picked up nicely. I did figure it out relatively quickly after a couple of other thoughts were squashed. I think its worth seeing but not for 15 bucks a pop. If you can get it at the dollar theaters or matine for 4 bucks its worth it. AS I said good acting story is good but at times predictable and Soderbergh directs well. As thrillers go its one of the better ones in the last few years mainly because there haven't been many. Its all been large superhero films etc. So its a good change of pace.

	schema:reviewBody "Forget about 'Contagion' which was entirely mediocre anyway and even put aside 'Flatliners' trust in Steven Soderbergh to get the job done right on his second attempt.... An entirely gripping captivating and twisted plot that might just be his career best. A young woman who's husband has just been released from prison is prescribed a drug to cure her depression but with unexpected side effects. Since its release this has always been in the top echelon of thrillers in my opinion. Sure the narrative slowly becomes convoluted and frequently drifts away from the prescription drug problem that it illustrates. However it never fails to hypnotise me. A provocatively shot underrated gem that deftly balances its jeopardising characters that strangely feel both likeable and despised simultaneously. The screenplay is confidently written to make you doubt yourself you think you've got one character sussed only for the story to then take a sharp turn in the opposite direction. It's almost Hitchcocklike which to me is an admirable inspiration and one most thrillers should take notes from. Jude Law and Rooney Mara must be praised for their natural ability to entrance me. Much like medicine I became dependant on them at delivering the story and they did so with ease. Newman's composition suited the clinical environment and surprisingly had me on edge even more. Soderbergh's direction and cinematography was sumptuous loved how the background and foreground were always blurred and only the character speaking was in focus. A fantastic method to engage the viewer and ensure they are paying attention. Safe to say his experience paid off dearly. As I said the plot does become slightly convoluted during the third act and plot holes do crop up occasionally. Yet it's very rare for a thriller to consistently keep me engaged and for that I have to applaud Side Effects. A film that I will frequently revisit on an annual basis.".

	schema:reviewBody "For suspense movies it is very difficult to write a review that is too meaningful. In some cases even the mere mention that thing are not what they appear to be already constitutes a spoiler. Steven Soderbergh is well known for making movies with issues. Even the title Side effect similar to Traffic suggests that this movie delves into the medical profession to expose issues on matters pharmaceutical. It would therefore constitute a spoiler when I intimate that this issue is used here to camouflage a crime thriller. But then you have been warned.Using liberally techniques such as VO leading into the next scene and in and out focus in the same scene Soderbergh has created this tale of spellbinding suspense not quite Hitchcockish but intriguing nevertheless. During the first half of the movie you won't quite see where it is heading. The story starts innocently with attractive 28yearold Emily Taylor Rooney Mara welcoming home husband Martin Channing Tatum released after four years' prison term for insider trading. This event though a happy one has triggered some of the depression problem she previously had but seemed mostly cured by a Dr. Victoria Siebert Catherine ZetaJones. The recurrence takes the form of her driving deliberately into a wall. While escaping serious injury she is brought into contact by a psychiatrist checking her out at the emergency ward the fact that there was no braking lines look suspicious leading to this Dr. Jonathan Banks Jude Law taking up her case. The story meanders a little around sporadic but continues recurrence of Emily's depression and Bank's prescription of a antidepressant called Ablixa which he is paid handsomely by a pharmaceutical corporation to test.As you begin to wonder how the movie will pursue this ethically dubious but not illegal issue the bombshell drops. Martin comes home Emily stabs him dead with a kitchen knife goes to the bed room climbs into bed and sleeps. All of a sudden Dr Banks finds himself in a most unenviable position of possibly administering a drug that turns a patient into a sleepwalking psychopath. But as I said things may not be what they appear. Of the plot I will say no more.Whether you find the plot too convoluted or absurdly predictable whether you admire the clever twists or deplore the dumb plot holes you would find this movie entertaining for the acting and storytelling. Law has shown masterful virtuosi is steering a character that takes some sharp turns and keeps him on course. Someone in the league of ZetaJones will of course not be wasted. But the spotlight is on Mara who carries this movie with impeccable authority. I mentioned that this movie itself is not quite Hitchcockian but then Mara is a perfect Hitchcockian heroine and it becomes her. This young just turned 28 woman will go far.".

The Oscar movies tend to be released during the first few weeks of the year and the summer blockbusters are still a few weeks away which makes April a bit barren for movies. Having scanned the listings and checked out IMDb scores Side Effects was the only decent thing playing at the cinema which I hadn't seen. According to IMDb Side Effects is supposed to be like Limitless but I didn't especially notice the similarity. As with Limitless the underlying premise of the film revolves around the taking of experimental drugs but that is about the only similarity. Side Effects follows the story of Emily Rooney Mara who is suffering severe depression. She is prescribed an experimental drug by psychiatrist Jonathon Banks Jude Law. The movie title gives away the fact that the drugs have side effects. Overall I found the film quite watchable although doubt it will leave a lasting impression. Quite sure that if you are into Jude Law or Rooney Mara you'll really enjoy it. Hats off to Jude Law for playing these roles as well. I'm not his greatest fan but it's impressive how often he opts for roles on serious films over taking the easy bucks in big budget films.".

This is my second favorite James Bond 007 film and in my opinion not yours Roger Moore's best film. This is the eleventh spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions and the fourth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The third and final film in the series to be directed by Lewis Gilbert it costars Lois Chiles Michael Lonsdale Corinne Clry and Richard Kiel. This film has so much action action action action all the time. It has beautiful girls climatic battle fights with laser guns in outer space Bond jumps off the plane without parachute. Climatic fight between Bond Holly Goodhead and Jaws on the Cable Car in Sugarloaf Mountain Rio de Janeiro. I love this film to death I grew up with this film and it is my favorite. I'm a hardcore James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Roger Moore is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond.Since I was a kid I have really enjoyed this film I have enjoy it in high school and I still do till it's day. I know a lot of people's is at least favorite Bond film because it is science fiction film it is set in space. James Bond 007 in outer space is a bad idea because in 1977 Star Wars come out and they were so popular that they decide to make this film I don't mind it.James Bond investigates the midair theft of a space shuttle and discovers a plot to commit global genocide. Roger Moore in my opinion is the most underrated James Bond 007 ever and I have more respect then i would have a respect to a morons like Daniel Craig I hate the new James Bond! Roger Moore R.I.P.

Bond throws knife in the assassin in Venice river and flees with his own boat.Great direction from Lewis Gilbert I am so proud on the director that he filmed this film in Venice Italy in the city in which my mom visited. Great music score from Shirley Bassey  Moonraker and John Barry did a wonderful score for the James Bond film.Michael Lonsdale's performance is astonishingly controlled and precise as Hugo Drax... There's something really scary about his true personality and character... He gives sarcastic remarks about 007 'You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.'

	schema:headline " The most visually striking 007 ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Of all the Bond films MOONRAKER is imo the most visually striking of the entire series. It looks like it cost a billion bucks to make. The sets by Ken Adams are amazing he should have won an Oscar for them. The locations are stunning. The fx are well made and still hold up today. The women are above average gorgeous they all look like supermodels before supermodels were in. All of this beautifully filmed by cinematographer Jean Tournier. I love watching MOONRAKER just because it's so damn gorgeous to look at. I don't know how many times I saw it at the movies when it came out just to appreciate the beauty of it all. Unfortunately we are talking about a James Bond film and of course there has to be the usual formulaic stuff seen in every other James Bond film. Basically MOONRAKER is a remake of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. I always preferred MOONRAKER over the schintzy SPY WHO LOVED ME which was made just before this one. Lewis Gilbert directed those three Bond films and MOONRAKER is his crowning achievement. Personally speaking Gilbert is a bad director. His films are always bloated and sorta soulless and yet still gorgeous. Aside from his Bond films he rarely made an impression with his other films. In fact he's the one who directed THE ADVENTURERS which is a good looking film but it's really really awful. I'm glad Gilbert stopped making Bond films. He was always too laid back for action films like this.There ARE a lot of memorable scenes in MOONRAKER the entire intro is now a classic and much better than the one in SWLM. Corinne being chased by dogs. The simulator scene. Bond fighting with Chang in Venice. My favorite scene is when Bond and Goodhead are stuck below a shuttle's rockets and are about to be burned alive. A near perfect action moment there. The climax in space is fun if improbable. I love the scene when they have to destroy those globes as they reenter the atmosphere. Really suspenseful. But as good as those scenes are individually they almost don't register as a whole because the story and direction are so lackadaisical so relax. It's like everyone was on vacation. There's absolutely no grit to this film. It's really sleek and smooth but nearly biteless. The whole story seems to be just a preamble to the action set in space. What really stands out about MOONRAKER are the many long moments with no dialogue. I'd say about 50 to 60 of the film has no dialogue. Just music and sound effects. It's almost a silent film. Moore didn't have a lot of dialogue to remember and this was an easy film to dub. The story is as easy as connectthedots The British owned Moonraker 5 disappears in midair and 007 is sent to California to investigate its disappearance. At the Moonraker plant in California France really Bond find blueprints of vials which leads him to Venice where the vials are fabricated. And from Venice Bond goes to Brazil where the vials filled with deadly nerve gas are shipped to the underground layout of Drax boringly played by the usually reliable Michael Lonsdale. Love the name Drax though. Oh and we learn that Drax wants to create a new race of super humans by killing everyone on earth by dropping those nerve gas filled globes from space while Drax and his super humans reside in Drax's space station. I actually like that part of the story and some of the grandeur of it Drax wanting to be God is actually achieved with the striking visuals and the amazingly lush score by the brilliant John Barry. Unfortunately again this is a James Bond film and thought provoking ideas are set aside for formulaic action. I wish this wasn't a James Bond film. Take away all the Bond elements the stupid humor flesh out the screenplay and this would be a spectacular kick ass science fiction film.Anyway back to James Bond.I really like Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. She's my favorite Bond girl ever. Beautiful and sophisticated but tough. She's no bimbo. I remember a lot of my friends in school didn't like her because they thought she was too tough for a babe. I guess Holly Goodhead was Girl Power before Girl Power was in. For me Chiles epitomizes everything chic and sexy about the late 1970s. She's unforgettable in that black jumpsuit. But the Holly Goodhead role is a really badly written one. She's almost an afterthought to the whole story. They basically needed a character to fly the space shuttle and Bond into space something 007 obviously couldn't do and Goodhead was basically that just a pilot. Then there's Corinne Clery who is truly gorgeous but sadly again her role is minimal. Then there's the not so beautiful Jaws. Jaws was so popular in SPY WHO LOVED ME they brought him back here. I don't mind this but they turned him into a good guy and he even falls in love with a ditsy girl. This part of MOONRAKER is really bad. Someone should completely edit that storyline out of the movie and its rating would go up exponentially. And like in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME the musical injokes were needlessly distracting.These bad aspects about MOONRAKER are almost negligible though because the film is such a visual and aural feast. Whether it's one of the best or worst of the series I really don't care. I can positively state though that this is THE best looking Bond film ever with an actually cool science fiction story somewhere in it. I give MOONRAKER 10 stars for the look of it all but 5 stars for the laid back and sometimes silly direction. So an average of 7 stars.".

In fact he's the one who directed THE ADVENTURERS which is a good looking film but it's really really awful. I'm glad Gilbert stopped making Bond films. He was always too laid back for action films like this.There ARE a lot of memorable scenes in MOONRAKER the entire intro is now a classic and much better than the one in SWLM. Corinne being chased by dogs. The simulator scene. Bond fighting with Chang in Venice. My favorite scene is when Bond and Goodhead are stuck below a shuttle's rockets and are about to be burned alive. A near perfect action moment there. The climax in space is fun if improbable. I love the scene when they have to destroy those globes as they reenter the atmosphere. Really suspenseful. But as good as those scenes are individually they almost don't register as a whole because the story and direction are so lackadaisical so relax. It's like everyone was on vacation. There's absolutely no grit to this film. It's really sleek and smooth but nearly biteless. The whole story seems to be just a preamble to the action set in space. What really stands out about MOONRAKER are the many long moments with no dialogue. I'd say about 50 to 60 of the film has no dialogue. Just music and sound effects. It's almost a silent film. Moore didn't have a lot of dialogue to remember and this was an easy film to dub. The story is as easy as connectthedots The British owned Moonraker 5 disappears in midair and 007 is sent to California to investigate its disappearance. At the Moonraker plant in California France really Bond find blueprints of vials which leads him to Venice where the vials are fabricated. And from Venice Bond goes to Brazil where the vials filled with deadly nerve gas are shipped to the underground layout of Drax boringly played by the usually reliable Michael Lonsdale. Love the name Drax though. Oh and we learn that Drax wants to create a new race of super humans by killing everyone on earth by dropping those nerve gas filled globes from space while Drax and his super humans reside in Drax's space station. I actually like that part of the story and some of the grandeur of it Drax wanting to be God is actually achieved with the striking visuals and the amazingly lush score by the brilliant John Barry. Unfortunately again this is a James Bond film and thought provoking ideas are set aside for formulaic action. I wish this wasn't a James Bond film. Take away all the Bond elements the stupid humor flesh out the screenplay and this would be a spectacular kick ass science fiction film.Anyway back to James Bond.I really like Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. She's my favorite Bond girl ever. Beautiful and sophisticated but tough. She's no bimbo. I remember a lot of my friends in school didn't like her because they thought she was too tough for a babe. I guess Holly Goodhead was Girl Power before Girl Power was in. For me Chiles epitomizes everything chic and sexy about the late 1970s. She's unforgettable in that black jumpsuit. But the Holly Goodhead role is a really badly written one. She's almost an afterthought to the whole story. They basically needed a character to fly the space shuttle and Bond into space something 007 obviously couldn't do and Goodhead was basically that just a pilot. Then there's Corinne Clery who is truly gorgeous but sadly again her role is minimal. Then there's the not so beautiful Jaws. Jaws was so popular in SPY WHO LOVED ME they brought him back here. I don't mind this but they turned him into a good guy and he even falls in love with a ditsy girl. This part of MOONRAKER is really bad. Someone should completely edit that storyline out of the movie and its rating would go up exponentially. And like in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME the musical injokes were needlessly distracting.These bad aspects about MOONRAKER are almost negligible though because the film is such a visual and aural feast. Whether it's one of the best or worst of the series I really don't care. I can positively state though that this is THE best looking Bond film ever with an actually cool science fiction story somewhere in it. I give MOONRAKER 10 stars for the look of it all but 5 stars for the laid back and sometimes silly direction. So an average of 7 stars.";

We did not care if the films were faithful to Fleming if there was too much humour or if Moore was wooden we went to have a good time and did.No offence to Connery but for us Moore was The Man.

	schema:reviewBody "Moonraker is directed by Lewis Gilbert and adapted to screenplay by Christopher Wood from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Roger Moore Lois Chiles Michael Lonsdale Richard Kiel and Corinne Dufour. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Jean Tournier.Bond 11 and 007 is tasked with finding out what happened to the Moonraker space shuttle that mysteriously disappeared up in space. His investigation takes him to the billionaire builder of the craft Hugo Drax where Bond discovers a fiendish plot to start a new world of perfect human beings.At the end of The Spy Who Loved Me we were told that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only but the gargantuan success of Star Wars and a rekindling of all things scifi led Albert Broccoli to send 007 out into space! Armed with a 30 million budget and using only the core base plotting of Fleming's novel the makers crafted what many feel is the runt of the James Bond litter. The money is up there on the screen it's excess overdrive outlandish from start to finish and actually is very very entertaining. The problem is that in James Bond terms it barely feels like a Bond movie it actually could be any bloke propelling the story this is a guy reliant on gadgets and not his brain or brawn quipping away purely for the sake of a cheap laugh. Ultimately it's a cash in both in terms of the scifi boom hitting the late 70s and of the James Bond name.If judged away from the Bond universe on its own popcorn terms film is a blast literally. As a whole it's a bit choppy but many of the parts desperately trying to make up a cohesive blockbuster are great entertainment. Mid air scrap for a parachute a cable car sequence brilliantly realised centrifuge chamber peril boat chase laser fight and much space age malarkey the film is chocked full of crowd pleasing moments. In fact it's often mistaken as being a film set in space when in fact the action doesn't move up there until the last half hour the previous hour and a half is spread out over France Italy Brazil USA Gutemala and of course England. The score and the title song however are very much Bond. With Barry and Bassey back respectively film is filled with appropriate atmospheric space strains and a hauntingly emotive theme song. Charaterisations are a mixed bag. Lonsdale's Hugo Drax is one of the better Bond villains dignified well educated and wallowing in a life of luxury he's perfectly understated in Lonsdale's hands and in fact steals every scene he shares with Moore's Bond. Holly Goodhead Chiles is a bold Bond girl with many skills she's a scientist and an astronaut attractive and decently played by Chiles if a touch unmemorable in the Bond girl universe. Kiel is back as Jaws with the makers choosing to make him some love sick puppy dog where once was a unique villain now is cypher for slapstick and a crappy flipflop of plotting while the love interest for Jaws Dolly Blanche Ravalec is cringe worthy. Sadly this would be the last appearance of Bernard Lee as M but he leaves a favourable mark as does Desomond Llewelyn as Q but once again Moneypenny Lois Maxwell is all too brief the flirt and banter she used to share with Bond now seems long gone.With a committed Bond fan base trudging through the turnstiles to see the latest instalment the scifi fans intrigued by the themes of the story and the general blockbuster loving crowd Moonraker made a colossal 203 million at the worldwide box office. Making it the highest grossing Bond film so far a record that would stick until Brosnan's debut in 1995. While critical notices were not as bad as some would have you believe the critics clearly judging it on non Bond terms. Broccoli took notice of the fans though who were upset by the lack of respect to the serious side of Bond. He promised things would be different for Bond 12. 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Moonraker is directed by Lewis Gilbert and adapted to screenplay by Christopher Wood from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Roger Moore Lois Chiles Michael Lonsdale Richard Kiel and Corinne Dufour. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Jean Tournier.Bond 11 and 007 is tasked with finding out what happened to the Moonraker space shuttle that mysteriously disappeared up in space. His investigation takes him to the billionaire builder of the craft Hugo Drax where Bond discovers a fiendish plot to start a new world of perfect human beings.At the end of The Spy Who Loved Me we were told that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only but the gargantuan success of Star Wars and a rekindling of all things scifi led Albert Broccoli to send 007 out into space! Armed with a 30 million budget and using only the core base plotting of Fleming's novel the makers crafted what many feel is the runt of the James Bond litter. The money is up there on the screen it's excess overdrive outlandish from start to finish and actually is very very entertaining. The problem is that in James Bond terms it barely feels like a Bond movie it actually could be any bloke propelling the story this is a guy reliant on gadgets and not his brain or brawn quipping away purely for the sake of a cheap laugh. Ultimately it's a cash in both in terms of the scifi boom hitting the late 70s and of the James Bond name.If judged away from the Bond universe on its own popcorn terms film is a blast literally. As a whole it's a bit choppy but many of the parts desperately trying to make up a cohesive blockbuster are great entertainment. Mid air scrap for a parachute a cable car sequence brilliantly realised centrifuge chamber peril boat chase laser fight and much space age malarkey the film is chocked full of crowd pleasing moments. In fact it's often mistaken as being a film set in space when in fact the action doesn't move up there until the last half hour the previous hour and a half is spread out over France Italy Brazil USA Gutemala and of course England. The score and the title song however are very much Bond. With Barry and Bassey back respectively film is filled with appropriate atmospheric space strains and a hauntingly emotive theme song. Charaterisations are a mixed bag. Lonsdale's Hugo Drax is one of the better Bond villains dignified well educated and wallowing in a life of luxury he's perfectly understated in Lonsdale's hands and in fact steals every scene he shares with Moore's Bond. Holly Goodhead Chiles is a bold Bond girl with many skills she's a scientist and an astronaut attractive and decently played by Chiles if a touch unmemorable in the Bond girl universe. Kiel is back as Jaws with the makers choosing to make him some love sick puppy dog where once was a unique villain now is cypher for slapstick and a crappy flipflop of plotting while the love interest for Jaws Dolly Blanche Ravalec is cringe worthy. Sadly this would be the last appearance of Bernard Lee as M but he leaves a favourable mark as does Desomond Llewelyn as Q but once again Moneypenny Lois Maxwell is all too brief the flirt and banter she used to share with Bond now seems long gone.With a committed Bond fan base trudging through the turnstiles to see the latest instalment the scifi fans intrigued by the themes of the story and the general blockbuster loving crowd Moonraker made a colossal 203 million at the worldwide box office. Making it the highest grossing Bond film so far a record that would stick until Brosnan's debut in 1995. While critical notices were not as bad as some would have you believe the critics clearly judging it on non Bond terms. Broccoli took notice of the fans though who were upset by the lack of respect to the serious side of Bond. He promised things would be different for Bond 12. 710";

On my opinion this is Moore's best fourth outing as 007may be not saying too much but there are three films left and a very entertaining scifi film. Critics argue that humor plays a strong hand in this moviestrong to such a degree that Bond character loses all personality becoming blurred in an impressive set of FX and stunt men. I reply certainly there are flaws some of them particularly Jaws conversion towards the end very ridiculous. But there are good points too. Remember that precredit scene which was ACTUALLY shot in the air the motorboat chase or the final space battle one of the most spectacular moments of the entire series yeah it was unrealistic OK but tell me how much realism you can find watching other Bond movies which are frequently referred to as the best. Think of Goldfinger or You only live twiceHowever Moonraker does not compare to Octopussy or TSWLM because of a sometimes plodding pacing due to the addition of unnecessary scenes especially during the first half when James is Drax's guest in California. The love story is a mere and inferior copy of TSWLM. And while in other Moore's films the blend of humor and Bond's trademark coolness worked smoothly here Bond is not given a scene to show not necessarily ruthlessness but a bit of harshness as we could see in FYEO or Octopussy.Following Moore's outings will feature Cold War elements which seem to fit more with the character and better screenplays from Richard Maibaumthe series' screenwriter who was mysteriously absent here.But action remains mostly exciting sometimes brilliant and highlights what could have been a mediocre entry.".

	schema:headline " A brilliant Bond film that is highly underrated!";
	schema:reviewBody "Moonraker is the most unfairly criticised of all the Bond films. The 11th film in the series and the fourth starring Roger Moore Moonraker works very well for a number of reasons. As Ian Fleming's original novel written in 1955 had become too dated to translate to the screen the producers decided to capitalise on the scifi craze started by Star Wars and so created a spectacular spaceage adventure where Bond himself journeys into outer space.Whilst this film was certainly inspired by Star Wars this is not meant to imply that Moonraker copies directly from the former. Don't forget that only the last 2030 minutes of the film takes place in space. Although the laser battle looks dated by modern standards it is still a classic slice of Bond action that as one reviewer has stated compares with the underwater battle in Thunderball. And on that level it works superbly. What I especially like about Moonraker is the way it glides smoothly from one action sequence to another. This way there's not only no shortage of thrills but an overall level of consistency in the storyline is maintained where Bond hops across the globe to Venice and Rio for example uncovering clues as to the disappearance of the Moonraker space shuttle. On the way he survives the customary assassination attempts by the bad guys Drax and Jaws and then at the end of the film all the clues piece together to complete the jigsaw. It's steady consistent storylines like this that prove the key to a successful Bond film.Purists often accuse Moonraker of being too stupid. Although there are some pretty outrageous sight gags the film still retains its enormous appeal. Certainly Moonraker is the most lighthearted Bond film and it's quite clear that Roger Moore was enjoying himself tremendously here. His performance in this escapade certainly brought a smile to my lips.There's also a wonderful cast. Drax is quite possibly the best Bond villain. His oneliners are great and he is certainly not short of ideas on how to dispose of Bond. The beautiful Lois Chiles proves to have the right qualities as an astronautCIA agent and she is a worthy ally to 007. Bond's first romantic encounter Corinne Dufour Corinne Clery brings a lot to the film.  Richard Kiel makes his encore performance as the steeltoothed giant Jaws. After his superhuman appearance in The Spy Who Loved Me Jaws plays more for laughs this time round but his RoadrunnerWile E. Coyotetype battles with 007 are still entertaining. There's also another henchman Chang Toshiro Suga who provides more credibility if somewhat less invincibility in a superbly staged duel with Bond in a glass factory.Moonraker also sees John Barry at his composing best. He provides a number of rich atmospheric tracks that perfectly reflect the film's outer space theme. Shirley Bassey's third title song isn't quite as good as Goldfinger but better than Diamonds Are Forever and is certainly as good as Carly Simon's song for TSWLM.Moonraker has often been placed at the bottom of the Bond spectrum. It doesn't belong there. It has everything a successful Bond film needs a great plot superb villains exotic locations beautiful women brilliant special effects for which visual effects maestro Derek meddings received an Oscar nomination and action by the bucketful. There are scenes which generate genuine suspense and which feature aweinspiring stunts in midair and on water. The space scenes are well done and all aspects of the space shuttle look true to life. In summary Moonraker is a brilliant film in its own right and should rank up there with Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me as one of the best Bonds ever made. I strongly urge you doubters to take a second look.".

This being the 4th Roger Moore film as Bond and it being 8 years since Sean Connery it's getting easier to accept Mr. Moore in the 007 role. He's really coming into his own by now.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1960s Hollywood combined the classic caper film with a healthy dose of romantic comedy. The result was a series of charming films such as CHARADE 1963 and HOW TO STEAL A MILLION 1966films that combined major stars clever plots witty scripts and which balanced suspense with comic and romantic complications.Made in 1966 and released in 1967 GAMBIT was among the last of these films and like all others in the genre it had a complex plot. Ahmad Shahbandar Herbert Lom is quite possibly the richest man in the world and a recluse to boot a man who has never gotten over the death of his beautiful Eurasian wife some twenty years ago. Harry Dean Michael Caine devises a clever plan to gain access to his luxury apartment and rob him blind he will use honkytonk dancer Nicole Chang Shirley MacLaine who bears a striking resemblance to Shahbandar's long dead wife to breach Shahbandar's defenses.There's only one problem it won't work. To tell exactly why it won't work is to betray the plot which is extremely clever suffice to say that Dean has made a number of incorrect assumptions about both the situation and the personalities involved. When the plot begins to twist it does so in a truly unexpected way taking both Dean and the audience completely by surprise.This is the sort of film that Hollywood used to do so well but which we seldom see today a frothy glamorous confection with first rate production values and expert performances from major stars. MacLaine gets top billing and she is quite fine but the weight of the film rests on Caine and Lom who give memorably dry performances and director Ronald Neame who was responsible for a host of memorable films including THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE keeps everything moving along at a smart pace with plenty of style.This may not be the best of the genreI think both CHARADE and HOW TO STEAL A MILLION to name but two outpace it. But even so it is a perfectly charming film the perfect antidote to a drab afternoon. Just add popcorn! GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "Although perhaps not in the same topflight league as Rififi and Topkapi Gambit is nevertheless an extremely entertaining heist movie that features consistently fine performances an amusing and twisty script and good production values. In this one Caine hires MacLaine who is working as a dancehall girl in Hong Kong to assist him in the purloining of a priceless piece of sculpture owned by Herbert Lom. This is not your typical heist film however and there is a twist right around the first halfhour mark that really had me chuckling out loud...and I'm not an easy person to make laugh out loud at movies either. MacLaine plays one of her patented loveable kooks in this film and is ever so appealing. Caine in his first American production plays it alternately cool and exasperated. Lom is surprisingly good as Shabhandar one of the world's wealthiest men his performance is both urbane and beautifully modulated. Good in smaller parts are two faces that classic Star Trek fans will recognize John Abbott an Organian as the French art connoisseur and Roger Harry Mudd Carmel as a hotel clerk. The heist itself is fairly suspenseful and I suppose hightech for its day. Both Caine and MacLaine display surprising derringdo and quick thinking and toward the finale of the film the viewer is treated to at least three unexpected twists of plot. Gambit thus offers good suspense real wit some romance colorful locales and fine acting. It is a real winner. If you're a fan of the heist movie this one will not disappoint. It's good light welldone fun and infinitely more entertaining than recent serious caper films such as The Score and Heist. Check it out!".

It's a highly entertaining and very clever crime caper and is Caine's first American film. It benefits from highly polished production values and Ronald Neame's expert direction not to mention a story that has several unexpected twists.Aside from excellent performances by the two stars and Herbert Lom as the intended victim the plot will keep you guessing until the final moments. Shirley is a knockout in her oriental disguise and delivers a wonderful performance as the girl who discovers she prefers an honest man to a thief no matter how much she let herself be tricked into the role of a charming lookalike for Herbert Lom's former wife. The trick is to get into his lavish digs so she and Michael can see the layout and devise a plan to steal a prized sculpture. Herbert Lom is urbane and sophisticated as a man who is highly suspicious of his new acquaintances.If you like crime capers or jewel heists this is for you. Diverting from start to finish with a particularly good opening sequence that sort of sets you up for a different kind of film than this actually is. But saying more than that would give too much away.My only complaintMaurice Jarre's score is a skimpy one. He provides some light and catchy melodies for the lighter scenes but fails to deliver the goods for the film's darker moments. Maybe he figured the audience would just be holding their breath while silence accompanied the catlike burglar approach rather than music.

Lom is particularly good as the suave and wealthy Shabandahr proving to be a more wily target than CaineDeane had predicted. A nice conceit of the flick is the opening segment which lays out how CaineDeane imagines the caper will go the rest of the movie then contrasting how reality does not play out as imagined.

Harry Michael Caine discovers a dancer Nicole Shirley MacLaine in a cheap cabaret. You then see him offer her a job and they then go off on a caper to rob the richest man in the world Shahbandar Herbert Lom. The plan goes off like clockwork and the theft has worked perfectly. It is only then that you realize that most of what you see happening is what Harry is describing to his partner Emile John Abbott. Then and only then does Harry's plan actually unfold. However in this real caper so many of the details do NOT work out as Harry has plannedand his 'wife' Nicoleposing as the Missus is nothing like she is in the plan. In the plan she's silent and mysteriousbut in reality she's chatty but actually a whole lot smarter than Harry! What's next? See the film for yourself to find outbut be aware that there are lots and lots of twists and turns! Gambit is a very good filmI won't deny that. And it's nice that it is a more humorous and lighthearted sort of caper film. However and here is a problem it's in a genre that is absolutely glutted with exceptional films. So while Gambit is very good films like Rififi Grand Slam Big Deal on Madonna Street Bob le Flambeur and many others make it seem to be secondtier. Good but not among the many better films like it. My biggest complaints was the bizarre casting of MacLaine as a Eurasianwhy not have her play an American?! as well as perhaps too many twists near the end for its own good. However Shirley MacLaine and Herbert Lom are particularly good in the film. Worth your time but not a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gambit 1966I love both Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine and yet I went into the movie with low expectations. Maybe this was partly the dull poster art which is all I had to go on or just the fact I had never heard of the movie and I see a lot of movies from this era.And it was really good! Yes a fun snappy somewhat contrived but still engaging piece of very 1960s entertainment. It begins with a narrative trick which I can't reveal but the first twenty minutes is a kind of setup or reference point for the next hour. Once you see it happen it's a big laugh and they actors play it out well though with a slight bit of camp. Caine plays a thief and con man and MacLaine is just a willing and slightly naive participant. At first.We are supposed to believe as well that these two young charming people are not made for each other they act disinterested but the love story becomes a small part of the situation. The third main actor is Herbert Lom who plays an Arab connected to oil this is several years before the oil embargo and more than a decade before the first big Islamic uprising the one in Iran in 1979. He happens to be the richest man in the world. And a target for this British man looking for easy success.Easy it is if only things were what they seemed at first. Brightly lit photographed with verve and acted with a kind of wink to the camera the movie is just good fun. This isn't a drama it's a comedy and it will brighten your day even if you have to ignore the forced twists in the plot. Michael Caine had just finished filming the astonishing Alfie which is both funny and truly dramatic and he was proving to be a complex and yet still caddishly likable leading man very British. Shirley MacLaine an American had been making charming funny movies for some time playing the cute and vulnerable girl over and over as in The Apartment best of all but see Irma la Douce too where she is a prostitute. Together here they are really well matched and hold up the movie start to finish. Remember to make it through the setup part of the movie which will at first seem a little stiff. It makes sense later!".

	schema:reviewBody "Any film with Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine has real potential for being delightful. Add to it Herbert Lom as a powerful but not really bad fellow for a change and it is headed for being terrific. What carries it to the top is it's sense of spoofing. For GAMBIT came at the end of the first sequence of crime movies where a scheme for the big robbery or whatever was the crime involved was carefully step by step explained to the audience as it was done. The best known of these films were THE ASPHALT JUNGLE RIFFIFI TOPKAPI THE KILLING OCEAN'S ELEVEN the original one with Frank Sinatra. Normally the schemes are flawlessly carried out but some small error blows the game away such as THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN or THE LAVENDER HILL MOB or there are internecine jealousies that destroy the plan RIFFIFI THE ASPHALT JUNGLE or outsiders destroy the plan THE KILLING OCEAN'S ELEVEN. But GAMBIT changes this deliciously.The movie is actually two films one about thirty minutes long interesting but mechanical and the other about eighty minutes long which makes a total hash of the initial film. We see Caine and his partner John Abbott looking at Maclaine in the dance hallbar she works at. She is important for some reason tied to her face. Soon after hiring her they show her a file on the life of Shabandar Lom the world's richest man living in a country like Indonesia or Malaysia. He is a lonely man ever since his one beloved wife died some twenty five years before  and she resembled Maclaine. They head for the city that Shabandar lives in planning to check into the hotel that is his home and headquarters as aristocrats. They know his secret police will bring Maclaine's appearance to Lom's attention. He is fascinated by her and takes her out to dinner while Caine explains he has to await for some phone calls. You see him doing some robbery in Lom's apartment which is electronically protected  but he is able to handle that to get at a rare ancient bust of a princess which looks like the late Mrs. Shabandar and Maclaine. At a given timed moment she excuses herself to go to the powder room leaving her bag behind to allay suspicion but gets a cab which picks up Caine at the hotel and takes them to the airport where they leave for London.And that half hour gives the whole scheme. As Caine explains it to Abbott it is perfect. Not a seam in it.Soon the seams begin to be shown here.First off Caine imagines Maclaine is putty in his hand doing what he wants without any questions. From the start she is nothing but asking questions. This drives him crazy like when she questions whether Lom can be the richest man in the world or not Caine shouts back in desperation OKAY HE'S NOT THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD...HE'S THE FIFTH OR THE FOURTEENTH! WHAT THE HELL DOES IT MATTER!! It still would not be totally offcentered if Caine in his research had been more careful. Lom as typical for Herbert Lom is an exceptionally smart guy  and very modern. He later explains to a bemused Caine that years before he allowed his inner sanctum to be invaded by a reporter and photographer and had dressed up like a religious Mohammadan but that was just window dressing. Since Caine has based his scheme on the information from that same article one can imagine his feelings.Even Abbott who plays a small part in the robbery plans has problems. He is supposed to call Caine to tell him that he has to call back that night to give added details for the sake of a naturally suspicious Lom. But instead of using a specific pay phone as planned Abbott can't even get into the phone booth because of a belligerent local man who is angrily making a telephone call.As you can see from these examples the second movie the eighty minutes following the opening is like a guide book to why planning can only be a failure. It is a welcome antidote to the idiotic flawless plans that are at the center of the other films. And the three leads four with Abbott are enjoying the joke. The film is not will the plan be a success but will it succeed despite the flaws that nobody even thought could arise.Only in the Sinatra OCEAN'S ELEVEN was there a similar sense of fun  as the Rat Pack realizes the inanity of the film plot there robbing the Vegas casinos on one night with the lights of Dino Sammy Frank Joey and the others working with precision when they'd prefer being drunk. Here Caine and Maclaine try to keep to an impossible time table and scheme after realizing they are not dealing with a tradition bound millionaire but one who fully likes using antiburglary devices based on modern electronics. Yet they do manage to get done in time for the double possibly triple surprise at the conclusions of the movie.An absolute joy particularly seeing Lom being really pleasant for most of the film  except for one moment but it passes quite quickly. It certainly deserves the kudos it has received as a first rate adventure comedy".

	schema:reviewBody "Fans of caper films and stylish heist yarns should be pleased with this wellappointed entry. Caine plays a shifty Englishman who recruits a jaded Eurasian dancehall girl MacLaine to aid him in his latest plot. Due to her resemblance to the dead wife of the richest man in the world Lom he plans to use her to gain entry to the man's heavily guarded suite where he can map out a way to pilfer a priceless piece of sculpture. He intends to gussy MacLaine up in the appropriate hairstyle clothing and manner of the dead woman knowing that Lom will be fascinated enough by her to let his guard down. To reveal more would rob firsttime viewers of some of the twistier elements of the script. A significant twist occurs about a quarter of the way in and it isn't the last one. The story begins one way and then takes off on a different tangent giving the audience a chance to amply discover that the best laid plans don't always turn out they way they're intended to! Caine was just emerging as a major name in the cinema and gives a lowkey but assured performance here. His stern understated persona is a terrific counterpoint to the more animated MacLaine she handpicked him for this role. MacLaine is given a considerable showcase which allows her to display her range. She plays both a demure silent deliberately mechanical type and a chatty animated opinionated person. She also gets to show off her incredibly limber physique in one climactic scene. Lom is excellent conveying a sure authority and a suave aristocratic presence. Though the film is chiefly a three character showcase all the other roles are portrayed by talented character actors. One small role is played by Tayback who would later make a splash as the loudmouthed shortorder cook on TV's Alice. The film is visually arresting thanks to excellent set design art direction and some eyecatching Jean Louis costumes. It's glossy tasteful oldfashioned entertainment featuring two charismatic stars. Caine and MacLaine would pair up again the next year in Woman Times Seven and be reunited almost 40 years later in Bewitched.".

This is the sort of film you'd expect the ending to go a certain just about predictable way and it absolutely doesn't at all like there are no clues of where the film is really taking the audience. And there's a good moral right at the death too which is really where the whole movie is driving.Dialog is very good too with some good wit and that avoid the tacky lines this sort of film will often throw at the viewer. Caine is good as always Lom as the villain does his job just right and Maclaine manages her role very well and looks absolutely gorgeous here.There's just enough originality and volume to this film to break the usual monotonous storytelling its genre will often supply and it's well balanced that it starts as intriguingly as it ends.Good stuff ! 810.".

Although he has about equal time Michael Caine has the slightly larger part as being behind the gambit. But MacLaine's star was firmly established by this time and Caine's was just beginning to rise. Fans may be surprised to learn that most of the first decade of Caine's career was spent in TV series with an occasional TV movie. His solid grasp of stardom didn't come until 1964 with his performance in Zulu.The entertainment of this film is based mostly on the cleverness of the plot and screenplay over any witty or funny dialog. It has a smattering of antics but mostly it's a nice caper film with a light treatment of the crime. This is one of those films that for true appreciation and enjoyment one must not know much of the actual plot. Just know that it has some surprises. Caine is good as Harry Dean and MacLaine is very good as Nicole Chang. But the supporting cast helps enrich the plot and movie overall. Herbert Lom is very good as Ahmad Shahbandar and John Abbott is very good as Emile Fournier. Roger Carmel is good as Ram. Without much comedy in the dialog or funny antics Gambit doesn't get near the top of the caper comedies. For instance it can't compare to one of Caine's top films Dirty Rotten Scoundrels of 1988. But this plot is ingenious and the film holds one's interest very well. So it belongs on the list of good caper comedies and is worth the price to watch.".

We'd be there for a couple of days and stay in a local BB over night. When we get called onto the set we go below decks on a British submarine that is decked out like a second world war German U Boat. Now it seems in the film the U Boat has run aground on a sand bank on an inlet river in South America and is waiting for the tide to turn so it can refloat. Meanwhile Peter O'Toole is trying to chop a very large tree down and put it across our Sub. Thus causing us some discomfort. Got the plot so far he's dropping trees and I'm in the basement.. A cute make up girl asks me to strip to the waist and I think from the shoes up what no flowers? We've only just met but she has to put make up on my face and body to make me look tanned as if I was in South America. Bert Batt the 1st A.D. took us all to see the Director Peter Yates of Bullitt fame and I was chosen to be the blue eyed German working the controls of the Sub.. After a few different angles the make up girl applies sweat to my hair and face. The camera is stuck an inch from my nose. Now we are talking about close ups here. My face plastered sixty foot by eighty foot at the Odeon Marble Arch. She could have saved on the sweat I was sweating for England. Peter was guiding me through the shots. ''Imagine you can hear a noise above you. Now imagine there's a noise to your left now to your right. Don't move your head Back too far we're close on your eyes.'' Then it was ''CUT see you in the morning Eight O clock.. Thanks Harry that was good''. Well that was good for me too. It took me hours to come down. Me Jerry and Nick went out on the town and got very drunk. Well it makes a change? The next day I'm back at the controls of the Sub and I'm thinking is it to be another starring role. Peter tells us today's the day the Sub gets hit and there could be a drop of water splashing around. First scene control roomI'm standing at the controls and Peter talks me through it. ''Now concentrate on the controls Harry and keep looking about. It seems the tide is coming in and you're going to be all right. Now give a huge sigh of relief. It's very quiet now but suddenly !!!!! CRASH !!!!. That's the cue for the Prop men to sling big buckets of freezing cold water over me. ''You're panicking now Harry He's got good eyesight More water on him and CUT. I spent most of the rest of the day sitting on the Sub deck enjoying the warm sun while the Stuntmen got their share of the water. We shot some other stuff in one of the cabins drinking beers then it was time to head off back to London. Thanks Mr. Yates. You must remember in the film game that all the shots don't make it to the big screen a lot end up on the cutting room floor".

We've only just met but she has to put make up on my face and body to make me look tanned as if I was in South America. Bert Batt the 1st A.D. took us all to see the Director Peter Yates of Bullitt fame and I was chosen to be the blue eyed German working the controls of the Sub.. After a few different angles the make up girl applies sweat to my hair and face. The camera is stuck an inch from my nose. Now we are talking about close ups here. My face plastered sixty foot by eighty foot at the Odeon Marble Arch. She could have saved on the sweat I was sweating for England. Peter was guiding me through the shots. ''Imagine you can hear a noise above you. Now imagine there's a noise to your left now to your right. Don't move your head Back too far we're close on your eyes.'' Then it was ''CUT see you in the morning Eight O clock.. Thanks Harry that was good''. Well that was good for me too. It took me hours to come down. Me Jerry and Nick went out on the town and got very drunk. Well it makes a change? The next day I'm back at the controls of the Sub and I'm thinking is it to be another starring role. Peter tells us today's the day the Sub gets hit and there could be a drop of water splashing around. First scene control roomI'm standing at the controls and Peter talks me through it. ''Now concentrate on the controls Harry and keep looking about. It seems the tide is coming in and you're going to be all right. Now give a huge sigh of relief. It's very quiet now but suddenly !!!!! CRASH !!!!. That's the cue for the Prop men to sling big buckets of freezing cold water over me. ''You're panicking now Harry He's got good eyesight More water on him and CUT. I spent most of the rest of the day sitting on the Sub deck enjoying the warm sun while the Stuntmen got their share of the water. We shot some other stuff in one of the cabins drinking beers then it was time to head off back to London. Thanks Mr. Yates. You must remember in the film game that all the shots don't make it to the big screen a lot end up on the cutting room floor";

	schema:headline " Revenge and the Lone Survivor";
	schema:reviewBody "It arises in every war. Destruction on a grand scale and then a private battle on a more secular stage. In every massacre quotes the sage there is always a survivor. Such is the premise in the film Murphy's War. During the final months of World War Two a German UBoat commander Horst Janson cruising the South American coast line attacks and sinks a British ship of war killing all aboard. Examining the ship's wreckage the German commander is satisfied he not only destroyed the English ship but did in fact kill the entire crew. Leaving the carnage behind the audience realizes an English sailor from the stricken ship survived. His name is Murphy brilliantly played by Peter O'Toole. Having lived through the terrifying ordeal many would believe one should be glad to be alive and to seek a safe distance between himself and the deadly submarine. That is not the conclusion of seaman Murphy who believes the only way he will be able to rid himself of the nightmarish screams of his dying comrades is to seek out and destroy the German UBoat. This might be a deathwish to some but not to Murphy who believes that regardless of the inevitable outcome of the war his sole purpose in life is revenge. Trying to convince him of this mad adventure is Dr. Hayden Sian Phillips a female doctor working among the tribal people of the Amazon. In addition Murphy not only discovers a repairable English seaplane but an amiable aging and exhausted Oil company employee named Louis Brezon. Philippe Noiret Louie has worked in the forgotten backwaters of the Amazon for years patiently waiting the end of the war. Now with Murphy seeking his help and relentless revenge Louie offer's a bit of sound advice. You're a small and lonely man Murphy like me the world will never build us a monument. The only difference is I know that. Thus the confrontation between the obsessed man and the powerful Submarine easilly become classic drama. ".

Here you'll see him in a rather unexpected macho role and he's as convincing as Lawrence general Tanz or any other characters he's ever played. This is pretty much a onemanshow and what a show! While his vengeance is of course reminiscent of Ahab's personal vendetta Murphy's war is all about O'Toole's intensity and his unmatched ability to capture madness pain obsession selfabsorption.As I understood O'Toole did most of the stunts himself so the horrified look on his face in the breath taking plane sequence was actually the real deal. Well I guess that explains the feel of authenticity. Either way that must be one of the most memorable moments of the genre.It was a pleasant surprise to see that Germans actually speak German which is unusual for that particular era of moviemaking. Remember Where Eagles Dare where Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood wanted to pass as Germans officers while speaking in English or The Night of the Generals where French generals where talking to each other in English. It's a detail of no major importance by any means but it ads to the overall impression of realism.This drama about the devastating effects of war with great acting a most realistic flight sequence and a surprising conclusion that fits perfectly  is not to be missed.I'm still hoping for a better DVD transfer in Region 2.".

When a film with a straightforward narrative and a relatively simple plot with very few characters can rivet you to your seat right until the end you have a hell of a story on your hands! The wide 2.351 format and outstanding cinematography by Oscar winner Douglas Slocombe are ideally matched to the location and type of action. And the reviewer who thinks the role of Murphy isn't suited for Peter O'Toole should have his head examined! O'Toole IS Murphy as much as he IS Lawrence of Arabia. Murphy's progression deeper and deeper into a vengeanceclouded mania is masterfully accomplished he's in good company here along with Gregory Peck's Captain Ahab in Moby Dick Spencer Tracy's Old Man in The Old Man and the Sea and Robert Shaw's Captain Quint in Jaws O'Toole's tenacious Irishman Murphy is an inspiration easily absorbed and applied to all situations in which one may be considered the underdog by a wide margin. In other words Murphy isn't an ironic post modern antihero. He's the old fashioned everyman overcoming incredible odds to achieve his ends kind of hero. One could critique the film from sociological or psychological perspectives and question whether the screenwriter intended for Murphy to symbolize the evil war can bring out in man or the greatness or both. But without reading anything into it Murphy's War is on a primary level simply a terrific action yarn well worth owning on DVD.".

The performances setting and story all work together to draw you into its dark and dangerous world.Most notably of all the Uboat commander and his men are portrayed as human beings. Efficient determined ruthless but they too have feelings and hate the whole damn war just as much as Murphy. This was unusual in war films up until then and its progressive enlightened approach to the war enhances the story.

This was unusual in war films up until then and its progressive enlightened approach to the war enhances the story. We understand and even feel for Murphy but we too must understand that sometimes we need to let go accept our losses be glad we survived and realise that our enemies are human too.";

Interesting and moving script by prestigious Sterling Silliphant  saddling some nice action scenes at the ending  when it takes place a relentless pursuit between a boat and the sub  specially in the last reel . Sensational acting by Peter O'Toole as the lone survivor from a British naval ship who seeks revenge when his ship is sunk by the Germans and gunned down most of its crew . However  his extreme obsession with desire for vengeance upon the Germans isn't believable  but the moments that click make the movie more than worthwhile . This character about an avenger who seeks revenge on those who killed his crewmates bears remarkable resemblance to Moby Dick's Captain Ahab by Herman Melville . Other important players are  Philippe Noiret as his supporter and sympathetic helper gives a mesmerizing acting  Sin Phillips as a goodtempered nurse and Horst Janson as a captain who massacred the Allied shipmates in the water .Magnificent color cinematography on tropical places by Douglas Slocombe . Adequate as well as stirring musical score by John Barry . The motion picture was compellingly made by Peter Yates and splendidly edited by film editor John Glen  subsequently director of James Bond movies . Never a prolific director Peter Yates subsequently made only a few more films . His best films include the stylish and ingenious caper comedy Hot Rock 1972 the underwater adventure Deep 1977 based on the novel and screenplay by Peter Benchley  and the quirky comingofage comedy Breaking away 1979. For the latter Yates received simultaneous Oscar nominations as Best Director and Best Producer and the enjoyably oldfashioned comedy Curtain call 1998 starring Michael Caine and Maggie Smith as a couple of theatrical ghosts . He was nominated again for a more cerebral 'actor's piece' The dresser 1983 starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay  based on a play about an ageing stage actor and his longstanding assistant. It was followed by a flop titled Eleni 1985 with John Malkovich . Most memorable perhaps were the courtroom thriller Suspect 1987 and the political drama House de Carroll Street 1988 2011  following directing a few films until death in 2011 age 81.".

If your heart doesn't start beating faster and if you don't have a smile on your face when you see this shot you need medical attention.  Go rent this movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "This film was fictionalized so that it could be viewed by civilians. What actually happened was far worse than shown in the movie. When the Germans invade the native hospital they killed the doctor and all of the civilian natives they could find. They did this to conceal their presence and activities from the world once the war was over. The film crew had to use a Grumman Duck because they could not find a Vought Kingfisher. The mechanic that was trying to learn to fly the plane would never have looped and rolled it but like any producer they did it to maintain interest in the film. The river used in the movie was the Orinoco in Venezuela even though the incident happened on the amazon in Brazil. The fact that the crew and captain might have been tried for war crimes had they left any of the survivors alive led them to eliminate all known survivors. The movie tries to show what survivors would have had to do in reality to achieve justice. Of course no one tried the victors. The German crew killed less than 300 people while the fire bombing of Tokyo killed 200000 people. Perhaps the message the film tried to establish was that only the meek shall survive. I loved the scene near the end when Louie walks off abandoning his only source of income to a lunatic. In reality he would have refused to let the tug go to sea in the first place. When Peter would scream full speed ahead in the real world Louie would have shut off the fuel line. This is one of the best movies around and the flying sequence is magnificent. Having flown a Giles 202 for five years the aerobatics were something I know about from first hand experience and the loops and rolls were easy. I was also in a Sabreliner when it was rolled but to roll the Duck is something I would never have done. To take a plane that had been so severely damaged and and then to loop it is beyond any form of possibility. The plane as shown in the movie did not have enough power to go vertical and once it got inverted the engine would have quit as the plane stalled inverted.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure this MAY contain spoilers but the thing that will be more spoiled is your time by watching it. It took me a while to realize it was a PG13 movie but then I realized I didn't hear any naughty words. This is a teenage bank robbery  hostage flick.That would explain why people talk like teenagers and that the cop in charge acts like a teenager instead of like all of other hostage negotiators you may have seen in all of those R rated bank hostage movies. R for realistic The biggest problem was that it was trying SO HARD to be funny or witty or whatever and it was just STUPID.Quick question for those who've seen the film. Do banks have PHONES any more? I believe they DO but you wouldn't know it if you saw this movie. I just remember one ringing RIGHT AWAY with the cop in charge calling in like the first 3 minutes of just about every other bank hostage flick I've ever seen. I also remember the copincharge REALLY knowing what he's doing too you know like he's taken a class or something.The thing that I find a real shame about this is that technically it was well made  all the pieces where there. The story wasn't really bad as an outline. The DIALOG was a BIG problem along with the lack of believable characters and editing that was too smart for itself by way of lock stock and two smoking barrels whose selfconscience style has infected cinema with its smallscreen editing and overlays. Please give me a long shot and some atmosphere! There's one good thing about this film however Erika Christensen is HOT and seriously if it weren't for her I would have stopped this within the first half hour.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sure this MAY contain spoilers but the thing that will be more spoiled is your time by watching it. It took me a while to realize it was a PG13 movie but then I realized I didn't hear any naughty words. This is a teenage bank robbery  hostage flick.That would explain why people talk like teenagers and that the cop in charge acts like a teenager instead of like all of other hostage negotiators you may have seen in all of those R rated bank hostage movies. R for realistic The biggest problem was that it was trying SO HARD to be funny or witty or whatever and it was just STUPID.Quick question for those who've seen the film. Do banks have PHONES any more? I believe they DO but you wouldn't know it if you saw this movie. I just remember one ringing RIGHT AWAY with the cop in charge calling in like the first 3 minutes of just about every other bank hostage flick I've ever seen. I also remember the copincharge REALLY knowing what he's doing too you know like he's taken a class or something.The thing that I find a real shame about this is that technically it was well made  all the pieces where there. The story wasn't really bad as an outline.

Having seen this on Canadian cable I was certain that this was one of the movies created as filler to satisfy their Canadianmade content requirement and I was prepared to rip into my government again for funding this. So I was somewhat pleased that as far as I can tell Hollywood gets to own responsibility for this mess. What is the world coming to when Canadian cable is involved a competent film like Passchendaele and Hollywood gives us How To Rob a Bank? It's a new dawn.The entire film seems to be about how two cute new adults can sound really really cool when they deal with all the incredibly stupid people around them. Stupid people like cops bankers criminal masterminds and so on. I think the inevitable porn version of this film is actually going to have a better plot with better acting.The story is based on the entire idea that a criminal mastermind couldn't hack a simple 4digit PIN. There are only 10000 possible PINs. It's not that difficult. If you are capable of hacking the system to divert service fees to another account you can crack or reprogram a PIN.By the way how are they going to withdraw those funds? You can't get it out of an ATM. You have to transfer it somewhere else. And that is tracked and held of course.And how about the bank's own tracking software? You think they don't notice when one penny is out of place? Trust me. No fee diversion scam will work for longer than one day. Those numbers are checked so many different ways automatically by a separate computer. This might have made some sense at the time of Superman III but that time has long since passed.Bad script bad acting REALLY bad computer screen with nothing on it.Really to justify all the nonsense in this film it really cries out for John McClane to come in and sort things out about half an hour in. That would be a great short film.I gave it a 5 solely because the two leads aren't bad to look at.".

I saw that this was an independent movie with a first time director released by IFC and it looked like it might be a cool little flick. Boy was I wrong. This thing is one of the worst films I have ever seen. If I had any power I would nominate this for a Razzie Award. It would win. Definitely the worst film of the year nomination. The story goes nowhere cinematically photographically or thematically. Some of the acting is worse than a high school drama. Witness the exchange between the COP on the street and the angry young man trapped in the bank. I don't know if I can blame the actors as they look completely lost as if they have no idea of what they are supposed to be doing and no direction. The lead performances are schizophrenic without tracking any kind of performance. One minute the man trapped in the bank vault with the horribly cheese ball sexy receptionist is freaking out in a panic and the next he is chill and calm and delivering smooth cool lines to the femme fatal. Horrible. The dialog is trying so hard to be clever but it trips all over it's self conscious self. The clumsy attempt to message this plot out with a angry protest cry at banks for charging  1.50 ATM fees is laughable  but not funny.The direction and production blatantly audition for an ultra mainstream Hollywood production in attempts to look slick and keep the camera fluid but just call attention to itself in it's half baked passionless committee driven excuse for a movie. IFC I want my  6.99 back.".

David Carradine is a nice touch even if only actually see him oncei recognized his voice from a mile away without looking into credits first.all in all is a good progressive time waster. it entertains";

So is the skillful editing and often original cinematographic style. This time however it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity Brad Pitt Benicio Del Toro.Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and nearincomprehensible Gypsy boxer.Like Ritchie's earlier film this one takes a little while to find its feet but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.When it comes to comedies I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh you won't find much to better Snatch.".

I watched Lock Stock and though I did like it it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch that's a completely different story all together.When I saw Snatch at the cinemas I was shocked to see a couple leave only fifteen minutes into the film.  As they left you could hear their intellectually deficient comments this movie is so boring.  I couldn't believe it!  I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE The Pope even!There are hundreds of thousands of reasons for anyone to see this movie each word of the script being a reason.Snatch is possibly one of THE best written movies I've seen. It's smart witty funny and has just the right touches of dark humour.  With characters like Turkish Mickey Tommy Brick Top Bullet Tooth Tony and Cousin Avi their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full for months after watching it.  The camera work and editing complement each other to keep the film's pace on its toes much like the boxers at the center of the character's stories.Jason Statham has some of THE best lines in the movie constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner Tommy has to say.  Brad Pitt turns out an excellent performance as the IrishGypsyPykie Mickey his accent is hilarious.  Even though the story line is only a simple one following a massive Diamond through England's criminal underworld it is the connections each character has to the diamond and each other that really makes this film stand out from all the usual jewelheist films.Another 10  10 from me on this one it's just a pity the follow up to Snatch was a collaborative effort from Mr. Richie and his um.......wife.".

Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.By now you know the plot or plots. We follow a diamondheist and the various characters trying to get theirs at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow every character connects with the rest at least once.There are complaints that the movie is confusing or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you such as what the dog has to do with anything but he's a VERY important character and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points Think The Ring vs. Ringu did we need the How long could you survive down there all alone? line?. Rather we just watch occurrences and have to piece together what ties everything together the plot weaves together beautifully.The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes slowdownstopgo makes it difficult to stop watching the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying Zee Germans and things like It's not like he's a set of car keys now is it? quite a bit. Naturally Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.Summary watch the movie and don't expect to be TOLD everything expect to have to pay attention.".

Let's see if we can keep this straightTurkish Jason Statham and his partner Tommy Stephen Graham are amateur boxing promoters who after their premier fighter is wounded have to find a replacement to fight or one of the meanest guys in London Brick Top Alan Ford who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.

Meanwhile there is a diamond the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers Benicio Del Toro. On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond trouble ensues and his fence Cousin Avi Dennis Farina is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony Vinnie Jones and Doug The Head' Denovitz Mike Reid.  Of course this can't happen easily as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film Boris The Blade' Yurinov Rade Serbedzija  or as he's better known Boris the Bullet Dodger'.  Did you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many oneliners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on the film transcends brilliant and becomes FANinsert your choice of expletive hereTASTIC.  The slick cinematography lightningfast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis techno and a traditionalsounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.

While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan and have been for the last two decades I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the Swept Away' path rather to get back to the work that has earned him welldeserved high praise.

The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius stripstyle plot line where the concept of time is no longer linear instead constantly folding in upon itself flitting between past present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie an unknown British director took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent who when he's not running his gambling operation manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil a mumbling manic motormouthed piker who also happens to be a onepunch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a fourfingered degenerate gamblerjewel thief a vicious boxing promoter a gang of inept robbers a polite hitman a crazed Russian gun runner a group of Irish gypsies a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet you soon will be.Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Mr. Madonna's Ritchie first film was shot on a small budget with a noname cast except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel Snatch is stylistically very similar to Lock Stock  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film that may make some people uncomfortable think Very Bad Things.  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film how with roughly twenty principal characters does one adequately flesh out each character and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages  each actor is full bodied receives ample screen time and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum is Alan Ford as Brick Top the promoter with a penchant for pigs who epitomizes coldblooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however I would have to go with Brad PittPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from Kalifornia and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O'Neil the hard drinking wily grifter and parttime pugilist Pitt displays a wide range of emotions demonstrating again that he is not only a star but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.While Snatch initially struggles to find its stride and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.".

	schema:headline " Just as much fun as Lock Stock. Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions threw them into a maze gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist and yelled out load SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING WINS! What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.Snatch is a confusing twisting crazy movie.  Let me repeat that.  This movie is crazy!  Imagine the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid and this is what you get my friend.  Believe it or not this mass confusion and complete insanity is very very entertaining.The movie has it's problems.  First off for those of you who have seen Snatch's predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you know that Guy Richie the writer and director of both films has a very musicvideo style as far as the camera angles movements and cinematography goes.  The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater.  I was also turned off by this madness. However most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour so it doesn't last.If any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can.  Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock but when it's funny you'll laugh till your lungs burst.  It was nice to see Vinnie Jones who was Big Chris in the last movie return as the same basic character only now named Bullet Tooth Tony and doing the same slamming victim's head in a car door act again.  The performances were just as great as Lock Stock with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack.  I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn't have a bigger role.  I was expecting him to be a lead character but he's not.So in conclusion if you have never seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie's style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction unlike most people but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp you will most likely like Snatch and Lock Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock you have deprived your life of culture.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the first showing of Snatch in my town this past Friday.  I loved it. I am quite a fan of Guy Ritchie's first and was expecting more of the same with Snatch.  Rarely do a film's opening credits hype an audience as much as Snatch.  Quick paced actiontofreezeframecuts introduce each cast member in situations that identify their character sort.  Then we're right in it. It's true similarities abound between Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  From Vinnie Jones' character's tough as nails negotiating means to oft referred to injokes between characters 'Zee Germans' here compared to 'Tubby Tommy' in LS2SB.  Still the film is fresh and not really a Lock Stock take 2 of any sort. The humor is more frequent in this one and a major difference is how dark this film is compared to the previous.  Alan Ford's Brick Top is the meanest SOB I can remember on film since Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.  Brad Pitt is a standout too as the never to be trusted One Punch Mickeyhe's not as incomprehensible as the trailers make him out to be but still that pikey accent is a huge laugh.  And the scene where he is glaring at a burning trailer lumped my throat when you find the context by which that scene is drawn it should get a reaction from anyone. The use of violence as humor is more embellished in Snatch as well eg the Bullet Tooth Tony and Boris the Blade showdown. Secondary characters are all over the movie and all grab laughs from their scenes  especially the dog and the tank of a getaway driver Tyrone.See this movie for it's frenetic energy retribution for the good guys is all that ties the end together but the ride to the finale is what makes this movie great.  After all as a wiser man than myself once said it's not where you go it's how you get there.  Snatch is all about the ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time since copied has very odd and profane characters accents that are difficult to understand and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So why do I enjoy this film being an oldfashioned soandso?Well because I usually enjoy stylish filmmaking and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets fascinating visuals odd camera angles and various tricks sound effects etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy played by American Brad Pitt is almost intelligible.This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film at least for the first viewing or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.Since the action changes every two minutes to another scene with other people Lord of The Rings subsequently did the same it's had to get lulled to sleep or have your mind wander. Something wacky is going on every few minutes. The attitudes of the criminals are rough these are lowlife people in the underworld extremely tough people with the toughest being Bricktop Alan Ford who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of fwords in here too.The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange so cartoonlike that  combined with the unique visuals  it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release  at least here in the States such as Jason Statham The Transporter but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all toughtalking almostcrude men plus a funny dog. It's so weird I'll just end with the clich that this is not for all tastes but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Diamond heist by Franky Four Fingers is carried out and he flies into London on a stop over.  He goes to Boris The Blade for a gun and Boris tells him to go to the bookies for him and put money on a fight in exchange. Boris then sets Frankie up and has a group of men waiting to rob the bookies and Frankie.  The fight in question is also difficult because promoters Turkish and Tommy have promised local villain Brick Top that they'll put up a fighter.  Said fighter is put in hospital by a gypsy Tommy buys a caravan from Mickey.  Putting Mickey in the fight makes things worse when he not only refuses to take a dive but knocks the fighter out  to Bricktop's displeasure!  Meanwhile Frankie's boss flies into London to find him and the jewel while Bricktop tries to catch the men who Boris sent to knock over his bookies.I had seen Lock Stock and enjoyed it to a certain degree.  It had problems but it was fresh and had energy and style.  It relaunched the British gangster film with some good ones and some bad copies.  One of those copies was Snatch  admittedly a copy by the same director!  This film has all the style and energy of the Lock Stock and borrows heavily from it.  However it is clear that the plot is both weak and overplotted if that's possible!. It is weak because it is so full of clich and silly occurrences and it is overplotted in that every scene needs more plot in order to explain the new thing that just happened!What keeps it watchable is Ritchie's style and energy.  The plot may not work but it moves along with pace that almost almost covers it's lack of substance.  So we get the same old cockney gangsterisms dark humour Vinnie Jones being tough with a few good lines and so on.  It felt to me like Ritchie just didn't have any other ideas in him.  It's all very samey but his style saves it as he intercuts and delivers some really inventive shots. In tune with this style and energy is the casting.  The film is much better cast that it deserves!Statham and Graham are the least colourful characters in the piece and Ritchie knows it  so despite being the leads they often play second fiddle and only act as the catalyst.  Ford Reid Jones et al all enjoy delivering tough old stereotypes and do well enough considering what they're there to do.  Pitt is a great bit of casting  and here he is DELIBERATELY doing a bad Irish accent unlike Devil's Own where it was an accident!.  He is funny and seems to enjoy playing out of type.  Likewise Del Toro and Farina can only help add class to the film.Overall though this is a victory for style over substance.  It's visual style and general energy will carry it for the running time but when it was over I found it had failed to make any lasting impact on it and I really could remember very little of it  it had just seemed noisy and in a rush to get somewhere.  Sure I enjoyed it while it was on but as little as 10 minutes afterwards I realised that I'd been taken for a ride by the style and flair of Ritchie.  At time of writing it is 199 in the top 250  you gotta be kidding me!".

	schema:reviewBody "Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list and I noticed that Snatch was on the list so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.I stayed at my uncle's apartment and he told me that you have to watch some of Guy Ritchie's movies before watching Snatch to get to know his movies better so I watched Revolver. I was not very keen on it and then I was not looking forward to see Snatch.While my uncle was not at home I decided to watch it. I wanted to turn it off after the first second because I thought it was so weird. I'm 14 years old now and I knew almost nothing about cinema back then and I had never seen such a movie like Snatch and it's style! I thought it would be stupid of me to turn it off after 1 second so I kinda forced myself to watch it. To be honest I actually loved the weird style after 10 minutes!The cinematography was great. I had never seen something like that before and the editing was just as great too. There were lots of great characters and the script was excellent. It was funny and clever and it will you make you laugh every single second! This movie is like Pulp Fiction. You can almost quote every line! The acting was totally awesome! Jason Statham Vinnie Jones and the rest were great but Brad Pitt totally stole the show!I was thinking to myself This movie can't be any better! but then it got better! Brad Pitt showed up! His accent got me laughing all the time! My stomach hurt it literally hurt and I got many bruises on my thighs because I could not stop hitting myself from laughing!This was one of the few movies that I didn't want to end so I decided to watch it again the next day and the next day after that.I have seen a lot of movies in my life but there are few movies that are better than this one! It's definitely in my top 15 of all time.It truly deserves a 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS I cannot discuss my reaction to Snatch which I suppose relates to the snatching of the large diamond without commenting on the Imdb ratings. Currently it is 142 with a rating of 8.1 primarily by virtue of most voters being under 29 and I suspect most under 21. Among the over 30 crowd the rating is 7.5 which seems to me just about right. In many respects it deserves highest ratings for style action witty dialog. But the story which is a bit convoluted and which involves all bad guys as in Lock Stock... is a rather poor one. As one professional reviewer said Guy Ritchie doesn't really want us to care about the story it's all about the action.My main interest in seeing the movie was Brad Pitt. From the trailers I was intrigued by his gypsy character a barefist fighting champion who only needs one punch.  I think his performance is the highlight of the entire film and again Pitt shows as he did in Fight Club and Twelve Monkeys that he is one of the better and more versatile males actors.James Barardinelli and Roger Ebert have excellent summaries of the film. For highlights I really thought the dog swallowing the squeek toy and squeekbarking was funny as was Something to declare? Yes don't go to England. Much of the dark humor in Snatch arises from the ineptitude of the various crooks. If they were serious competent crooks then the film would not be very interesting. Slapstick Crooks would be a better name.The camerawork and editing as well as the dynamic 5channel sound were all firstrate. Ritchie is certainly in a different league there. I will keep watching his films for their entertainment value but it would be easy to criticize him for all the violence a la Pulp Fiction and pervasive use of foul language.  We just have to remind ourselves It's only a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Snatch is a British Englishlanguage film from 2000 so it is already over 15 years old. The writer and director is Guy Ritchie and this film came out shortly before he married Madonna. The cast includes many known names such as Oscar winners Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro action film superstar Jason Statham the late Dennis Farina and former football player Vinnie Jones. This 105minute is as fast as it gets for a film and this is certainly not to everybody's liking including myself. I found the camera work i.e. the constant switches and movements fairly distracting. The characters are all very much in your face so Ritchie and the actors definitely wanted to make sure you remember them. But how about writing them properly instead? Giving them interesting background stories and making them memorable this much more subtle way? Now that would be something wouldn't it? And that also certainly requires much more skill when it comes to writing screenplays compared to just letting everybody shout at each other for the entire film even if the path Ritchie took at least resulted in a handful fairly memorable quotes.In the heart of a story there is a precious priceless actually diamond most of the characters are after. And with characters I could also say criminals as absolutely everybody in here has gotten his hands dirty one way or another. This includes all kinds of robberies brawls illegal fighting blackmailing and even murder. The latter also includes the scene I found the funniest. Actually I did not find too many scenes funny in here I have to admit it mostly seemed pretty tryhard to me. I am talking about a scene where one guy shoots another and the guy hit by the bullet keeps insulting the guy who shot at him. And this goes on and on. Another bullet another insult another shot another insult etc. He just didn't want to die it seems and told him frankly and openly what he thought of him. This scene was laughoutloud hilarious. But it was really the only one and there aren't too many entertaining sequences in here. Still comedy was probably the film's biggest strength as storytelling and character development were really weak in my opinion. Ritchie had a fairly decent cast here and I found it pretty underwhelming what he made of it. This film is actually among the IMDb top250 films and this is truly baffling as this film does not have any substance besides drugs or depth whatsoever. I guess this film has many fanboys rooting for it I believe it actually is a very maleoriented film with the cast and story and these do not care about all the important aspects I already mentioned that this film lacks. I personally give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of filmmaking. So now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works  rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.So this is the plot. Unscrupulous boxing promoters violent bookmakers a Russian gangster incompetent amateur robbers and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.Turkish Jason Statham and Mickey O'Neil Brad Pitt are obviously the first reason anyone would want to watch to the film. I cannot believe how awesome both Statham  Pitt were in this movie. Tommy is like Turkish's brother they have known each other for a long time. Turkish is a boxing promoter. He entangles himself in Brick Top's hands who is a bookmaker and Brick Top is a man you wouldn't want to end up owing him. Franky Four Fingers has a large diamond 86 carats which he stole and he is in league with cousin Avi. Boris The Blade wants the diamond. Everyone's a gangster or a goon so this is a film which has nobody but thugs. Doug The Head is a dealer  if anyone knows about the diamond he is the man. He has two twin daughters working as his assistants in his shop. Anyway Tommy wants a caravan for himself and Turkish and goes to the pikeys to buy one. But there he is scammed and Gorgeous George Turkish's boxer in the unlicensed match in which Brick Top has invested a large amount of money and Mickey fight it out in a bare knuckle match and Mickey wins so George is out for a few months. Now Turkish hires Mickey as the boxer for the match. The deal was that Mickey had to go down in the fourth round but he wins in one shot which doesn't go down too well with Brick Top. Sol and his bumbling amateur robbers get involved with the diamond the damn dog is in all the scenes they are in which is very funny. Bullet Tooth Tony also wants the diamond. You know what? Trying to explain the plot line is ridiculous. All you need to know is the story is set in London and most of the English spoken is in British accent.Mickey's mom is burned down along with the caravan by Brick Top because Mickey tried to get a new caravan for his mother from Turkish and had said he wouldn't fight till he got it. That was very touching the expression on Brad Pitt's face made me so sad for his mother I felt is anguish  anger. That was a defining moment in the film. Then the big finale match at the end of the film was just awesome. Tommy Turkish Mickey's life and the lives of the whole family and friends of Mickey are on the line on this match. Being the bastard Mickey is he could not possibly go down in the fourth round at least this time can he? Brad Pitt Jason Statham  everybody give an engrossing performance. The film is pure brilliancy on the part of Guy Ritchie the man has style ingrained on his bones every scene is visually stylistic and the dialogues are superb the background score is also really catchy. The way he has interwoven the lives of all these characters is brilliant. How else can you empathize with these characters who are all basically villains going against each other? One thing is for sure you cannot predict one scene in the film no matter how many movies you have watched. Go snatch a copy of 'Snatch' I am lame I know. 1010".

One thing is for sure you cannot predict one scene in the film no matter how many movies you have watched. Go snatch a copy of 'Snatch' I am lame I know. 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "Snatch may well be the worst movie I have seen over the past 12 months. Who ever told Guy Ritchie he can direct? Probably the same person who told him Madonna would make a good wife.There are so many places where this film went wrong I don't know where to begin. But I'll give it a shot.1. The movie is just too slow. Ritchie certainly is taking us for a wild ride but the pace is almost as slow as an 80yearold grandmother driving on the interstate. Ritchie spends too much time spinning his wheels before moving on.2. MTVStyle cinematography. Nothing really wrong with this provide it is actually used to further the story and the pace of the film. But Ritchie uses it as a gimmick. His lame attemps to dazzle me actually bored me.3. The use of ethnic types and ethnic humor. Again I have nothing against the use of ethnic humor or the use of race provided it is not done in a mean spirited manner. Ritchie doesn't cross the line but he does tread it. Actually from his portrayals I can see that Ritchie's knowledge of ethnicity is limited to whatever is white AngloSaxon Protestant. His use of ethnic humor makes Ritchie look like an idiot.4. Eccentric characters. I love to see really eccentric characters in movies. But again this is something Ritchie can't handle. Half his characters aren't eccentric enough and the rest go so far off the deep end that they are not even credible just onedimensional. Its as if Ritchie is trying too hard. Also there is a lack of normal characters for the eccentrics to play off of.The only positive thing I can say about Snatch is that this is the best acting I have ever seen from Brad Pitt. He totally disappeared into his character. Unfortunately even with Pitt Snatch is not worth the time or money to see.".

If you were truly thinking about that while watching The Curse of the Jade Scorpion then you should reconsider the way you watch a movie. Sure Allen is now really old but who can play his role as well as he does. He sometimes casts other actors in that role such as John Cusack in Bullet Over Broadway but even though they do the job very well they can't be better than the old man with the big glasses himself. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is not a serious Woody Allen movie. It is not one of his most important movies that is clear. But its aim is to entertain and entertain it does. Jade Scorpion shares a lot with Woody's recent light comedies such as Small Time Crooks and Manathan Murder Mystery. And like these two it is certainly not a new Annie Hall. But it does not try to. It is just a lot of fun to watch. The script is funny the acting is charming the plot is just hilarious and on the whole this movie puts a smile on your face from the beginning to the end. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is another very nostalgic movie like Radio Days Sweet and Lowdown Everyone Says I Love You and Bullets Over Broadway but once again Allen makes us forget for 103 minutes that he is basically doing nothing he hasn't done before. But the man once again shows his gift to entertain. And what more can you ask from an aging genius?77".

	schema:headline " Delightful tribute to films of old";
	schema:reviewBody "I usually do not read movie reviews prior to actually seeing a film.  This has a tendency to influence what I think or even how I watch a movie.  I made the mistake of reading a few reviews of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion before I watched it.  As I watched Woody Allen's latest opus a tribute to the quickwitted screwball' comedies of the late 1930's and early 1940's I found myself mentally arguing with the reviewers.  The very issues they had with this movie were some of it's greatest features. The plotline for Scorpion is simple.  Allen portrays an old school' insurance company detective with a fantastic record for solving his cases. Helen Hunt is a streamlining expert' brought in to bring the insurance company instep with the modern world' of the 1940's.  Allen and Hunt's characters are like water and oil.  The two are hypnotized with a Jade Scorpion used to induce the trance hence the title in a stage show and later the hypnotist calls on Allen to steal the very jewels his company insures Allen has no knowledge he has done this.  The fun ensues as Allen attempts to find the person responsible for the thefts.  While this is an over simplification of  the actual story the actual story is perhaps too simple and predictable as well but this is not the reason people go to Woody Allen movies. It is the well written dialog that fits each person delivering the lines  the meticulous attention to detail of a period movie that works like a time machine transporting the audience on a trip to sixty years in the past  the unpredictable humor that fills each predictable twist.  These are things that makes this movie work.One review criticized the casting of Allen in the lead role.  Allen now 66 was not believable in a romantic lead' and the critic went on to suggest that another actor should have been used.  This thought was swimming through my mind throughout the two hours of the movie.  Allen was perfect for the role.  His character C.W. Biggs is an aging insurance investigator with few redeeming characteristics.  He is not supposed to be handsome or attractive.  Yes the WoodMan is getting old but it works for the movie. There are some unflattering shots where we see his Godfatherlike jowls. This is not the same thirtysomething guy from Bananas or Sleeper he is a sixtysomething old man.  We need to accept this.  It is apparent that the filmmaker has accepted this for himself and tailored the film to work with this in mind.  Helen Hunt's Betty Ann Fitzgerald can't stand C.W. in any way and it is only after Volton David Ogden Stires hypnotizes her in a magic show does she not show that she loathes him.  Sexy and rich socialite Laura Kensington portrayed by the beautiful 26 yearold Charlize Theron is attracted to Biggs because he the antithesis of her past conquests something new and different.  Sure he could have cast someone else perhaps Jason Alexander into his Biggs role.  While it would have certainly made an entertaining movie there would have been something lost.  Woody needs to be in Woody Allen movies.  It just works.Another critic panned the casting of Elizabeth Saved by the Bell Showgirls Berkley with such actors as Helen Hunt Dan Aykroyd Wally Shawn et al.  True enough Berkley's acting talents do not match up with the names I mentioned but the casting of Berkley for the minor role of office secretary Jill' is perfect nonetheless.  Allen's attention to detail cannot be overlooked.  I first noticed in his 1987 film Radio Days just how detail oriented he can be.  As a musician and something of an aficionado of vintage musical instruments I always look for anachronisms in period movies when a band is featured.  I can usually tell the year a wind instrument was made just by looking at it.  Not only were all of the instruments true to the time portrayed the label on the mute a Humes and Berg Stonelined' used by a trombone was correct for the period.  One off the shelf in a music store today looks identical except for small differences in the label.  I was amazed that this level of detail was made.  I am convinced this level of detail was made in the casting as well.  This movie is not only set in New York in 1940 but also as a Hollywood movie made in 1940 clichs common to movie making of the time abounded.  I believe the casting of Berkley in her role is another one of these details.  A movie made in that time would have featured headliners from the stable of lead actors from a movie studio or perhaps one loaned from another.  These would be people in the roles Allen Hunt and Aykroyd had.  The role of the office secretary would not have been filled by a star but by one of the studio's contract players sent to the production by central casting.  There were many young gorgeous actresses with questionable acting talent that were picked up by a studio in hopes of her developing into the flavoroftheweek or maybe for just a ride on the casting couch.  Elizabeth Berkley filled this role flawlessly.  She hit her marks said her lines and that's about it.  I think it is just what the writer  director wanted.The ensemble cast all delivered credible performances.  Like a film of the time the only performances that stand out are those of the leads it is Woody Allen and Helen Hunt's movie as it should be.  William Powell and Myrna Loy stand out in front of the cast of 1934's The Thin Man who remembers Nat Pendleton or Minna Gombel?  Dan Aykroyd plays an adulterant Insurance Company C.E.O. in much the same way as his  dramatic performances in Driving Miss Daisy or My Girl understated and credible.  He allows the writing to do the comedy for him without having to work at it.  Charlize Theron's Cider House Rules The Astronaut's Wife roll is smaller than her onscreen presence.  She makes for a perfect 1940's screen vixen.  David Ogden Stires always gives a good performance and was able to shake the shadow of MASH's Maj. Winchester for a deadperfect evil magician. Wallace Shawn in a Woody Allen movie is like having ice cream on a slice of cherry pie always a welcome presence.  You may also see a familiar face or two but can never place the name John Schuck a veteran movie and television actor Sgt. Charlie Enright on TV's McMillon and Wife is one of them.  It is apparent that the writing was crafted for the star players and terrific casting took care of the rest.Movies can be many things.  Some can inspire some can be extremely poignant.  Others can just simply entertain.  The Curse of the Jade Scorpion falls under the entertaining types.  A perfect diversion as a weekend matinee or as a followup to a nice dinner out Scorpion does not make use of lowbrow humor and stays true to the 1940's flair the movie itself portrays.With romantic interests like Helen Hunt and Charlize Theron Woody Allen gives all men hope as we get older.".

	onyx:emotionText "I usually do not read movie reviews prior to actually seeing a film.  This has a tendency to influence what I think or even how I watch a movie.  I made the mistake of reading a few reviews of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion before I watched it.  As I watched Woody Allen's latest opus a tribute to the quickwitted screwball' comedies of the late 1930's and early 1940's I found myself mentally arguing with the reviewers.  The very issues they had with this movie were some of it's greatest features. The plotline for Scorpion is simple.  Allen portrays an old school' insurance company detective with a fantastic record for solving his cases. Helen Hunt is a streamlining expert' brought in to bring the insurance company instep with the modern world' of the 1940's.  Allen and Hunt's characters are like water and oil.  The two are hypnotized with a Jade Scorpion used to induce the trance hence the title in a stage show and later the hypnotist calls on Allen to steal the very jewels his company insures Allen has no knowledge he has done this.  The fun ensues as Allen attempts to find the person responsible for the thefts.  While this is an over simplification of  the actual story the actual story is perhaps too simple and predictable as well but this is not the reason people go to Woody Allen movies. It is the well written dialog that fits each person delivering the lines  the meticulous attention to detail of a period movie that works like a time machine transporting the audience on a trip to sixty years in the past  the unpredictable humor that fills each predictable twist.  These are things that makes this movie work.One review criticized the casting of Allen in the lead role.  Allen now 66 was not believable in a romantic lead' and the critic went on to suggest that another actor should have been used.  This thought was swimming through my mind throughout the two hours of the movie.  Allen was perfect for the role.  His character C.W. Biggs is an aging insurance investigator with few redeeming characteristics.  He is not supposed to be handsome or attractive.  Yes the WoodMan is getting old but it works for the movie. There are some unflattering shots where we see his Godfatherlike jowls. This is not the same thirtysomething guy from Bananas or Sleeper he is a sixtysomething old man.  We need to accept this.  It is apparent that the filmmaker has accepted this for himself and tailored the film to work with this in mind.

	schema:reviewBody "Most people seem to consider The Curse of the Jade Scorpion a failure either because of casting or the jokeaminute script. But I think they're wrong about that. It's just that it was made about sixty years too late. It's really an homage to the sort of comedymysteries that were produced in the early forties  the same time period in which the movie is set. Seems to me most people didn't get that. Maybe people these days don't watch enough old movies.Everyone was correct of course when they said Woody Allen was miscast and since Woody Allen did the casting he deserves the blame. But it's not that great a sin. Basically this is a movie that should have been a vehicle for Bob Hope but since Bob Hope wasn't exactly available in the year 2001 someone had to stand in for him. I daresay there isn't an actor in Hollywood these days who can do a good Bob Hope and since there isn't I have to say Woody Allen isn't such a bad substitute.Actually I remember reading somewhere that Bob Hope was a major inspiration for the young Woody Allen and he was stung in the late sixties when Hope told a few meanspirited jokes about him. Maybe all these years later Woody Allen decided that all was forgiven.Anyway don't let yourself be bothered by the fact that the lead actor is about 30 years too old for the part. Also try to forget that nasty business with SoonYi. Just relax and let yourself laugh at the oneliners. Better yet try and imagine that the lines are being delivered by someone with a skijump nose. You may see this movie for what it is  a screamingly funny comedy and the best movie Bob Hope never made.You know someday Hollywood might find another actor who can play a role the way Bob Hope did back in his heyday. And when that happens this movie would be an excellent candidate for a remake.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all since I am such a loyal fan of Woody's films this may not be the most objective critique in the world. I have since my 18th year thoroughly enjoyed his witty dialogue his comedic and sometimes darker explorations into life love and death. In addition I adore the variety of early jazz scores that he uses for his films.  That being said Woody at 66 years of age has showed no signs of slowing down in his flm career delivering by far the brightest and wittiest comedy I've viewed this year in Curse of the Jade Scorpion. The film is a homage to the Pulp films of yesteryear. It's set in 1940 Woody plays the role of an aging detective in an insurance company. He has cracked many huge cases receiving information from street contacts and relying heavily on gut instinct and dumb luck. He can't stand the new efficiency expert Helen Hunt who is smarter than he is younger than he is poses a threat to his job and can't stand him either. During a dinner party for a fellow detective's birthday they are both hypnotized by the magician Zolton who uses the powers of the 'Jade Scorpion' to make them fall deeply in love with one another. He snaps them out of it just as they are about to kiss but Zolton never releases them from the key word that can at anytime send them deep into suggestive hypnosis. Later on Zolton calls CW Briggs hypnotizes him with the keyword and uses him as a pawn to rob jewelry from rich estates.The casting in the film was excellent. There are supposed film experts out there who believe that Woody is too old for the lead in this film and that it is unbelievable how Charlize Theron or Helen Hunt would ever fall for him. I wholeheartedly disagree. Throughout the film Woody's character is not displayed as a handsome or romantic gent in fact quite the opposite. In it he is called grubby an inchworm and a cockroach just to name a few. Theron only wants to have sex with him as an experiment since she is used to handsome and muscular men not shrimpy and ugly ones. Helen Hunt is hypnotized into loving him and vice versa but when they're not under Jade's spell then they absolutely loathe each other  I won't go any further into this so I don't spoil the film's ending. Although Woody is ageing his performance was outstanding not losing a step as he delivers wise cracks and witty comments one after the other. Helen Hunt also performs flawlessly and was actually a treat to watch her. As for the rest of the cast Dan Aykroyd is decent in a small yet significant role as well as Charlize Theron and Elizabeth Berkeley.The cinematography and the visual setting for the film in jazzy 1940 is absolutely exquisite it is much more polished then his earlier works. The writing is excellent as I've said before Woody hasn't lost one step in his writing or his performance. The jazz soundtrack is as usual very pleasant and fits very well with the scenery. Overall Curse of the Jade Scorpion ranks as one of my favorite Woody films. If you are a fan of his previous light comedies then you will definitely enjoy this little film. So what are you waiting for? Head up to the theatre and see it on the big screen.".

	schema:headline " A delight. Woody Allen in his classical style as good as ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "I paraphrase from memory from Allen's speech at the 2001 Oscars When the Academy called me I was surprised  as you know my movie The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' hadn't been nominated for anything.  I thought maybe they'd called to apologise.'  At the time I thought this was just another selfdeprecating joke.  And I'm sure it was.  But having seen the film I'm starting to think he had a point or at least as much of a point as anyone who complains about being snubbed at the Oscars ever has.In three of the categories which are ludicrously called technical'  art direction cinematography costume design  Allen's picture had as much right to be included among the nominees as half of those that WERE included it also had an original screenplay that had far more going for it than that of Amelie or Monster's Ball and it was at the very least above the AVERAGE quality of the films competing for the Best Picture award.Really  it's one of Allen's better films and I don't see how anyone could reasonably think otherwise.  The early pure comedies which some people supposedly still long for Take the Money and Run Sleeper weren't actually any funnier the obvious classics like Manhattan weren't better structured or cleverer or more pointed.  Granted Manhattan Zelig et al. had a divine spark which isn't perhaps to be found here but you can't expect to be zapped by a divine spark every day of the week.  It's an oldtime romantic comedy set in the 1940s which could ONLY be set in the 1940s and Allen has a magic touch when it comes to 20th Century period pieces don't ask me to explain it in which several clichs  a contrived and unlikely plot involving in this instance hypnotism a male lead decades older than the female lead an odd couple who start by loathing each other and end up in love  are explained given surprising depth and pressed into serving new functions.  When Briggs and Fitzgerald are arbitrarily HYPNOTISED into falling in love it's like a comment on the absurdity of the way love strikes in romantic comedies ... but the story never fails to work perfectly when taken straight too.  All of Allen's implied secondorder comments serve in the end to enrich the firstorder story.  It's as if he decided to show us that fiction crafted to debunk the conventions of other works of fiction CAN actually be good in its own right when it's done by a true artist rather than some wanker with a theoretical axe to grind.  The result The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is diverting pleasurable and satisfying as not one film in a hundred succeeds in being.Place this alongside Sweet and Lowdown and you'll wonder how the rumour that Woody Allen's powers are declining ever got started.  I blame the modern addiction to novelty.  Allen has been making movies for a while now and even though his films today are no more derivative than they've ever been less so in fact a Woody Allen picture is no longer a new KIND of thing.  The same people who would argue that Haydn's 102nd symphony couldn't possibly be as good as his 80th because the latter happened to have been written and performed first and there are people who WOULD argue this the instant it became fashionable to do so will tell you that Curse of the Jade Scorpion is clearly inferior to say The Purple Rose of Cairo because it's in the same style and vein and was made later.  Put like that the view sounds silly.  And indeed it is.".

I thought maybe they'd called to apologise.'  At the time I thought this was just another selfdeprecating joke.  And I'm sure it was.  But having seen the film I'm starting to think he had a point or at least as much of a point as anyone who complains about being snubbed at the Oscars ever has.In three of the categories which are ludicrously called technical'  art direction cinematography costume design  Allen's picture had as much right to be included among the nominees as half of those that WERE included it also had an original screenplay that had far more going for it than that of Amelie or Monster's Ball and it was at the very least above the AVERAGE quality of the films competing for the Best Picture award.Really  it's one of Allen's better films and I don't see how anyone could reasonably think otherwise.  The early pure comedies which some people supposedly still long for Take the Money and Run Sleeper weren't actually any funnier the obvious classics like Manhattan weren't better structured or cleverer or more pointed.  Granted Manhattan Zelig et al. had a divine spark which isn't perhaps to be found here but you can't expect to be zapped by a divine spark every day of the week.  It's an oldtime romantic comedy set in the 1940s which could ONLY be set in the 1940s and Allen has a magic touch when it comes to 20th Century period pieces don't ask me to explain it in which several clichs  a contrived and unlikely plot involving in this instance hypnotism a male lead decades older than the female lead an odd couple who start by loathing each other and end up in love  are explained given surprising depth and pressed into serving new functions.  When Briggs and Fitzgerald are arbitrarily HYPNOTISED into falling in love it's like a comment on the absurdity of the way love strikes in romantic comedies ... but the story never fails to work perfectly when taken straight too.  All of Allen's implied secondorder comments serve in the end to enrich the firstorder story.  It's as if he decided to show us that fiction crafted to debunk the conventions of other works of fiction CAN actually be good in its own right when it's done by a true artist rather than some wanker with a theoretical axe to grind.  The result The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is diverting pleasurable and satisfying as not one film in a hundred succeeds in being.Place this alongside Sweet and Lowdown and you'll wonder how the rumour that Woody Allen's powers are declining ever got started.  I blame the modern addiction to novelty.  Allen has been making movies for a while now and even though his films today are no more derivative than they've ever been less so in fact a Woody Allen picture is no longer a new KIND of thing.  The same people who would argue that Haydn's 102nd symphony couldn't possibly be as good as his 80th because the latter happened to have been written and performed first and there are people who WOULD argue this the instant it became fashionable to do so will tell you that Curse of the Jade Scorpion is clearly inferior to say The Purple Rose of Cairo because it's in the same style and vein and was made later.  Put like that the view sounds silly.  And indeed it is.";

	schema:headline " Woody Hits His Mark";
	schema:reviewBody "Doing a period piece seems to put Woody Allen at the top of his game possibly because he has the intrinsic ability to capture a specific time and place and make a truly transporting experience out of it.  Which is exactly what he's done with The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' which he not only wrote and directed but stars in as well.  Set in 1940 it's the story of CW Briggs Allen an investigator for an insurance company which despite the exemplary achievements of CW has been slipping at the bottom line forcing the company's exec. Chris Magruder Dan Aykroyd to call upon the services of an efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald Helen Hunt.  But there's a problem right from the start in that CW and Betty Ann simply do not hit it off.  And the situation is quickly exacerbated when a rash of thefts involving millions of dollars worth of jewelry and goods begins to occur among clients for whom the company has installed security systems. An inside job is suspected and to CW's chagrin more outside help is brought in.  So now CW has to contend with that as well as his new nemesis Betty Ann and the way he sees it there's only one way to fix it all Solve the case.  And with that the hunt is on...Character and dialogue driven Allen's film is loaded with atmosphere and detail that really puts you in the story you can almost feel Bogart's presence in such films as The Big Sleep' and The Maltese Falcon' the spirits of which permeate this film.  The dialogue is snappy and clever some of Allen's best ever and he presents it all in a way that sustains interest and makes it thoroughly involving and entertaining.  In fact it's the ongoing banter between CW and Betty Ann that really makes this one click and it's perfectly delivered with timing by Allen and Hunt that is right on the mark.  This is the most screen time Allen has had himself in some time and he's good his trademark neurotic gropingforaword delivery is tempered and finely tuned which makes his character entirely credible.  Allen is looking older but he's growing into his age well and actually has a much less disheveled appearance here than usual which has seemingly been an innate trait of his regardless of the role he's playing.  And though there have been films of his that one could say simply had too much Woody' in them that is not the case here.  It's a good performance his scenes with Hunt are alive and he has some moments with Charlize Theron that are even better.Hunt does a great job too Betty Ann is a bit like her Darcy McGuire in What Women Want' but with a harder more intimidating edge that works well for this character.  She manages to make Betty Ann both feminine and feminist at the same time reminiscent of some of the characters that Davis Crawford and Stanwyck played so successfully in films past.  There's some obvious chemistry at work in her scenes with Allen the one in which they are hypnotized is hilarious but it's absent in her screen time with Aykroyd though it may have more to do with their respective characters than anything.  And it's refreshing to see a strong female character to whom Allen's character can relate on a personal level that though it involves conflict is devoid of his typically neurotic and paranoid responses.  They may not like each other but CW at least relates to Betty Ann in a very straightforward manner.  It has to do with the way the characters were written of course but part of it is in the way Hunt transfers the Betty Ann found on the page into a real person.One of the highlights of this film is the performance by Charlize Theron in which as Laura Kensington she is transformed into the second coming of Lauren Bacall.  Laura is the epitome of the femme fatale in the way she looks speaks and moves you keep waiting for her to say You know how to whistle don't you Steve?'  It's a supporting role that actually affords Theron comparatively little screen time but she makes the most of it and she is certainly a memorable asset to the film.Also effective in a small but pivotal role is David Ogden Stiers as Volton a part that would have been so perfect for the late Orson Welles. In the absence of Welles however Stiers does a very commendable job.Allen put together a terrific supporting cast for this one including John Schuck Mize Elizabeth Berkley Jill Wallace Shawn George John Tormey Sam Kaili Vernoff Rosie Brian Markinson Al and Peter Gerety Ned. There's an inspired precision to this film in the way Allen blends the story characters and music such a big part of creating that necessary atmosphere that makes The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' something of a minor classic in the Allen canon.  Aficionados of the classic films of this period will be especially delighted with this one but anyone who appreciates a film that is well crafted and delivered and provides some solid entertainment will be satisfied as well.  Allen geared this film to a specific audience albeit fairly wide and for those who fall within it's parameters it's right on target.  One has to wonder though why he didn't film it in glorious black  white which would have been so perfect.  But taken as it is it's still a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can take Woody Allen in small doses. Even though all his films are different his type of humor and dialog remain constant from film to film. To me it gets old quickly. THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION is no different but the variety of actors including Helen Hunt Charlize Theron and Dan Aykroyd make it interesting enough that it kept me entertained for much of its 100 minutes. Good light entertainment nothing more. It helps that I got the DVD on loan from my local library so there was no outofpocket cost to me. And it still irks me that Allen insists on a mono soundtrack for all his films basically turning his back on modern sound technology and snubbing his audience. many SPOILERS follow you may choose to read no further.Set in 1940 Allen plays an insurance investigator Hunt is the new girl in the office hired to make the operation more efficient Aykroyd is their boss married but having an affair with Hunt's character. The title of the film comes from an evening out to celebrate the birthday of a coworker and a magician uses a jade scorpion to hypnotize Allen and Hunt for him the word that puts him in a trance was Constantinople for her Madagascar. All thought it was just light entertainment but the magician had grander plans. After a suitable lapse of time he phoned Allen and later Hunt said the magic word and had them perform heists of expensive jewels at properties that Allen had been the security expert for. Quickly under suspicion because of clues at the scene footprint hair strands fingerprint they obviously recalled none of it. Through street contacts Allen traces the crimes to the magician and clears himself and Hunt.Allen plays his usual deadpan womanizer in a strange twist Theron's character actually is in his apartment about to go to bed with him when he gets a call goes into the trance tells her to go home!  In the end even though Aykroyd has gotten a divorce and is planning to fly to Paris with Hunt and get married when Allen says I love you. What's the hurry?  Where are you going Madagascar? As if back in the trance Hunt turns to him expresses her affection she and Allen walk away arminarm. A bit confusing because all thought that both spells had been broken so we the audience aren't sure if Hunt was going willingly or not.The DVD picture is fine the mono sound is boring the extras are small and relatively unimportant.  Huge Woody Allen fans will want this DVD in their collection while most others like me will only want to see it once.".

	schema:headline " Gripping intelligent psychological thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the years the IRA and the 'troubles' in Northern Ireland have been a source of inspiration for countless British and Irish movies. What can 'Shadow Dancer' add to what we already know about this conflict? The answer is nothing really. This film isn't about the struggle for freedom it isn't about catholics and protestants it isn't even about right or wrong. It's only about suspense. This isn't a political movie it's a thriller. In fact this movie could just as easily have been set in the context of the Italian mafia or a Mexican drugs gang. The story about a young female terrorist who after a failed bombing attempt becomes an informant for the authorities to escape a prison sentence is extremely suspenseful. She lives in constant fear of being discovered which would almost certainly lead to her execution. 'I am dead' she literally tells her contact at one point. The film starts off with a clever flashback a very intense scene that explains her motivation to become a terrorist. The rest of the film is told in chronological order with the suspense rising gradually until the unexpected and dramatic climax. In a subplot we see that the British secret service is subject to the same sort of internal discussions infighting and egotripping as the IRA. Clive Owen and Gillian Anderson nice to see her again! are fine as secret service persons but the best acting is done by Andrea Riseborouh as the proud and independent terrorist Collette McVeigh. The film is also excellent in recreating the atmosphere of the catholic working class neighbourhoods in Belfast actually it is shot in Dublin where terrorism in the 1990's was a part of everyday life. Director James Marsh uses faded colours in many scenes to recreate the rundown streets and interiors. This is a gripping intelligent psychological thriller with excellent acting and a plot that will have you hooked from start to finish. I was amazed the IMDbrating is not higher than 6.6.".

There were 4 people in total when we went to watch the film and that was par for the course for the week apparently. The cinema manager suggested it would be pulled pretty quickly.Such a shame because it is a fine film excellent when the scenes are based in Belfast with ALL the actors who played the Irish parts absolutely first class. You felt you were in Belfast and the tension took you there. Location scenes good.Less so the part played by Gillian Anderson. She was OK but a bit wooden. The MI5 scenes generally did not get off the ground until near the end when there was a great twist.Clive Owen was the biggest enigma of the film. I am still not sure if he was OK average or weak in the part he played. First impressions were could have been done better definitely but the lowkey interpretation may have had some merit. Owen just seemed to drift through it all and when he got angry it fell flat.I would recommend anyone to go and watch this welldirected film. It is a good story from the writer which needs all the support it can get based on our experience of row after row of empty seats.People tend to forget their history even that happened in their lifetime.

	schema:headline " Convincing Thriller on The Troubles";
	schema:reviewBody "The multidimensional layers of the Northern Ireland troubles offer rich pickings to thriller writers. Several good books have appeared but films about the era have yet to find their feet. As with Vietnam War films for the Americans time and perspective are required before stories stripped of partisan hyperbole emerge. The eponymous book upon which this film is based is written by BBC journalist Tom Bradby who reported from Northern Ireland in the 1990's the era in which this film is set. With funding from the BBC Eire and the Lottery Fund the politics was always going to be a problem however Bradby neatly sidesteps this by producing an apolitical thriller not a polemic. There are no good guysbad guys as such just people responding to a time and period over which they had no control. The Director James Marsh  directed the acclaimed documentary Man on Wire. That documentary experience combined with Bradby's journalistic training sets the tone for the film.National reviews for Shadow dancer have been very good but should be viewed with some caution. Bradby is a popular figure amongst the journalist community and some of the notices have owed more to the principle of doing a friend a favour than exercising due critical discipline.For raw material The Troubles take some beating. The British Government in 1968 was not that bothered about Northern Ireland nor were the people of the Mainland but were forced into upholding the Constitution. British Colonialism was the last thing on British minds. British troops arrived to safeguard catholic lives and property then became the enemy through no fault of their own. The Catholic population was right to demand equal rights and in the absence of Protestant dominated Stormont Government had no alternative other than to call upon the IRA to defend them. But the 1970's IRA quickly developed into a very different beast to the Michael Collins era IRA with splinter groups such as the INLA even further removed mirrored by the Protestant UDA and UVF. Turf wars and criminality soon became as important as politics.The British people really were not concerned about whether Northern Ireland was in  or out of Britain  but took exception to its soldiers being killed and its cities bombed. Equally the Eire government was keen to play the united Ireland card for political purposes  but dreaded the day when the practicalities actually came about as Northern Ireland would then become Dublin's problem not London's. It is against this backdrop that the film is set.Shadow Dancer eschews all the aforementioned intrigue in favour of a people rather than events driven story and works well because of it. The running time of 100 minutes is tight for a thriller with screen time dominated by Clive Owen as Mac an MI 5 handler and Andrea Riseborough as Collette an IRA volunteer. Both are well cast and convincing but the intensity of that relationship does not have sufficient screen time which undermines a key dimension of the film. There is little overt action in this story in the form of explosions violence or chases. Bradby does well to keep the narrative moving Marsh's grasp of on screen drama is less assured.The opening quarter of an hour is very strong. We are initially taken back to 1973 when Collette as a little girl  delegates a shop errand that her father had given her to her little brother only for him to be killed by a stray bullet in the street. Then in 1993 we see her as a Failed and captured London bomber. Dialogue is at a minimum action motive and result are implied not overt. So far so good. However the turning of Collette as an informer is a little perfunctory it is a case of  No way.......oh alright then. The authenticity and sense of time fashion place and dialogue is good however  presumably because of funding the locations are in Dublin not Belfast which robs the spectacle of some of its drama. The grey that seemed to pervade the entire city is bafflingly broken by the decision of Collette working as a spy to wear a bright red raincoat for her clandestine meetings with Mac. There may have been some symbolic significance in this but for practical purposes it was risible.An awkward sub plot involving inter security service rivalry is frustratingly portrayed. Gillian Anderson appears as a senior MI5 Officer for no particular reason other than to sell the film in America for neither she as a character nor her as an actor adds anything to proceedings. The internal machinations of the IRA are also under drawn. Gerry the local commander has to organise operations against the British funerals discussions about British Peace proposals house breakins  tout hunts torture and executions in around twenty minutes screen time. A promising and pivotal character suffers as a result.The denouement to the tale works well in plot terms and will delight Republicans leaving the audience guessing as to what had really happened but is undermined by the lack of characterisation. . Bradby as a journalist is good at the narrative Marsh as the documentary maker is good at recording it but as a drama it is good rather than excellent a criticism more of what it could have been than of what it is not although I am sure that budget restraints play their part. An IRA funeral confrontation is well set up but in long shot looks puny and fizzles out. The visceral horror of terrorism is also noticeable by its absence. Eagle eyed viewers will enjoy an on screen news report which features Tom Bradby as the reporter but with a pseudonym as a tag line. A more experienced director of action and drama a bigger budget and a more experienced screenplay writer may yet deliver Bradby the on screen spy thriller success he aims for.".

I'm not sure what the situation with this movie was because it only made 400000.The movie takes place in Belfast and in the first scene a young girl Collette is told by her father to buy him some cigarettes. She doesn't want to go so instead she sends her little brother Sean.The action then shifts to 1993 and we see the adult Collette Riseborough deliberately leaving her purse in the London tube as she escapes from the tube she is arrested. An MI5 agent Mac Owen offers her a deal  no prison time if she will become an informant and at the end of her time working for him a new identity. Because she has a young son she agrees.Mac ultimately learns that his superior Anderson is using Collette as a red herring to protect her own mole inside the Irish organization. Mac tries to find out who the mole is and remove Collette from a dangerous situation.This movie is sparse on dialogue and frankly action particularly at the beginning as we see Collette on what seems to be an endless train ride and finally dropping her purse. After that things pick up. The cinematography is dreary with Ireland looking like it's one step up from a trailer park in most scenes.Andrea Riseborough who can be beautiful and glamorous is photographed harshly here and she's excellent as a young woman caught in the nightmare of having to betray her brothers and answer to their triggerhappy leader Kevin David Wilmot and to Mac. She is natural and realistic in underplaying the role of a young Irish girl under incredible tension. Owen is good as the protective Mac tough and persuasive.The big problem is the lack of family connection that is Collette's relationship with her worried mother and her brothers who are entrenched in a violent world. Shadow Dancer concentrates on the relationship between Mac and Collette where showing more within the family would have brought us into the film more deeply.We're led to believe certain things in Shadow Dancer and it's not until the end of the movie that we realize what a good script it was and how well it is directed by James Marsh.A sober movie showing the impact of violence and stress on one family.".

Otherwise read up about Irish politics before attempting to understand all the nuances in this film. Grady Harp";

	schema:reviewBody "This is director James Marsh's first fiction movie. He has hitherto been known as a great documentary maker including last year's excellent Project Nim. In Shadow Dancer he has put together a film set during the Troubles period of Northern Ireland's history. In it a girl with IRA connections is coerced into becoming an informant for MI5. This leads to several compromising and dangerous situations. While the movie is set within a clear political situation it isn't really a political film. The focus is specifically on the role of the informer in this powder keg context. At the time there were many people in similar situations and the movie tries to look at both the dangers that they found themselves in and the complex moral dilemmas that effected people on all sides of the conflict both republicans and British intelligence. As such Shadow Dancer is about people as opposed to politics and it doesn't really make any subjective comment on rights and wrongs. It's clear that both sides of the fence act in sordid ways. The distrust amongst the high command on both sides is shown to be similar. Civil war is never a simple affair.It's a wellacted and intelligently written film. It's lowkey and pensive rather than a suspenseful thrillride. Perhaps it's a little too slow paced and sober for its own good at times but it does gather steam in the final third and things are wrapped up quite effectively by the end with a series of events that fall into place with tragic inevitability.".

However the author did write the screenplay. Anyway I thought the film itself was OK. In general everything felt like it was neutral on the line. Nothing really stuck out and there was no real memorable scenes. The film also seemed very slow and dragged out. The acting from everyone involved was good. Nothing special but nothing terrible. However my main complaint would have to be the characters. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters especially the protagonist  which is the main thing really. I felt the IRA characters were too clichd and just the same generic IRA men as in every other film with IRA men in them.Overall the film did not impress me. However I wasn't expecting anything special so I suppose it balances it out. I'd give it a solid 610. But gun to my head  would I recommend it?  No. Probably not.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is based on the novel by well known journalist in the U.K. Tom Bradby who also wrote the screenplay. It's a dark thriller that runs a mere 100 minutes unusually short for the genre but it still manages to work without as much of the character and relationship development I would have enjoyed seeing expanded. Bradby has had all the firsthand experience and knowledge on the subject covering the Northern Ireland goingson in the 1990's. He skillfully wrote a screenplay that is apolitical yet retains convincing elements necessary for the movie to be a genuine thriller. The cast was well chosen and the ensemble delivers the goods without reproach.The opening of the movie brings important context to what will follow next in the movie. It 1973 Belfast during 'The Troubles' we see young Collette witness the tragedy of the times when her younger brother is killed collateral damage and how she is moved by the event. Maria Laird who plays young Collette is an actress I look forward to seeing again soon. Then we fast forward to 1993 when Collette played by Andrea Riseborough is now an IRA member she is apprehended when she planted a bomb in the London Underground but the IRA doesn't know that for sure. Enters Mac MI 5 agent played by Clyve Owen who turns Collette informant. Unbeknownst to Mac Collette's MI 5 mission is to protect a mole they have in the IRA Kate Fletcher played by Gillian Anderson is Mac's superior but she does not share the information about the existence of a mole which is something he has to dig up himself if he's to ensure the protection of Collette. The drama then unfolds. The thriller has just one real twist but it is a startling one at the end.I have to warn audiences about the very poor audio levelling in the movie. You see there are two very critical and short pieces of dialogue without which it will be virtually impossible to understand the movie's denouement. So if you see the movie on DVDBlueRay or some other device that has pause and rewind features you'll be fine you can play back and jack up the volume for those two moments and you'll know I'm sure when those are. I never get how sound editors can miss that sort of stuff that which can kill the viewing enjoyment. I'm very glad I didn't see this movie at the cinema but on my big screen at home instead.Given the running time of the movie I was happy enough with the key actors' interpretations of their role but can't help but think how much better I would have like it if some twenty more minutes could have been added. I hope those weren't just cut out for reasons I don't want to speculate about. Of course you get that I recommend the movie despite that.".

I think it should be a 7 for sure and this movie can be really misinterpreted. People who like action bombing crash type movies will not be happy with this since it is not about that. It is a very deep moving film about the Troubles and all the problems in North Ireland. If you know about that history this movie will resonate with you and you will feel the intensity the dilemmas facing the characters the anger the resentment the incredulity that goes with the Troubles. Consider that even today people are not allowed to have parades in certain parts of North I because riots will break out it's A PARADE! There is serious animosity between peoples in North I and even South and it is stupid to pretend different. That's why this movie is a real good choice to show anyone young who needs to know their history. Clive Owen did a respectable job same as most of his roles that stone faced glare not giving away much emotion it works for him. But Andrea Risboraough who I had only seen in Oblivion was REALLY good. Some other reviewers picked this up too and they're bang on. I hated looking at her face in Oblivion that blank pasty cold blue eyed stare  which was perfect for that role but in this one it's almost like she has the same stare but there is so much rage and deep sorrow simmering just below the surface. As far as other reviewers complaining that they couldn't understand the Irish accents...maybe you need subtitles it is hard to understand if you are not used to hearing.".

If you know about that history this movie will resonate with you and you will feel the intensity the dilemmas facing the characters the anger the resentment the incredulity that goes with the Troubles. Consider that even today people are not allowed to have parades in certain parts of North I because riots will break out it's A PARADE! There is serious animosity between peoples in North I and even South and it is stupid to pretend different. That's why this movie is a real good choice to show anyone young who needs to know their history. Clive Owen did a respectable job same as most of his roles that stone faced glare not giving away much emotion it works for him. But Andrea Risboraough who I had only seen in Oblivion was REALLY good. Some other reviewers picked this up too and they're bang on. I hated looking at her face in Oblivion that blank pasty cold blue eyed stare  which was perfect for that role but in this one it's almost like she has the same stare but there is so much rage and deep sorrow simmering just below the surface. As far as other reviewers complaining that they couldn't understand the Irish accents...maybe you need subtitles it is hard to understand if you are not used to hearing.";

Mac needs to find the identity of that informer. I like Clive Owen movies but this one was not ready to come to the gate. When the movie ends there are questions that should have been answered within. Didn't happen. We didn't get an inkling that there was a love relationship between Mac and Collette yet she spontaneously kisses him at one point and nothing happens thereafter. Why did she do that? How did the IRA know that Kate's informer was the mole who they killed? We had no clue to that. Were some scenes cut that we never saw? The surprise ending regarding Mac made absolutely no sense. Again perhaps some scenes were cut? Huh?I believe directors have a responsibility to allow the audience to hear what is being said. When English and Irish accents are involved the men have a great tendency to talk into their chests talk so fast the roadrunner couldn't keep up whisper in conspiratorial tones that rewinding the DVD many times just exercises the wrist. This doesn't happen with the women actors. We can hear them fine. The movie centered too much on Collette and that led me to believe that Mac was second fiddle in here. He had no control over anything. And the contentious relationship with Kate his boss didn't help matters. James Bond wouldn't allow things to get this out of control you really wanted Clive Owen to be the next James Bond didn't you? When our hero Mac loses control we don't know what to expect anymore. See?This movie should have been wrapped in suspense and tension but they were not in evidence. The best part of the movie was the first 20minutes. After that it all ran downhill with Collette's side of things. Yes Andrea Riseborough as Collette performed well but we went to see a Clive Owen movie. Oh he also performed well as usual but his Mac lost control. I like going to Clive Owen movies. I hope the next one is better. 310Violence Yes. Sex No. Nudity No. Torture Yes.

There's an intro giving us character development motive etc. that captivates but in hindsight might be better left out. There's also a brief and most surprising romantic interlude that at first seems an unneeded diversion but actually has some impact on the end product. But what's intriguing about Shadow Dancer is the gritty mundane realism of overcast Northern Ireland and depressing Belfast lives. The film is thankfully devoid of emotional screes on British repression Irish solidarity sacrifice and loss. Plot knots are skillfully tied. Just a taunt believable thriller with some minor action sequences made without pomp and upon a modest budget.

	schema:reviewBody "Last year we saw the historical spy thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy which took a realistic slow burning approach to the upper echelons of MI6. Shadow Dancer aims to take a similar approach taking a ground up view.The year is 1993 and Peace Process is in full swing. Colette Andrea Riseborough is a member of the IRA who is arrested by MI5 after a failed bombing of the London Underground. MI5 officer Mac Clive Owen gives her a choice she can be arrested and her young son would be put into care or she can turn informant against her brother Conner Domhnall Gleeseon. She choices the latter. But as soon as she turns informant her IRA commanders suspect she is a traitor and she becomes a figure to investigate as Mac tries to protect her.Shadow Dancer is a slow burning film with the pace to match. This is a film that is far away from the worlds of Bond Bourne and Mission Impossible and this a film where the aim of MI5 try to stop action happening. Shadow Dancer is also as much a family drama as it is a spy focusing on Colette's struggle to protect her son having to betray both her brother and her ideology as mother also try to protect her.Director James Marsh sets out to show that this is a brutal world of violence the IRA willing to kill and torture and that is a complex world yet bureaucratic world within MI5. Many of the characters are complex and well drawn they felt like real in this world and Marsh made sure he did not side or moralise one faction or the other. It is a character driven film and the whole cast were terrific. The highlight was Riseborough giving a compelling and grounded performance of a woman who needs to protect her family by betraying and a character used by the IRA and MI5. By falling into the spy world she fears for her live and soon forced to explore her dark side as she tries to protect herself. Owen too is great starting off in an antagonist role but slowly develops as character who wants to be bold a good intelligence officer and protect his agent because of his duty and for the person she is. He is gives a very intense and believable performance. The world of spying terrorism and Northern Irish society is a very complicated web that is difficult to untie.Marsh comes from a documentary background and it shows with his camerawork the slow build up of tension and the great amount of period detail. Marsh does everything he can to draw the audience into the early 90s in a poor working class community right down little things like the televisions and cars. During the tense scenes Marsh uses handheld cameras following Colette in long continuous shots that feel like a document as the action takes place.There is a side theme during the film between approaches the leadership and the foot soldiers in both the IRA and MI5. There is a divide between the political leadership of the IRA at the time and the foot soldiers lead by Gerry Aiden Gillian and Kevin David Wilmot who wants to carry on the fight and willing to ignore the leadership who want to negotiate peace. There is a view that some people who do not want peace that there is only one resolution to their cause it kept going during the peace process and it is still going on in Northern Ireland. It could easily happen in other situations around the world. The politics within MI5 is played more like a convention spy with the superiors not telling their agent anything and keeping him out of the loop leading him to undergo his own unofficial investigation. This is a film set in a culture of distrust between Catholics and Protestants and how it infects everything families the intelligence services the politics and hierarchy of IRA.Shadow Dancer is a very slow film that can turn some off and sometimes a certain piece of information flies by so fast that it is easy to miss and wonder when did this happen. It also do not help that there is a character called Gerry because he can easily be confused for Gerry Adams. But because of its style and themes Shadow Dancer does share similarities to Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Animal Kingdom and Hunger all films you should check out.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not a notable piece of filmmaking this modest western offers so many satisfactions and surprises that it almost merits the designation of undiscovered gem. After an opening sequence that quickly and efficiently sets up the story we learn that John Payne will unexpectedly play the movie's bad guy. He's a killer who seems to take grim pleasure in the fact that his escape from prison resulted in the deaths of three guards. There's no attempt to soften his image by suggesting he'd been unjustly convicted and there's no plea for sympathy by for example showing a back cruelly scarred by an overseer's whip.After taking over Dennis O'Keefe's wagon train Payne seems drawn to leading lady Arleen Whelan but aside from one passionate kiss in a rainstorm the standard romance between these two never develops. What's more Whelan's character defies what would have ordinarily been a goodygoody role. She's by turns cynical sullen and selfish and she never becomes particularly likable.Dooley Casablanca Wilson also appears in the cast at a time when black faces were rarely featured in movies in general and in westerns in particular.As the wagon train that Payne and his cohorts take over makes its way to California the usual hardships occur but they seem a bit starker than usual. A baby dies from lack of milk its mother drifts into madness a calf greatly valued by its elderly owners breaks its leg and must be destroyed a schoolteacher's prize collection of seedlings gets tossed by the side of the road a father must bury his child. Only at the end of their journey do these pioneers find any respite from their troubles but then there's an explosion inside a tunnel which results in a death and a shift in relationships few would have expected at the start of the movie.Since Lewis Foster's work classifies him as little more than a journeyman director the unique qualities of Passage West can probably be ascribed to the script cowritten by the blacklisted writer Alvah Bessie. Loyal Griggs who later won an Oscar nomination for The Ten Commandments provides the cinematography which is heavily slanted toward exterior shots. In fact the first interior a saloon comes at the movie's threequarters mark.John Payne with an uncharacteristic mustache and Dennis O'Keefe work together much better here than in their earlier The Eagle and the Hawk but minor actress Arleen Whelan can do little with the intriguing but sketchilydrawn figure of Rose. As might be expected  most notably in the tunnel sequence  Payne gets a chance to shed his shirt revealing that thatch of chesthair he had to shave off during his cleancut and boyish days back in the 1940s.".

	schema:headline " Dramatic western about brutality and redemption";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen many movies starring John Payne and Dennis O'Keefe and I have to say I found their performances in PASSAGE WEST among the strongest of their careers. Payne plays a hardened escaped convict serving time for murder who leads a pack of five other runaway cons in taking over a wagon train of settlers heading to California. The leader of the train is a minister played by O'Keefe who is first seen conducting a funeral service for a boy who died during the journey. Payne runs roughshod over the wagon train and jeopardizes the settlers' lives with some rash commands earning O'Keefe's undisguised contempt. Gradually however the men's relationship shifts eventually reaching a point of trust and grudging respect. The turning point is a grueling fistfight between the two the film's only action scene a battle that is quite rough and messy like a real fight and not a cleanly choreographed western brawl like we'd normally find in such films. O'Keefe even executes a few unusual moves that might seem out of place in the west of 1863 but are explained in a clever bit of dialogue after the fight as something he learned in a lumberjack camp and as a waterfront saloon bouncer in an earlier life before he found God.The settlers are played by dependable character actors who come across as plausible migrants from the east seeking a better life. Only Arleen Whelan's character a preacher's daughter who falls hard for Payne after he forces a kiss on her smacks of Hollywood contrivance but she plays the role with conviction and redheaded fury with a layer of seething discontent just below the surface and I found myself believing her despite the clich. In the final film of his career Dooley Wilson best known for playing singerpianist Sam in CASABLANCA plays a runaway slave among the convicts. The script briefly touches on his status when the group learns of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation but otherwise steers clear of racial issues. Other than a handful of interior scenes the bulk of the film was shot on location and has the actors enduring a sandstorm desert heat rain and deep pockets of mud among other hardships. This has some thematic similarities with another excellent underrated western of 1951 THE SECRET OF CONVICT LAKE in which Glenn Ford leads a group of escaped cons into a snowbound mountain settlement populated almost entirely by women whose men have left town to work a silver mine leading to a series of uneasy encounters as the women take great pains to keep the convicts from getting the upper hand.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blacklisted screenwriter Alvah Bessie one of the Hollywood Ten penned the story for Passage West. Had he been blacklisted for bad writing on seeing this one rather than political opinions he might not have obtained martyrdom. This is a rather unreal story of six escaped convicts who inflict themselves on a wagon train bound for California headed by preacher Dennis O'Keefe. The leader of the convicts is John Payne whose career path was like Dick Powell's completely sheds his boyish crooning image for being a complete tough guy.Unfortunately unlike Dick Powell this was not a Murder My Sweet success for him. Payne did many interesting roles in B films during the Fifties but this was not one of them. Dennis O'Keefe who was something of a raffish fellow also just does not ring true as a frontier preacher.

Had he been blacklisted for bad writing on seeing this one rather than political opinions he might not have obtained martyrdom. This is a rather unreal story of six escaped convicts who inflict themselves on a wagon train bound for California headed by preacher Dennis O'Keefe. The leader of the convicts is John Payne whose career path was like Dick Powell's completely sheds his boyish crooning image for being a complete tough guy.Unfortunately unlike Dick Powell this was not a Murder My Sweet success for him. Payne did many interesting roles in B films during the Fifties but this was not one of them. Dennis O'Keefe who was something of a raffish fellow also just does not ring true as a frontier preacher. He and Payne have a rivalry of sorts over Arleen Whelan who is scheduled to marry preacher O'Keefe after the journey is over starts reassessing things with the sight of a shirtless Payne sporting a very hairy chest.

Even though this was made by James Cameron the same director who gave us Aliens both movies are very hard to compare.When an American nuclear submarine is attacked during the cold war and crashes the navy is convinced that it was the work of the Russians. They want to salvage the wreckage as soon as possible because a storm is coming but they aren't able to send a diving crew of their own that quickly. That's why they contact a group of workers of a nearby underwater oil rig who reluctantly accept the job. They are joined by some navy SEALS who will help them to locate and investigate the cause of the crash. But they do not only find the crashed sub they also find out that there is more down there in the deep than what they had ever expected to see.What I liked so much about this movie was that this time the aliens didn't feel threatening at all. It was something completely different from what we were used to see and it worked perfectly. This was a beautiful wellcrafted movie with some very fine acting and with some excellent special effects. Even though this movie was created in 1989 the computer animations were still marvelous and breathtaking. In fact this entire movie is breathtaking. It is very touching and powerful at the same time and I'm sure that many people will have a lot of difficulties not to show any emotions while watching it. I give this movie an 810. It sure doesn't deserve any less.".

Michael Biehn perfects his sterotype persona in The Abyss1989 as the battle and take charged obsessed Lt. Coffey.  Maybe the finest directed feature film James Cameron has put forth.  The Abyss1989 is way better than the overrated and less than average Titanic1997.  Minor weakness is that the film at times drags towards the end.  Ed Harris produces a performance of human depth and quality as Virgil Brigman.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Lindsey Brigman is the perfect counterpart to Ed Harris's Virgil Brigmanwhich is why the two characters make a good couple.

Hollywood executives make movies for the common herd they dumb them down to make sure every patron goes away feeling happy.  God forbid that anyone actually may have to think a little.

The visual imagery of this film is stunning with no half measures taken it is such a pleasure to watch. The aliens look as beautiful as an alien can do and the underwater scenery is so picturesque that I just wish I could be there.The special effects are stunning. As with a lot of Cameron's hits this was an innovator in special effects. If it wasn't for this film films such as The Matrix and Lord of the Rings would not be here or at least would not have been able to express themselves in a visual sense.Cameron is the ultimate director. Although he is a pain to work with he gets his image across and proves why he is such a hit machine. No one compares to him when it comes to picking a cast. Even though most of this cast were and still are unknown the performances in this are fantastic. I know I always praise him but Michael Biehn as Coffey is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen and the fact that Biehn was not even Oscar nominated is a travesty! He is great to watch as the maniac who is irate and just plain horrible. Ed Harris is on par with his good performances in The Rock and Apollo 13. You just want to be his mate in this movie despite the fact he is another pain see Rock out takes which is why him and Cameron have not spoken a word since this film. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was a bit of a fad. She didn't last very long being in good films but she is good as the hard nosed estranged wife who near the end becomes wonderfully vulnerable and loving.Cameron is a great writer and The Abyss along with The Terminator and Strange Days shows off his talent to a great extent. As with all of Cameron's SciFi screenplays behind the technology lies a distinctively human element. This enables The Abyss despite the extra terrestrial goings on to approach the audience on their level and suck viewers in to the film. The character of Coffey is a great obstacle character because he is losing his mind and is getting engulfed by paranoia to the point where he can not trust anyone. The way Cameron uses Coffey to build up suspense is very effective and the culmination of this is one of the most frantic underwater chases there will ever be. Spectacular is the only word that comes to mind. The ending of this film has been heavily criticised but this is unfair as it carries a decent message regarding humanity and fits the mood of the film. It may have been slightly rushed but the best bits of the film are all under water anyway.Anyone who likes their special effects a great story and terrific acting need look no further than The Abyss. The contrast of the breathtaking beauty of the ocean between the claustrophobia of a vessel should be enough to captivate most audiences. A fantastic visionary piece.".

	schema:reviewBody "James Cameron as a director is a bit of a mixed bag. He has created some of the most phenomenal action showcases cinema has ever seen. His movies make loads of money and create spectacle like no other. He has been part of the Alien quadrilogy Terminator and there was that little movie that could about a couple of lovers on a sinking boat. For that little picture he even won an Oscar. However as a writer he has also given us some patently ridiculous dialogue. It's like he can create some pretty interesting story concepts generate a great deal of tension between characters and pull of amazing action but when it gets to finding the heart and soul of a character he pulls out the cheese. It is interesting then that my favorite Cameron movie would be so character driven with only a few moments of grandiose action.The Abyss came out in 1989 with a trimmed down 146 run time. Later when the movie came to video Cameron released his directors adding a significant amount of footage and bringing the time to 171 minutes. Most of this extra footage comes in at the end of the film and stands to clear up some major confusion wrought in the theatrical version. It seems that there are some creates living at the bottom of the ocean and are rather perturbed at humanities prevalence for violence. It seems these creatures aliens? can manipulate water and have forced giant tidal waves to start approaching every major port. Humanity is saved when the creatures see the true love between the two main characters. It reminded me of the quote from Genesis where God agrees to save Sodom and Gomorrah if He can find just 10 righteous people. In their case He didn't and the cities were destroyed by sulfur and fire but in Cameron's tale it seems that the rekindling of love between Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio does save humanity.What Cameron does extremely well in this picture is create tension. From the claustrophobic setting of an underwater oil rig to the potential nuclear meltdown each scene slowly tightens the screws of suspense. The cold war plot raging outside of the main action reminded me a lot of 2010. In both pictures the main characters are isolated on vessels a spaceship on 2010 an underwater oil well in the Abyss while the USA and Russia bring conflict close to nuclear war back on earth or above water. In both movies this helps to add tension as it also dates the movies since the cold war is now over.One of my favorite scenes involves the flooding of parts of the rig. Water comes rushing into the rig and several of the characters scurry to make it to safety and close off the doors to isolate the flooding. Ed Harris is saved by his wedding ring. One of the doors automatically starts to close and Harris sticks his hand in to stop the door which normally would have crushed his hand but because he still wears the ring his the door does not fully close. This give him enough time to be saved from the flooding waters. There was an earlier scene in which his wife asks him why he still wears the ring since they have separated. When I chose my own wedding ring I opted for a titanium band known for its extra strength. I can't help but think of that scene every time I look at my own ring.Much of the dialogue in the Abyss is of the heavy handed clichd variety that Cameron brings to pretty much all of his movies. Some of the extemporaneous characters bring little to the overall movie and help distract the viewer from the main plot. I think Cameron has done a very good job with the two main characters though. Ed Harris does a remarkable job playing his role as 'boss' on the rig while still hackling with his wife. Mastrantonio also does a fine job of portraying the tough as nails Lindsay while still remaining feminine and sympathetic.The directors cut ending is much debated in the online world. While it serves to clarify what was a rather abrupt and confusing ending in the original it also becomes quite preachy and is at a loss for any type of subtlety. Cameron attacks his antiwar message like Ripley against an Alien.Even with some awful dialogue and a preachy ending the Abyss has still managed to be one of my favorite scifi movies. James Cameron creates a tension like a master auteur and creates two of his best characters to date.".

In both pictures the main characters are isolated on vessels a spaceship on 2010 an underwater oil well in the Abyss while the USA and Russia bring conflict close to nuclear war back on earth or above water. In both movies this helps to add tension as it also dates the movies since the cold war is now over.One of my favorite scenes involves the flooding of parts of the rig. Water comes rushing into the rig and several of the characters scurry to make it to safety and close off the doors to isolate the flooding. Ed Harris is saved by his wedding ring. One of the doors automatically starts to close and Harris sticks his hand in to stop the door which normally would have crushed his hand but because he still wears the ring his the door does not fully close. This give him enough time to be saved from the flooding waters. There was an earlier scene in which his wife asks him why he still wears the ring since they have separated. When I chose my own wedding ring I opted for a titanium band known for its extra strength. I can't help but think of that scene every time I look at my own ring.Much of the dialogue in the Abyss is of the heavy handed clichd variety that Cameron brings to pretty much all of his movies. Some of the extemporaneous characters bring little to the overall movie and help distract the viewer from the main plot. I think Cameron has done a very good job with the two main characters though. Ed Harris does a remarkable job playing his role as 'boss' on the rig while still hackling with his wife. Mastrantonio also does a fine job of portraying the tough as nails Lindsay while still remaining feminine and sympathetic.The directors cut ending is much debated in the online world. While it serves to clarify what was a rather abrupt and confusing ending in the original it also becomes quite preachy and is at a loss for any type of subtlety. Cameron attacks his antiwar message like Ripley against an Alien.Even with some awful dialogue and a preachy ending the Abyss has still managed to be one of my favorite scifi movies. James Cameron creates a tension like a master auteur and creates two of his best characters to date.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Abyss is one of my alltime favorite scifi films. It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clichs. And it does so with good dialog strong characterization and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long but worth every second of the experience and the slightly lengthier more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.Ostensibly this is a film about first contact with nonterrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas  violence love capitalism war courage and cowardice. The hardest most obedient soldier in the film played spectacularly by Michael Biehn is a coward and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife Harris turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the scifi genre. Even so this is a film which entertains at every level and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic.  Most of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in the abyss  a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands  after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship  The Benthic Explorer  to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong and the encounters with strange phenomena continue the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile on the surface accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA and nuclear war seems immanent. This describes just a small segment of the deliciously complex plot that unfolds in The Abyss. You'll have to see it to enjoy the rest.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wouldn't recommend watching the Theatrical Cut of The Abyss. It's a decent film but the ending is so butchered that it has you wondering what the hell happened. It just doesn't make any sense. However the ending to the Special Edition isn't perfect either. It clears things up it tells you why there are these florescent aliens swimming about but in the extended edition they're less likable  in the original cut Bud Ed Harris disarms a nuclear warhead is saved by aliens and then meets them for about two seconds before being taken back to the surface it's nonsensical but at least the aliens seem helpful and friendly. In the Special Edition though you see that these aliens are on the brink of destroying the world. They can control the waves so they're going to flood everything. And when Bud asks why they're going to do this they show lots of shots of nuclear bombs going off on some watery video screen. Here they seem a bit preachy and just a little bit psychotic. But then inspired by Bud's love for his wife they change their mind and the waves dissipate. The aquatic nutballs realise that we're not all bad and that there's no need for watery genocide. Suddenly they're a bunch of extraterrestrial hippies.But although the message of the Special Edition is pap in the extreme war is bad okay? Why can't we all just get along? it's at least an acceptable resolution. You're not left scratching your head.But the aliens are perhaps one of the least satisfactory aspects of the film. In parts the film becomes Close Encounters underwater yet the wideeyed wonder is just a little bit cornier than it should be. Much more successful is the Cold War paranoia and the working class banter amongst the characters. Cameron is no Spielberg.For me the most enjoyable parts of the film are those dealing with Coffey Michael Biehn. He's a Navy Seal who has to hitch a ride on Bud's underwater drilling platform to locate a sunken nuclear sub. At the beginning his mission is just to look for survivors but when the aliens show up he thinks they're Russians. Cue psychosis.The progression from normality to lunacy isn't exactly handled with subtlety Coffey goes mad almost instantly a reaction to being so deep underwater but it's fun. One of my favourite bits is when the divers are talking and Coffey is discretely cutting his arm under the table. Mental just doesn't describe him adequately. And I also like it when the divers confront him after he brings a nuclear warhead onto the rig. He says something about them doing an 'aboutface' but Biehn delivers the line superbly he hisses it like a snake. And then once they leave you see that he's been holding a gun behind his back all the time. Again he's just completely lost the plot. But what makes him such a good character is that he doesn't think he's mad. He thinks what he's doing is for everyone's good he thinks there are commies down there. So as dangerous and crazy as he is he ends up being something of a pathetic figure. Indeed even his death isn't cause for celebration. After an excellent submarine chase he falls down into the abyss and dies when the sub cracks under the pressure. Soldier boy just couldn't take the strain.But although Coffey is the most fun character if fun is the correct word Ed Harris is the person who makes the film work. You can feed him the corniest lines and he'll somehow make them seem genuine. And he'll give them a ring of truth because he's so damn intense. Just take the resuscitation scene. It's silly in the extreme. Bud's wife drowns after the chase with Coffey and Bud then takes her back to the rig. He then resuscitates her. It really shouldn't work and we've seen so many resuscitation scenes that they're clichd beyond belief but Harris jumps into the scene with such vigour that it ends up being one of the best scenes in the film. He gives CPR like a madman and yells Fight! at the top of his lungs before slapping his wife across the face. It's pretty hardcore. And then when his wife wakes up after an interminable length of time a shaking of the head which would be the normal reaction is replaced by a goofy grin.And credit also has to go to Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Bud's wife Lindsey. She gives an excellent performance and she joins Ripley and Sarah Connor as female characters that are genuinely tough. These days there are tons of annoying lipstick heroines that are supposed to be 'empowered'  women who can fire oversized guns and 'kick ass'. But they're usually anorexic models with balloon tits they're about as tough as a glass of water. But Cameron has a habit of creating genuinely tough female characters ones that feel like the real deal.However as good as Harris Biehn and Mastrantonio are the rest of the cast are far from stellar. In fact some of the acting is downright dire. But it's weird although there's some cringeworthy Oh my god! moments and although there's some unconvincing crying and some bad line delivery there's genuine chemistry between the actors which makes up for some of the shortcomings when it comes to craft.But to be fair the bad acting isn't limited to the supporting cast. Mastrantonio suffers in the scene where she has to talk to Bud as he's journeying down the abyss to disarm the nuke. But then again the script doesn't help her much. She has to talk some nonsense about candles. However that's Cameron for you. He's a master at action but an amateur at emotions. Just watch Titanic for another lesson.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Abyss was a movie of destiny. First off this movie either began or was the result of a lifetime obsession James Cameron has the ocean see later Titanic and his IMAX deep sea movies. The Abyss is also full of echos of claustrophobic thrilleradventure movie Alien in which Cameron directed the sequel. So combining one of Cameron's old movies with his new obsession we get The Abyss a solid scifi thriller starring Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Ed Harris plays Bud the head of an undersea oil rig where very little actually happens and the people on the rig are only there in case something goes wrong. Well wouldn't you know it but an American nuclear submarine patrolling the US coast near the oil rig suddenly sinks killing the sailors on board. The Americans suspect it's the Soviets but we know better. Something pink and glowing does something to the submarine causing it to sink. A team of Navy seals ferried down to the rig by Bud's exwife Lindsey Mastrantonio boards the oil rig and uses it as a command base for their mission to recover the submarine. And that is when the fun begins. Of course a hurricane has to enter into the plot in movies like this there is always a hurricane but beyond The Abyss is a solid scifi thriller where the oil rig becomes a character in the movie. Much like the Nostromo in Alien or The Discovery in 2001 the tight spaces adds flavor to the movie bringing the setting in as another character of the movie. The special effects were groundbreaking at the time and hold up well today. The scene of a column of water snaking its way through the oil rig still creeps me out to this day.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've never really heard of The Abyss except in Fox DVD commercials.  When it came out I was only 8 and not into scifi movies that weren't titled Star Wars.  However now I decided to check it out and was quite pleased with this solid scifi movie.At first I wasn't quite sure why this was considered scifi.  It seemed pretty normal with the sinking of a nuclear sub and the hiring of an oil crew to save it.  It wasn't for a while till we really got to meet the extraterrestrial creatures.  The special effects for representing these characters were quite good and I especially liked the water creature that toured around the rescue vessel.  It's also neat to see that effect inspire a similar one used in Terminator 2.As I said the story took a little while to gain steam but it was pretty interesting from then on.  The acting was good too most notably by Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.  The other actors didn't do anything really extraordinary but serve as solid supporting characters.Overall I wouldn't say The Abyss is the best scifi movie out there or that it will dethrone Star Wars anytime soon but rather it's a solid addition for any scifi fan's collection.My IMDb Rating 810.  My Yahoo! Grade B Memorable".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie based primarily on my love for other Cameron movies and the mostly highly positive reviews here. What a mistake! This movie is deeply deeply flawed both as science fiction and as a matter of filmmaking. It suffers from many of the worst clichs of 1980s American films and displays none of the sense of atmosphere imagination and style which are present in Cameron's best work. I find it almost unbelievable that he followed the amazing Aliens with this movie.So what are the problems? First the plot. It is clichd silly and resolves with a laughable deus ex machina. Like many a poor actionscifi movie it relies almost entirely on coincidence and contrivance to develop the story rather than being driven by strong characters with believable motivations. For example we are presented with a series of pathetically derivative stories  the estranged husband and wife who we know are going to get back together from the first second the psycho chain of commandloving military guy the ragtag bunch of lovable tech specialists who find their beloved undersea rig taken out of their hands and on and on. Characters live or die based on unlikely coincidences the worst of which is undoubtedly Ed Harris' character being saved by his wedding ring which he never takes off  symbolism doesn't get much more obvious or ridiculous. The main action sequence an underwater subfight drags on and on for no real reason. Nothing here is remotely new or interesting. Not content with that though we also have man's folly with nuclear weapons and is man inherently good or evil? thrown in for good measure. Ultimately we get a preachy silly ending which gives virtually no resolution to those questions  the characters learn nothing except that if we're naughty the aliens are going to drown us all.Second the characters. They are just totally implausible. In Aliens Cameron gave us a more believable bunch of characters despite the fact that they were billions of miles away and hundreds of years into the future. Here they are just clichd boring unappealing and predictable. The 'lovable' undersea cowboys talk in ridiculous slang and catchphrases. The military guys perhaps presaging Avatar are robotic and wholly defined by crew cuts and personal aggression. Of course there is the 'crazy' guy who noone takes seriously but who turns out to be right the coldbutsexy woman who knows how to take control even a sassy black chick. It's all so predictable and there are no surprises at all.Thirdly as a matter of science fiction this movie is an epic failure. We learn little to nothing about the science allegedly involved. The undersea creatures display no characteristics which reflect their environment why would they have technology to control water through the air when they live entirely UNDER water?. The physics on display is awful a huge station presumably weighing hundreds of tonnes is rapidly dragged by the weight of a small crane for example. Even the science of deep sea diving is largely ignored  things crack and crumple when it is convenient from a plot perspective but other times the characters and equipment seem to be immune to the effects of being deep underwater. Where incidentally there is no life and the water is a pleasant clear aquamarine colour.Fourthly and most importantly this movie is simply boring. When you have a silly plot and characters who are far from engaging the last thing you should do is have a film which drags on and on and on but that is precisely what this one does.A word about the special effects  they are OK by 1989 standards but pretty awful by contemporary standards. The undersea creatures look like a bad children's cartoon and the much celebrated water effects definitely show their age. Much more impressive are the underwater and flooding scenes but even these are fairly average by current standards.This movie seems to hint at what was eventually going to be done much better in Avatar right down to the fluro blue aliens. Although Avatar repeats some of the mistakes listed above it is a far more coherent and more importantly engaging film. This film has plenty of defenders but the truth is that even amongst Cameron's own body work there are many films which are far far better than this. I refuse to believe anyone can watch Aliens and then watch The Abyss and come away thinking that this film is even half as good.".

I cannot begin to explain how different my viewing experience of the Special edition was from the severely truncated theatrical version. To sum it up the special edition is a richly thematic and far more resonant experience the difference between a good movie and a truly great film. Perhaps Cameron spends too much time in the beginning of the picture explaining the technology and how it works but I believe that knowledge only helps one immerse themselves into the world of the characters. The Abyss is actually three films a technological thriller a love story and a lesson in basic morality. This is definitely a movie that warrants your full attention since the details are so vastly important to the whole that if you were to step out for five minutes which no one should ever do! you would become completely lost. This film has some of the most amazing scenes I have ever seen in film and they are quite diverse. One would have to be the scene where Linsday chooses to drown and be taken back to the rig by Virgil...the real human element of that scene that struck me was when the water level started to rise over her neck she doubts that it was a good idea. I can feel her fear as she desperately tries to keep her head above the rising water. Immediately following is the scene where Virgil revives Lindsay screaming for her to fight while everyone else thinks he is crazy for trying to bring back what appears to be Linsday's corpse. That entire scene is so gut wrenchingly emotional that it's a good thing that there are a few quiet scenes afterward...we need to catch our breath but then this also has to do with Cameron's storytelling he knows we do too. The biggest moments of goose bump inducing awe that this film gave me came only from the special edition...the whole reason for the NTI's being there is explained and the reason they didn't go through with using the wave to wipe out mankind was because of Bud's own self sacrifice. It's hard to comment on a movie you love without getting incoherently jumbled but this one will always be special to me because it does one thing that many films these days do not it makes me feel something.".

A fast moving storm forces the Navy to use the crew and equipment from a nearby underwater deep sea drilling platform and the oil roughnecks are promised some big government checks for their help. Crew chief Ed Harris gives his reluctant consent made even more reluctant by the fact that his estranged wife Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has designed some new equipment for use in the really deep waters of The Abyss of the Atlantic Ocean. The Navy people and the oil people are a bad fit to start with but when the deep depths effect Navy SEAL Michael Biehn by bringing out the worst aspects of the military authoritarian personality things get real interesting down in the deep.The spectacle does dwarf the story which is the only real criticism I can make of The Abyss. What the submarine made accidental contact with is some incredible alien life form which I can't go into further because that's the whole point of the film. Of course Biehn still believes it's all a Russian plot of some kind and therein lies the conflict exacerbated by the extreme paranoia he develops.Unlike Cameron's Titanic the spectacle at the end just overwhelms the human players in this film. But it was those special effects that go The Abyss its Academy Award recognition. The Abyss was also nominated for Sound and ArtSet Direction and Cinematography. It could have been a winner in any of those categories. In fact the biggest mistake you can make which is the one I did make to see The Abyss on the small screen and formatted. This film is what IMAX was developed for.Though the story does get lost somewhat in the special effects the point is still made about man being ready and open to all kinds of possibilities of life that can exist anywhere.

	schema:reviewBody "This review is for the special edition of Abyss that adds 28 minutes of footage especially near the end according to Wikipedia. I had seen it many years ago but although I remembered it was underwater and had a particularly cool and original creature I didn't remember much else from it. After watching it again recently I wonder why. This is one of the best undersea adventures I've seen certainly the most ambitious. This was made before computer effects became so prevalent so most of the action underwater is actually shot underwater on sets and in diving suits. Stateoftheart computer effects at the time are used to portray most of the strange deepsea creatures and they still look great today. The Abyss starts as the rescue operation of a nuclear submarine but veers more into good first encounter sciencefiction as it goes along.What struck me was the great underwater setting that at times made you feel claustrophobic and isolated as if you were deep underwater yourself. It's not the most actionpacked film and it can feel slow at times so try to be relatively awake before watching it. The first half sometimes somehow made me feel contemplative and relaxed but it might bore some people. You should be warned that most of the film takes place in a relatively confined location so there's no undersea exploration a la Cousteau per say. It's also a characterdriven conflict between reason and openmindedness the rig crew VS ignorance and destructive impulses the military. As it went along my appreciation of the film went from only good to remarkable. There are strong suspenseful and dramatic character moments extremely well played by Ed Harris rig captain Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio creator of the rig and future exwife of the rig captain and Michael Biehn leader of the navy seals. I particularly liked the shuttle scene between the captain and his future exwife. Because of the creatures there's also a feeling of mystery and sense of wonder at the unknown which is rarely seen in modern scifi but that I often enjoy. The characters are not the type to shoot first and ask questions later which I found refreshing.What I also found noticeable is that there are several false endings as in it might stop there but it doesn't going further into the abyss as it were. This is a great humanistic and human scifi flick that gets better as it goes along. It's closer to 2001 than Aliens but it's not really like either one. The extra footage in the ending makes for a more satisfying conclusion that helps things make sense. However your appreciation might vary on how cynical you are I can see it ruining the film for a minority. In my opinion it's worth owning but be careful of which DVD version you pick the special editions don't necessarily have a second disc with the extras and the covers don't tell you how many discs there are you want the 2disc version.Rating 8 out of 10".

The characters are not the type to shoot first and ask questions later which I found refreshing.What I also found noticeable is that there are several false endings as in it might stop there but it doesn't going further into the abyss as it were. This is a great humanistic and human scifi flick that gets better as it goes along. It's closer to 2001 than Aliens but it's not really like either one. The extra footage in the ending makes for a more satisfying conclusion that helps things make sense. However your appreciation might vary on how cynical you are I can see it ruining the film for a minority. In my opinion it's worth owning but be careful of which DVD version you pick the special editions don't necessarily have a second disc with the extras and the covers don't tell you how many discs there are you want the 2disc version.Rating 8 out of 10";

Though this isn't Cameron's best I would say Titanic and Aliens are his best it definitely isn't his worst. The main problem with this film is its length  it clocks in at 146 minutes and a whopping 171 minutes for the special edition! which makes it hard to watch without at least one bathroom break. I very much enjoyed the performances by the superb actors Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio whose character interactions are quite heartfelt especially near the end. And talking about the ending it's one of the best climaxes I have ever seen won't give it away but I LOVED it!. And special mention goes to Alan Silvestri for his superb score. A solid 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "By far James Cameron's most personal work it takes at least half an hour for anything conventionally 'exciting' to happen but by then we're so involved with the characters and their situation that it makes the drama all the more intense.   Cameron is a master of the 'pared down' screenplay giving us all the elements necessary for the story but no frills.  The Terminator epitomises this technique.  Rarely does the story slow down long enough for the characters to indulge in reams of exposition but then that's what makes it such a visceral experience.  Cameron's dialogue is made up of either bold statements of fact or smart wisecracks.  Never are the audience or characters allowed to think I wonder if they meant this...   So it is with The Abyss.  Only with the story being naturally slower nonstop action is not contrived to take the focus off the dialogue.  It is left to the visuals to do this and what stunning visuals they are.  The reputed 'hell' that Cameron put his cast and crew through during the shoot would doubtless by judged worth it by the director pointing to these as his evidence.   The film is no less interesting when things are confined to the interior of the sub.  The actors convey their uneasiness with their surroundings and each other perfectly.  No the relationship between the characters of Harris and Masterantonio isn't very credible but this is more down to Cameron's shunning of backstory than any deficiencies in performance.  In any case it doesn't damage the drama at all.   There are some not very subtle allusions to the Cold War for those who want them but for those who don't The Abyss proves surprisingly difficult to categorise.  One thing that can be said about it is that it is consistently entertaining throughout its running time.  Cameron hasn't lost the knack of providing for his audience.  Fans will find something different to his usual style but pleasingly this at least remains the same.".

While little kids who know of Pinocchio from story books and the Disney Animated Classic are sure to enjoy the outstanding animation of the puppet will most likely be frightened by many of the other scenes. Older kids teenagers and many adults often consider themselves too old for the story of Pinocchio with a few exceptions.There's also a couple other scenes in the film which make it objectionable for younger children.  One scene makes repeated use of the word jacka while referring to donkeys as in the original story the word seems a little over used for a film that has a G rating in Canada not sure of the US rating.  Another objectionable scene is at the end when real boy Pinocchio tells a lie to two of the films villains knowing that his nose won't grow anymore.  To me this counteracts the lesson to be learned by having his nose grow when he lies in the first place.Over all the film is still really well done and very touching provoking tearducts in places.  The acting is excellent and the direction seems good.  The script on the whole seems good apart from the few objectionable scenes which make me wonder what the film's target audience is meant to be as opposed the recent Disney musical version titled Geppetto which was definitely familyoriented.".

Also superb is Martin Landau as Geopetto who brought charm and sadness to the role. The only things that weren't so well done were Jiminy Cricket though David Doyle voiced him with spiritit's just his character animation was a bit mechanical and Udo Keir's villain did little for me but that is just me being picky. The film is lavishly designed especially with the scenes with the puppets with the sets that look like something out of an opera or vaudeville. Also Rachel Portman's score was beautiful very dynamic and sometimes moving in the more slower bits. Comparing this to the Disney film this is a lot more faithful to the book by Carlo Callodi but the Disney film has charm and a certain darkness that isn't quite there here but it is evident. All in all a highly underrated and beautiful film. 710 Bethany Cox.".

Also the book has a pretty long story with lots of things that are difficult to put in a hour and half movie Roberto Begnigni tried to do that and we all know that the result was horrible. The classic special effects without CGI are amazing and the acting is great. The style of the movie reminds me a little Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen 1988. This movie is really magic to me and it has all the atmosphere and style of the original book. If only people read more Collodi's book wich is amazing and watch less the Disney movie everybody would agree with me.This is by far my favorite Pinocchio movie and one of my favorite movies of all time.".

Bebe Neurith and Rob Schneider of all people are sleazy and dim witted as real people versions of the cat and the fox.

The one thing this one could have done without though is a few goofy ass songs from Stevie Wonder. Like wtf.

Udo Kier although underused did great as the villain Lorenzini. The cast isn't the only strongest aspect however. The mixture of animation and liveaction with the help of the Muppet creator Jim Henson captures the spirit of the book perfectly well and the CGI effects on Pinocchio is creative to look at you can feel like thanking the company for doing such a fine job. The visuals are magnificent and the cinematography is imaginative.

	schema:headline " A seemingly rushed and somewhat annoying version of the story";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember back around the time this 1996 version of Pinocchio was released not sure whether it was around the time of its theatrical release or its home video release. I saw the promotional image of a wooden Pinocchio looking at a real version of himself like a reflection in the water and later saw a trailer for this adaptation of Carlo Collodi's story on TV. Even though I was very familiar with the classic 1940 Disney version I never actually saw this movie when it was new not that I was missing much. Well over a decade later I finally saw it just last night. By this point I knew it wasn't a very popular film so my expectations weren't very high and it's a good thing they weren't since I found The Adventures of Pinocchio to be below average! Pinocchio is a wooden puppet carved by a woodcutter and puppet maker named Geppetto. Soon after he finishes making this puppet figure of a boy it magically comes to life! Even though Pinocchio is still wooden he can now move and talk but doesn't know much about the world around him. He wants to be a real boy but has a lot to learn before that can happen. While walking out with Geppetto he meets some schoolchildren and wants to go to school himself. He also catches the attention of two criminals named Felinet and Volpe and is soon wanted by the evil Lorenzini! At school Pinocchio punches a classmate and lies to the teacher about it causing his nose to grow longer with each lie and after he finally confesses he is kicked out of class. He then goes to a bakery where he causes chaos and for this he and Geppetto are both taken to court! They will both be sent to prison unless Gepetto can pay for the damages which he can't so Lorenzini offers to pay but only if Pinocchio is given to him. Eventually Geppetto reluctantly gives in and Lorenzini gets the puppet but it turns out Pinocchio is not safe with him! The living wooden puppet finds himself on an adventure full of danger with a wise cricket named Pepe often appearing to give him advice! This film adaptation begins with a poor opening narration from David Doyle which turns out to be the voice of Pepe the Cricket. This character is supposed to be funny but he fails. The same goes for the rest of the film's humour in general in scenes such as the havoc Pinocchio wreaks in the bakery. It's not funny when it tries to be. Also it seems Felinet and Volpe are supposed to be funny but they also fail miserably unlike Honest John and Gideon in the 1940 version. Some of the characters in this 1996 version may get a little annoying at times including the title one and I think this is when they're trying to be funny. The poor humour isn't the only problem here. The Adventures of Pinocchio seems rushed going too fast and seeming to just throw in characters without taking enough time to introduce them making them seem very insignificant. Geppetto certainly doesn't seem very surprised when he sees Pinocchio alive for the first time. The lack of focus even makes the story seem almost meaningless even though it does include the morals of the story but in a very ineffective manner! The film fails both at trying to be funny AND trying to be touching except maybe near the end. I also didn't care for the design of the wooden Pinocchio's face and his facial expressions.I have never read the 19th century book The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi but have been familiar with the animated 1940 Disney flick from a very early age so it's obviously hard for me not to compare these two films. I can't forget the times I saw the 1940 version as a kid and I still thought that film was great when I watched it again a couple times in 2007 my first viewings of the classic piece of Disney animation since my childhood in the 90's. It has excitement poignancy and some good humour and all this is more than I can say about the 1996 version. This movie does have some nice visuals but that's the only positive thing I can think of to say about it and that's certainly not enough to make it worthwhile. Some movies can improve with a second viewing but I can't imagine how I could ever warm up to this mess of a live action adaptation of Collodi's story so I don't intend to watch it again. If the screenplay had been better written it could have made a really good family movie but due to its poor quality and lack of focus the film's results were disappointing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember back around the time this 1996 version of Pinocchio was released not sure whether it was around the time of its theatrical release or its home video release. I saw the promotional image of a wooden Pinocchio looking at a real version of himself like a reflection in the water and later saw a trailer for this adaptation of Carlo Collodi's story on TV. Even though I was very familiar with the classic 1940 Disney version I never actually saw this movie when it was new not that I was missing much. Well over a decade later I finally saw it just last night. By this point I knew it wasn't a very popular film so my expectations weren't very high and it's a good thing they weren't since I found The Adventures of Pinocchio to be below average! Pinocchio is a wooden puppet carved by a woodcutter and puppet maker named Geppetto. Soon after he finishes making this puppet figure of a boy it magically comes to life! Even though Pinocchio is still wooden he can now move and talk but doesn't know much about the world around him. He wants to be a real boy but has a lot to learn before that can happen. While walking out with Geppetto he meets some schoolchildren and wants to go to school himself. He also catches the attention of two criminals named Felinet and Volpe and is soon wanted by the evil Lorenzini! At school Pinocchio punches a classmate and lies to the teacher about it causing his nose to grow longer with each lie and after he finally confesses he is kicked out of class. He then goes to a bakery where he causes chaos and for this he and Geppetto are both taken to court! They will both be sent to prison unless Gepetto can pay for the damages which he can't so Lorenzini offers to pay but only if Pinocchio is given to him. Eventually Geppetto reluctantly gives in and Lorenzini gets the puppet but it turns out Pinocchio is not safe with him! The living wooden puppet finds himself on an adventure full of danger with a wise cricket named Pepe often appearing to give him advice! This film adaptation begins with a poor opening narration from David Doyle which turns out to be the voice of Pepe the Cricket. This character is supposed to be funny but he fails.

	schema:headline " Amazing atmosphere and effects but for the other parts...";
	schema:reviewBody "So I've watched Pinocchio. So what do I think about it? Let's begin with the good parts. We have Prague esk Krumlov and Croatia serving as the sets I adored that and it makes the movie better because of it. The music matches the tone of the scenes and gives a nice feeling to it. The puppet of Pinocchio is also a nice piece of professional craftsmanship and is properly used in the movie production. And there is Martin Landau playing as Gepetto and it is obvious he's doing a good job at it.But then everyone with a human brain that is properly functioning and isn't here for a cheesy halfdead experience starts to think about what the movie shows them. And then this movie falls apart. The writing is bad and that is obvious. I'm not going to do a scene analysis but just going to pick the biggest sore points I saw in this movie.For instance we have Pepe the Cricket. I think he is supposed to be reminiscent of Jiminy Cricket in some way but he is not helping Pinocchio really as a supporting character. I think Pinocchio just found everything he needed to know out on his own and Pepe did not really help in that. His jokes also aren't funny and he is just plain annoying. And whereas with the Disney version we clearly understood why Jiminy was doing what he was doing because the Blue Faerie asked him to do so Pepe is just a stalker doing things for no reason or motive whatsoever. The second problem is Pinocchio's quest to become a real boy. It is contrived and comes out of nowhere and only seems to exist ''just because all Pinocchio versions are based around that''. But here there are no promises regarding him becoming a real boy if he fulfills a certain condition like the Blue Faerie gave him in the Disney version after he was made alive and in the book at a certain point in the story but here it is blatant wishfulfillment and because miracles come from the heart. Yeah that is a great idea for writing. The third problem is the lore of the world in general. Lore is information we learn about the universe of the story and what makes it tick. Some parts are nicely set up like how Gepetto's emotional impact on a tree makes the magic in it alive so he could years later find it again and make a puppet out of it. And of course there is the water that turns people into animals they are mostly in common with and how Pinocchio escapes that by the holes in his body. It could've been done better but we understand why things are the way they are. However there are major holes that a bit of rationalizing aren't going to save. This is mostly due to poor exposition. For instance at the end of the story we learn that Lampwick was turned back into a human because he did a lot of good deeds. Wait what? We only were told that the water turned people into animals not how to resolve that. If we as the audience could learn about what the solution was against it and it turned out to be good deeds then we understood what their next plan was and how Lampwick could resolve his tiny problem. And also if good deeds are the answer wouldn't any hardworking donkeykid turn back after a certain amount of time? Weird. And then there is the problem regarding the foreman turning into a monster  wait that isn't an animal. Why not a vicious wolf or bear or any other animal that can fit his metaphor?The fourth problem are Volpe and Felinet get it? Fox and Feline. Yeah great satire here. Whereas in the book they were brilliant and deceitful and in the Disney movie they had a clear motive to what they were doing they're suffering here from the same problem as Pepe what are they doing anyways? I understood the part with Lorenzini because of the money and all that but afterwards they don't really seem to have a purpose except for staying on screen and annoying everybody. O yes they're supposed to bring him back to Lorenzini but they're not trying to do that. Strange.And my last big problem is the teacher. If I were a teacher back then I would have noticed that there is a boy in my class that isn't a student of mine and o yeah is A WOODEN PUPPET. He does never question it but only remarks the nose like he had more wooden puppets before as students. Great. Anyway for those who were TL DR the atmosphere is good the acting is decent but the story falls flat on its wooden face. And stories are kind of important.".

Rob Schneider and Bebe Neuwirth play two pathetic villains in what can only be described as a bad joke on them. Udo Kier plays a character named Lorenzini who is apparently a new character as if this version wasn't screwed up enough as it is. Pointless live version isn't totally faithful to the classic but the visual attempt is there. Perhaps the script should substitute as fire wood. Score 2  10";

If you want to enjoy this film you have to meet Jeffery The Dude Lebowski on his terms hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their perhaps somewhat leisurely pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism theft of a car and more importantly a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape kidnapping abstract art porn and  of course  bowling. The story is actually kind of simple. You see some nogood German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug  and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug  or possibly get a new one because that rug really tied the room together. So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people even Jesus  who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man.With Jeff Bridges in the leading role the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission. The supporting cast is outstanding J.Turturro J.Goodman and S.Buscemi among many others the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This  for me  is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films httpwww.imdb.comlistls054200841Lesserknown Masterpieces httpwww.imdb.comlistls070242495Favorite LowBudget and Bmovies httpwww.imdb.comlistls054808375".

I simply can't begin to perceive how one could sit down in front of this cinematic poppoetry as it plates gold on the silver screen and not feel so incredibly alive. The dream sequence Busbee Berkley musical numbers are unique and aweinspiring the humor is rich subtle and clever in the way it satirizes politically correct arrogance the freeflowing story avoids even pokes fun at nonessentials like plot points and payoffs. But what really makes this film such a masterpiece such a panacea is the incredible humanism the care that the Coen brothers put in developing The Dude Jeff Bridges Walter John Goodman Donnie Steve Buscemitremendously endearing and Brandt magnificently played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Looking at the films use of Sam Elliott to play The Stranger who constantly rambles about the many wonders of The Dude among other things it is clear that the film is an ode to a Dudist way of life. And in a time where so many film promise that they have the answer to the worlds problems and end up as slick stylistic showoff films what more could one ask for than a goodhearted film like this? Not to mention the performance by Jeff Bridges which ranks among the best performances of the nineties he has a relaxed slouch a goofy smile an enthusiastic dance and his buttons can only be pushed by Walter who John Goodman plays with charm and fury. The Coen brothers have always been considered 'cold' filmmakers but there is nothing here but warmth and humanity as is the case with the Coens' Fargo. What we have here is one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema and if you can't see that grab a White Russian hit the bowling ally and find your innerDude as soon as possible.".

When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight fun movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now a few years and several viewing later I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres styles and images in a similarly eclectic postmodern fashion but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film but it doesn't shout look at me! Aren't I clever?. It sucks you in from the get go and bottom line it is FUNNY and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect the script the direction set design costumes and the wonderful soundtrack one of the most brilliant ever assembled it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers Creedence classics and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac Captain Beefheart Moondog Esquivel and garage gods The Monks. Plus of course the actors who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges 'Fat City' 'Starman' IS The Dude and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman Steve Buscemi John Turturro Peter Stomare and Jon Polito are all on board as well as Julianne Moore 'Boogie Nights' David Huddleston 'Capricorn One' Philip Seymour Hoffman 'Magnolia' and Sam Elliot 'Mask' even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara 'The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie' and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski' it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office Top Ten was as inspired and amusing as this one!".

I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In The Hudsucker Proxy it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In Raising Arizona I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film I felt many touches of greatness but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as Jesus coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles Hotel California done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is once you dig deep a fine piece of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Acting is one of the most key elements to success or failure of a film. Some film types can survive without superb acting. These motion pictures can entertain the viewer with special effects or intense action scenes. A film based on heavy dialog and backstory can not survive with out excellent actors. One such movie that meets the dialogbased criterion is The Big Lebowski. The film follows Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski Jeff Bridges and his two close friends through a not so normal chain of events. The story is augmented by the supporting characters Walter John Goodman and Donny Steve Buscemi. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen the creative forces behind Fargo the intriguing story succeeds because of the actors' impeccable skill. As with many other films by the Coen brothers The Big Lebowski is an odd array of out of the ordinary characters slapped right in the middle of an improbable situation. The Dude is an unlikely hero living in the city of Los Angeles who becomes embroiled in a botched kidnapping. This is not the average kidnapper comedy that has been seen a thousand times before. The Coen brothers take a fresh look at an old tired subject. The story they have created is intriguing and entertaining but the true entertainment comes from the unique characters. Walter played by John Goodman is a Vietnam veteran who seems to have some parts of post traumatic stress syndrome. Donny another one of The Dude's close friends is a quiet unassuming character who often interjects into conversation but no one pays close attention to what he says.As well as these characters are written they would not be as effective had they been played by other actors. This effectiveness of acting can be seen in the opening scene at the bowling alley where the supporting characters are first introduced. This scene is comprised of Donny Walter and The Dude sitting at their lane in the bowling alley discussing the attack on The Dude by some hired thugs 7min 25 sec. The Dude is approaching the situation in his usual lackadaisical way. Jeff Bridges conveys The Dude's overall demeanor in his laid back sauntering walk. Although being laid back Bridges is direct in his speaking showing that The Dude is not the average confused old stoner. Bridges facial expressions during this scene show The Dude is distressed about the loss of his rug which 'tied the room together.'Donny seems to be an outside observer in this scene and throughout much of the film. Buscemi conveys his character's attention during discussion by following the flow of the conversation with his head. He looks from The Dude to Walter and from Walter to The Dude depending on who is talking. He may seem to be paying attention but his asking of simple questions dispels this assumption. Another technique Buscemi uses is while he is observing the conversation he furrows his brow as if in deep thought and contemplation. This look of concentration is juxtaposed with the look of confused happiness an empty smile Buscemi uses when Donny makes a point in the conversation. These techniques which are introduced by Bridges and Buscemi early in the film are used throughout the entire picture. Although Bridges and Buscemi do an excellent job of introducing their characters traits to the viewer Goodman superbly shows his character's inner traits. Throughout the conversation it is apparent due to dialog that Walter is becoming upset. Goodman conveys this anger with facial expressions and body movement. In the early part of the conversation Goodman puts on a stone face to show that Walter is firmly set in his position. The Dude begins to agitate Walter as the conversation continues. Goodman shows this agitation by furrowing his brow leaning forward while talking and turning progressively redder. As Goodman continues his speaking becomes more staccato and flustered. When The Dude refers to one of the attackers as 'the china man' Walter continues on his tirade momentarily then quietly addresses the non politically correct nature of The Dude's comment. Changing from this aggravated manner of speaking to a more politically correct and lower tone shows that Walter has some sudden mood swings and a short fuse as he returns to his tirade quickly. This scene exemplifies the acting skills of John Goodman Jeff Bridges and Steve Buscemi. The characters in this story have been given interesting and entertaining dialog by the writers but it is up to the actors to make the characters exude a certain feeling or trait. In each of their roles the three main actors add a level of feeling to the characters that is lacking from many of the offerings of the dark comedy genre. Goodman's portrayal of Walter as the 'know it all' with a short fuse is downright hilarious. Jeff Bridges steps out of his usually serious persona to portray a character as laid back as they come 'quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county.' Steve Buscemi is as entertaining as ever. His depiction of Donny the character to rarely speak adds depth to an otherwise bland side character. After viewing this film one can see why actors who can actually practice their craft are worth their weight in gold.".

He finds out that the criminals were not looking for him but looking for the OTHER Jeff Lebowski the disabled millionaire played by David Huddleston. That's all I can tell you. The rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words but it's bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the words.Still what I'll remember most about The Big Lebowski is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances. Bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lieabout who just wants to be left alone. John Goodman is the real comic gem here as the foreverloudmouthed Walter The Dude's bowling partner and best friend. Steve Buscemi costars as the dimwitted bugeyed Donny the third bowling partner there's a small but interestingly offbeat spot for Julianne Moore and John Torturro stops in as Jesus the bowler for what is probably the best walkon performance in years.

He's simply some dopey hippie who loves to hang around a John Goodman cardboardcutout Vietnam vet gone loco real Vets should raise their fists in anger over such an overdone unfunny disrespectful and insulting characterization and a seldomlyseen Steve Buscemi who doesn't really do much. The plot winds into so many different twists and turns and includes so many supporting characters all of whom seek The Dude's bag of money that trying to understand this movie is like trying to untangle the Gordian Knot by hand. What's the point of placing layer upon layer upon layer of weird uninteresting characters to the point that you forget what the hell this movie is about? Nihilist German rockers? Some sicko Hugh Hefner clone? A gorgeous yet incomprehensible avantgarde artist who wants to have The Dude's baby? A strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort of Greek chorus? Stop it! PeeWee's Big Adventure had an array of weird characters but it succeeded because it had a straightforward plot and brilliant acting and writing. The Coen's monstrosity has little wit or signs of superb comic writing and all of their characters though weird are totally boring and flavorless. For weird characters to work they must act totally offthewall and twisted beyond realism. The weirdos in Lebowski are actually regular and seem like a mishmash of alltooreal rejects from a yuppie coffee bar.Who likes this stuff? I have just seen No Country for Old Men and like Lebowski that was poorly written in terms of a smooth plot and like Lebowski lacked any interesting characters. I'll give Fargo a chance otherwise the Coen Brothers ain't reeling me in with their weird clunky movies.".

	schema:headline " I cannot respect King Arthur...";
	schema:reviewBody "I did not hate this film. It was fairly entertaining with wellstaged battle scenes and high production values. The acting though often either overblown or slightly wooden was passable and Ioan Gruffydd was actually quite good.What bothered me is that the text at the opening of King Arthur promised a portrayal of the historical Arthur and then manifestly failed to deliver. For the record there is no historical Arthur. There are scattered references in the works of Gildas and Bede to an Arthur or an Aurelius Ambrosianus upon whom the legend of Arthur is based. There is a fairly detailed story of a King Arthur in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History though most of this seems drawn from Welsh and Cornish folktales of the type later collected in the Mabinogion. There is however very hard evidence that there ever was a King Arthur or battles of Baddon Hill and Celidon forest.There was however an invasion and colonization of Britain by the Saxons and other Germanic tribes during the fifth and sixth centuries following the Roman military withdrawal. And it is pretty clear that the native Celtic and RomanoCeltic population put up one hell of a fight slowing but not stopping the Saxon invasions. My own opinion is that there is enough smoke to suggest that the Arthur of medieval romance probably had some kind of historical prototype most legends of this type usually do a Dux Bellorum war leader as named in Gildas possibly this shadowy Aurelius Ambrosianus.So I had high hopes for the movie King Arthur. After all the film had the time period right and the context looked convincing enough. Unfortunately rather than using the historical material and context the filmmakers completely ignored them. There was no consistency to this movie and anyone with even a passing knowledge of the history of the early middle ages the socalled dark ages will be more than irritated by the pretended historicity of the movie. Some examples 1. The film suggests the lateimperial Roman government and policy was directed by the Church through the Papacy. This is absolutely false. Although the Empire was staunchly Christian at this time it was the Emperor and his court  at Constantinople rather than Rome  that set and executed policy. Bishops did not order armies around. In fact the See of Rome at the time was a relatively weak power centre at the time especially compared to the Bishops of Constantinople and Alexandria.2. While it is true that the Romans enlisted soldiers and units from border tribes like the Sarmatians they were never posted at the other end of the empire. This would have made no sense since the whole point of the foederati was to create a buffer between the empire and the northern and eastern barbarians. The Sarmatian soldiers were typically posted in Sarmatia.3. Arthur would never have known Pelagius who though a Briton or Irishman by birth was in Rome from about AD 405. He was condemned by the Church but never actually excommunicated or convicted of heresy and probably died in Rome in AD 420 around the time the historical Arthur was born.4. By the fifth century the Roman occupied part of Britain had been quite thoroughly Romanized. The population was mostly Romanized Britons and NOT an ethnically British population under the boot of a few foreign ethnically Roman aristocrats. While there certainly were nonRomanized Celts like the Wodes about most of the Britain that Arthur would have been fighting to defend would have been populated by Christian Britons who though of themselves as Romans.5. Bishop Germanicus or St. Germain was not a former Roman general. He was a former Gaulish lawyer.6. Hadrian's wall was built not to keep the Britonnic Celts and Saxons out of Roman Britain. It was built to keep the Picts and Hiberni  who were explicitly NOT Briton and in the case of the Picts probably not even Celts  out of Britain. It runsran from Solway Firth to the River Tyne and thus is waaaaaaaaaaaaay too far north to have had much to do with the historical Arthur.7. While the Church in the fifth century was certainly militant read St. Augustine for that the portrayal of churchmen as murderous ascetics who tortured and sacrificed pagans is absolutely ridiculous. In fact by this time most of the population south of Hadrian's Wall had been converted to Christianity.What troubles me is that there is no reason why the filmmakers should have played so fast and loose with history to make this movie. I understand creative license but the way in which they claim historicity on one hand and then create a nonsense fabrication on the other  to no end other than the fact that they just seemed to want to do it that way  makes it very difficult for me to respect King Arthur. I can respect Excalibur at least no one claimed that it was historical.".

I loved the idea that they were just regular guys and in effect drafted into military service. Not the privileged elite who volunteered their services to a king. Yet it is apparent that the Sarmatian knights fought more out of their love and respect for Arthur than any duty to Rome. That comraderie feels very organic and the sentiments pure. I liked that they're not all wearing the same uniform that they might have picked up pieces here and there as spoils of war.I was especially captivated by Mads Mikkelson's Tristan. There appeared to be Eastern influences in his tattoos clothing sword and fighting style. I love the idea of Lancelot using two swords.

	schema:headline " if you claim your movie is based on history...please do some real research beforehand!";
	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion what this movie is trying to do is not to reveal the man behind the myth but to make millions of dollars by exploiting a trend that has become extremely popular lately. King Arthur Alexander Troy The Gladiator what all these movies have in common besides exciting battle scenes of epic proportions is inaccurate historical claims. However some of the movies mentioned above and others within the genre do not make the claim that what they are telling in their movie is history. In the case of this movie it starts by saying that many historians agree on the theories they are about to shows us through this film. The truth is that the historicity of Arthur can not be proved until today and there are many theories out there and the one this movie presents to us is definitely not the most popular in the contrary most historians do not agree with it. So why claim your movie is based on history if its not? And where in hell did they get the idea of Guinevere carrying a bow? Come on! We all know that showing Keira Knightley halfnaked kicking some Saxon ass is pretty hot...but still was there any account of Guinevere being a postfeminist Celtic warriorprincess? I didn't think so. Hey don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say that this is an awful movie but rather that the claims they make in the movie are completely ridiculous. This semester we watched this movie in my history class a King Arthur history class. The reaction from every student was...Wow Hollywood really doesn't know what kind of crap they are showing... Our professor Dr. Christopher Snyder is not only one of the top experts in the field of Medieval British and Celtic studies but the focus of his research is based on the historicity of King Arthur! And to top it off Disney interviewed him and others historians to put them as part of the extra material in the DVD version but decided to replace them with Keira Knightley talking nonsense without knowing what she is saying because the views of these historians did not agree with what the Disney movie was trying to say about the historicity of King Arthur.To finish this long comment let me just say that if you like flicks with a lot of action in them go see Troy or Lord of the Rings. This movie has certain excitement but can't be compared to the blockbusters of its genre and the ridiculous historical claims the film makes just show the immense stupidity and lack of historical knowledge that was used in this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "In my opinion what this movie is trying to do is not to reveal the man behind the myth but to make millions of dollars by exploiting a trend that has become extremely popular lately. King Arthur Alexander Troy The Gladiator what all these movies have in common besides exciting battle scenes of epic proportions is inaccurate historical claims. However some of the movies mentioned above and others within the genre do not make the claim that what they are telling in their movie is history. In the case of this movie it starts by saying that many historians agree on the theories they are about to shows us through this film. The truth is that the historicity of Arthur can not be proved until today and there are many theories out there and the one this movie presents to us is definitely not the most popular in the contrary most historians do not agree with it. So why claim your movie is based on history if its not? And where in hell did they get the idea of Guinevere carrying a bow? Come on! We all know that showing Keira Knightley halfnaked kicking some Saxon ass is pretty hot...but still was there any account of Guinevere being a postfeminist Celtic warriorprincess? I didn't think so. Hey don't get me wrong I'm not trying to say that this is an awful movie but rather that the claims they make in the movie are completely ridiculous.

	schema:reviewBody "Jerry Bruckheimer's KING ARTHUR is a shining example of that new breed of mythology adaption. It is similar to Wolfgang Petersen's TROY in that it dispenses with the supernatural splendour and phantasmagorical intrigue characteristic of traditional tales and presents the story as relatively realistic historical fiction attempting to convey the magic of the story through drama rather than gaudy special effects.This is a brave venture by Bruckheimer  and director Fuqua and they are to be commended for executing it with such style and creativity as is displayed in this film. It has however enjoyed somewhat limited success due to the fact that it presents such a radical interpretation of a story much closer to our hearts than that of the Illiad.I believe though that if the viewer simply opens one's mind and attempts to enjoy the story purely for the sake of itself forgetting for the moment Rosemary Sutcliff and Barbara Leonie Picard KING ARTHUR will reveal itself as a truly fine piece of filmmaking.More than anything else Fuqua masterfully portrays the atmosphere of the tale endowing it with a sense of time and place far more eloquent than the rather runofthemill dialogue. The entire experience oozes the ambiance of the early common era from windswept downs and hills to rugged coasts and snowcloaked mountains from the spartan order of a Roman camp to the hellish confines of a torture chamber. Exemplars of this perfectlypresented atmosphere are Arthur's knightsIoan Gruffud Ray Winstone Joel Edgerton Mads Mikkelsen Hugh Dancy and Ray Stevenson.These are not the chivalrous couth pious Christian knights your mum told you about but rather a troop of barbaric lecherous pagan Sarmatian mercenaries. Together with excellent performances all round particularly by Winstone Gruffud and Edgerton they epitomise the pragmatic godless exquisitely human atmosphere of the period. As Gawaine tells a cowering Roman friar in an early scene  Your God doesn't live here.The lead actors too are outstanding from Stellan Skarsgaard's sociopathic Cerdic to the delicious Keira Knightley's dark and beautiful Guinevere. Only Clive Owen disappoints as Arthur himself lacking the emotion this characterisation requires to supplement his steely resolve.Despite the lukewarm reception to which it was subjected KING ARTHUR is a finely crafted and memorable item of filmmaking. Forget all your preconceptions about King Arthur  just float with it and let the rich atmosphere engulf you. 910.".

	schema:headline " The realism behind the magic";
	schema:reviewBody "In recent movies coming out of Hollywood there seems to be a trend towards attempting to unveil the true character behind some of history's most mysterious individuals. With most of us having been brought up on tales of a medieval King Arthur and the magic of Camelot it was a risk for those who initiated this movie to attempt to expose the man behind the myth so to speak. In my opinion through a combination of realistic battle scenes stunning cinematography and well rounded characters this movie is successful.This tale takes us on a journey with King Arthur's knights as they embark on a final quest for Rome. The issue of religious persecution is raised on numerous occasions in the duration of this movie and relates to contemporary circumstances where religious belief can be used as a form of power and means of superiority. Themes such as this raise the film above the average Bruckheimer production. However the dialogue is still clich in places and midbattle jokes can fall flat on audiences that have grown weary of them in films such as LORD OF THE RINGS and PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Fortunately the battle scenes are realistic and don't bombard us with Jackie Chan like maneuvers that the knights have suddenly and inexplicably learned.The movie is beautifully shot with a variety of landscapes ranging from Hadrian's Wall to icy snowcovered hills and peasant villages. This ensures that the audience always has something new to look at but also paints a realistic picture of the poverty and harsh environment of the time.My only complaint about this film would have to be that some of the acting and characterisation was a little disappointing. Clive Owen's 'Arthur' was a little internalised and predictable. While other characters such as Lancelot Ioan Gruffud are fabulously flawed Arthur is always thinking of others and making the right decisions. His humanity never falters. Owen delivers his lines woodenly and without the passion one wishes to see from such a great warrior and humanitarian. Whilst the writers have dared to put a different spin on the characters of Lancelot and Guinevere Keira Knightly they seem to have stuck with the Arthur of legend. Knightly's performance was certainly nothing special. Her role in the movie was unclear as she seemed to only be there to run around in skimpy outfits although I'm sure the intention was to create a strong female character. I thought her survival in battle was unrealistic as she was much smaller and weaker than the thousands of large trained warriors she was fighting particularly since she had apparently nearly starved to death after being walled up in a tomb for her Pagan beliefs. Although Knightly is beautiful her performances in movies thus far have yet to convince me of her acting abilities.Overall I thought this movie was unique in that it depicted a time not often portrayed in modern cinema. It had strong themes with a good mix of humour romance and action. Although the film had its flaws I would definitely recommend it as I believe it would appeal to a wide audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just seen King Arthur and what a disappointment! I have seen heaps of movies and I am able to stomach a lot having enjoyed mediocre films like Van Helsing for instance. Van Helsing at least was silly but had no pretensions of being anything else King Arthur on the other hand is a little movie very predictable filled with plot clichs that you have seen in countless other motion pictures but has pretensions of being something extraordinary. Well surprise surprise it is not! There is not even enough camp in this movie to grant it a sort of je ne se quois to make it enjoyable. Even the soundtrack is a rip off of Gladiator without even fitting the movie adequately. Hans Zimmer should know better than to copypaste from is own work some of us might notice!Most of the acting is pretty good. I have especially enjoyed Ioan Gruffud as Lancelot and Clive Owen and Arthur both of them make a very good effort given the silly lines they have especially Owen who's lines are extra silly. Most of the actors are competent with the exception of Til Schweiger as Cynric and I felt that such a great actor as Stephen Dillane Merlin was completely wasted and given no chance to show is quality.The direction was pretty bad and uneven. Antoine Fucqua doesn't show the talent he has demonstrated in Training day or even Tears of the Sun the movie is a mess from start to finish. Visually I must admit it looks good. Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is really good and I hope to see some of his work in the future. I have a lot more problems with this movie which I won't detail much further with the exception of two that I cannot overlook. First of all trebuches the catapult thingies were invented by the French during the 100 year old war several centuries later and not by Merlin. In a movie that brags about historical realism and accuracy this strikes as odd. Besides if Merlin had this kind of weapons why not used it against the Romans in the first place? Another gripe and this a big one is the complete absence of gore! Did people in the Dark Ages not have blood? The battle scenes are violent but no blood! What's the point? Again if you want to have a realistic take on this period of history why the absence of realism in the battle scenes? Do the filmmakers think that a PG13 rating will get them more money at the boxoffice? Having seen this mess I seriously doubt it!Summarizing this movie is a complete mess with the exception of some of the performances namely the Knights and most of all Gruffud's and Owen's acting. As for the rest it is dumb predictable not very original in terms of plot and a complete disappointment! Long live Excalibur John Boorman that with it's 23 years it is still the best Kig Arthur story in movie history.".

After a few generations the Angles and Saxons  led by Cerdic of Wessex  came into conflict with the RomanoCelts led by Ambrosius Aurelianus. Artorius Arthur was apparently one of Ambrosius' generals. He fought ten battles against the Germanic tribes culminating in the Battle of Badon sometime between 500 and 510 4050 years AFTER this film's period.NONE of this information came out in this film. I am somewhat familiar with the Sarmatian legend but there is little evidence for it in fact Roman legionaries in Britain came from all over the Empire. As history this film gets an F. As entertainment...? The characters were shallow the acting was amateurish and the dialogue was plodding and trite. As a found comedy it works rather well  I found myself laughing through most of it.

But..this one doesn't. Well it does but it is SO weak. The last battle makes me want to choke. NO sane general would let the enemy breach the walls. Anyway.Yeah the story was weak. So in conclusionOn the positive side LancelotHoratio Hornblower is good eyecandy.  So is Guinevere but if she was a celt why not spell it Gwenhyvar? The battle scenes are relatively OK.

In this case I didn't care that the violence was PG. The acting was adequate although Ray Winstone Bors reminded me more of a British Soccer Hooligan. The film eventually dragged for me and strained my credibility on a number of points.  Firstly I just couldn't see Arthur and his seven or so knights single handedly being asked to traipse around the British landscape like some bad gunslingerConan movie I identified more with Arnold in Conan by the way.  Secondly it made no sense that Arthur kept referring to his cronies as my knights since he never actually became king until the end of the movie.  Who knighted them and how can an indentured soldier of the Roman Empire have the status of knight?  Even a squire has higher status than a slavesoldier.  How pretentious can you get?In the end the movie dragged and I didn't feel the sense of connection Arthur had for his people.  It seemed as if he hardly knew them but was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.  The Excalibur explanation also seemed weak and devoid of the meaning that the legend gave it.  It seemed almost pointless to include it.  I also expected more of Merlin who really didn't say much or earn his sorcerer title. It's unclear other than Merlin's influence why the Britons even bothered to make him king.  I guess it's possible that he organized the final battle but you didn't see that in the movie.  The only ones he seemed to be motivating were his own buddies the handful of knights who for some reason were the only ones who had horses.  In short this film needed more depth and more of a connection between the myth and fact.  Instead the screen writer just used the ambiguity of history to make up his own film based on a smattering of general historical facts.".

Knightly is a talented actress but she wasn't given much to work with. Skarsgard is also an excellent actor but again not much of a part to work with. The dialog is incredibly weak.The movie seemed like a really weak version of Braveheart overall.

It's a shame because the true story of Arthur and his knights is as fascinating as the legend it spawned and better writing and direction really could have done something with it.".

It's a shame because the true story of Arthur and his knights is as fascinating as the legend it spawned and better writing and direction really could have done something with it.";

I got that Arthur and his men had to do one last mission before their retirement but why exactly was this important Roman family living in hostile territory? And who the hell was Guinevere? Where did she come from...why did anyone pay any attention to her? Other than the fact that she loved to dress up in skimpy little dresses and leather bondage outfits in the middle of winter that is.Not to mention that all Arthur's gibbering about 'freedom' screamed twentieth century American idealism...people in the dark ages didn't think that way. And Clive Owen managed to deliver these Braveheart aping lines with about as much enthusiasm as a man having his teeth pulled. I especially loved his prayer scenes.The knights were entertaining and fun to look at to boot. Bors was funny in that bawdy soldierly way and his bickering with Lancelot gave another side to the normally sullen and glowering Ioan Gruffydd. Joel Edgerton was charming as Gawain who has always been my favourite knight and Madds Mickkleson was mysterious and probably the most believable Samarian of them all. The head Saxon was wonderful too Skellan Skarsgard was obviously having a ball hovering around in his black outfit and whispering lines like 'burn everything...kill everyone.' Whether he was supposed to be funny or not he made me laugh.Essentially the names were the same but other than that the movie had little in common with the Arthur legends. Though I have always like the idea of setting Arthur in the dark ages where the origins of the story most likely spring from this particular movie came off like a bad cross between Gladiator and Braveheart. Clive Owen had no charisma whatsoever though unlike good old Mel Gibson so all Merlin's spouting about people needing a 'leader' to help them fight the invading Saxons who never actually formally invaded Britain came off as out of tune. Arthur's disillusion about the Roman empire was awkward and didn't really seem to fit the story and his relationship with Guinevere was so mechanical the audience actually groaned when she said who she was. Essentially my complaints about the movie though many really just boil down to the fact that it was a bad movie.

	schema:headline " Kitsch 80's film that never ceases to charm me!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film about five times now and I never cease to be delighted by its charms.Where do I start? Firstly Jon Cryer is truly excellent as the precocious adolescent amateur photographer who spouts sophisticated adult dialogue but is really naive on the romantic front. The way he blushes at the right moment is very credible. He plays the blushing virgin with gusto  we don't doubt for a moment that he's never had sex or kissed a girl.Firstly I must admit here to being a major fan of Demi Moore's films in the 80's. I've seen all of them from that period and I adore the characters she plays  Moore is what I call 'value added'. Whatever role she plays she brings something special whether it is a brilliant range in temperament downcast eyes the husky voice the tearful eyes the shiny hair. Most Hollywood actresses can't manage this but Demi manages to be the girl next door and screen siren all in one.Anyway she plays this aspiring niteclub singer with bad taste in 80's clothes and even worse taste in music. To her credit she doesn't sing any of the songs as they were recorded by other people so she just lip syncs along quite nicely. That song 'Hotheaded' is actually quite catchy in that Michael Bolton Bar 'rawk' sort of way. Overall her character Laura Victor comes over as a really likable human being. And the final scene at the airport is truly touching. Moore's says two simple words 'thank you' and we know she means it.Another to reason to love this film is that it was filmed entirely on location in San Francisco and studio interiors are very few and far in between. Most of the shots are on real locations which adds to the movie's overall charm. This combined with the corny dialogue that scene where she barges into the High School language laboratory dressed in a coctail waitress read hooker! outfit in very high heels and pulls Cryer out of the language lab is really funny  especially when she says F Off ez Vous to the French teacher.Some of the scenes are chauvinistic including the one with frat boys and the hired hooker  which really doesn't have any relevance to the overall plot. And I agree with a previous poster who says that Cryer's on screen mother is one of the most irritating characters to appear in movies. That line about the sausage of Cryer's brother going cold is truly risible. When I watch this film I try very hard to ignore the flaws!This is corny cheesy and highly entertaining. It really captures the spirit of the 80's. I'll never stop watching it  I love it.Bonus watch out for Jennifer Tilly and Tim Robbins in bit parts playing Cryer's classmates. Robbins was 28 when he played this role. Teenage high school student he ain't! But it's still good to see him in this. Also the very catchy song 'Eiffel Tower' by Malcolm McClaren and the McClarenettes.Moore wears some wacky clothes and has that 80's penchant for long evening gloves with hundreds of bangles very Material Girl! I love that cabin on the boardwalk apartment she lives in while working at Jakes's as a singer. Very bohemian very cool very 1984!".

	onyx:emotionText "I've seen this film about five times now and I never cease to be delighted by its charms.Where do I start? Firstly Jon Cryer is truly excellent as the precocious adolescent amateur photographer who spouts sophisticated adult dialogue but is really naive on the romantic front. The way he blushes at the right moment is very credible. He plays the blushing virgin with gusto  we don't doubt for a moment that he's never had sex or kissed a girl.Firstly I must admit here to being a major fan of Demi Moore's films in the 80's. I've seen all of them from that period and I adore the characters she plays  Moore is what I call 'value added'. Whatever role she plays she brings something special whether it is a brilliant range in temperament downcast eyes the husky voice the tearful eyes the shiny hair.

Charles spends all his money for his Milan trip to advertise Laura on 150 taxis but it's so vague that people assume she's an escort or it's a phone sex line.This is Jon Cryer's movie debut. He delivers a great puppy love very much in the vein of Duckie. Demi Moore has her star quality in a struggling artist character. The story is a meandering teen romcom. Maybe it's the presence of Duckie but this does have a faded sense of a John Hughes movie. It's not quite at a high level but the two leads are magnetic and compelling.

Cryer pines for her while trying to help her achieve career stardom through the use of his camera and photographic skilland the 6 grand he's had saved up for a trip. There's an amazing cast in supporting parts like Cheers' George Wendt as the club owner Moore frequently sings Peter Frechette as Cryer's supportive big brother Elizabeth Daily Pee Wee's Big Adventure  Valley Girl as Frechette's fianc Jeffrey Tambor yes of The Larry Sanders Show as Uncle Ken married to Cryer's mom played by Ann Wedgeworth Tim Robbins get a load of him as a sexobsessed high schooler so tall he towers over the rest of his classmates! he is one of those dimbulb goofs you cackle at and a barely recognizable Jennifer Tilly as a fellow classmate of Cryer's who could be a future love interest of his. Demi's rocking out obviously not her singing and Cryer's discomfort with matters relating to sex like his hooker incident with the stag party prostitute are moments certain to either make you cringe and giggle or both. There's good use of San Francisco throughout as a backdrop for Cryer's attempts at wooing Moore but this was still a few years before he really perfected his selfdeprecating persona so memorable on the show Two and a Half Men. He was still about two years away from the delightful scenestealing part as Ducky on Pretty in Pink and the criticallymaligned but not as bad as they insist to me anyway Morgan Stewart's Coming Home an HBO comedy I remember quite popular among my pals back in the day and these films would express his gifts at comedy and endearing charm despite the loser stigma that seems to define most of his characters. The statutory illegal relationship between Moore and Cryer's characters especially the ending when she takes his virginity might give cause to squirm but it identifies the pentup yearnings held by teenage boys for slightly older girls. Moore has a hard time with performing aching and frustration and Cryer just seems rather uncomfortable and a bit nervy for some reason it all entertained me regardless. His sacrifices might be considered worth it after rolling under the sheets with babe Moore I had a nice chuckle at the use of Moore's image which enrages her Cryer meaning well on taxicabs to get her noticed as an attempt to advertise her misconstrued as invites for sexual favors a phone call underneath a provocative pose. Surprisingly this bit of fluff for the teenageyoung adult crowd was directed by Jerry Schatzberg Panic in Needle Park  Scarecrow both starring a young Al Pacino. Despite being rated R the only real reason No Small Affair might be seen as too adult for the intended crowd is some nudity tits and mature themes handled with a bit of care such as Moore's admission at offering herself to Wendt to keep her singing gig and Cryer unable to seal the deal with the hooker he later just wants to hug!.".

	schema:reviewBody "About halfway through No Small Affair there's a scene where Laura the singer played by Demi Moore belts out a knockout rendition of the MadeiraDorsey standard I'm Glad There Is You. It's a jazzy paean to romance. Watching the movie again recently I was jolted when Laura sang the line about underrated treasures because it's a capsule description of the film itself. No Small Affair unheralded in its day and rarely revived since is itself a treasure a gem among the gravel of cynical 1980s films.It's a comingofage tale chronicling the conversion of Charles Cummings Jon Cryer from gawky teenager to confident young adult. Nothing new there except that director Jerry Schatzberg and screenwriters Charles Bolt and Terence Mulcahy have fashioned a charming film that sings with a bittersweet passion about Cummings' wrenching transformation. His catalyst is Laura the 23yearold saloon singer played by Demi Moore. With her youthful yet worldly manner and her scratchy violin voice playing its siren song on Cummings' sensibilities the lad is a goner. What ensues is a funny and endearing riteofpassage story with brilliantly clever complications.Cummings  he prefers not to be called Charles  is a 16yearold amateur photographer who likes to shoot pictures of colorful San Francisco locales. One day when Laura and a friend wander into camera range Cummings waves them off but not before he's snapped a few shots of Laura's beautiful face. Seeing that face later in his proof sheets Cummings is hooked.Infatuated beyond reason Cummings searches for his new beloved. He begins by staking out the dock where he first saw her. After several hours of fruitless waiting he sulks Someone said if you stand in one spot long enough the whole world will pass by. I don't know who said that but he's an idiot.Fortune finally smiles on Cummings on a night out with his big brother Leonard Peter Frechette and Leonard's fiance Susan Elizabeth Daily. Armed with a fake ID Charles joins the pair at a downtown nitery and there on the tiny stage the object of his affections warbles into a hand mike barely audible above the blare of a heavy metal band. But the next morning Cummings' exhilaration at finding Laura is tempered by the news that her band is breaking up and the lady may wind up out of a job.Worlds above Cummings in sophistication Laura nevertheless turns to her new friend for comfort when her career goes sour. One afternoon she accedes to his request to pose for his camera and we can feel their deepening friendship as the hours pass by and Cummings shoots roll after roll of film happily taking pictures of this glowing Circe in front of some of San Francisco's most picturesque landmarks. Night falls and the pair are tired hungry and broke. So they decide to crash a wedding reception and help themselves to food and drink. When they are caught by the father of the bride Hamilton Camp and threatened with arrest Cummings makes a deal with the irascible paterfamilias Let Laura sing for their supper. She does so... and to everyone's surprise including Laura's her rendition of a classic ballad the above mentioned I'm Glad There is You is a big hit. Who knew this grunge diva could sing pop?This revelation inspires Cummings to take drastic action. Rounding up his life's savings he pays to have Laura's likeness and telephone number posted on taxicabs all over the city. He's hoping the publicity will attract attention to Laura's talents but at first it seems only to attract heavybreathing weirdos. Exasperated Laura pulls her phone out of the wall. But a newswire service picks up the story about the young fan and his generous gesture and prints it and soon the phones are ringing off the wall at Laura's old place of business. The bar owner Jake George Wendt pleads with Laura to return and sing at his establishment. She agrees but she is still furious with Cummings.Laura's debut in front of a packed house that includes record company talent agents is a success. She is offered a recording contract and the possibility of stardom beckons. But now in a neat reversal of the first half of the film the hunted becomes the hunter as she tries frantically to locate Cummings and thank him.What makes No Small Affair so winning is the delicious array of comedy performers director Schatzberg has united for his film. Jon Cryer making his first film at age 19 has all the right moves whether making sheep's eyes at his costar or doing a nifty moonwalk upon receiving a bit of good news. Demi Moore in her first starring role makes Laura tendertough a savvy woman who combines a strong sense of independence with a most touching vulnerability. In one climactic scene Laura wraps her arms around her young benefactor and says When I grow up I want to be just like you. It wouldn't be the last time Demi Moore enchanted a younger man.Among the supporting players none resonates more delightfully than Judy Baldwin as Stephanie the elegant call girl Cummings meets at his brother's bachelor party. Baldwin's bit is little more than a cameo but her luminous and hilarious scene with Cryer will be remembered long after most of the other performances are forgotten.Dan Navarro daneldorado93yahoo.com".

She does so... and to everyone's surprise including Laura's her rendition of a classic ballad the above mentioned I'm Glad There is You is a big hit. Who knew this grunge diva could sing pop?This revelation inspires Cummings to take drastic action. Rounding up his life's savings he pays to have Laura's likeness and telephone number posted on taxicabs all over the city. He's hoping the publicity will attract attention to Laura's talents but at first it seems only to attract heavybreathing weirdos. Exasperated Laura pulls her phone out of the wall. But a newswire service picks up the story about the young fan and his generous gesture and prints it and soon the phones are ringing off the wall at Laura's old place of business. The bar owner Jake George Wendt pleads with Laura to return and sing at his establishment. She agrees but she is still furious with Cummings.Laura's debut in front of a packed house that includes record company talent agents is a success. She is offered a recording contract and the possibility of stardom beckons. But now in a neat reversal of the first half of the film the hunted becomes the hunter as she tries frantically to locate Cummings and thank him.What makes No Small Affair so winning is the delicious array of comedy performers director Schatzberg has united for his film. Jon Cryer making his first film at age 19 has all the right moves whether making sheep's eyes at his costar or doing a nifty moonwalk upon receiving a bit of good news. Demi Moore in her first starring role makes Laura tendertough a savvy woman who combines a strong sense of independence with a most touching vulnerability. In one climactic scene Laura wraps her arms around her young benefactor and says When I grow up I want to be just like you. It wouldn't be the last time Demi Moore enchanted a younger man.Among the supporting players none resonates more delightfully than Judy Baldwin as Stephanie the elegant call girl Cummings meets at his brother's bachelor party. Baldwin's bit is little more than a cameo but her luminous and hilarious scene with Cryer will be remembered long after most of the other performances are forgotten.Dan Navarro daneldorado93yahoo.com";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie to insanely love.The story is about the first love. This naive and dreamy moment in the life of almost everyone of us. However while choosing not the happy end the movie doesn't go to make it a massacre of a romance or a sad love story it showcases an unsuccessful first love that maybe we wanted for ourselves.The treatment gave us the boyish sentimental talented photographer idiot his victory as a nerdy nerd who kisses the ultimately sexy chick in fact it's the other way around right in front of his bully bulls helping this onesided love to success in her career then winning her somehow eventually at least as a friend having the hottest innocent separation ever portrayed on screen WITH a smart reference to his next maybe real love affair. Can the hardy first love be more lovely ? It's the most successful unsuccessful love story you'll ever see !Jon Cryer is utterly believable and most of all funny. With good script he captured the essence of his character making it a fresh lead more than another stereotype that might hint about the movie's makers as maybe old geeks who showed themselves as distinct human beings more than a Hollywood easy laughingstock. This characterization had to be a big reason why the movie is respectable for every geek out there assuring the solid romantic side in them with much verity and love. For opposite instance in later movie Napoleon Dynamite the character is exploited horribly just for the sake of some cheap laughs! Back then Demi Moore was SEXY SEXY SEXY I can go forever !. And the irony between herself and her costar age charisma way of talking.. was one of a kind. Thank god that they didn't cast Sally Field as it was first intended the sexual thing would have been totally missed and the matter shrunken into a motherson relationship. Enough to recall moments that have her  cursing the French teacher in EnglishFrench way running in the street half naked with only a long coat searching for that boy who put her on all the city's cabs and undoubtedly the one when she wakes up to answer the telephone with only blue shirt AND bare legs this moment is one of the most unforgettable moments in the history of cinema and those legs represent a part of the best things I saw in my life !The Jazzy songs worked brilliantly. I have them on tape they're priceless. The My Funny Valentine performance can't be more perfect. Truly aside from being as husky as Demi's Chrissy Faith's voice is wow. Add to that factors like the wedding's crises Jeffrey Tambor's delivering line like she took my pen! the catchy cinematography I believe the good parts are simply the whole movie it has a sweet spirit all over it. This is the favorite story of every adolescent with desperate oneside amour a dream of a doomed first love and it has inspiring core too as if the dilemma of that first  from oneside love is just a fair preparation for the real love after therefore it's wholly no small affair. You have to admire this theory where being disappointed in love isn't disappointing at all and the unfinished love already finishes with a next yet complete one. This is extremely optimistic. Rare to watch a movie of this sort nowadays. The 1980s were dreamy enough to comprise these delicate stories.So with wonderful story acting singing kisses and legsI find no bad thing to say. God even Jennifer Tilly's performance was great !".

It isn't quite as entertaining as 'Lifeforce' the original naked space chick movie but it's a still pretty good way to waste an hour and a half of your life. Why it gets slammed so much is beyond me. Maybe people just don't have a sense of humour. The opening of the movie is terrific. In a lab we see a cold scientist Ben Kingsley overseeing the murder of a young girl Michelle Williams imprisoned in a glass case. Only she escapes by showing some super human strength. She is immediately pursued by dozens of soldiers but manages to elude them. We then learn she is in fact a genetic experiment a mixing of extraterrestrial and human DNA. Kingsley heads up a task force consisting of Michael Madsen Alfred Molina Marg Helgenberger and Forest Whitaker each a specialist in a different field. Pretty soon our alien fugitive mutates into a gorgeous blonde Natasha Henstridge who spends most of her time topless. Kingsley and company face a race against time they must capture the horny alien girl before she screws guys to death? or something... Who knows. Henstridge is great to look at and the above average cast give it their best shot with the lame dialogue and cliched scenes. Whitaker's empath character quickly irritates with his constant stating the bleedin' obvious but I always get a kick out of watching Madsen here in stereotypical tough guy mode.

	schema:headline " Sexy Bmovie thriller great fun!";
	schema:reviewBody "Species is like a meeting between an amateur low budget film and a big budget horror movie. On the one hand the film has a great cast and is professionally produced but on the other  the special effects wouldn't have looked out of place in an eighties film and the plot concentrates mostly on its sleazy and often silly byproducts. That being said however the movie is lots of fun and overall I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the best horror films of the nineties. The film takes obvious influence from a range of similar films such as Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce and Jack Sholder's 'The Hidden' but it brings all of it's elements together well and somehow manages to feel fresh and inventive. The plot is pure hokum but it works well as alienhuman crossover 'Sil' escapes from a testing lab with a team of professionals comprising a psychic an action hero a woman etc on her tail. Sil's ultimate goal is to reproduce and to complete that aim she must find a man. So basically what we have here is a sexy horny naked chick being chased around before she can have sex with someone. Sounds good to me...I'm not quite sure how director Roger Donaldson managed it but he's managed to get quite a few names to appear in his film and most of them do well with their roles. Despite the fact that she probably isn't really Natasha Henstridge looks clean and pure in the lead role and this both ensures that she looks the part and the film is great in that it carries off the juxtaposition of having a sweetlooking virginal woman act like a prostitute. Ben Kingsley is the biggest cast surprise as the former Ghandi actor looks slightly out of place in a Bmovie like this. Michael Madsen is absolutely great in his typecast action hero role and the cast is completed by a memorable performance from Alfred Molina and a rather annoying one from Forest Whitaker. Marg Helgenberger fails to make much of an impression as Madsen's love interest. The two plots that run concurrently are played out well and climax nicely. The special effects are key in a film like this and even though they're cheap throughout  they do look fairly realistic. It's not until we get to the end and the director decides to spoil it with some abysmal CGI that the effects become a problem. But even so Species takes its plot well and isn't too serious and I've got to rate this as a really fun flick overall.".

	onyx:emotionText "Species is like a meeting between an amateur low budget film and a big budget horror movie. On the one hand the film has a great cast and is professionally produced but on the other  the special effects wouldn't have looked out of place in an eighties film and the plot concentrates mostly on its sleazy and often silly byproducts. That being said however the movie is lots of fun and overall I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the best horror films of the nineties. The film takes obvious influence from a range of similar films such as Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce and Jack Sholder's 'The Hidden' but it brings all of it's elements together well and somehow manages to feel fresh and inventive. The plot is pure hokum but it works well as alienhuman crossover 'Sil' escapes from a testing lab with a team of professionals comprising a psychic an action hero a woman etc on her tail. Sil's ultimate goal is to reproduce and to complete that aim she must find a man. So basically what we have here is a sexy horny naked chick being chased around before she can have sex with someone. Sounds good to me...I'm not quite sure how director Roger Donaldson managed it but he's managed to get quite a few names to appear in his film and most of them do well with their roles. Despite the fact that she probably isn't really Natasha Henstridge looks clean and pure in the lead role and this both ensures that she looks the part and the film is great in that it carries off the juxtaposition of having a sweetlooking virginal woman act like a prostitute.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason I've always loved watching Species even though I very well realize that it isn't a particularly good movie. Still due to its approach and handling of a really unoriginal concept and story the movie can be regarded as one of the best sciencefiction movies from the '90's.If you need to compare this movie to something you can easily compare it to any of the Alienmovies. Of course over the years Alien and its sequel Aliens have been rippedoff countless times and filmmakers often tried to cash in by making basically Alien and Aliens clones using the same concept settings characters locations complete sequences and whatever more that it was that made these two sciencefiction movies such an highly acclaimed success. Yes in my opinion Species can definitely be seen as an Alien clone but out of all the movies that ever tried to rip off the Alien movies in any way possible this is easily the best movie that at times even makes you forget how unoriginal it actually truly is.Also no big wonder that the movie should remind you of Alien at times also since the alien in this movie got designed by the same man who designed the original alien for Alien and all of its sequels. So perhaps this is also part of the reason why you so easily can forgive this movie from ripping off Alien in parts.It's a surprising movie from Roger Donaldson who had never done any sciencefiction or horror before and he also hasn't done any ever since. Donaldson is these days mostly known for directing more serious movies.It's perhaps its horror that also makes this movie work out so well. The movie is not just a sciencefiction movie about an alien on the loose but truly knows to create a dark moody atmosphere as well and puts in a couple of true great and effective horror moments which makes the movie tense and in a way also unpredictable to watch also since the movie is not too afraid to kill off its main characters.There is also some gore in the movie that is good looking with its often graphic killings. Also the makeup effects are great and the movie uses some early special effects that especially for 1995 standards seem like pretty good ones even though the movie itself somewhat feels and looks like a low budget production.The movie makes a choice not to only follow the team that is called in to hunt down the alien but also shows things from the perspective of the alien herself. She's constantly learning things which she uses to adapt and blend in and to eventually get what she wants. This approach gives Species a nice extra dimension. It's like The Day the Earth Stood Still only with a not so friendly alien. The movie also has an amazing cast with actors such as Ben Kingsley Michael Madsen Alfred Molina Forest Whitaker and Michelle Williams involved. Whenever I hear the name or a thinking of Ben Kingsley I'm not thinking about Schindler's List or Ghandi but I'm thinking about Species. I don't now I just find it to be a very amusing role by him despite the fact that he plays his character totally death serious.I love this movie!810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

This gives birth to Sil a girl Michele Williams who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blond obsessed with mating Natasha Henstridge. Government agent Xavier Fitch Ben Kingsley assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary Michael Madsen an anthropologist Alfred Molina a molecular biologist Marg Helgenberger and an empath Forest Whitaker.I saw Species years ago and for some reason developed an eyerolling attitude toward it maybe it was due to Roger Ebert's negative review I don't know. In any case I'm glad I gave it a fresh viewing because this is a topoftheline scifiadventurehorror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a goodlookin' woman she doesn't do anything for me I prefer shorter rounder women so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.For one the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly the Alist cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshedout in the story. Lastly while people understandably writeoff the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production there's more here than meets the eye. For instance Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA more on this below. Another example is the excellent character of Dan Whitaker whom whiners complain about as always pointing out the obvious when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring deadend after another.While snobby film critics love to hate Species it's a thoroughly entertaining scifi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like Alien Aliens Terminator Terminator 2 and Predator you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as Aliens Terminator and Terminator 2 but it's on par with Alien and marginally better IMHO and superior to Predator. Then again it depends on what you want in a scifi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned Species delivers the goods.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City Utah.GRADE A SPOILER ALERT Don't read further unless you've seen the movie The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon a weed killer from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or more accurately the human race that inhabits it. It's a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it.".

I really like the idea that she's interstellar weed to kill off humanity. It's Alien in a pretty package. Alien is one of my favorite movie and I certainly don't mind the pretty package. Natasha Henstridge is a little more than simply pretty. She shows both wideeyed innocence and a bit of murderous spark. The empath is ridiculous but I still like the hunt and the thrills.";

I'd always drown before I could find the biosuit. Why this was never made into an adults oriented video game is beyond me other than the obvious problem with marketing it to teenagers.The whole SPECIES franchise was meant to cash in on the success of the ALIEN films obviously and go straight for the amniotic fluid in the reproductive cycle at the expense of logic probability and science. It's probably a better movie than it had to be and I'm sure that multiple viewings will bring out more nuances though that's probably not the idea they had in mind when making it. Once will suffice for most viewers.I enjoyed seeing Natasha Henstridge naked however and the H.R. Giger creature designs are fabulous as always. In fact I wondered is the whole film really a contrivance just to get to see Giger's aliens mating with humans? Why yes it probably is. And for some people that's enough to warrant watching it regardless of whom the lead body actress is. Giger's designs were sexually suggestive to begin with and with this movie he finally got to see them doing the nasty. I trust he was well paid.In any event it's a wildly popular film for reasons that have nothing to do with the professionalism of the cast  crew. Which by the way someone should have told them before prodding us with their serious emotive performances that serve as buffer zones between the sex  ooze scenes. Only Michael Madsen seems to be aware that it was essentially an exploitation film and acts accordingly. He's spoken of his pride in the work and it shows especially when considering that he turned up for SPECIES 2 with it's bonus deathmatch levels and Capture The Flag mod.610".

	schema:reviewBody "Species follows a team of scientists and killers in their attempt to capture a homegrown alien.  Most of the time the alien called Sil looks identical to a regular human woman well okay a regular supermodel making her a difficult target to locate.  The team is concerned that Sil is out to breed and they're main goal is to stop her before she does.One of the members of the team Dan Forest Whitaker is an empath who feels things deeply.  He provides intuitive commentary on what Sil is up to and why.  His presence creates the impression that there is more to this alien than breeding and destroying humans and that there is more to this movie than finding the alien and blowing her away.  But as we find out when the credits start rolling the alien really has been only interested in breeding and destroying humans and the movie was really only about finding the alien and blowing her away.  A movie doesn't have to be about more than that but it shouldn't pretend to be something it's not.I guess the biggest conceit of this movie is that someone who looks like Natasha Henstridge could wander around L.A. for a week without finding someone to have sex with.  She eventually hooks up with one of the team members Alfred Molina pushing credulity even further so the team has been looking for a beautiful woman who supposedly acts like a nymphomaniac because she needs to breed and some stranger shows up in my hotel room and starts removing her clothing.  Am I the only one who hears alarms going off at this point?Species also contains what must be the granddaddy of all science fiction cliches the overnight transformation of a child alien into an adult alien. This trait is so advantageous especially to the plots of poorlywritten science fiction movies you wonder why humans didn't develop it eons ago.".

Most of the time the alien called Sil looks identical to a regular human woman well okay a regular supermodel making her a difficult target to locate.  The team is concerned that Sil is out to breed and they're main goal is to stop her before she does.One of the members of the team Dan Forest Whitaker is an empath who feels things deeply.  He provides intuitive commentary on what Sil is up to and why.  His presence creates the impression that there is more to this alien than breeding and destroying humans and that there is more to this movie than finding the alien and blowing her away.  But as we find out when the credits start rolling the alien really has been only interested in breeding and destroying humans and the movie was really only about finding the alien and blowing her away.  A movie doesn't have to be about more than that but it shouldn't pretend to be something it's not.I guess the biggest conceit of this movie is that someone who looks like Natasha Henstridge could wander around L.A. for a week without finding someone to have sex with.  She eventually hooks up with one of the team members Alfred Molina pushing credulity even further so the team has been looking for a beautiful woman who supposedly acts like a nymphomaniac because she needs to breed and some stranger shows up in my hotel room and starts removing her clothing.  Am I the only one who hears alarms going off at this point?Species also contains what must be the granddaddy of all science fiction cliches the overnight transformation of a child alien into an adult alien. This trait is so advantageous especially to the plots of poorlywritten science fiction movies you wonder why humans didn't develop it eons ago.";

Scientist have created a new form of life based on some strange signals received from outer space. Though at the beginning of movie they are trying to kill this life as I do believe they have figured out that his new life is a threat to the human race. They get a group of scientist a psychic and a guy who takes care of things a great character played very well by Michael Madsen. He really added something to this movie and I really enjoyed his character. Natasha also is very good in this movie as the very sexy and sultry alien who is out to find herself a mate. The story is somewhat cheesy but it is still fun thanks to the good actors in this movie who include besides Madsen and Natasha Forest Whitaker Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina. The alien is a bit different too as it is not a seemingly bad creature only doing what her instincts direct her to do. She is not a kill first creature though bad things will happen if she is allowed to mate and bring about more of her species. There are also some very memorable scenes in this one the most memorable being the one involving the guy with asthma and that wonderful kiss he shares with Natasha. A lot better movie to me than a lot of horror movies here that get a lot higher scores than they deserve I think this one deserves higher but I would never want to watch the sequels as they did not look good at all from the previews I saw.".

THE SEVEN MINUTES was a box office flop and ruined any chances Meyer may have had to continue with Fox. But I actually found myself liking this movie and while it's not as fantastic as his comedies or action flicks MINUTES is still unique in its own way.The Seven Minutes is a book that has been charged with obscenity and is blamed for leading a young boy to rape a girl. The film revolves around the court case against the book. That's pretty much it. Regular Meyer fans will be disappointed in this film no doubt. While it does feature Edy Williams Charles Napier Stuart Lancaster a young Tom Selleck the actor who plays Martin Bormann and the black boxer from BVD these cast members appear in what amount to cameos and disappear very quickly. Yvonne de Carlo is great as an oldtime Hollywood actress though. The major problem with the film is that it is a serious film not a slapstick comedy a real turning point for Meyer. I wonder if he even wanted to make this film as it is such a departure from his regular content.THE SEVEN MINUTES is not filled with busty beauties or excellent music or outrageous situations but features lots of Meyer's trademark lightningquick editing and enough twists and turns in the plot to get the viewer involved in the story. The surprise ending is totally out of left field. Still I would only recommend THE SEVEN MINUTES to diehard Meyer fans and even then very carefully. The film is very hard to find but I was able to rent it from Video Vault in Alexandria VA. Even Meyer doesn't offer it on his Bosomania label! So if you spend lots of time searching for it expecting another BVD or SUPERVIXENS you will be disappointed when you finally see it. Worth one viewing.".

Obviously one begat the other but the cycle never repeated. Still a case can be made for FOX assigning this movie to Meyer given his experience with censorship from his earlier forays into soft porn which always ran the gamut between guilty pleasure and goodhumored raunch of dubious taste. Whatever your opinion of his sensibilities Meyer always knew what his public wanted and he supplied it in copious quantity.

While Meyer is intellectually up to the task and halfway accomplishes the tough goal of laying out the controversies convincingly he's not up to resolving things in a credible manner. The first half is a bit amateurish and thin but it is the second half where the bottom really falls out. In particular Meyer tries to cram so many twists into the wacky denouement that any commentary he has previously made is lost. Perhaps all of this is satire of the politicization he is documenting but if so it's too uneven. Worse it's not entertaining. In one movie Meyer singlehandedly alienated serious moviegoers who stayed away merely based on his name. At the same time he turned off his core audience who could not have possibly been prepared for the utterly nonRuss Meyer product he delivered in THE SEVEN MINUTES. The trademark titillation violence and bawdiness of his entire prior filmography is absent replaced by sensationalized but strangely static courtroom dialogue. Meyer was never quite the same afterward and subsequently only made three or four more movies in the next 33 years after having made 18 in the preceding 11.Still if you like to see the Seventies at its most excessive and overly indulgent this is a precious cautionary time capsule showing how someone successful in one area could not harness his skills in another. It's so breathtakingly inyourface bad that you might find it amusing. 1.5  10".

At the same time he turned off his core audience who could not have possibly been prepared for the utterly nonRuss Meyer product he delivered in THE SEVEN MINUTES. The trademark titillation violence and bawdiness of his entire prior filmography is absent replaced by sensationalized but strangely static courtroom dialogue. Meyer was never quite the same afterward and subsequently only made three or four more movies in the next 33 years after having made 18 in the preceding 11.Still if you like to see the Seventies at its most excessive and overly indulgent this is a precious cautionary time capsule showing how someone successful in one area could not harness his skills in another. It's so breathtakingly inyourface bad that you might find it amusing. 1.5  10";

Well sort of...Irving Wallace's novel is a terrific suspenseful read and Meyer does a good job bringing the story to the screen completely replacing the surprise ending of the novel with one of his own.  As you can probably imagine Meyer can't really play anything straight so this film is full of Meyer's bright colors and eyepopping um camera work.  The man is a brilliant cinematographer and this film looks just as good as any of his others that I've seen.  Odd camera angles fast cuts bad acting Edy Williams and gratuitous cleavage shots are all here and well worth a look.Beware of the old television print of this film for sale in some US video outlets.  The hack job done by the censors just ruins the film.  Fox has a gorgeous print of the film around as it has been shown on the FX channel in the past open matte unlike BVOD this one wasn't shot in Panavision fully uncut and looking brand new.  Write the folks at Fox and demand a proper video release!".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this film on Bravo. While I admit to being a bit of a Russ Meyer fan in the same way many people slow down to look at train wrecks I actually found this movie surprisingly entertaining. Russ Meyer is the master of campy dialogue bizarre twists and nonsensical plots and of course larger pun intended than life characters. This movie has them all but at a much more subdued level than most of his other films. In many ways this film works ... much better at least than other Russ Meyer films.If you are looking for a quality film delving into the drama of the courtroom forget it here. With even a modicum of legal savvy it is easy to see all the holes in the courtroom antics of both sides. The twist at the end might be typical Russ Meyer but it was also pretty predictable. Normally I dislike predictability in a movie but Russ Meyer flicks are usually such mixed up twisted messes that seeing a plot actually come to fruition with a credible twist that fits into the rest of the story was a bit of a treat.I echo the sentiments of other users when they say that this is not a Russ Meyer fan's movie. Unfortunately the only people who likely will ever see this film are the serious Russ Meyer fans who want to see everything the man has made. Said fans can look for the cameo of Russ as well in true Hitchcockian style smile. I felt this was a good film easy to watch fun and sexy at times with a few valuable yet no doubt satirical comments about the hypocrisy of the day. Being that Russ had his own personal problems with censorship the movie is an obvious pokeinthenose at all the holierthanthou types out to save society while wallowing in their own debauchery.My Rating 7  10 Unless you are looking for a Russ Meyer genre film then only 2  10".

	schema:reviewBody "The Seven Minutes was Russ Meyer's follow up to his big studio debut Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. That one made a lot of money for 20th Century Fox but also caused it a fair bit of embarrassment and flack due to its salacious content and X rating. The Seven Minutes was the second film in his two picture deal and it went down a much less controversial route. It takes the form of a courtroom drama and perhaps unsurprisingly unlike its predecessor it bombed at the box office. But as is the way despite the unfamiliar subject matter it's still pretty obvious as a Meyer movie and is ultimately quite a strange film.On the face of it The Seven Minutes is a serious drama but Meyer seems incapable of playing it straight. His distinctive camerawork and superfast editing are still in abundance. While he still makes space for a bevy of buxom women who appear throughout such as Shawn 'Baby Doll' Deveraux. In truth Meyer had no interest adapting the Irving Wallace novel that the film is based on but the studio insisted. In the end he figured the subject of freedom of speech and censorship was something he knew about from past experience and could make something interesting with it. But Fox felt battered by the publicity that they had attracted with Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and the similarly X rated Myra Breckinridge so they made it clear that The Seven Minutes must make an R rating. Consequently it is easily the most restrained outing he ever released.The story boils down to a court case about a book called 'The Seven Minutes' which is considered obscene so much so that it is accused of inspiring a vicious rape. The title refers to the average time that a woman takes to achieve orgasm. To be honest going into this film I didn't have very high expectations. Its reputation sort of goes before it and the very idea of Meyer directing a film not based around buxom women set off alarm bells seeing as they always seemed so integral to the success of everything else he did. As it turned out I was very pleasantly surprised with this flick. Despite being a courtroom drama it still retains enough Meyer madness to ensure it's fascinating. In truth his fast editing style is wholly inappropriate for such a film the twists and turns of the plot end up coming at us so fast that it's very hard keeping up with plot developments while the appearances of the pneumatic women that punctuate the movie are completely incongruous for a film trying to make a serious point! But ultimately its aspects like these that makes it more interesting at the end of the day. The extreme melodramatic tendencies and bizarre tone and presentation are what mark it out. Make no mistake it's not up there with Meyer's best movies but who in all seriousness would expect it to be? It's his least typical film though that's for sure and its one I am pleased to have finally seen. It's notable too for featuring a young Tom Selleck as well as a cameo from veteran actor John Carradine it also features Meyer regulars Charles Napier Stuart Lancaster and his then wife Edy Williams.".

Expect lots of visual humour but also the odd moment of funny dialogue the making love dialogue scene is quite hilariousThe plot is standard Bond fare A French tycoon is up to no good stealing crown jewels and trying to become king of.... England oddly enough. There is a Bond girl played by Natalie Imbruglia and sharing more similarities with Sophie Yeoh's buttkicking bond girl than with the more traditional damsel in distress. But unfortunately there is no equivalent to Q nor to M and the movie is a bit too much of a oneman show.How does it fare then? On the laughter front it was quite satisfying easily outmanoeuvering the oncetoooften repeated Austin Powers putting anything recent by Leslie Nielsen to shame and being an altogether fine Bond spoof. There is lots of slapstick including the disgusting kind but the movie manages to be less over the top and closer to Bond than to old National Lampoon  Mel Brooks movies.Altogether the movie was pleasantly surprising  better than Bean which isn't too hard to be honest and Austin Powers although it is a different kind of spoof. Still not brilliant but a good dose of oldfashioned entertainment. Pity the trailer gave away quite a lot of the best bits.Plus the bad guy was supposedly French what more could you ask for?".

We know more than he knows we see the banana skin immediately in front of his feet which he invariably fails to see and in a way it's his fault he fails to see it himself but his failure to see it is always something other than a failure of intelligence. He's easy enough to humiliate but for some reason hard to hoodwink. It's refreshing too that we're allowed to feel for him  when for instance he's dismissed from the case. We see Johnny English being devastated not Rowan Atkinson trying to be funny.Sure it's not what it could have been. It's funny without being brilliantly so and the satire what there is of it is on the blunt side. But these merely negative failings aren't enough to kill a film. Its biggest problem may be bad timing. When the script was being written the antiFrench sentiment must have seemed quaint and amusing harmless because unreal nobody could have predicted surely the sickening wave of hatred the fact that it was all planned by the likes of Rupert Murdoch does not alas make the hatred any less real that was shortly to sweep over the Englishspeaking world.

Comedy is tough to write and tougher to execute on  but Atkinson has the chops to handle it.  He just needs the right material.

	schema:reviewBody "JOHNNY English is a comedy pure and simple. It makes no pretensions to complexity beauty or scriptwriting prowess but is entirely devoted to the entertainment of the viewer. Such comedies are becoming increasingly rare nowadays and this fine example deserves all the accolades it receives.Rowan Atkinson rules the screen in his customary manner as Johnny English a bumbling British bureaucrat who is transferred to MI5 after unwillingly causing the death of one of its top agents. Assisted by a beautiful and sassy Interpol officer Natalie Imbruglia he does battle with Pascal Sauvage John Malkovich a nasty French business tycoon who has his eyes on the British crown. This is a unique performance from Atkinson meshing the best comedic attributes of his best known characters into a coherent whole. Johnny English has all the ribtickling sardonic wit of Blackadder and the unpredictable slapstick skill of Mr. Bean and comedy fans of all tastes are sure to find something to their liking in this character.Aussie songbird Natalie Imbruglia however proves that she's a much better musician than an actress. She's not bad but she fails to reach the high threshold set by her costars. I have not seen any of her other films so I don't know whether this is a reflection of her skills or whether she was simply miscast. Regardless her incongruous performance detracts from the dialogue somewhat leaving the movie feeling a little unbalanced. She looks great though! Mad John Malkovich is characteristically quirky and extremely convincing as the villain  his French accent has improved out of sight since THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK. Providing a good background performance is Ben Miller as English's sidekick Bough his consistent pervasive dry humour a good foil to Atkinson's exuberance.JOHNNY English requires no particular attitude or mindset whatsoever. It is a comedy pure and simple and an excellent one at that. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was an award for Best Film Based On A Barclaycard Commercial then surely this would win handsdown. Sadly there isn't but before the idea has time to sink in it would be a shame to totally dismiss this film as a pointless shameless cashin. While it is rarely gutbustingly funny there are still plenty of reasons why this film is so much better than Rowan Atkinson's more famous creation Bean. Just remember not to take it too seriously and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.Atkinson plays MI7 agent Johnny English a bumbling spy in the Inspector Clouseau mould who dreams of being just like James Bond. When he is suddenly promoted his first task is to guard the recently renovated crown jewels but to his horror they are stolen. English suspects that greedy Frenchman Pascal Sauvage John Malkovich is behind the theft and working alongside his trusty sidekick Bough Ben Miller and beautiful Lorna Campbell Natalie Imbruglia English battles his superiors and his incompetence in order to bring Sauvage's schemes to a halt.It isn't exactly difficult to spoof a spy film  even Die Another Day had a good chuckle at itself  but Atkinson's rubberfaced idiot takes things into straightup slapstick and it works. Atkinson really knows how to deliver an outstanding comic performance as anyone who has seen the TV show Blackadder will testify. It's not quite to those giddy heights but Johnny English is a perfectly good platform for his particular brand of chaos. Opposite Malkovich hams it up as the villain but he gives the impression that this film is somehow beneath him. As for Imbruglia it's safe to say that she looks and sings better than she acts but given that the last substantial acting part she had was in the Aussie soap Neighbours a decade earlier perhaps it's not that surprising. The plot is rather weak it has to be said but Johnny English is not to be taken seriously. It's a funny silly film that is a great timepasser but not exactly one that stays with you.While it isn't exactly difficult Johnny English is a much funnier film than Atkinson's previous outing Bean. Instead of the silent gurning fool English is a genuinely funny character cursed by his own incompetence and yet somehow oblivious to it. It's not the biggest or best film of its type but it is a fine alternative to the Austin Powers films. It also feels made for an audience beyond the UK a suspicion backed by a claim by a Bulgarian bartender I once worked with that this was the funniest film he'd ever seen. I wouldn't go that far but you could certainly do much worse than Johnny English. Trust me it's far funnier than the forthcoming Capital One movie in production...Not actually in production thank God".

	schema:reviewBody "Amusing moments along with embarrassing in this first entry about secret agent Johnny English with a likable Rowan Atkinson  role of the accidental spy who doesn't know fear or danger in this comedy spythriller . In his initial adventure the most unlikely intelligence officer in Her Majesty's Secret Service must stop a group of international conspirators led by a mean French John Malkovich before they eliminate the monarch of England and cause global chaos on the Great Britain . Johnny English a British secret agent who dreams of rising beyond his menial job within the MI7 organization is hired to protect the Crown Jewels after all the other agents are bumped off. When the jewels are stolen he eventually uncovers a plot to replace England's Queen with what the British fear the most  a French monarch . And since her nation has such close ties to France  Pegasus Tim Piggot Smith head of MI7 instructs secret agent Johnny English to retrieve the robbed crown jewels and directing the investigation. On the way he runs into the suspects . With one shot at redemption he must employ the latest in hitech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout a ambitious French successor . With mere days until a coronation  one man must use every trick in his playbook to protect us all. For Johnny English disaster may be an option but failure never is. This first installment is a passable and average comedy because the formula is well known with 'The Pink Panther' series. It stars clumsy Rowan Atkinson as one man show accompanied by a sympathetic Ben Miller . Johnny English release was the first part of series as the inept and bungler secret agent from MI7 . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing  funny scenes  fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Rowan Atkinson steals the show parodying the ordinary international secret agent  James Bondalike  including his ordinary faces  grimaces and gestures . Appears as secondaries some prestigious British actors as Tim Piggot Smith  Ben Miller  Kevin McNally and two gorgeous women as Tasha De Vasconcelos and Natalie Imbruglia . The actors seem to enjoy themselves immensely giving funny interpretations . Lively and atmospheric music by Ed Shearmur . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Remi Adefarasin . The film is regularly penned and directed by Peter Howitt . Several chuckles and gags  the result of which is one acceptable first entry . The flick will appeal to Rowan Atkinson fans who plays stunningly the highly unorthodox agent. Followed by Johnny English Reborn original title that maintains the slapstick franchise with Rowan Atkinson  Gillian Amstrong  Rosamund Pike  Dominic West and directed by Oliver Parker . Johnny is back in action and returns to the role of the accidental secret agent who doesn't know fear or danger in the comedy spythriller 'Johnny English Reborn' . In the years since MI7's top spy vanished off the grid he has been honing his unique skills in a remote region of Asia  now that the world needs him once again Johnny English goes into the action .".

Malkovich clearly enjoyed his role as the evil villain and delivered a typically great portrayal albeit as a very shallow character and finally Natalie Imbruglia does a great job of looking sexy throughout.Full of sustained and silly humour this spy spoof is pretty good entertainment and should satisfy most Rowan Atkinson fans adequately.710";

	schema:headline " Great spy spoof";
	schema:reviewBody "Johnny English is a great comedy that makes fun of virtually every aspect of super spy thrillers from the car to the female secret agent who eventually falls in love with the protagonist. The movie concocts a ludicrous plot as a vehicle for the gags that will ensue and it integrates these gags into the plot quite well. They got the right man for the job too. Rowan Atkinson is excellent at portraying the completely incompetent Johnny English who's sidekick Boff is actually a better agent than he is. Yes I know the whole sidekickbetterthanhero thing has been used before but without Boff the plot probably would have never advanced because English fumbles literally EVERYTHING he does on assignment. So Boff is to just move the film along while English's job in this film is to provide the laughter.One of the things that makes Johnny English such a great spy spoof is because the character himself at first glance looks and acts like he's a real secret agent unlike Austin Powers who looks and behaves like an idiot. English is serious about doing his job and very confident that he's the best which is why when he screws up everything its hilarious to see how he reacts and tries to correct his mistakes. One great part is Spoilers how he never ever fires his gun because everytime he does it breaks! The mood of one of those scenes is great. English is being fired at by a thug and this fast action packed music plays. The whole thing plays out like your standard hollywood gunfight then when English leans out to fire the top slide of his gun falls off yet the action music keeps playing.End of spoilerAnother excellent aspect of Johnny English is how many of the gags carry over in several scenes. This means that a lot of the gags in the movie don't just come and go they will have some significance later in the movie that will add to the hilarity. Finally Johnny English is also an excellent comedy because it never has to rely on sex jokes which in many films these days are not so subtle because they're so effortlessly made yet they make the general audience roar with laughter. Johnny English uses some clever original jokes that are extremely funny. Many will not like this film because it lacks sex jokes and will simply dismiss it as being corny which is ridiculous but if you like a great spy spoof starring Mr. Bean himself this is truly excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I think my One Line Summary says it all really. Johnny English is one of the best British Modern Comedies to be made in a long time. While not very original the movie takes the material that made Mr. Bean and James Bond so good and combined them into a 90 minute comedy that never once fails to impress.But what made this film so successful? Firstly one has to admire Rowan Atkinson's talent. He keeps this movie together and stops it from becoming tiring and tedious. He is probably one of the best actors in the United Kingdom. I applaud his performance. I did enjoy the performances of the rest of the other cast too. It was nice to see different actors and actresses play lead roles rather than casting the same faces over and over. Secondly the set pieces were superb.  SPOILERS  The truck chase was very original the scene in the Hospital and the Crowning Ceremony had me in stitches! I must also mention the musical score. While I am not a huge fan of Robbie Williams his theme song A Man For All Seasons did suit the movie very well. The rest of the score composed by Edward Shearmur was very exciting. It was nice to see a contrast in tempos. For example the truck chase action score was very upbeat and exciting while the love theme was a beautiful swing in Waltz time. I look forward to hearing some more of his work in the near future.So how about a sequel? As much as I would like to see one I think it is better all round that one is not made. If more are produced I can see the Johnny English character slowly fading from our minds as a character who was once very funny and enjoyable to watch. Please don't go down the same road as Austin Powers!As a last note I recommend you do see this movie. Fans of Rowan Atkinson and James Bond will go mental for it as will all comedy lovers!And remember the name is English  Johnny English. A Bloody Mary please not too spicy!".

His whole performance I felt was very laboured and forced and unoriginal and stupid and just whatever...Natalie Imbruglia will never act in another movie ever again I promise. She's easy on the eye and I think she's a great singer but she should never act again. I felt so weird watching her supposedly falling in love with Rowan Atkinson. That was just absurd and totally unconvincing.I have no idea what John Malkovic one of the greatest actors of the 21st century was thinking. Why would he agree to play some sort of aristocratic billionare french retard? Why would he put on that insane accent? why? Why? WHY?  I rate it 1 out of a million.".

Despite his sheer incompetence English manages to uncover Sauvage's plot to succeed the Queen and take control of England.I don't think I really need to explain why I didn't bother to see this at the cinema  the level of humour didn't appeal to me at the time and it simply didn't look like it would be much good.  In the mood for a silly spoof I rented this film and sat back happy to let it gently wash over me. However it was a surprise how few laughs there are even though I was in the mood I still didn't laugh more than twice and they were silly halflaughs. The jokes are very basic and all basically stem from the idea that if English can do something wrong then he will.  This is OK at times but for the majority of the film it is tiring simply because you know what it is doing and where it is going.Needless to say the plot is daft and pointless but if you didn't know that before you went to see it then you get what you deserve!  The silliness wouldn't matter if it was consistently funny but since it isn't it just seems even more juvenile than it is if that's possible.  The script tries hard but it's basic humour is not clever enough to be an effective Bond spoof the concept is funny but it overdoes the incompetent' thing way too far and damages the humour it could have had.Atkinson may not be playing to the same crowds as he once did with Blackadder but he is still good enough for this material.  His 00Bean act is OK here but he really needs to start doing other roles in the very public way he has done this and Bean.  Imbruglia looks good enough to be a Bond girl type but she isn't a very good actress  Neighbours has taught her to be quite deliberate in her delivery and she does that here although her lines are hardly Shakespeare!.  Ben Miller is good in support even if this humour is below his usual standard.  Malkovich does an outrageous villain that is quite funny but it would have been better if he played it a little bit more knowingly rather than just spinning wildly like a firework like he is here.Overall this is a fairly disappointing film that isn't very funny.  It's silly mood and constant pratfalls means it is passable even when there are no laughs however it'll take a forgiving soul to really enjoy this film as it's lack of laughs just leaves it as an overly silly repetitive film that is only likeable due to the good hearted nature of it's cast and it's clear but missed good intentions.".

With a few notable exceptions Michael Caine's Harry Palmer springs to mind they were all derivative and basically rubbish. In the 1970s the UK's output seemed to consist of unimaginative film versions of popular TV comedy. They were all rubbish. Even the decent TV shows Dad's Army Steptoe and Son were pale copies of the original programmes.So what do we have here to herald the British Film Industry's entry into the 21st century? A Bond spoof that's an adaptation of a TV advert for god's sake! What's worse it's so obviously geared to the US market. Well believe it or not my American cousins we are not all middle class snobs and buffoons where the only thing that is of any importance is our obsession with the monarchy.

	onyx:emotionText "After the success of the Bond films in the 1960s there was a whole gamut of '007' copies some serious and some spoofs. With a few notable exceptions Michael Caine's Harry Palmer springs to mind they were all derivative and basically rubbish. In the 1970s the UK's output seemed to consist of unimaginative film versions of popular TV comedy. They were all rubbish. Even the decent TV shows Dad's Army Steptoe and Son were pale copies of the original programmes.So what do we have here to herald the British Film Industry's entry into the 21st century? A Bond spoof that's an adaptation of a TV advert for god's sake! What's worse it's so obviously geared to the US market. Well believe it or not my American cousins we are not all middle class snobs and buffoons where the only thing that is of any importance is our obsession with the monarchy. How would you like it if someone made a film about how all Americans are loud cultureless slobs who are only interested in eating?See it's not funny either.";

It is obvious that some of the scenes filmed in Mexico were actually done in front of a blue screen. According to Priscilla Presley the hotel scenes were filmed at a Mexican style hotel in California. Of course with every Elvis film there is a few big names thrown in for good measure. In this case the beautiful Ursula Andress fresh from Dr. No and Alejandro Rey who would find fame in The Flying Nun and Moscow on the Hudson. The cast is amicable and most of the songs are passable with the exception of the stupid 'No Room To Rumba In A Sportscar'. Elvis was still searching for that big role. While a few of the stars went on to meatier roles Elvis was stuck doing the same thing. You could tell by the time he was finished with movies he was just burned out. Still you can see he has the knack for acting even in a flick like this. I know it sounds like I am putting down this film but I still find some charm in it. You can't say no to Elvis or Acapulco.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few spoilers here...Director Richard Thorpe had earlier directed Elvis in 1957's Jailhouse Rock the young singer's third film.  Jailhouse Rock shot in black and white featured a somewhat dark atmosphere and a farfrombenign Elvis. Fun In Acapulco is different fare all together.  Elvis's figurative and temporary emasculation by the Hollywood machine is obvious in most of his '60s 'travelogue' musicals and this film presents the sanitized Elvis in his full glory lacquered hair and all.  The story's fairly typical in its lightweight nature  Elvis films of the '60s were generally nothing that you'd confuse with something written by Eugene O'Neill  but it has a couple of twists and a bit of a backstory.The basics are that Elvis finds himself unemployed in Acapulco short on money and too short on time to secure a work permit.  He hooks up with a young street kid Raoul who's basically a pintsized Colonel Parker Parker for the uninitiated was the huckster who was Elvis' manager and who became as much a legend among managers as Elvis did among performers always on the make for new ways to turn a peso.  Elvis ends up doing doubleduty as a lifeguard and as a fillin singer at various clubs after Raoul helps him get his first gig at the Acapulco Hilton the Hilton name to become more intimately associated with Elvis' name in the '70s when he changed the face of Vegas.  Elvis experiences 'double trouble' yet again being pursued by and pursuing two bodacious babes a famous lady bullfighter played by Elsa Cardenas and the Hilton's Assistant Social Director played by Ursula Andress in the process ticking off the local diving champion Alejandro Rey who played the Cuban immigration lawyer in 1984's Moscow On The Hudson.  Said rival reveals the fact of Elvis' character's past  that he was a member of a familybased circusacrobat team who 'lost his nerve' when he let his brother fall to his death.I picked up on a few ironies within the film some of them probably planned and others retrospective ones that were obviously not.  Among the first group were Elvis talking about somebody being all shook up actually I think I've seen that one in another of his '60s films...maybe GI Blues. Elvis also talks about kings having had foodtasters and follows it up with another mention of 'the King' not by the way a title that Elvis was overly fond of when applied to himself.  The other kind included Elvis donning a bullfighter's cape for part of a song as a kind of visual premonition of his stage suits a decade later and Elvis shocked that his young 'manager' expected a hefty 50 of Elvis' earning exactly four years after this film was shot Colonel Parker renegotiated his contract with a recentlyconcussed Elvis and claimed a whopping  and undeserved  50 of Elvis' income along with other concessions that effectively gave the wily old carny more Elvisderived funding than Elvis himself received.Interestingly Elvis didn't go south of the border for this film  all of his wideangle and longshot scenes in which Acapulco scenery is evident were shot using doubles.  Most of the backprojection composites are really well done too to the point that some people have a hard time believing that he wasn't in Acapulco for at least part of the shoot.  Apparently Colonel Parker reminded Producer Hal Wallis of the nightmare that filming became in New Orleans while working on the 1958 classic King Creole and raised the specter of being forced to rely upon a few local policemen in a country where the principals didn't know the ground rules nor the relevant agencies.  Elvis made up for the deficit by taking Spanish tutorials to try to improve his pronunciation Ursula Andress in the meantime was trying to improve her English.The Mexican flavor of the film is tastefully done and is consistent and authentic.  It was really a natural combination.  Elvis had always  since the '50s  incorporated some Spanish and Mexican stylings into his dress as he continued to throughout the '60s and even more obviously in some of his rather jawdropping '70s on and offstage ensembles and the same is true of his music.  Although Elvis' prime influences were black and white gospel traditions blues country and DeanMartinstyle pop balladeering many of his '60s and '70s songs have an obvious Spanish tinge.  In the 1970 documentary Elvis  That's The Way It Is Xavier Cugat states for the camera that Elvis sings Spanish songs like nobody.I like this film.  It's not a great film and it's not even the best of Elvis' '60s musicals but it's enjoyable and pleasant and is far above many of the films that followed particularly those shot 196567.  A harmless diversion you might say and both Elvis and his female costars look great. The soundtrack though is one of my favorite of Elvis' movie years. Elvis really nails the Mexican sound probably thanks in part to the backing efforts of the LAbased Amigos.  Most of the songs are presented well too and most are presented in natural settings and well shot.  Check out the tasty little number Bossa Nova baby and witness Elvis' ability to move upper and lower halves entirely independently.  Pretty good workout.  The ending Guadalajara is great and Elvis delivered the take used in the movie after only a couple of attempts in the studio having learned the lyrics phonetically.  No Room To Rhumba In A Sports car is the weakest song but even it has a certain charm.  By the way the Beatles saw this movie at a Florida drivein during their first US tour they were hoping to have seen Elvis in person but had to settle for the celluloid version until their next tour of the US.".

Ursula's dad a former Grand Duke from some Zenda like duchy is played by Paul Lukas who is now making a living as the head chef at the resort hotel Presley is singing at. Another great example of Colonel Tom Parker getting Elvis the best support possible. I have no doubt that Parker also got former MGM contract director Richard Thorpe who did a number of MGM classics back in the day to direct the film.Elvis does a bit of acting here and Fun In Acapulco gives the King a bit of an acting job which he carries off as he struggles with his fears.I'm sure Presley felt gypped along with the rest of the cast in not actually shooting in Acapulco. The second unit shooting though gives Fun In Acapulco a look like the Hawaiian location films that Presley did. And it's a nice story with a capable cast backing up the King.".

I have no doubt that Parker also got former MGM contract director Richard Thorpe who did a number of MGM classics back in the day to direct the film.Elvis does a bit of acting here and Fun In Acapulco gives the King a bit of an acting job which he carries off as he struggles with his fears.I'm sure Presley felt gypped along with the rest of the cast in not actually shooting in Acapulco. The second unit shooting though gives Fun In Acapulco a look like the Hawaiian location films that Presley did. And it's a nice story with a capable cast backing up the King.";

The romantic subplot is rather unimportant although Cardenas is quite striking in her matador outfit. But it's obvious that this is Hollywood's dream ideal of a friendly tourist loving Mexico no social issues and no reflection on the real issues of the 60's.

	schema:reviewBody "One of Elvis' best films...well certainly one of my favourite Elvis films anyway! I'd place this second behind Viva Las Vegas in my list of favourite Elvis flicks. Unfortunately for some reason Elvis wasn't allowed into Mexico during the filming of 'Fun in Acapulco' and in this day and age with first colour Television and then bigger screens the fake backgrounds and body stand ins are all too obvious. Nevertheless it has no influence on the enjoyment or entertainment of the movie. 'Fun in Acapulco' also features two stunning Elvis Girls in Elsa Cardenas as a sexy Mexican Bullfighter and the glorious Ursula Andress a year after her appearance in Dr. No as the ultimate Bond Girl. After losing his job as a sailor for the rich around the beautiful port of Acapulco Elvis as Mike Windgren under the guidance of a wily 8 year old wannabe Agent are you sure you're not a 40 year old midget? Elvis performs as a singer at one Club while other Clubs managers watch his performances and attempt to hire him. In the process Elvis is chasing beautiful Hilton Acapulco Hotel employee Andress...and having to fend off the attention of Cardenas. Tough life eh. Throughout the film Elvis has an obvious fear of heights following the death of a family member The Flying Windgrens in a trapeze act accident in which Mike Elvis holds himself responsible for. But after feeling guilty for injuring a jealous clifftop diver Moreno in a fight and also being branded a coward by Cardenas for his fear of heights Mike decides to settle things once and for all. Combat his demons kill off the coward claims and bury his guilt for wounding Moreno The King entertains the masses by leaping into the ocean from the clifftops...and they all live happily ever after! Moreno gets Cardenas Elvis gets Ursula Andress AND a job. This is an enjoyable film and Acapulco looks a beautiful picturesque place that it's hard to see why it seems to have lost it's pull in recent decades with tourists flocking to Cancun instead. The soundtrack is good too. Aside from the dodgy Bullfighter Was a Lady and No Room to Rhumba in a Sportscar the other songs are fabulous. Vino Dinero Y Amor is Dean Martinesque while the arrangement sounds like Viva Las Vegas and was recorded just 6 months before the famous Vegas song. The stand out tracks are Fun in Acapulco  Bossa Nova Baby and Marguerita. Not only are they good songs but The King is in fine voice too!".

	schema:headline " Elvis Takes The Plunge!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Veteran helmer Richard Thorpe directed two movies with Elvis. Jailhouse Rock came first in 1957 and the second one Fun in Acapulco followed in 1963. Comparably Jailhouse Rock qualifies as the better of the two with more grit and realism. Jailhouse Rock ranks one of Elvis' best musicals and its black  white look contributes to its distinctive look. If you're counting Fun in Acapulco was the King of Rock  Roll's thirteenth cinematic outing. Naturally the action unfolds in scenic Acapulco. In real life Elvis was nowhere near the popular Mexican resort spot when Thorpe was lensing the film with Oscarwinning cinematographer Daniel L. Fapp of West Side Story fame. According to Parmnides Garca Saldaa in his book entitled Rey Criollo the authorities had branded Elvis as an undesirable because two of his early movies had created such a stink in Mexico. Anyway Elvis warbles such songs as Fun In Acapulco Vino Dinero Y Amor I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here Mexico El Toro Marguerita The Bullfighter Was A Lady There's No Room To Rhumba In A Sports Car Bossa Nova Baby You Can't Say No In Acapulco and Guadalajara. Other than Top 10 Billboard hit Bossa Nova Baby most of these tunes are entirely forgettable like this largely disposable romantic musical comedy. Fun in Acapulco is of some interest because Elvis plays a character with a flawed background. Look closely and you'll spot Andy Griffith regular Howard McNear in one of the night club scenes. Young Larry Domasin makes a cute little boy who serves as Elvis' manager. I cannot help feeling that Raoul might have been an injoke jab at Elvis' promoter Colonel Tom Parker. Paul Lukas has a neat little role as a cook. Fun in Acapulco features only one Elvis brawl and it occurs ten minutes from fadeout.When we first see Elvis he is Mike Windgren the captain of a yacht. The daughter of the wealthy man who owns the yacht Janie Harkins Teri Hope of Pajama Game is a spoiled bratty girl who drools over Elvis. Elvis wants nothing to do with this 'jail bait' siren so she has him fired when her father catches her with alcohol in an Acapulco bar. Fortunately Mike encounters a homeless Mexican shoeshine boy with street smarts Raoul Almeido Larry Domasin who helps Elvis snag a job singing at the Acapulco Hilton run by one of his cousins Mr. Ramrez Alberto Morin of Rio Grande who constantly has trouble with his current singer El Trovador who gives him nothing but grief. Mike agrees to fill in for El Trovador if Ramrez will let him lifeguard at the pool during the siesta for room and board no pay. Ramrez does like to upset his employers and he fears that the current lifeguard Moreno Alejandro Rey of Mr. Majestyk who is a cliff diver will object to Mike's presence. Of course matters are helped that Elvis has his eye on Moreno's stunning girlfriend Marguerita Dauphin Ursula Andress of Dr. No later Mike learns that the Hilton chef Maximillian Dauphin Paul Lukas of Watch on the Rhine is Marguerita's father. An interesting scene occurs later when Elvis ascends to the top of the diving board at the Hilton and imagines himself as a high wire trapeze artist in the circus. He looks down at the pool but sees a circus arena. As it turns out he was part of a highwire family trapeze act called The Flying Windgrens and he misses the man that he is supposed to catch. Mike's brother plunged to his death. Mike lacks the nerve to dive off the board. This is probably the most interesting facet of this Elvis character. Girls! Girls!Girls! scenarist Allan Weiss hammers home this point when Mike refuses to be photographed after he wows the audiences who had listened to El Trovador. Predictably Mike and Moreno clash over Marguerita. Secretly Marguerita wants to go to America and she believes that if Mike marries her that her father and she can immigrate. Meanwhile Mike is trying to date Dolores Gomez Elsa Crdenas of Giant when Moreno interferes again. Later when Mike performs again with Dolores as his date Marguerita and Moreno are in the audience. Clearly Marguerita is upset that she didn't come with Mike so she forces Moreno to take her home. Later on a cliff overlooking the city at night Dolores and Mike are smooching in her convertible sports car when they almost roll off the cliff because Dolores raised the emergency brake that was between them. This was an amusing little scene. Dolores is a somewhat interesting character because she is a female Mexican bullfighter. Before long Raoul has Mike booked in almost every night club in Acapulco. Eventually Moreno learns about Mike's tragic history and he calls Mike a chicken to his face. Mike receives a wire from his mother and father who want him to return to America so they can renew their act. Of course the ultimate act for our hero to prove his courage is to dive off the challenging 136foot cliffs of La Quebrada. Mike scales the mountain from the other side because the crowd prevents him from entering the dive area. We learn that Mike is Catholic because he bows at a shrine and makes the cross of Saint Mary before he makes his leap of faith. Of course he completes the dive with no difficulty.Interestingly enough we don't see Mike marry MMarguerita and take her father and her to America so he can resume his high wire trapeze act. Altogether Fun in Acapulco makes for a harmless diversion.".

Fortunately Mike encounters a homeless Mexican shoeshine boy with street smarts Raoul Almeido Larry Domasin who helps Elvis snag a job singing at the Acapulco Hilton run by one of his cousins Mr. Ramrez Alberto Morin of Rio Grande who constantly has trouble with his current singer El Trovador who gives him nothing but grief. Mike agrees to fill in for El Trovador if Ramrez will let him lifeguard at the pool during the siesta for room and board no pay. Ramrez does like to upset his employers and he fears that the current lifeguard Moreno Alejandro Rey of Mr. Majestyk who is a cliff diver will object to Mike's presence. Of course matters are helped that Elvis has his eye on Moreno's stunning girlfriend Marguerita Dauphin Ursula Andress of Dr. No later Mike learns that the Hilton chef Maximillian Dauphin Paul Lukas of Watch on the Rhine is Marguerita's father. An interesting scene occurs later when Elvis ascends to the top of the diving board at the Hilton and imagines himself as a high wire trapeze artist in the circus. He looks down at the pool but sees a circus arena. As it turns out he was part of a highwire family trapeze act called The Flying Windgrens and he misses the man that he is supposed to catch. Mike's brother plunged to his death. Mike lacks the nerve to dive off the board. This is probably the most interesting facet of this Elvis character. Girls! Girls!Girls! scenarist Allan Weiss hammers home this point when Mike refuses to be photographed after he wows the audiences who had listened to El Trovador. Predictably Mike and Moreno clash over Marguerita. Secretly Marguerita wants to go to America and she believes that if Mike marries her that her father and she can immigrate. Meanwhile Mike is trying to date Dolores Gomez Elsa Crdenas of Giant when Moreno interferes again. Later when Mike performs again with Dolores as his date Marguerita and Moreno are in the audience. Clearly Marguerita is upset that she didn't come with Mike so she forces Moreno to take her home. Later on a cliff overlooking the city at night Dolores and Mike are smooching in her convertible sports car when they almost roll off the cliff because Dolores raised the emergency brake that was between them. This was an amusing little scene. Dolores is a somewhat interesting character because she is a female Mexican bullfighter. Before long Raoul has Mike booked in almost every night club in Acapulco. Eventually Moreno learns about Mike's tragic history and he calls Mike a chicken to his face. Mike receives a wire from his mother and father who want him to return to America so they can renew their act. Of course the ultimate act for our hero to prove his courage is to dive off the challenging 136foot cliffs of La Quebrada. Mike scales the mountain from the other side because the crowd prevents him from entering the dive area. We learn that Mike is Catholic because he bows at a shrine and makes the cross of Saint Mary before he makes his leap of faith. Of course he completes the dive with no difficulty.Interestingly enough we don't see Mike marry MMarguerita and take her father and her to America so he can resume his high wire trapeze act. Altogether Fun in Acapulco makes for a harmless diversion.";

Fun in Acapulco basically sees Presley have women problems have a fight with another macho man kill off a demon in his past and sing a bunch of tunes. Unfortunately where the songs are concerned for this one they are in keeping with much of Presley's 60s film output not really worthy of his talents. The exception is Bossa Nova Baby where a truly fine rendition from The King is backed up by an energetic snakehips performance. In fact one of the film's strengths is that Presley looks in great shape as does Andress and Crdenas the pic is never less than colourful and graced with beautiful people!It plays out exactly as you expect and production values waver from scene to scene. But there's nearly always something cheery about Presley's movies and this one is no different.

Girls! Girls!' when his films became much less consistent are actually pretty good and a few of them close to great. Particularly good are 'King Creole' 'Jailhouse Rock' 'Flaming Star' and 'Loving You'.

The hit unsurprisingly is Bossa Nova Baby while the title song Mexico and Marguerita are not too far behind.Elvis is charming very charismatic and very relaxed.

This said this is very likely not to be an issue and will only really be of significance to anybody who's seen 'The Greatest Show on Earth'.However as said not all the songs are great. The rest are decent to forgettable while Bullfighter is a Lady is disposable and There's No Room to Rhumba in a Sports Car is even worse than that only having the unintentionally hilarious title going for it.'Fun in Acapulco' is also overlong and very slight and formulaic in story making the energy flag so the film can drag badly as a result. As to be expected considering that it is rarely a strong suit in Elvis' films with a couple of exceptions 'King Creole' and 'Flaming Star' the dialogue is corny with mawkish sentimentality and humour that sometimes is fun but too often falls flat.In summary another decent but patchy middling effort. 610 Bethany Cox".

No way.And let me tell ya  Once it was established that Elvis's sidekick for comedy relief in the story was going to be a 10yearold brat named Raoul I just knew that the socalled fun in this flick was gonna go nowhere fast.And speaking about the sexual chemistry between Presley and Swiss beauty Ursula Andress  Well  To be honest there wasn't any chemistry at all.And what about the 11 songs that Elvis sang for his adoring fans?.... Answer  Totally forgettable one and all.And finally  On top of all of my other complaints  This decidedly dulledged boymeetsgirl musicalcomedy lost itself even more points for the filming of far too many of the outdoor scenes in the story with the actors obviously posing in front of backprojection screens..... Sheesh! This film certainly didn't win me over as an Elvis Presley fan. Nope. It sure didn't.";

	schema:reviewBody "A typical Presley film that's quite enjoyable. Made a little before the King got bored with the indistinguishable material thrown at him and he gives a relaxed and likable performance here. Here he's playing a character who's trying to overcome a past trauma an accident in a circus show which resulted in his brother's demise by taking a job as a lifeguard at a hotel resort in Acapulco. But with this being a Presley film he also moonlights as a singer and has two knockout beauties wanting his full attention. The dramatic aspect here is actually quite good and what little Presley gets to show off in dramatic acting he pulls off well. Other than that this is standard Presley fare. A few musical numbers in nightclubs a shallow love story with the irresistible Andress a macho rival for the girl's affections and a cute kid who befriends Elvis. Actually the kid here Larry Domasin is quite funny and endearing and scenes involving the two are very good. The acting by Andress Elsa Cardenas as the other woman vying for Elvis's affections and Alejandro Rey as the fellow lifeguard and Presley's rival for Andress is remarkably stilted. Elvis and the kid come off best. The songs here are fairly solid for Presley fans but none have become classics with the possible exception of Bossa Nova which is undoubtedly the highlight of this film's musical numbers. In the end Fun in Acapulco is enjoyable for a Presley fan and others might just have a decent enough time. The scenery here is wonderful and you'll just wish you were there as is the case with many Elvis films. Too bad the King hardly ever visited these great locations as he was always in studio and a body double used for the wide shots and it's quite apparent in a few here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's one the lightest most fun Italian war movies I've come across. It features a top notch cast and some great action scenes.Bo Svenson stars as an American officer who's thrown into a prison convoy with a murderer Tony Peter Hooten Fred Fred Williamson a thief Nick Michael Pergolani and a coward Berle Jackie Basehart. The convoy comes under attack by the Germans and the men escape across the French countryside. They enventually become wrapped up in an important Allied mission headed by Colonel Buckner Ian Bannen.The movie features a top notch cast. Peter Hooten is especially memorable as the bigot Tony and Fred Williamson turns in a great performance. Bo Svenson himself a renegade still tries to do the decent job as an officer and keep these boys in line. Michael Pergolani has little to do in his role as the hippiethief he does have one great motorcycle stunt scene though a la Steve McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Watch for Michel Constantin THE DIRTY HEROES as a partisan leader Donald O'Brien as a German officer and Enzo Castellari himself as a German officer.The movie has some stunning action scenes there are plenty of shootouts and explosions. The big gun battle amidst ruined German and American trucks and halftracks is especially impressive. The Partisan raid on the train near the end is well filmed but features many repeated shots of the same action happening over and over again. The miniature work is not the greatest but is much better than the later BATTLE OF THE EAGLES.The plot is basically a combination of THE DIRTY DOZEN and BATTLE OF THE COMMANDOS but it's so fastpaced that you won't really care. Castellari lets only a few minutes go by before something important happens. He really develops his lead characters which is another important feature we don't get to see much of in typical Italian war films.Despite all of the good stuff this movie has a few rough spots. For one thing it's got a very needless love story subplot that never goes anywhere and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Another complaint there are some lengthy conversations between the German characters that weren't dubbed. It's impossible to understand what they're saying.The movie is not for young kids. It features graphic violence plenty of profanity and even full female nudity in one scene.The version I saw was from Lightning Video entitled DEADLY MISSION. The source print was of top quality with fresh picture and good sound. The opening and closing titles however were apparently new material and feature some music that isn't heard anywhere else in the feature.Overall this is a funtowatch Italian adventure piece. For the great cast production values and action scenes I'll give a 610.".

But of course moviePHD Quentin Tarantino held up this man's work particularly this film to such high esteem he took the title if not the skeleton of the subject matter for his latest opus. Why not give a late 70s war movie a shot featuring Fred The Hammer Williamson one of those unsung badasses and Bo Svenson an underrated actorcumstar a shot? Turns out the shot was a big surprise. In the best possible way.Inglorious Bastards is made by a real professional not by some slacker just looking to slap together some used sets and flunky character folk for roles. This is the real deal if it's not one of the very best war films it's certainly one that is one of the best you haven't heard of least until recently thanks to the aforementioned PHDinfilmincarnate. It's one of those guysonamission movies where it features a tagline Whatever the Dirty Dozen did  they do DIRTIER! and with from the looks of the trailer either very good or very shoddy fx and a lot of ammo. Basically a bunch of US soldiers on their way for courtmartialexecution somehow escape after an incident and go on the run... only to find themselves getting embroiled in a mission involving a train a whole sload of Nazi's and perhaps a few casualties here and there  few dozen to few hundred give or take.There's barely a line wasted in this flick barely a scene that doesn't actually try and provide its actors like Svenson and Williamson  also other very good players like Peter Hooten and Jackie Basehart and Ian Bannen as the tricky Colonel Buckner  some good meaty dialog to chew on when they're not blowing stuff up to bits written and I was even more surprised by this than you by five writers. Oh sure you could argue that it's violent maybe needlessly so. But that is part of the point. It actually doesn't go too overthetop not as far as I expected given its Italiancult credibility and that of Castellari's speckled career.The action is shot and edited with the great ferocity possible when a crew gets enough money and enough verve to push buttons. It does get bloody and there's a pile of bodies that reaches up to a small skyscraper. But it's also a lot of fun to watch it and it even goes beyond being a guilty pleasure into being just plain awesome. You lose yourself with these guys on their mission with Williamson gritting and showing off why he is The Hammer or how Svenson could be such a persuadable star in good hands. And yes it probably does crib from the likes of the Great Escape motorcycle jumps anyone and Bridge on the River Kwai bridge blowup anyone and at the same time it holds its own as a legitimate effort.I imagine that's what Tarantino saw in it its own sense of paying tribute to so many other war pictures while holding its own for a bunch of dudes watching a bunch of dudes go to extreme in Nazioccupied France. It's surprisingly tense terrific genre filmmaking that doesn't force the Platoon treatment  it just asks you go just a little Dirtier with the flow of the average war flick like Sam Fuller with a face full of pasta yelling out orders.".

He knows he's not doing Citizen Kane though so he doesn't let his artistry get in the way of making an entertaining picture. Not a masterpiece by any means and it will probably seem outdated to anyone used to modern CGI work and Matrix stunts.

Action fans will get a kick out of it.";

There is a lot of good action scenes and the acting is great for the style. There are better action war films to watch but few that will remain a classic like this one.While I did not enjoy the 2009 movie by QT I must thank him for directing my attention to this title.

	schema:reviewBody "For my 1000th usercomment on IMDb I wanted to write about something that I not only enjoyed but something that summed up or represented my feelings about and tastes in movies. You know something that has my name written all over it. I considered a number of films  some bad  some good  but in the end I decided to go with The Inglorious Bastards. Not only is it a great example of the kind of movie I go for but I've been wanting to write something about it for a while now. And with Tarantino's reimaging set to open this year I definitely wanted to get my user comment written beforehand. So here it is 1000.As the film opens a group of WWII era soldiers are being transferred to a military prison to await decision on the many crimes they've committed. Murder theft robbery  these aren't your typical cleancut allAmerican GIs. On the way the MP convoy is attacked by a German plane and a band of five prisoners escapes. They immediately decide to head to neutral Switzerland and the freedom it offers. On the way they have plenty of opportunities to kill and maim Nazis. But when they accidentally shoot a group of American paratroopers disguised as German soldiers the Bastards decide to stand in and complete their compatriots' mission. And what a mission it is  steal a train carrying a V2 rocket.If director Enzo G. Castellari is known for anything it's action. And in The Inglorious Bastards he outdoes himself. It's a testosterone injected ride from start to finish! Gun battles explosions vehicle wrecks fights falls off castle walls motorcycle stunts  if it involves action you'll find it here. Castellari somehow manages to keep the film well paced throughout. While the action does admittedly slow a tad in the second act the film never bogs down and is always enjoyable. The Inglorious Bastards also features some really nice miniature work. The film's finale is especially memorable on that front. The cast is first rate. Fred the Hammer Williamson may be third billed but he's the real star. Williamson's character is appropriately named Fred. Appropriate because he's pretty much playing himself  a cigarchomping oneline spewing guntoting badass. Surprising to me is that Bo Svenson is able to match Williamson scene for scene. I've never thought much of his other work that I've seen but here Svenson is very believable as the in control leader of the Bastards. The rest of the cast provide equally enjoyable performances. It's an excellent job by all involved.While I can see why The Inglorious Bastards might not appeal to everyone for me it's a near perfect movie. I've seen some reviews nitpick the lack of realism. Relax this was never intended to be a documentary. It's about having a good time and enjoying yourself. Just go with it and quit being so uptight. As for those who complain about the dialogue or the editing you're obviously not familiar with Euro movie making from the 60s and 70s. Again just go with it. Like I said it's almost perfect to me. In fact I've got no problem at all rating The Inglorious Bastards a 910 verging on a 1010.So here's to 1000 user comments. For those of you who have read and maybe even enjoyed some of what I've written I say thanks. And look forward to more to come. On to 1001!".

	schema:reviewBody "DVD technology has helped to bring retrospectives of 1970s Italian cinema and saved many films that looked doomed to oblivion. Action director Enzo Castellari is one name who has benefited from this trend seeing projects like 'Heroin Busters' and 'Street Law' drawing new audiences. Castellari's second war film 'The Inglorious Bastards' is also enjoying a revival and has spurred an upcoming project by Quentin Tarantino.'Bastards' can be viewed as a summingup of the Italian war genre bringing together elements of plot character and general nuttiness seen over two previous decades. Renamed by its distributors as 'Quel maledetto treno blindato' 'That Damn Train' 'Bastards' hooks onto several wellknown premises. The idea of U.S. Army convicts on a tactical mission was originally used in 'The Dirty Dozen' and the progress of a German locomotive was seen in John Frankenheimer's 'The Train.' These elements were later fused into 'Battle of the Commandos' directed by Umberto Lenzi and seen in Italy many times afterward. Everything from twenty years of Italian war filmmaking surfaces in 'The Inglorious Bastards' a wildly uneven plot a myriad of characters plenty of gunfire and explosions and an overthetop finale.The major European cast is led by Bo Svenson who plays U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Yeager. Yeager is forced to take charge of army prisoners who escape when their ground transport is attacked by a German fighter plane. The 'bastards' plan to reach exile in Switzerland but accidentally kill off a group of American soldiers disguised as Nazis whose mission is to stop a train carrying the prototype of Germany's new V2 missile. 'The Inglorious Bastards' devotes an hour to their escape and forty minutes to their carrying out of the operation.Despite third billing former NFL defensive back Fred Williamson stays visible as Private Fred Canfield. Canfield is the most developed character in this film having to deal with ongoing racism from both 'friend' and enemy. Peter Hooten creates much of the racial strife as Tony a blueeyed American who is unafraid to drop slurs. Michael Pergolani gives a spirited effort as Nick the longhaired mustachewearing playboy who excels at forging documents. Jackie Basehart nicely fills Berle a cowardly farmer who delivers at pivotal moments. Academy Award nominee Ian Bannen maximizes his role as Colonel Buckner the mission's guide Bannen is particularly effective with Svenson as Nazi impostors.Enzo Castellari's main talent is action and the action scenes in 'Bastards' are wellmade. After seeing their guns confiscated by the Italian police during a Red Brigade scare the film's crew pressed onward with homemade arms including from wood that fired electrical sparks in one burst. Castellari pulled off later scenes by using rapid crosscutting to disguise the 'fake' weaponry. These scenes are superbly paced with editing by Gianfranco Amicucci and use Castellari's favorite technique of slow motion to heighten the drama. Matte layouts by Emilio Ruiz del Ro and explosives work by Gino De Rossi place 'Bastards' on a much larger scale than its budget allotted for. Composer Francesco De Masi 'Eagles Over London' 'The New York Ripper' presents an orchestral soundtrack arguably the best written for a spaghetti war flick.While highly watchable 'Bastards' is hurt a great deal by sloppy writing and mediocre venues. The script was written by no less than five people with Franco Marotta and Laura Toscano making lastminute changes to enlarge its action. Main characters except for Canfield are little more than bodies which is usual for this genre and the intended humor doesn't always work to its potential. Much of the humor is slapstick and has a builtin risk of annoying viewers this occurs at several points in the film. The writing often lacks focus and has unneeded subplot actress Debra Berger is highly welcome as a French nurse but her romantic interest with Tony has no definite place in the storyline.'Bastards' was also not filmed in Spain as other Italian war movies of the period. Instead it was shot in locations around Rome which clearly didn't offer the wideopen feeling that a movie of this type requires. While the foliage and climate of Italy appear to match those of France several of the action scenes are happening on cramped backlots the areas are confined and seem to be hiding elements that would give away its place in a modernday Italian suburb. del Ro's matte work helps to bring an epic feel to the movie but it often looks as if Castellari was hindered by the tight workspaces. Although not greatly successful as a war film lovers of action should be happy with 'The Inglorious Bastards.' The film is a mustsee for Italian war fans and deserves at least one sitdown from those interested in Second World War epics. Tarantino's new version of 'Bastards' helped with an impressive DVD release from Severin Films which is available in a threedisc set. The film is solidly presented in widescreen 1.851 with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track. Subtitles are given for all nonEnglish dialogue.Disc 1 offers a commentary track with Castellari and writer David Gregory an excerpt from the theatrical trailer and a 38minute conversation between Castellari and Tarantino. On disc 2 are 'Train Kept ARollin'' a 75minute documentary on the making of 'Bastards' and 'Back To The War Zone' a 13minute featurette with Castellari revisiting locations. The third disc is a CD with 18 minutes of the film's original soundtrack including its main titles. Several minutes were erased by De Masi when he needed a tape to record his son's school play how about a featurette called 'The Inglorious Brats?'. Another spaghetti war tale for the ages. out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr".

Castellari's second war film 'The Inglorious Bastards' is also enjoying a revival and has spurred an upcoming project by Quentin Tarantino.'Bastards' can be viewed as a summingup of the Italian war genre bringing together elements of plot character and general nuttiness seen over two previous decades. Renamed by its distributors as 'Quel maledetto treno blindato' 'That Damn Train' 'Bastards' hooks onto several wellknown premises. The idea of U.S. Army convicts on a tactical mission was originally used in 'The Dirty Dozen' and the progress of a German locomotive was seen in John Frankenheimer's 'The Train.' These elements were later fused into 'Battle of the Commandos' directed by Umberto Lenzi and seen in Italy many times afterward. Everything from twenty years of Italian war filmmaking surfaces in 'The Inglorious Bastards' a wildly uneven plot a myriad of characters plenty of gunfire and explosions and an overthetop finale.The major European cast is led by Bo Svenson who plays U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Yeager. Yeager is forced to take charge of army prisoners who escape when their ground transport is attacked by a German fighter plane. The 'bastards' plan to reach exile in Switzerland but accidentally kill off a group of American soldiers disguised as Nazis whose mission is to stop a train carrying the prototype of Germany's new V2 missile. 'The Inglorious Bastards' devotes an hour to their escape and forty minutes to their carrying out of the operation.Despite third billing former NFL defensive back Fred Williamson stays visible as Private Fred Canfield. Canfield is the most developed character in this film having to deal with ongoing racism from both 'friend' and enemy. Peter Hooten creates much of the racial strife as Tony a blueeyed American who is unafraid to drop slurs. Michael Pergolani gives a spirited effort as Nick the longhaired mustachewearing playboy who excels at forging documents. Jackie Basehart nicely fills Berle a cowardly farmer who delivers at pivotal moments. Academy Award nominee Ian Bannen maximizes his role as Colonel Buckner the mission's guide Bannen is particularly effective with Svenson as Nazi impostors.Enzo Castellari's main talent is action and the action scenes in 'Bastards' are wellmade. After seeing their guns confiscated by the Italian police during a Red Brigade scare the film's crew pressed onward with homemade arms including from wood that fired electrical sparks in one burst. Castellari pulled off later scenes by using rapid crosscutting to disguise the 'fake' weaponry. These scenes are superbly paced with editing by Gianfranco Amicucci and use Castellari's favorite technique of slow motion to heighten the drama. Matte layouts by Emilio Ruiz del Ro and explosives work by Gino De Rossi place 'Bastards' on a much larger scale than its budget allotted for. Composer Francesco De Masi 'Eagles Over London' 'The New York Ripper' presents an orchestral soundtrack arguably the best written for a spaghetti war flick.While highly watchable 'Bastards' is hurt a great deal by sloppy writing and mediocre venues. The script was written by no less than five people with Franco Marotta and Laura Toscano making lastminute changes to enlarge its action. Main characters except for Canfield are little more than bodies which is usual for this genre and the intended humor doesn't always work to its potential. Much of the humor is slapstick and has a builtin risk of annoying viewers this occurs at several points in the film. The writing often lacks focus and has unneeded subplot actress Debra Berger is highly welcome as a French nurse but her romantic interest with Tony has no definite place in the storyline.'Bastards' was also not filmed in Spain as other Italian war movies of the period. Instead it was shot in locations around Rome which clearly didn't offer the wideopen feeling that a movie of this type requires. While the foliage and climate of Italy appear to match those of France several of the action scenes are happening on cramped backlots the areas are confined and seem to be hiding elements that would give away its place in a modernday Italian suburb. del Ro's matte work helps to bring an epic feel to the movie but it often looks as if Castellari was hindered by the tight workspaces. Although not greatly successful as a war film lovers of action should be happy with 'The Inglorious Bastards.' The film is a mustsee for Italian war fans and deserves at least one sitdown from those interested in Second World War epics. Tarantino's new version of 'Bastards' helped with an impressive DVD release from Severin Films which is available in a threedisc set. The film is solidly presented in widescreen 1.851 with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track. Subtitles are given for all nonEnglish dialogue.Disc 1 offers a commentary track with Castellari and writer David Gregory an excerpt from the theatrical trailer and a 38minute conversation between Castellari and Tarantino. On disc 2 are 'Train Kept ARollin'' a 75minute documentary on the making of 'Bastards' and 'Back To The War Zone' a 13minute featurette with Castellari revisiting locations. The third disc is a CD with 18 minutes of the film's original soundtrack including its main titles. Several minutes were erased by De Masi when he needed a tape to record his son's school play how about a featurette called 'The Inglorious Brats?'. Another spaghetti war tale for the ages. out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr";

	schema:reviewBody "We can't deny the fact that some of our American actors travelled overseas to appear in foreignproduced motion pictures. HELL'S HEROES the video title stars Fred Williamson and Bo Svenson who were notably cast together in DELTA FORCE COMMANDO. Italy is by no means similar to Hollywood and this won't appeal to war film buffs who watch THE GREEN BERETS on TNT. This one gets a lot of credit for actually willing to deliver a good amount of action right until the explosive finish. The violence is rather graphic noticing soldiers falling out of trains and hitting landfall but that heightens the reality of the war experience. It isn't rare to find Italian movies sleazy no matter how serious a situation is and it's best kept that way. Fred Williamson known for BLACK CAESAR and other blaction films isn't at all a complete waste here as long as naked broads in the water gain some vengeance in return for him stepping into the party. Well done for an actor known to possess the mean image but he's fair enough as a guy smoking a cigar out to do battle. Enzo Castellari's direction comes to as a surprise for a few trash fanatics just when realizing how he would soon manage to go full force on 1990 THE BRONX WARRIORS and GREAT WHITE. A pretty good war flick from Pizzaland. Remember to take it with caution if you've seen Oscarwinning war battles.".

My mate and I watched this movie in a series of War movies but deliberately saved it for last because we presumed it would turn out the most fun one to behold. And we were right too!

They encounter a series of obstacles along the way but then they accidentally kill a squadron of American soldiers dressed in Nazi uniforms for a specific mission. Tired of running away the crazed band of bastard brothers decide to take over the mission that exists of preventing a train with destructive of missile and a whole bunch of Nazis on board from reaching its destination. The action in The Inglorious Bastards is plentiful and far out! Straight from the beginning with the fabulously energetic music playing throughout the opening credits you just know this will become a nonstop smrgsbord of violence excitation and sheer kicks! This is ZGradeexploitation heaven with specialist director Castellari shamelessly borrowing elements from the greatest war movies ever made the motorcycle stunt near the end seem to come straight out of The Great Escape but also adding a lot of his very own and creative ideas and humorist elements. The main characters are stupendous and impossible not to cheer for. Bo Svenson as the ultracool leader Fred Williamson as the cigarchewing killing machine and Michael Pergolani as the kleptomaniac hippie  You hate to love them all and vice versa! The film is fastpaced from start to finish and actually an unbreakable chain of extravagant and impressively staged action stunts. Particularly the entire climax in and near the train station and the escape from the Nazi occupied chteau are brilliant period! In spite of the reasonably low budget the film contains some very adequate special effects and detailed miniature sets that explode into little pieces quite wondrously! And just when you think the movie you are watching have practically everything except gratuitous female nudity the characters stumble upon an assemblage of skinnydipping German chicks with machine guns! Is this movie the total definition of perfection or what? No wonder Quinten Tarantino is an avid fan and even working on some sort of remaketribute.".

There's not a great deal of slow motion here but lots of cheesy machine gun battles of the kind that became popular when Stallone and Schwarzenegger did it in the 1980s. The low budget is evident in the use of repeated locations and lack of squib hits but even so the greenery provides an attractive backdrop for the wartime hijinks. The best bit is at the end in which our heroes attack a train but a sequence in which they storm a Nazioccupied castle is also a highlight.

	schema:headline " A censored gem!";
	schema:reviewBody "Inglorious bastards released in 197778 became one of those films banned in Sweden. Had I grown up watching it as a kid this would be the war movie to remember instead the Swedish audience had to stick with rather cheap takes on world war II.A rag tag bunch of U.S. soldiers misfits escapes the death penalty by firing squad and journeys into German occupied France in an attempt to find refuge in Switzerland. In doing so they accidentally kill a German squad who turns out to be Yankee special forces and now they're forced to undertake a mission impossible by blowing up a mobile research faculty a train lab if you will and demolish a mobile V2 rocket system.The story is original although in features all the commando raid ingredients like sneaking into a SSCastle blowing up a bridge and stab German sentries from behind. It might sound like a clich filled typical classic and in someways it is but here is where the similarities stops in comparison with all other vintage war flicks.Some examples The movie is European so you don't get to see Hollywoodish standard crap with Stars and stripes in slow motion dying soldiers telling how much they love their wives and so on and so forth. Even though many scenes are shot against animated backgrounds it contains one of the best of it's kind take notice of the huge field of scrap metal after the Americans have dropped a plethora of nasty bombs. To be this a old it's a movie that sometimes is breathtaking and I got flabbergasted by the fact how detailed and accurate the German army is portrayed they wear Zeltbahn camouflage tunics all German dialog is in German and it surpasses the standard phrases like Achtung! and Granate!.Some scenes are in the same league as Cross of Iron and Sergio Leones spaghetti westerns. The french resistance are though and they all speak french and are not clowns.You don't get to see Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers style violence instead the action sequences are very stylized and rather gritty. You don't get to know the main characters and the dialog seems deliberately directed in the course of being over the top unsentimental and cold. It's very noirish in the way the dialog is spoken and those who long for a really crappy laughable Bmovie will be disappointed. It's 30 years old and contains many scenes seen in many movies made after Inglorious Bastards the air of the movie is filled with scenes seen in other movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark Enemy at the Gates Stalingrad Das Boot.Furthermore Take notice of the color of blood. Back then you could only watch bloodbaths in orange here the blood is really realistic.

	onyx:emotionText "Inglorious bastards released in 197778 became one of those films banned in Sweden. Had I grown up watching it as a kid this would be the war movie to remember instead the Swedish audience had to stick with rather cheap takes on world war II.A rag tag bunch of U.S. soldiers misfits escapes the death penalty by firing squad and journeys into German occupied France in an attempt to find refuge in Switzerland. In doing so they accidentally kill a German squad who turns out to be Yankee special forces and now they're forced to undertake a mission impossible by blowing up a mobile research faculty a train lab if you will and demolish a mobile V2 rocket system.The story is original although in features all the commando raid ingredients like sneaking into a SSCastle blowing up a bridge and stab German sentries from behind. It might sound like a clich filled typical classic and in someways it is but here is where the similarities stops in comparison with all other vintage war flicks.Some examples The movie is European so you don't get to see Hollywoodish standard crap with Stars and stripes in slow motion dying soldiers telling how much they love their wives and so on and so forth. Even though many scenes are shot against animated backgrounds it contains one of the best of it's kind take notice of the huge field of scrap metal after the Americans have dropped a plethora of nasty bombs. To be this a old it's a movie that sometimes is breathtaking and I got flabbergasted by the fact how detailed and accurate the German army is portrayed they wear Zeltbahn camouflage tunics all German dialog is in German and it surpasses the standard phrases like Achtung! and Granate!.Some scenes are in the same league as Cross of Iron and Sergio Leones spaghetti westerns. The french resistance are though and they all speak french and are not clowns.You don't get to see Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers style violence instead the action sequences are very stylized and rather gritty. You don't get to know the main characters and the dialog seems deliberately directed in the course of being over the top unsentimental and cold. It's very noirish in the way the dialog is spoken and those who long for a really crappy laughable Bmovie will be disappointed. It's 30 years old and contains many scenes seen in many movies made after Inglorious Bastards the air of the movie is filled with scenes seen in other movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark Enemy at the Gates Stalingrad Das Boot.Furthermore Take notice of the color of blood. Back then you could only watch bloodbaths in orange here the blood is really realistic. The scenery reminds me of scale model dioramas and train sets in combination with European country side.1977 the Vietnam war marched into to the history books as a sadistic conflict and social democratic Sweden were a nation banning all sorts of military conflicts worlds wide.

This version really can't make up its mind what it wants to be as the plot somewhat changes as it goes along and is quiet boring in parts as there are sub plots and an abrupt clumsy ending however as a B movie its one of the better ones you could see. The acting is fine its just the script that lets it down. The Dirty Dozen has a start middle and end so does Inglourious 2009 still worth watching once.".

It's certainly energetically vulgar and enthusiastically violent crap which probably explains why socially underdeveloped young men like Quentin Tarantino fell in love with this type of movie but it's crap all the same. The plot is like someone telling a bad joke and forgetting how it goes halfway through. The dialog is about half step above monosyllabic grunting.

Even the plentiful action scene are laughable resembling nothing so much as a bunch of kids going Bang! Bang! with their fingers and then falling down when somebody says I got you!The only reason this dreck made it onto DVD is because Tarantino decided to appropriate and misspell the title for his latest work. If you liked Inglourious Basterds you won't like this movie. If you hated Inglourious Basterdsyou still won't like this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato aka. Inglorious Bastards of 1978 is a highly entertaining little piece of Waraction exploitation cinema brought to you by no one else than cultdirector Enzo G. Castellari. This has many similarities to Robert Aldtrich's classic The Dirty Dozen 1967 only that this one is pure awesome late 70s Italian exploitation. The prolific Hollywood stars of The Dirty Dozen are replaced with exploitation regulars like Bo Svenson and most memorably the great Fred Williamson. In France of 1944 a bunch of WW2 USArmy soldiers are about to be brought to a POW prison for different offenses when the Military Police truck they are being transported in is suddenly attacked by Germans. Five of them take the opportunity to escape among them an officer Bo Svenson and the supertough black Pvt. Fred Canfield Fred Williamson. They decide to flee to Switzerland which is not easy since they have both the Military Police and the Germans against them... Basically the five unite all the characteristics that the twelve members of the Dirty Dozen had. Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson basically are the heroes of the pack Williamson being the tough and supercool black dude and Svenson the clever Strategist. The rest of the bunch include a trickster with an affinity to jokes and theft basically the guy responsible for the funpart a young wuss who almost wets his pants throughout the film and a sinister and racist jerk. The supporting cast includes a bunch of familiar faces for exploitation fans I was especially delighted to see the great Donal O'Brien in a small role. Still the main reason to watch this is Fred Williamson who is once again coolness personified. The film does not have the great storyline or characterdrawing of The Dirty Dozen but it makes up for this with lots of action explosions bloody battle and occasional female nudity. Even so the film is not nearly as outrageously violent as I had expected it to be and neither is it very sleazy. Yet this is a highly entertaining and great fun to watch WarAction flick that I highly recommend to all my fellow exploitationbuffs!".

The aforementioned solid action scenes could only be achieved under the helm of Castellari himself and this movie is a firm example of why he is truly adept at directing action. The performances were excellent and the characters likable. Bo Svenson was cool and Fred Williamson and Peter Hooten were also superb. The film is almost comic booklike and I got a laugh out of it's humorous aspects. It couldn't have had a better score from Francesco Di Masi and the titleend credit sequences were awesome in their own right!.This is really everything I want a war movie to be simple and action packed with decent characters.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't usually like war films but I've really got to hand it to Enzo G. Castellari for this one what we have is a true balls to the wall gritty and violent exploitation masterpiece from the time when a bastard was called a bastard and not a 'basterd'. The film works principally because rather than focusing on the war itself it focuses on a group of people thrown into the war and their personal experiences which principally consist of blowing German heads off German shoulders. The film begins with a convoy taking a group of American soldiers off to prison for their various crimes against the army. En route to the prison they are attacked by the Germans and a group of five men manages to escape. They plan to head for Switzerland the only neutral land around. However on their way there they are again attacked by Germans and forced to find their way on foot through the woods. The film then follows the group as they negotiate their way to Switzerland and end up becoming involved with a plan to steal a valuable weapon from a German train.The main reason this film works so well is simply down to the fact that it's such a blast! The film is entertaining from the first minute to the very end and this is achieved by a bunch of interesting characters some well worked humour and best of all a plethora of violence. I'd really love to know what the body count for this movie is as it must be astronomical! The film is Italian but really you'd never guess unless you're familiar with Enzo G. Castellari's work which includes crime films and Jaws ripoffs as the main cast are all American and the film was shot in English. The film is often said to be a rip off of The Dirty Dozen and indeed the tagline nods to this although having unbelievably not seen The Dirty Dozen myself I can't really comment on that. The plot flows very well throughout and there's always plenty going on to keep the interest high. It's a surprisingly high quality film too very well made and the special effects are good. Overall this is an absolutely great war movie Quentin Tarantino is going to have to work hard if his reimaging is going to top it!".

Castellari's legendary 1978 Eurocult classic The Inglorious Bastards which brought together Walking Tall star Bo Svenson blaxploitation legend Fred The Hammer Williamson and a whole lot of dead Italians is a naked chick war film that was an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino.In fact there is supposedly footage in Quentin's film borrowed from this one I haven't seen the new version yet and Director Castellari Keoma Cold Eyes of Fear is an actor in the new film.To say that the body count in this film is high is a misnomer almost as many people died in this film as in the whole war.Like The Dirty Dozen it is about a misfit group of deserters that is charged with an extremely dangerous mission to capture a German rocket.One heck of a bang up ending.";

	schema:reviewBody "The prolific Italian helmer Enzo G. Castellari of Any Gun Can Play and Payment in Blood not only made terrific Spaghetti westerns but he also made one of the best European Bmovie World War II thrillers. This halfdozen Dirty Dozen actioneer consists of courtmartialed American soldiers and a reckless Air Force fighter pilot. In 1944 they manage to escape from an armed escort of MPs after an enemy aircraft spots them. A German fighter attacks the convoy and the MP guards actually shoot the prisoners as they jump out of the trucks for cover. Strapping tall blond Bo Svenson is cast as Lieutenant Robert Yeager he was a pilot who used his P51 Mustang to visit his girlfriend one time too many. As Private Fred Canfield Fred Williamson endures racial slurs and prejudice from both sides. Williamson smokes his usual cigar and wears his handlebar mustache. Once these fellows are free of the MPs our antiheroes head for neutral Switzerland. Along the way they pick up a German deserter who agrees to lead them to Switzerland. Later he dies tragically when he links up with a group of commandos and then is shot in the back by them. The deserters kill the commandos as revenge for their killing the German. Later our heroes discover that they have killed Americans masquerading as Germans. Naturally when the French Resistance come upon them the Resistance believes that the deserters are in fact the commandos that they gunned down for killing the German. Consequently they find themselves replacing those commandos to help a stubborn hidebound colonel Ian Bannen of The Hill accomplish his mission. Along the way they allow the Nazis to capture some of their number so they can storm a stronghold and acquire motorized transportation. The Colonel and his commandos had trained to steal the gyroscope from the guidance system of a prototype of the new V2 rocket warhead being transported on a Nazi train. Grudgingly the Colonel uses them in place of his men. Our heroes are sympathetic and charismatic. Eagles Over London composer Francesco De Masi provides an atmospheric musical score and Castellari orchestrates several machine gun clashes. He does an exceptional job with the firefight at the train particularly with the use of slowmotion. The last battle displays energy with to spare with Nazis whirling as bullets riddle their bodies. At one point they blow up a bridge and one of the deserters makes a desperate Great Escape bid on motorcycle to pass along information to his comrades. There are couple of surprises and the guy who survives is not the one that you think will live. The matte work is reasonably well done in the long shots for this lowbudget war epic. Five men wrote the screenplay. The train crash in the final quarterhour is obviously a miniature exploding but looks pretty cool. Inglorious Bastards is diverting fun. Unfortunately Quentin Tarantino's remake is nowhere as entertaining as Castellari's straightforward version. The graphics on the opening and the end credits was done by the same man who did similar graphics on Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars.".
