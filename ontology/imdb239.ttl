I'm not sure what his last movie was before directing and writing! this forgettable dark comedy but it seems as if he took a long break from the business.  You would think he'd make a big revival after his many successes with such hit comedies as Animal House Trading Places and Coming to America.  Wrong. I'm not going to be entirely negative.  I was laughing a lot during the first and second acts.  The film never quite hits the comic bull's eye but it starts out on a positive note with many funny and entertaining moments. The characters are never welldeveloped and it's obvious that Landis was leaning towards a dark farce but I let that slide at first.  Towards the end the onejoke premise is stretched to the point where we're watching a series of violent dream sequences which get quite repetitive.  The film loses all focus and the audience is given the runaround. The cast is promising.  Rob Schneider has a few funny sequences.  Dan Aykroyd looks cool as a snide toughguy biker dude.  The women are sexy led by Natassja Kinski.  However I will give a warning.  I'm a man and I'm not offended by female nudity in fact I enjoy it.  But for all women who are offended by the degrading of females in countless motion pictures will probably croak on this one.  Those who saw Landis's landmark comedy Animal House know his tendency to insert gratuitous nudity to catch the attention of his male viewers but in that film it better fit the tone.  In this case I think he was pushing it.  I don't know if it was exactly necessary to show Thomas HadenChurch doing Lara Flynn Boyle doggystyle.  As I said I'm not offended but prudish women probably will be.  The soundtrack is awfully onenote.  It's as if Landis was running way way underbudget and could only fit one theme song into the soundtrack.  Though I was laughing most of the way I couldn't help but feel this film was way under parespecially for a man of Landis's talent.  The last thirty minutes is all over the map and Landis seemed to have written those final scenes in his sleep.  Altogether not bad but not too good either.  My score  5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "What the hell has happened to John Landis? Not that he was ever a genius behind the camera but he did make some genuinely entertaining and original films. Susan's Plan' however isn't one of them. The reason I watched this was for the cast which boasts many talented performers but I felt bad for them by the end which is a slapdash mess. The film starts off promisingly enough but much like the titular Plan' this movie falls apart by the third act. One of the rules of this site discourages blowing the ends of movies and I'll respect that but be prepared for a weak very predictable conclusion. This film is also chockablock with dream sequences which were a forgivable indulgence in An American Werewolf in London' but in this seemed like a copout filmic device for audience misdirection that mainly seemed included to pad out a very thin script to feature length. It's also got plenty of gratuitous female nudity which is pleasant to look at but kind of made me feel bad for the actresses especially Lara Flynn Boyle. Time for her to get a new agent.

Susan's Plan' however isn't one of them. The reason I watched this was for the cast which boasts many talented performers but I felt bad for them by the end which is a slapdash mess. The film starts off promisingly enough but much like the titular Plan' this movie falls apart by the third act. One of the rules of this site discourages blowing the ends of movies and I'll respect that but be prepared for a weak very predictable conclusion.

	schema:reviewBody "People had been dumping on this film a lot so I made sure to check all the other Landis movies I could before trying this one out. Susan's Plan is a low budget a bunch of people talking to each other movie with a very simple plot  the title character comes up with a plan to whack her ex husband with the help of her friends and split the insurance money but the plan goes wrong and hilarity ensues.Susan's Plan even if obviously smaller is still classic Landis. The low budget is compensated by a strong narrative and a myriad of colorful characters who're rather at home in the Dream On universe than in bigger Landis movies. Almost everybody in this movie is famous for one thing or the other even the small parts just check out the cast. The most unexpected performance comes from Michael Biehn I'm not sure if he ever played something so funny and against type because it's a role one would expect Jim Carey to play. Thomas Haden Church seems to be playing Peter Weller. Lisa Edelstein is all Cuddy again. And Dan Aykroyd's character is just really sick! Susan's Plan feels constructed around cheap and accessible locations and well known but inexpensive actors and it's very well done at that. At just 85 minutes it appears to have some padding scenes of various importance like characters' dream sequences Susan's day job as a teacher or Stuart Gordon as a doctor telling a dirty joke but it's done to make a full creative use of a location. One thing that I found amazing was how Landis and his actors manage to switch between something really funny or plain silly to something suspenseful and genuinely scary almost all in a single scene. Overall it's a small crime comedy for midnight TV that looks bigger than it actually is. I really liked it and I recommend it.".

After all how much emphasis should a palm tree receive  shot and reshot via redundant closeups and pull backs? The first set of scenes seems to set the tenor of the movie and is a grand hint that what follows has the potential of being awful.  Cheesy sets lousy dialogue poor editing  all worthy of a ninth grade film buff student in his first big homework assignment. The framing of the shots almost seem to be out of How to Make a Movie 101 with the subsequent movie having a very cook booked feeling or how to make a movie by the numbers. Somewhere about the 30 minute mark it becomes exceedingly difficult to suppress the thought that the producer director and writer John Landis should not be taken outside and shot.  It is amazing how he can take a more than capable cast and have most of them looking like low IQ dimwits.  The movie's only saving grace is that it is highly uneven meaning that there is something there to almost balance out its dreadfulness but not quite.  That factor is Dan Aykroyd whose reputation as a comedian proceeds him and without that awareness the movie would be a complete failure.  As the character Bob Akyroyd does his version of Tom Hanks in Road to Perdition  a deadly serious killer whose lack of on screen humor makes him very funny.   The basic plot of the movie is contained within its title Dying to Get Rich!  Susan's Plan and revolves around Susan played by Nastassja Kinski scheming to get rid of her exhusband to collect his insurance money.  Characterizing the film as a black comedy cannot mask its gross deficiencies.  It is painful to watch an actress of Nastassja's caliber having to mouth some of the lines that are liberally interspersed with a four letter word starting with f and ending in k.  This must be a Guinness world record for Nastassja uttering the f word in any of her movies.  It is my fervent hope that Nastassja will never have to attend a film festival of her works and have to provide commentary on a frame to frame basis for this movie.  Because this movie is like a sitting duck it is too easy to blast it out of the water.  One scene has the major participants openly discussing the murder in a crowded public restaurant!  The awkwardness and stiffness of some of the scenes should constitute a nice lesson on hownottomake a movie.  This is one movie that not even Nastassja can escape unscathed as she leads her merry band of idiots down a path of ruin.".

As the character Bob Akyroyd does his version of Tom Hanks in Road to Perdition  a deadly serious killer whose lack of on screen humor makes him very funny.   The basic plot of the movie is contained within its title Dying to Get Rich!  Susan's Plan and revolves around Susan played by Nastassja Kinski scheming to get rid of her exhusband to collect his insurance money.  Characterizing the film as a black comedy cannot mask its gross deficiencies.  It is painful to watch an actress of Nastassja's caliber having to mouth some of the lines that are liberally interspersed with a four letter word starting with f and ending in k.  This must be a Guinness world record for Nastassja uttering the f word in any of her movies.  It is my fervent hope that Nastassja will never have to attend a film festival of her works and have to provide commentary on a frame to frame basis for this movie.  Because this movie is like a sitting duck it is too easy to blast it out of the water.  One scene has the major participants openly discussing the murder in a crowded public restaurant!  The awkwardness and stiffness of some of the scenes should constitute a nice lesson on hownottomake a movie.  This is one movie that not even Nastassja can escape unscathed as she leads her merry band of idiots down a path of ruin.";

	schema:headline " Plenty of violent action in Lenzi's masterpiece cop drama!";
	schema:reviewBody "Umberto Lenzi tried his hand at just about every popular type of film in Italy during the sixties seventies and eighties and while he has some very nice entries on his list of directorial credits it has to be said that he isn't the best director to try his hand at the likes of Giallo zombie and cannibal movies. However when it comes to crime films Lenzi comes into his own and just like Almost Human a couple of years earlier Violent Naples is an entertaining and nasty little crime thriller. Like every film in this subgenre the major influence comes from the masterpiece American film 'Dirty Harry' and here we follow a copper not too far removed from Clint Eastwood's famous character. Commissario Betti is your typical disgruntled cop that favours violence over proper police procedure. He's fed up with the way that Naples is being run by the criminals and so sets his sights on The Commandante. However this man isn't easy to bring down and since Betti is receiving no help from his fellow townsmen the task of ending crime in Naples is left to our leading man.The title of the film leads the viewer to expect lots of violence and Lenzi certainly doesn't disappoint in this respect. We've got bowling balls to the head a young woman having her face scraped off on a moving train a man impaled on a sharp fence and many other such delights. Overall it has to be said that this film isn't very original but Lenzi injects some freshness into it with a barrage of exciting chase scenes the best of which take a point of view shot from the front of a motorbike and violent shootouts. The good thing about these Polizia movies is that they are played out for pure entertainment value meaning that Lenzi is free from trying to be arty and can pack in as much violence as he likes a fact which is often capitalised on. The film benefits from a strong Italian cast including Maurizio Merli who may be no Clint Eastwood but still delivers a strong and entertaining lead performance. John Saxon gets to join in the fun also and there's also a place for fellow American actor Barry Sullivan in the role of the villain. Overall if you're into Italian cop movies this isn't one to miss!".

It's like a sprawling metropolitan city only someone's decided to condense that sprawling city into a very small space then add loads of markets and alleyways then add loads of mopeds and cars then add loads of people screaming in each other's faces at top volume. Naples is total bedlam from the moment you emerge from the train station. It really does chew you up and spit you out. I love the place and would return there in a second but will not argue with the opinion that it is to be honest an absolute hole.Take it from me I relished any time I spent there but it does have an overcrowded hyperactive atmosphere to the place. This seems to have infected the makers of Violent Naples because nary have I seen such a Eurocrime movie that has so many story lines or a pace that moves at 100mph....Maurizio Merli is Inspector Berti  who has arrived from Rome on an assignment to another Italian city he was hoping for something more exotic but Naples is Italy's whipping boy so he regrets going there and before you know it he's getting death threats and is already on the case of some jewel thieves and some rapists and to be honest a trail leading to the boss of all bosses Mr something or other the film is so fast paced I didn't have time to catch his name  The Commandante  That's it! Merli bothers himself at first with the rapists the protection racket and the jewel thief plus an armed robber who manages to establish an alibi in sequences that had even my jaded wife's jaw dropping in awe at the actual lack of safety towards the actors or indeed the public...Merli works himself up the line exposing undercover police agents none of whom receive a happy ending wasting the rapists one gets impaled on a fence right through the jaw and generally hassling John Saxon a sleazy businessman who seems to have made a general series of mistakes leading to his heading into hiding...Most folks I'd guess are introduced to Umerbto Lenzi through either his cannibal films Cannibal Ferox Eaten Alive or his zombie efforts Nightmare City or for his lateeighties crapfests House of Lost Souls Nightmare Beach but I can say without a doubt that this guy was an expert in action film. He does not waste a minute of this film even injecting a bit of pathos in the end as some sort of statement regarding the youth's arrogance in the face of corruption or something. Look  If Tarantino were to remake this classic it would take him about nine hours.Violent Naples is well up there in terms of greatness in a genre the Italians rarely got wrong and gets my highest recommendation. It's a sheer classic from start to finish.Actually I'm gonna mention how violent this film actually is because at some points I had to say For feck's sake! at the TV screen. At first this happened when one of the rapists impaled his face on a fence but when an armed robber pushes a woman's head out of a window in order for her face to be struck over and over again with a passing tram my jaw hit the floor. Not to mention the guy used in a bowling alley or the ironic crippling of a kid and you've got something mental here. It still doesn't manage to be as gory as Contraband but it's sure up there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cult director Umberto Lenzi is probably most famous for his shocking Cannibal films Cannibal Ferox 1981 and Mangiati Vivi 1980. These are of course memorable films and more than worth watching for every exploitation fan but as far as I am concerned Lenzi's greatest films date back to the 70s. Especially his meanspirited and ultraviolent Poliziotteschi are absolutely essential to every lover of Italian Cultcinema. Napoli Violenta aka. Violent Naples of 1976 is another actionpacked adrenalinedriven ultraviolent and delightfully politically incorrect copthriller that no fan of Italian genre cinema should consider missing. While it is in my opinion just not quite as brilliant as Lenzi's foregoing Poliziottesschi Milano Odia La Polizia Non Pu Sparare aka. Almost Human 1974 and Roma A Mano Armata aka. Rome Armed To The Teeth 1976 which is mainly due to the lack of the great Tomas Milian who played sadistic criminals in these two films this is yet another great and outrageously brutal Poliziottesco from Lenzi.Genrestar Maurizio Merli stars in the role of Comissario Betti for the third time the first two Commissario Betti films were Marino Girolami's Roma Violenta of 1975 and Italia A Mano Armata of 1976 two priorities on my list of films that I haven't seen yet. Betti who is known for his unorthodox methods hates criminals as much as he hates crime and he has does not keep his beliefs a secret. When he comes to Naples where he has worked earlier the local criminal underworld above all the Camorra the Mafia of Naples are already getting nervous as they know that the Comissario who has no mercy for criminals is dedicated to clean up... Merli is once again great as the mustached and unorthodox copper Betti who treats criminals in a way that makes Dirty Harry look like a social worker. The cast also includes the great John Saxon and Barry Sullivan in the role of a Mafiaboss called Comandante. The supporting cast furthermore includes many familiar faces for Italian genre fans such as Guido Alberti as the chief of police or the buttugly Luciano Rossi as a sadistic mugger. The score by Franco Micalizzi who also delivered the score to Roma A Mano Armata is once again very good and the camera work is fastpaced and great. Napoli Violenta is generally a violent film and it has several moments of outrageous brutality. I will not give away more but I am sure that most of my fellow Poliziotteschi fans will enjoy the film as much as I did. Brutal gripping and breathtaking Napoli Violenta is a film that fans of Italian CrimePolice films can not afford to miss!".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian director Umberto Lenzi made films in many of the genres that were popular at different times throughout a career which spanned the golden age of Italian genre cinema. He will probably remain most infamous for his key contributions to the cannibal film cycle but really the subgenre best suited to his sensibilities was the Italocrime film better known as the poliziottesco. These movies revelled in brutal action and often featured cops who dealt with crime fighting in a decidedly fascistic fashion which brings us to the brilliantly  and accurately  titled Violent Naples. In this one we have a Dirty Harry style cop who prefers beating criminals up to questioning them a punch now ask questions later kind of thing. He arrives into a Naples rife with crime and run by criminals a place where his brand of nononsense violent retribution seems like the obvious answer to combat the hordes of thieves rapists and Mafia types bringing the place down.Needless to say Violent Naples is severely politically incorrect which of course only serves to elevate its entertainment and cult value even higher. Lenzi's sledgehammer directorial style is a pretty significant factor in this. The pacing is fast due to his typically rapid choppy edits that propel us from scene to scene with no messing around. And his approach to violence could never exactly be described as reticent. There are loads of punchups and gun fights but also some moments of creative violence such as where a rapist dies by way of facial impalement via fence post and another occasion where a policeman is murdered by way of death by bowling ball. On the action front there is a pulsepounding race across town on a motorcycle and a wellstaged gun battle on a train carriage that includes a poor woman having her coupon obliterated when an unreasonable gangster shoves her head out a window into the path of an oncoming train. Lenzi even makes time to show his sensitive side too with scenes involving a young boy that introduces some pathos into all this mayhem although these particular scenes are cheesy to the point of hilarity and only ultimately serve as a springboard for our tough cop hero to return to his daytoday business of physically assaulting petty criminals in the name of good old 70's Italian law and order.".

Violent Naples is the second entry in the masterful Commissario Betti trilogy released in between Violent City and A Special Cop in Action and it's the only one not directed by Marino Girolami.

I tend to repeat myself when reviewing titles in this particular subgenre of cinema but Violent Naples is once more a brilliant cop thriller with harsh violence exhilarating action sequences fascinating characters gritty atmospheres mean dialogs and a splendid soundtrack. Straight from the opening credits with a camera attached on the hood of a car that is rushing through the trafficinfested city to the tunes of awesome Franco Micalizzi music you have the guarantee that Lenzi  Co will deliver 95 minutes of nonstop excitement. Commissioner Betti no first name gets transferred to Naples because this crimeladen metropolis is in desperate need for his unorthodox but highly efficient methods. Betti takes every case very personally and obsessively hunts down all type of criminals. He's equally intolerant for jewelry thieves homeinvading rapists armed bank robbers and mafia kingpins that run a relentless protection racket. In the highest regions of the Naples crime hierarchy there's a bit of a feud going on between Francesco Capuano and the nicknamed Commandante and Betti terrifically uses this to bring them both down. The highlights of the film are numerous and nearly impossible to list! There's the race across town on a motorcycle which has to bring a dangerous but slick bank robber from the scene of the crime towards his waterproof alibi at the police station in less than ten minutes or the vicious battle inside an upwards train carriage that poor woman. Unforgettable as well are the bowling ball massacre and the impalement of Luciano Rossi's ugly mug on a fence. There isn't a whole lot structure in Violent Naples and it doesn't look as if Betti ever sleeps but action addicts will get everything the wish for  and more!".

Car and motorcycle chase scenes in this movie are extraordinarily well done with Lenzi employing pointofview shots and creative camera angles for exhilarating results.The movie has a few other notable moments such as a scene where a crooked jeweler pretends to flush a ring down the toilet and our hero shows that it was a trick with a little tray in the bowl apparently a common trick as well? How many jewelers make a habit of taking their customers into the bathroom? and another scene where a woman has her face smashed against the side of a speeding train.Most of the fisticuffs in the movie  and there are a lot  look like people punching air but there are other more violent moments apart from the above such as a man being shot with a machine gun.Unfortunately the movie has the same problems Violent Rome had as the protagonist Maurizio Merli makes absolutely no impression and the movie has very little plot to string the violence and chase scenes together.As such it was kind of an endurance contest sitting this one out waiting for the next awesome chase scene or interesting moment but Lenzi's entry in this trilogy is still the best simply by virtue of having these things in it and making them worth waiting for.".

	schema:headline " Makes me want to beat your ears in!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film ought not to be good for several reasons.For one there's barely any character arc. These Italian crime movies follow an interesting pseudocontinuity from movie to movie. Side characters and villains die in one film but show up in another sometimes played by other actors. Sometimes the same actors keep popping up but as different though often similar characters. It's a kind of universe similar to the Toho Kaiju movies where the same actors would keep popping up as different people. Whether playing Inspector Tanzi Betti Berti or Berni Maurizio Merli is essentially the same character in all of these Eurocrime films probably owing most to his limited range. However he lights up every scene he's in with his undeniable intense charisma making us happy he was typecast in an archetypal role that fit him so well.Secondly there's at least 4 different very loosely connected plots to the film that the film skips in and out of with very little resolution other than some crook or cop getting jailed  killed. In what would make for a bewildering and chaotic viewing experience actually really works here in keeping up a breakneck and exciting pace from start to finish.Merli takes to the scumridden underworld of 70's Naples like a duck to water never taking any nonsense from anyone and performing a lot of impressive stunts without use of a double. This film brilliantly makes use of the crowded markets and cobblestone alleys in a way that no other Naplescentered Polizioteschi film such as WEAPONS OF DEATH which I also liked manages. It's all brilliantly handled with surprising assuredness by Lenzi and Fabrizio De Angelis in his first outing as a producer to create a feeling of both classy filmmaking and rugged and violent exploitation simultaneously.I haven't even mentioned the two American costars Saxon and Sullivan here mainly for international marquee value but both giving memorable performances as a desperate crooked businessman and an untouchable crime boss respectively. Sullivan glides through the film in a part you'd usually expect to see Richard Conte in.So what are the weaknesses? Well personally while I'm a huge fan of Franco Micalizzi's music I find his main theme for this film to be a bit weaker than ROMA A MANO and CINICO scores this film is sandwiched between. I love the speedbike chases but I think they run a little too long and with some goofy fastforwarded footage that could have easily been cut around. Also on the English dub a lot of the dialog comes off as quite awkward and poorly synced but Michael Forest gives Merli's character the perfect voice intonations and emotion.Honestly if you're interested in Italian mob movies and want a place to start this film is the perfect way to put your toe in the water. It fits in wonderfully with any of the other three MerliLenzi outings as the leaders of the genre in terms of pacing and fun.".

Although not a horror film it's definitely not a film for kids. Umberto Lenzi gives us scenes such as a woman getting her face torn off by a train a man's head being used in place of skittles and a slime getting impaled through the bottom of his chin scenes which make the later GOODFELLAS look tame in comparison.Maurizio Merli stars in a careerdefining role as a toughasnails cop who uses his own violent unconventional methods to catch the criminals. He's a man who thinks with his fists and believes in true justice for thieves  a movie hero if ever I saw one. Merli is supported by a strong cast including Barry Sullivan as the chief gangster and John Saxon as cool as ever as a crime boss who finds his life on the line. Much of the fun comes from the crazy dialogue this movie has with lines such as You crud! You make me want to beat your ears in! achieving classic status amongst cult fans.Things don't get much cooler than a motorbike speeding incredibly through Naples as stylish jazzy music plays on the soundtrack. There's all manner of action from fistfights to gun battles car chases foot chases even a train chase to top it all off. This is a very violent film with people being machine gunned in full view and a high death rate so the drama is nearconstant. The location of Naples makes a nice change and a picturesque backdrop to the action. With loads of different subplots and characters a reliance on exciting action to propel the film good cast members giving it their all and strong direction from Lenzi this is one of the best of the Italian crime movies and a must for genre fans.".

The top brass doesn't necessarily approve of his unorthodox methods but you can't argue with his results! It seems the crime wave Betti has been called upon to stop is being promulgated by The Generale Sullivan and he's intertwined with businessman Francesco Capuano Saxon. Along the way Betti befriends a sassy young boy Gennarino Deda who reprised this role in the Violent Protection spin off movie Weapons Of Death 1977. Now Betti must wage a oneman war on crime and the baddies are going to wish they had some protection from this violence! Violent Protection is an entertaining and worthwhile entry into the Poliziotteschi genre. Italy in the 70's was having some real problems with crime and kidnappings and these hardhitting cop movies came along to exploit that situation. Luckily most of them are actually good movies that are highly watchable. Umberto Lenzi like many of the directors of his generation was a journeymanstyle artist a man versatile in every genre  Spaghetti Westerns Giallos Crime movies Peplums War movies and more  but is seemingly most known for his horror output in the 80's like Cannibal Ferox 1981 Eaten Alive 1980 and the wonderful Nightmare City 1980. He brings his best attributes on board for Violent Protection and the results are worth seeing.Maurizio Merli was a mainstay of the genre and it's no wonder he's perfectly suited to the part of the determined and mustachioed cop. John Saxon also pops up a lot in these genre movies and Barry Sullivan rounds out the cast of wellknown names. There are plenty of memorable action setpieces from the highspeed motorcycle chase to the scenes in the bowling alley and the train. The dubbed version has some interesting choices of dialogue where characters call each other You crud! and Ya fathead! in that classic yelly dubbed way we've all come to know and not love. But the excellent score by Franco Micalizzi pastes everything together nicely.While the movie was released on one of our favorite VHS labels Paragon seeing as it's a dubbed and panandscanned release a cleanedup widescreen DVD would do the presentation of this fine movie a lot of good. Maybe MYA or Raro will take the case soon. There is a great endcredits song A Man Before Your Time which confusingly is said to have been played by The Bulldogs but recorded by The Blue Jeans. We're not entirely sure what that means but check out the song at the end.In all Violent Protection should please both fans and newcomers to the Poliziotteschi genre.".

Betti soon realizes there are two crime bosses behind most of the mayhem  Capunao John Saxon and the Commandante Barry Sullivan. The two are at war and Betti's caught in the middle. Betti is a no nonsense kind of cop who is perfectly comfortable using whatever tactics necessary to get the job done. But how far is Betti willing to go to get his man? Trying to do a short summary of a movie Violent Naples is almost impossible. The movie is in reality little more than a series of actionpacked setpieces strung together with an all but invisible plot thread. Intricate plot details are hardly the point of a film like Violent Naples. Instead it's about the action and the pacing. And Lenzi was as good at this as anyone who ever made a Poliziotteschi. Violent Naples moves from fire bombings to beatings to bank holdups to gunfights to rape without missing a beat. Lenzi doesn't give you time to catch your breath before your off to the next action setpiece. I was impressed and found memorable the very same moments noted in almost every other review or article written on Violent Naples  the vicious bowling scene and the amazing camera work of the motorcycle chase scene. As good a moments as I've yet run across in a Poliziotteschi.Along the same lines as Violent Naples' paperthin plot if you're looking for character insight and development look elsewhere. Merli's Betti is as two dimensional a leading character as you'll find. We know almost nothing of the man. Similarly we know next to nothing about the baddies played by Saxon and Sullivan. In fact sitting here writing this I can't even remember what their disagreement was about. Like I wrote before details like character motivation are secondary to the action. And honestly I wouldn't want it any other way.".

The film sticks to the main plot most of the time but there are a few scattered plot holes and it is lacking in style and energy. The flat cinematography and poor soundtrack do nothing in its favour. It tends to drag most of the time. Of the cast Lochlyn Munro stands out as he is the only one who breathes some life into the movie. Leslie Nielsen is let down by an underwritten role and appears more a caricature. Ditto with Vanessa Angel who isn't given much to do in the first place. Thus there is no surprise in 'Camouflage'. It is just another halfbaked wannabe comedy thriller.".

Leslie Nielsen narrates throughout the film which is where many of the funniest lines come from. Lochlyn lived up to all my expectations he was great throughout the entire movie. Leslie was also good. The acting was definitely not the problem with this movie. So what was the problem? The plot doesn't have too many flaws... It's consistent and makes sense although there were some holes left unfilled. So if it's not the plot or the acting that's causing the problems what is it? It's really hard to say. I thought some parts of the movie weren't necessary. Although the sexual content doesn't come near the amount seen in some movies such as Scary Movie I felt most of it wasn't necessary. I also think the movie lacked a certain roundness to it. Overall I would recommend this movie only to fans of the actors in it. Although it isn't a bad movie I think that if I weren't a Lochlyn Munro fan I would have lost interest and stopped watching during the movie. I give it a 7 out of 10.".

I love the part where he says he's gonna make a minor adjustment and then breaks Lochlyn's nose! For sure this movie is a must have for Lochlyn fans! Lochlyn Munro is one of my favorite actors and he has a starring role in this movie as a guy who is even worse as a detective than as an actor. I love the teaming of him and Nielsen.Unfortunately Vanessa Angel had to be in the movie too. She is pretty those lips turn me on! But she is a terrible actress. Her acting has improved over the years though. She reminded me of Wendy Benson from the TV movie Pretty Poison.This movie is pretty much for Lochlyn fans like me.

I love the part where he says he's gonna make a minor adjustment and then breaks Lochlyn's nose! For sure this movie is a must have for Lochlyn fans! Lochlyn Munro is one of my favorite actors and he has a starring role in this movie as a guy who is even worse as a detective than as an actor. I love the teaming of him and Nielsen.Unfortunately Vanessa Angel had to be in the movie too. She is pretty those lips turn me on! But she is a terrible actress. Her acting has improved over the years though. She reminded me of Wendy Benson from the TV movie Pretty Poison.This movie is pretty much for Lochlyn fans like me. It would have been even better if Vanessa Angel wasn't in it.";

The only good Camouflage in here was its propaganda as another comedy from the main star of the American cinema's parodies in the 1990s especially with a good intro by a nice cartoon credit like the pink panther movies ! Camouflage turned out to be Nielson's try to take off the robe of farce which had been cohered to him for quite sometime so here he is just ripping it apart into pieces some of them just didn't remove ! That is why he looked deformed and not in a funny way at all. Simply he didn't make fun of Bogart's familiar method as the typical detective of the 1940s or even made something of his own as a parody or else !Moreover I discovered that Billy Bob Thornton is the cowriter of this ??!! Although Thornton was a writer or cowriter of 8 movies till now but this is the only one he made under the name of Reginald Perry ?! Of course the idea of Nielson  Thornton in one movie is just interesting unlike THIS movie ! So what's about this movie anyway ? It's the worst comic detective story ever because as a comedy obviously there are no laughs ! and as a thriller it's so predictable ! and with the tasteless acting it's altogether standing in that lukewarm middle between seriousness and silliness ! So for sure it's not a comedy a black comedy about the world's materialism a small Noir movie maybe the ugliest wannabe one ! nor an action one or even a parody of anything !.. OH GOD.. What is it ?

Some of the movie has a voice over translation and some of it has subtitles which is a bit disorientating.And in the last 10 minutes Shin makes some statements which are startling and shocking and really change the interpretation of the whole of the rest of the movie.Which is very badly handled as really in my opinion those statements should have come half way through the movie and there should have been an extended investigation into them.The film maker is handed a unique opportunity to talk to one of the most interesting people on the planet and really bungles it not getting into the depths of the issue just telling the story as is.Though there is a power in that. The story speaks for itself with such intensity it is worth watching just for that.".

	onyx:emotionText "I want to review this film in two halves.The story is just incredible so powerful and moving it's so hard to believe these places exist.Shin obviously struggles with recalling his past and it is important to hear what he has to say.So that part of it is good.However I think the film as a film is pretty bad.All of the information is much too spaced out there are long pauses between every statement. Some of the movie has a voice over translation and some of it has subtitles which is a bit disorientating.And in the last 10 minutes Shin makes some statements which are startling and shocking and really change the interpretation of the whole of the rest of the movie.Which is very badly handled as really in my opinion those statements should have come half way through the movie and there should have been an extended investigation into them.The film maker is handed a unique opportunity to talk to one of the most interesting people on the planet and really bungles it not getting into the depths of the issue just telling the story as is.Though there is a power in that. The story speaks for itself with such intensity it is worth watching just for that.";

Metz and cinematographer Lars Skree spent six months following the lives of young soldiers situated less than a kilometre from Taliban positions. The result of their work is a gripping and highly authentic war drama that was justly awarded the Grand Prix de la Semaine de la Critique at the 2010 Cannes film festival. But it also provoked furious debate in Denmark concerning the controversial behavior of certain Danish soldiers during a shootout with Taliban fighters. The filmmakers repeatedly risked their lives shooting this tense brilliantly edited and visually sophisticated probe into the psychology of young men in the midst of a senseless war whose victims are primarily local villagers. Yet more disturbing than scenes in which Taliban bullets whiz past their cameras is the footage of the young soldiers as each ...";

	schema:reviewBody "What would make a young man who has just completed a harrowing and brutal six month tour of duty in Afghanistan decide to return for another stint? The answer to that question is puzzling but it is made a bit clearer by Janus Metz' powerful documentary Armadillo Gran Prix winner at the Critics Week competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Armadillo like Restrepo is named for the military base where the subjects are stationed. The film depicts the bravery and camaraderie and also the addictive high of several Danish soldiers seemingly just out of their teens that comes from their participation in the war in Afghanistan.Edited by Per K. Kirkegaard Metz follows the soldiers from their farewell party at home filled with naked strippers to their arrival at base camp moments of relaxation briefings by their superiors times of boredom and the combat that includes some stomach turning sequences. The camera seems to be ever present and it hardly seems like an understatement to say that the director and cinematographer Lars Skee's lives were as much at risk as the soldiers. The film also demonstrates the plight of the villagers who are afraid of Taliban retribution if they cooperate with coalition forces. Caught in the middle the Afghan civilians suffer greatly standing to lose their crops their animals and their lives either from NATO forces or from the Taliban.What makes it even more distressing as the film points out the soldiers cannot distinguish between friend and foe. When one of the soldiers accidentally kills a young girl all that can be offered is compensation while the Platoon commander tells the soldier that did the killing to shrug it off because these things happen every day. The camerawork is up close and personal and the horrors of war perhaps have never had such an immediate impact. We can see the look on a young soldier's face after he has just been shot and we see decapitated Taliban bodies being pulled from a ditch.While the film takes no position either prowar or antiwar the inhumanity of war has never been shown more clearly and the soldiers boasting and laughter after obliterating a wounded enemy while high on adrenaline caused considerable debate about appropriate military behavior back home in Denmark. Depending on your point of view the soldiers are either making a difference or perpetuating atrocities in an unwinnable war. What does become clear however is the bond formed by the men and their lack of questioning of their mission. Like adolescents on a drunken rampage they are excited by the thrill of the moment. We owe Metz a debt of gratitude for showing us the mindless sadistic and dehumanizing behavior that war can induce. Armadillo stands as one of the most visceral and frightening documentaries about combat ever made.".

It is furthermore realistic and objective and it will certainly start an important social debate. It is striking how much this war looks like the Vietnam war. The movie also debates what a war hero is. Where shall we draw the line? Are you a hero if you shoot some Talebans? Apparently yes. It also shows that this war is very hard to the civilians and that they are trapped between two sides. If they help the intruders aka the USA Denmark and so on then Taleban will come after them but if they help Taleban then the intruders will come after them. Though the film is serious it also contains epic boyish fun so to speak and that gives an extra facet to the movie. Armadillo is an utmost relevant movie and therefore it is a mustsee!".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading reviews of this film I noticed a lot of extreme praise lauding this documentary as being perhaps the best war documentary ever made. With the praise so high it is tempting therefore to look for the film to be the most dramatic or visually compelling sight ever.Looking at the film that way it is quite possible that you will be disappointed. This is not because the film is bad far from it but rather is because the film has distinct and particular strengths.One of those strengths is paradoxically the reasonably low casualty rate of of the protagonist unit and reasonably low level of blood and guts. Holding down the level of gore is very important because a lot of people watching war documentaries become too shocked and revolted to be able to draw much meaning from the film. This documentary shows enough for someone with little experience in such matters to be able to get it without being so shocked that the horror overwhelms everything else.The second strength of this film is in its being in the right places at the right time to capture a good sense of events. In contrast to some reviewers I cannot say that the photography is absolutely the best an experienced war photographer might be able to film things better in combat but the camera is at least generally in the right place and the confusion of war becomes something understandable to the audience.The third big strength of this film is in capturing the way that morality for someone fighting a war is often experienced differently than a person who is not in that situation would expect. This is the outstanding feature of this documentary and I am aware of no other that comes close to explaining this situation to a civilian or person unfamiliar with conflict.The fourth strength of this documentary is in its capture of the boredom and frustrations of military service.The upshot of all this is that Armadillo is a very informative film and one that does a great deal to bridge the gap between civilians and the military. For all those guys who have been in the military and who are frustrated by the fact that other people just don't get it this could be very useful.".

It was packed when I went. Maybe this will aid in the situation and approach finally being reevaluated because it clearly is hopeless right now if you weren't certain this will cement it for you. This has some of the best photography I've ever witnessed and not only for a documentary. I find it hard to believe that the cameramen were always entirely safe during this. This Danish piece of nonfiction depicts six months at the Armadillo base in the Helmand province. We see the young men in various moods a handful of them expected others not. They entertain themselves and each other they get bored they express a desire to help in the war... and reveal their excitement at the idea of combat. Dark humor and porn are used to deal with what they go through. This is funny at times but it also hits you quite hard. It is a commentary on among other things the human psyche. The choice of form could not be more perfect this is immensely objective and the facts speak for themselves. No one is painted as a monster. It would appear that when someone expressed their emotions and it was captured it was put in the film. The editing is spoton. This has an always wellcomposed effective and fitting score. They use lingo occasionally and each time a new term is said we get an explanation of it. Every word spoken that is not in Danish is either subtitled or translated by an interpreter. I think it takes a bit of empathy and maturity to understand this. There is a lot of violence and disturbing content as well as a little strong language nudity and sexuality in this. I recommend this to everyone old enough for it. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a documentary. As such it tries to show the reality of camp armadillo in the Afghan Helmand province. Armadillo is the most forward of the allied camps and as such the one with the most fighting and the least civilian work. Taleban territory is 800 meter from the camp  and peace is not something that the locals dare hope for.Some people seam to think this movie is an argument against the war. I beg to differ. This movie simply shows us what war sometimes is Young men without a clue about why leaving their tearladen family to fight in a country far away. AT great personal cost. Sometimes the greatest. Maybe  something good will come out of it even though it can seem hopeless.The movie shows us the different coping strategies the soldiers uses. The sense of brotherhood the porn the adrenalin the dark sarcastic humor. It shows us how the soldiers doesn't always have time to ask before shooting. And it shows us how different the soldiers are.It's a sober movie. Filmed at the front line with images never before seen from the actual war in Afgahnistan. Beautiful camera work sublime editing makes this a very good documentary.EDIT What I miss  and why I don't give it a 10 I am actually a bit surprised by what the soldiers do not say. In these circumstances I would expect a much more racist tonehumor. But there is hardly any of that. The few soldiers I have met in real life have all had very complicatednuancedmany faceted feelings towards the local culture Admiration and disgust at the same time. I get the feeling that this movie have actually edited the worst lingo out of the movie. I think it would serve everyone good to know that if a returned soldiers refer to someone as a camelfer  this is not always because that same soldier cant feel a deep respect for said camel culture customs language and persona.Also A soldier 'snitches' and talks to his relatives back home about a certain incident. Since everybody is talking about brotherhood in this movie I would suspect that having a snitch in the brotherhood has led to some interesting frustrations misgivings and suspicions. This is not shown which is disappointing.But still fantastic camerawork and very sober war movie. 810".

From when they leave there loved ones at the airport to when they come home after 6 months fighting the Taliban forces in Afganistan. The movie shows strong scenes and close quarter combat like you have never seen before. This movie made me want to join the army more than ever. To watch these soldiers fight side by side back to back protecting each others from the enemy is just so inspiring. This is no recreation of a war incident this is real war combat. If you like war movies this is a movie for you no doubt. A beautiful movie.The movie had gotten some bad criticism because of what the soldiers did in the movie. I will not say to much but it involves how they treated the enemy after they was down. My opinion is fk Taliban. I enjoyed every minute of it especially the scene that i was talking about. And to add a bonus me and some other students got a opportunity to see two of the movie makers explain how they made the movie.".

	schema:headline " A wilfully misleading documentary which says virtually nothing about war";
	schema:reviewBody "Is there any man here that does not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and commercial rivalry?  Woodrow WilsonArmadillo documents the lives of Danish soldiers stationed at Helmand Province Afghanistan. It purports to be an objective and non partisan war documentary but this is not true.The film introduces us to a group of young soldiers days before they're shipped off to Afghanistan. Though they all have different faces their motivations are largely the same they view war as a rights of passage a chance to define themselves prove their manhood go on an adventure and do something important. These are trivial reasons to enlist but the military has always been a cultic institution preying on the anxieties and insecurities of the young.In typical war movie fashion the rest of the film alternates between moments of downtime and moments of tense adrenaline pumping violence. At the end of the film the Danish soldiers kill several Taliban soldiers. Later they discuss whether or not these murders were justified. Yes they decide. End film.Armadillo pretends to be apolitical but the very act of avoiding all context is itself a firm ideological stance. Ignored is the fact that the Taliban have been deliberately dehumanised by the West for a number of decades. They are painted as irrational fanatics bearded extremists and terrorists. This of course paves the way for aggression military operations and genocide all of which are waged under the guise of collective selfdefence. Killing the Taliban is then celebrated as a legal virtue. To leave the Taliban in control of Afghanistan says the US and NATO is to leave a haven for terrorism.Yet before 911 these same terrorists were Washington's close allies. They were funded supported and hailed as freedom fighters who with our help would be able to fend off the Soviet Union whom the American public were told sought to destroy Afghanistan. Under the pretext that the Afghan government was a Soviet puppet which was false the then Carter Administration authorised the covert funding of oppositional tribal groups. These groups were armed and trained in secret camps set up in Pakistan by the CIA. Thus was born mujaheddin a campaign of terror which resulted in the Afghan government in Kabul requesting the help of the Soviet Union resulting in an illfated military intervention which ended ten years later with the retreat of Soviet forces and the descent of Afghanistan into an abyss of religious intolerance poverty warlordism and violence. Contrary to official history the mujaheddin did not arise in response to a hostile Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union intervened at the request of the Afghan government in response to the instability being wrought by a Western funded and armed insurgency. See Nicaragua Syria Iraq Libya etc.After 911 Washington then turned against the very allies they supported a pattern which we find occurring throughout history. Think the West's funding of Saddam Hussein against Iran prior to sweeping in and wiping him out decades later. In the case of the Taliban the justification for their newfound status as our enemies became their supposed links to the WTC attacks and their sudden oppression of women. In reality the Taliban had nothing to do with 911 and were the White House concerned about women's rights they wouldn't be close allies with countless other counties most notably Saudi Arabia and Pakistan both of which practise an Islamic Law akin to the Taliban. The real reason for Washington's change of stance toward Afghanistan is this. During the mid 1990s several mega corporations began to seduce the Taliban all seeking the granting of mineral rights. Eventually the deal came down to a handful of corporations the UnocalCentGas consortium which later became Chevron and which has ties to the Bush family and Dick Cheney and Bridas an Argentine company. While negotiations were underway Bridas found a partner in gas giant Amoco and Amoco itself went on to merge with British Petroleum. Throw in the fact that Gazprom a Russian gas company pulled out of the UnocalCentGas consortium and that Unocol's proposed pipeline was closed to Afghanistan whilst that proposed by Bridas would also service the local market and it looked likely that the Taliban would strike business deals with Bridas. In response Unocal and its lackeys stepped up their game. Their Vice President of International Relations appeared before the US Congress in February 1998 calling for the removal of the Taliban regime. The Taliban themselves were issued an ultimatum take our offer or we drop the bombs. Meanwhile cue the Clinton administration's sudden concern about human right violations in Afghanistan the seizing of all USheld Taliban assets the placement of trade bans and the calling for the surrender of Bin Laden. In other words it was only when absolute control of oil was challenged that the Taliban regime was openly discredited. Although the Taliban continued to offer negotiations on the handover of Osama bin Laden the atrocities of 911 gave Washington oil policies a convenient new allinclusive justification. Oil motivations never a popular foreignpolicy justification could now be submerged within a primal response to a deepseated national combination of fear loathing and outrage.Incidentally drug trafficking constitutes the third biggest global commodity after oil and the arms trade. Afghanistan produces 92 percent of the world's opium the profits of which are laundered back to the West or channelled toward corrupt chieftains and locals. The longer the war can be prolonged the more these 3 industries profit. Unsurprisingly most of the major White House players during this era were affiliated with oil companies active in Central Asia Condolezza Rice Bush Zalmay Khalilzad Hamid Karzai Cheney Donald Evans Gale Norton Spencer Abraham Thomas White etc. 410  Says nothing you can't learn from a video game.".

	schema:reviewBody "Armadillo documents the sixmonth tour of a Danish military unit at Camp Armadillo a forward operating base in southern Afghanistan. Much like Restrepo it was filmed by embedded journalists took place around the same time frame and in the same country though on the opposite side included pretour and posttour footage from the soldiers'respective home countries and features a small team of Allied forces engaging the Taliban.I'm a big fan of historical films and war epics and have seen a fair amount of movies and documentaries about global events conflict armed forces and government intelligence. As an American I love a good civil war story WWII drama and CIA thriller. But I also like to explore foreign films of the same genres  to see what these topicseventsstories are like in other cultures. Sure we might get an occasional glimpse at an ally country James Bond movies or oppositionenemy Valkyrie  U571  Hunt for Red October but these typically only give us superficial perspectives. So one of the things I really enjoyed about Armadillo is that it provides a unique raw behindthescenes look at what wartime military life is like in another country Denmark  from how the families cope with the fear  anxiety of having loved ones in harm's way to how their troops react in combat.Regardless of the rules of engagement controversy that ensued when this film came out which I won't go into because it involves a spoiler of sorts I was really impressed by how welltrained and prepared the young Danish soldiers were. I don't know why but I wasn't expecting that. Although Denmark is much smaller than the U.S. roughly half the size of South Carolina and our countries may not have a lot in common life in Afghanistan for Danish and American troops seems almost identical. They appear to receive similar training use a lot of the same equipment follow the same protocols conduct the same types of operations and have similar camp cultures. Even the familial and societal dynamics felt familiar. While many Europeans IMO harbor bitter it's all America's fault that we're in this antiwar sentiments the Danish civilians in this film seemed more sympathetic to the war effort displayed a lot of patriotism and national pride and showed strong support for their troops. I was sincerely moved by the alltoofamiliar emotional airport scenes where families are sending off their sonsbrothersboyfriends to war  and then eventually welcoming them home.As far as action goes there are a handful of suspenseful combat scenes  including one intense upclose bloody skirmish that involves several allied and combatant casualties. This is the part that sparked the aforementioned controversy. I don't think I've ever seen fighting that real where the camera was so close. At one point the cameraman Taliban and Danish soldiers were within 10 yards of each other while exchanging gunfire and grenades.But this film is about so much more than actioncombat. It forced me to think about things that I wasn't expecting and it did so in a very subtle way. For me that's one of the hallmarks of a good documentary.910 Original review date October 2011".

It interviews one of the troops as well as his family. It must have been weird for him to grow up in peaceful Denmark and suddenly get sent to wartorn Afghanistan. Most importantly the Afghans see pretty much any westerner as a colonizer.The movie doesn't moralize. It just lets us see what things are like for this platoon. The fact remains that war is hell.

	schema:headline " More impressive for its intimacy than what it actually tells us but still an engaging film";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing to say about Armadillo is that the main reason for watching it is because of how impressive the level of access is throughout the film. Following a group of Danish kids who ship out to Afghanistan and this is mostly what they are  kids the camera is always very close to what is happening going on patrols having meetings with locals and being right there when bullets start flying even with so much footage from front lines in the news media these days this footage is still impressive and really well captured.We see firsthand the boredom and the action and the reality of the fight and the hearts and minds battle. It engages and the film is well spread with action which is tense and dramatic but the main thing it struggles with as a documentary is having a point to make. I suppose in this very partisan world there is something to be said for the fact that the film doesn't seem to have a particular agenda but it also gives us a rather big weakness which is that it does document what happens and what happens is nothing that we don't already know really well. We know that war affects the mostly young men who fight it we know that civilians are regularly hurt killed or just affected by the war around them and we know that in the heat of battle things are never as clear as they are later. The film shows us all these things but because it doesn't have an agenda it doesn't really explore or push them often  it mostly just documents them.So for an example there is a clash between young men trained to kill who are excited for action on one hand but yet also have to be controlled and stick to rules of engagement. This is touched on by the guys themselves but only briefly while other issues get the same noninvasive treatment that is engaging but because it is quite passive it lacks an edge that other more structured films have. Indeed this weakness is compounded by the feeling that we know a lot of what we already see thanks to the news coverage on events involving soldiers going too far or being changed by their experiences etc so the content of the film isn't actually that new or insightful leaving the degree of intimacy to be the main selling point.For sure this is an impressive aspect of the film and probably worth watching it for but it is hard not to want a bit more in terms of edge direction and content on top of the strong yet passive documentation.".

I suppose in this very partisan world there is something to be said for the fact that the film doesn't seem to have a particular agenda but it also gives us a rather big weakness which is that it does document what happens and what happens is nothing that we don't already know really well. We know that war affects the mostly young men who fight it we know that civilians are regularly hurt killed or just affected by the war around them and we know that in the heat of battle things are never as clear as they are later. The film shows us all these things but because it doesn't have an agenda it doesn't really explore or push them often  it mostly just documents them.So for an example there is a clash between young men trained to kill who are excited for action on one hand but yet also have to be controlled and stick to rules of engagement. This is touched on by the guys themselves but only briefly while other issues get the same noninvasive treatment that is engaging but because it is quite passive it lacks an edge that other more structured films have. Indeed this weakness is compounded by the feeling that we know a lot of what we already see thanks to the news coverage on events involving soldiers going too far or being changed by their experiences etc so the content of the film isn't actually that new or insightful leaving the degree of intimacy to be the main selling point.For sure this is an impressive aspect of the film and probably worth watching it for but it is hard not to want a bit more in terms of edge direction and content on top of the strong yet passive documentation.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Armadillo";
	schema:reviewBody "Premiering at Cannes 2010 and winning the Critics Week Grand Prize Armadillo is a documentary that's surprising hard to be treated like one with its picturesque cinematography of an ongoing warzone in Afghanistan from the titular forward operating base that's home to almost 300 British and Danish troops and with a host of character soldiers that boggle the mind to know that they are not scripted because in many scenes the narrative does look as if there's someone who had put in a lot of work with the devil in the details. Which is what makes it a startling film to sit through from start to finish especially if one had served in the armed forces before.We follow a platoon of Danish troops who get sent to Armadillo for their 6 months tour of duty beginning with the sending off from their hometown where it's natural for friends and especially family to struggle in coming to terms with their loved ones leaving home to fight another man's war in a faraway land especially so when the threat is very real and the soldiers are headed for the frontline. From then on it's getting acquainted with a number of characters especially that of Mads Mini a Nicklas Bendtner lookalike and an Asian medic amongst others such as the fearless platoon commander.As mentioned this documentary is so expertly filmed that it looks very much a fictional narrative which it isn't. For instance to the viewer it's hard to reconcile not that it's a bad thing of course how the troopers here seem more like characters rather than real people kudos to the editing and constantly brings to mind whether director Janus Metz Pedersen and his camera crew had to be embedded with the soldiers constantly during their dangerous missions in order to get the footage they obtained so up close with the obvious element and sense of danger exactly how and where they had to be around and yet not getting in the way should the soldiers get engaged by enemy gunfire and not to forget that bullet rounds cannot differentiate film crew from soldiers.We get to go behind the scenes of this hightech army which I think SAF is trying to emulate with the 3G capabilities on display here their professionalism even when the call of duty means mundane incident free patrols of the surrounding areas of their camps getting acquainted with their rules of engagement and being very much in tune to life in a secured barracks with their involvement pretty much in defensive ops to try and win over the hearts and minds of the local Afghan community. It isn't easy since they're being viewed as the enemy still and more so when they go about their burly ways of trampling onto crops or worse to cough up compensation when things go awry from the destruction of crops livestock and property to the more serious loss of innocent lives by way of being collateral damage in any offensive operations.It opens up insights as to how tense a situation can be when one is out there in the field where anyone by way of the people's dressing could be more than meets the eye weapons properly hidden away not knowing who's friend and who's foe since everyone's intent is pretty much walled away through the inability to communicate directly without an interpreter and where loyalties still lie with the Taliban otherwise the villagers will be subjected to cruel torture once the Danish troopers leave. Improvised Explosive Devices also litter the landscape and can be planted easily overnight by the enemy such that no trodden path can always be absolutely safe. All these play a part in the mental wellbeing of anyone having to live it up on a high alert status with most events being much ado about nothing. Think of Jarhead and you'd come to understand better what life on site would be like.You get to learn things as well from a soldiering standpoint with the experience these troops undergo besides rushing to wait and waiting to rush understanding how important or more significant the success of diplomacy is on the ground and to read tell tale signs of enemy presence when civilians start to abandon their land to get out of the way of a major fire fight. Those worried that there are no action in this film can be rest assured although the gun fights are never as glorified as what you've seen in war films with the great unknown on enemy identities and locations being a constant pain and a pivotal moment in this film involved conquering the enemy but in the real world rarely does one get to walk into the sunset. It's a little controversial since the filmmakers captured an aftermath that won't go down well with any civilian but for those who have been in those uniformed shoes before it's nothing that far fetched when one gets caught up in euphoria stemming from being alive or dead.In every theatre of war we get to know how soldiers who return never really go back to their selves before their tour of duty and looking at the group in focus that again is quite true with perspectives being changed from harrowing experiences gained epitomized by Mads Mini who started off looking for adventure but probably got more than he bargained for returning a more sombre person than one seeking thrills. If it's an up close and personal look at a modern day active warfront you can't get any closer with a more nuanced feel of being there and having done that with Armadillo. Highly recommended!".

Denmark is not a nation I know well but what was so fascinating about this documentary was the ways in which the young Danish soldiers were similar to friends of mine in the British Army and also the ways in which they were completely alien. The documentary itself is well put together mixing the lyricism of a foreign land with the power of modern armies and the confusion of battle. All of this was part of a simple story as the Danes did a single tour of duty. The camerawork was highly effective and the editing excellent. The film makers don't impose themselves except when strictly necessary to explain events or details. Most of the film is told simply through the words and actions of those recorded. It gives the film a powerful honesty.The most interesting part of the documentary is towards the end when the Danes attack a ditch and kill a number of Taliban. Later questions are asked as to whether this was a war crime whether they grenaded and sprayed with bullets enemies who were trying to surrender or too wounded to resist. The entire event in all its confusion is captured on film. The audience can therefore decide for themselves. Were the Taliban surrenderingwounded?

That to me is the main truth about modern warfare. In almost all the military conflicts nowadays around 8090 of casualties are the civilians. That is what is really sick about modern wars. That and of course the utter criminality of the whole thing.But instead the whole industry of movies about war and a good deal of literature all concentrate on the soldiers and their sufferings. And though it is definitely possible to sympathize with the soldiers who have no choice but take arms to defend their homeland it is hard to feel empathy for the Western youth who couldn't get a better job than go to a foreign land to kill people. This of course is always wrapped up in the heroic rhetoric but it is so thin and so obvious that there is nothing remotely enriching in this experience. You are there in the beautiful land with gorgeous mountains and you are just stuck at the base and can't even become real friends with locals. all you do is just blow up poor people's buildings destroy their livelihood and once in a while kill armed men or more often unarmed women and children.".

One of the strengths of such a work can be the realism that is portrayed more and more frequently a major focus of recent war films like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down yet no matter how hard a movie with actors tries what's happening on screen isn't real and can't match the reality of a piece like Armadillo.In that regard films like 'Restrepo' and 'Armadillo' can be compelling viewing no actors and generally a 'warts and all' insight into going to war both these pieces providing ammunition to both pro and anti Afghanistan opinions. I found Armadillo to be fascinating viewing perhaps principally because it isn't American doesn't portray Americans and gives one an insight into proceedings well removed from the propaganda of either side of the debate.So young Danish kids like tattoos watching porn and talking crap undoubtedly little removed from kids in most other western or probably most cultures. The freedoms and excesses of western society are illustrated perhaps merely to further fuel the resolve of those they are fighting against but it doesn't seek to gloss over anything and the boys all want to bag themselves a 'Talibob' before they go home.The complications frustrations and barriers to getting their job done are all highlighted not knowing who the enemy are not able to deny areas to the enemy consistently having the enemy able to keep better tabs on them despite their own technological advantage and having to work with a deeply mistrusting and unreliable and uncooperative populace many of whom express fear of reprisal for dealing with the soldiers.In that regard both the questions of should the west be there and can the mission be completed aren't or aren't able to be answered and the film doesn't appear to really try and tackle those questions criticised by some 'enlightened' individuals apparently as prowar and proAmerican propaganda merely because it doesn't.The villager that tells the soldiers that he isn't able to help them because the soldiers and Taliban are fine because they have their guns yet the villagers are stuck in the middle and he would get his throat cut by the Taliban certainly suggests that the locals do have a problem that perhaps requires or warrants some outside intervention perhaps akin to a local neighbourhood terrorised by a gang but it is apparent that there is no easy or imminent solution though having the gang on the back foot or with a little competition on their hands was not necessarily a bad thing.The climactic action of the film and the subsequent controversy around such further fails to offer any conclusion and opinions on such will likely fall somewhere between ideology and reality. Without a doubt it must be a lot safer to cast judgement sitting thousands of miles away from the comfort and safety of an armchair. Certainly I'm inclined to agree with the guys that have to put their head in the enemy trench to see what's what.All that aside as mentioned I found this compelling viewing as an insight into both modern military and the realities of the situation in Afghanistan seen through the eyes of a nation I doubt anyone would ever describe in this day and age as warmongers. It raises several questions that aren't or can't be answered leaving plenty to contemplate or debate afterwards for people on both sides of the fence.

In the tradition of best cinma vrit Metz has produced one of the best because it concentrates on the most important aspect men in war and how they behave. In doing so Metz presents a harrowing story the like of which we would see only in fictional war movies at the local cinema. In fact the whole production is done so professionally you could easily think you're watching a fiction war movie anyway  like Brothers 2004 Danish 2009 American set in Afghanistan and about what men do to survive. In the last third of Armadillo there are solid echoes of Full Metal Jacket 1987 when the Danish patrol is ambushed by Taliban snipers  think of those scenes in FMJ where the American soldiers are hunting for the lone Vietcong sniper in the bombedout ruins of Hue  only this story is real all too real bullets are flashing past the cameras men are diving for cover cameras are sent askew  and you hold your breath as the patrol carries on searching dodging men calling to each other.... By the time that search and destroy mission is complete the viewer could well be sweating she might even feel sick to the stomach some might feel revulsion others will be totally enraged still others would cheer. Finally the phlegmatic cynics out there would shrug their shoulders open another can of beer and make a crack that Sht happens buddy! Git over it. Those sorts of reactions occurred in Demark when Armadillo was released to cinemas there. And for good reason.For this viewer the best aspect of the actual production is the total lack of any narration or interviewing by any of the production crew. Watching the Danes at rest eating at play and in action provides the best flyonthewall experience I've ever experienced in cinema bar none. Crucially also the production crew makes no implicit or explicit judgment of what transpires during the skirmish to neutralize the Taliban snipers. Closeups of grunts' faces after the battle say it all.The direction and editing throughout are exceptionally well done  astonishing even given the mise en scne. The sound work is crystal clear. Together with a soundtrack that fits seamlessly with the story I'd urge any viewer interested in documentary production to see this effort  as soon as possible. And for all those who dislike subtitles make an exception this time.Recommended for adults. Give this my best nine out of ten. Don't miss it.May 8th 2015".

The film follows them first in Denmark and then their six months tour. They are quickly into combat situations and things are lost in translation. The villagers are caught in the middle.There isn't anything particularly new. The action does get quite dangerous as the filmmakers go out into the patrols. It's an extended news report without the commentary. The great thing here is the film allows the people and action to speak for themselves. There are memorable scenes where the language difference get into the way. There is also some controversies back home about their combat mission. We shouldn't be surprised by any of this but it's always a bit shocking.".

It's slowly going house to house and I should get the DVD back sometime in mid 2007 at this rate. Now he's taken on horror the genre I adore! This spooky comic sex romp is everything Scary Movie attempts to be except with jokes that are actually funny. The jabs at the manic maniac movies of the 80's and 90's and send ups of contemporary indie frights are handled with deft cuts that are witty sexy and still a bit scary.Stormy Daniels Princess of Space Nuts and heroine of Eternity is in fine form as Kirsten bubbly blonde danger magnet who isn't sure what she should be more traumatized by  the possible dismemberment of her boyfriend or breaking the heel of her 300 shoes. Jessica Drake departing from her usual style with a rather flattering auburn hairdo is marvelous as the acid tongued Megan who provides a bitchy straight woman to Kirsten's floaty punchlines. Megan Okay if you were a phone where would you be? Kirsten In a phone booth. Megan Okay if you were a phone booth where would you be? Kirsten At a gas station! The rest of our college kids are rounded out by Eric Masterson as our math geek Blair Witch documentary artiste Voodoo and Tommy Gunn are our lettermen one being the captain of the badminton team who are trying prove themselves manly and heroic with limited success. Josh Did you just hear that sound? Rayford What sound? Josh Well there were like two different sounds  one was like a bobcat or an owl and the other was like a scream. Todd A scream? What kind of scream? Josh Like AHHHAHHH only a lot more girlie. Todd Oh you mean like when I'm fking your mother right? Josh That only happened once! Add to the blend a mysterious guy to be run over by a van a beautiful spirit guide an attack raccoon a well with a creepy Ring chick as well a mysterious old caretaker Mike Horner  who played the Evil Overlord in Space Nuts is comic gold here! and even dearer to my heart and other places Randy Spears  a gruff voiced Texas sheriff and it's mixed very well.There is splashing blood disfigured psychos roaring power tools and startling soundtrack chords that do add a nice bit of horror atmosphere however the film is first and foremost a comedy. So the horror is a dash here and there in the midst of it all  adding to the fun but not eclipsing it.The sex scenes are quite hot even if a bit too formulaic. The performances are enhanced by people maintaining character when they can. However I would say there is a decided lack of cunnilingus in this film and I think that Jonathan should really address that in his next movie. A little more variation in the popshots would be welcome just so I don't have to listen to the sigh and Look another facial. which accompanies most of them well it is mostly me saying that true. Oh and the gold belly chain on the mental patient.? Yes it's pretty but under a hospital gown? That's just not right. As with Space Nuts the extra discs are just as much fun as the film itself with commentary bloopers shorts auditions and all kinds of camp stuff! I plan to inflict this movie on everyone I know  and this time I'm buying a spare DVD!".

COMMANDOS FIVE FOR HELL HELL IN NORMANDY DESERT COMMANDOS THE WAR DEVILS SALT IN THE WOUND They may not have been particularly wellmade or socially relevant what would German collaborators really have to say about WW2 anyway except maybe they weren't as awful as the Nazis? but are enjoyable escapist fantasy fare aimed straight at the bloodthirsty 12 year old boy in all of us who likes watching stuff get blown up real good. They were Spaghetti Westerns with tanks  machine guns instead of horses  six shooters and while many were downright absurd they do have a certain charm about them that is very reminiscent of playing army as a kid out in the sand lot near the lake house with your cousins. The stories are disposable the plots reusable and the films for the most part unremarkable made for little or no money meant to be shown on a double bill one week then gone the next replaced by 2 more just like it. The Italians may not have crafted particularly memorable films but you have to admit that they kept busy and for the most part the Euro War phenomenon resulted in fast paced if somewhat derivative  formulaic efforts that nonetheless had a certain entertainment value that sadly was lost on North American audiences. Aside from COMMANDOS and FIVE FOR HELL they are obscure unheard of and incredibly hard to find other than a few crummy public domain releases of tattered worn full frame TV prints that were rescued from various trash dumpsters after the local TV movie matine years ended.One of the films you won't find however is WHEN THE BELL TOLLS. I have been criticized for being lenient when it comes to evaluating Euro cult genre cinema before and the war films in particular but this time I won't mince words This movie SUCKS. Even the presence of Brad Zambo Harris cannot add much interest beyond noting that the film features a performance by Brad Zambo Harris one of my favorites of the genre actors as a priest. He appears in the bookend segments of the film of which the first running about 15 minutes is the only part of the movie with any genuine interest. The rest is utterly excruciating and not even in a good way. The film was directed by Luigi Batzella aka Paul Solvay who also wrote and adapted his story for the screenplay and thusly has nobody else but himself to blame. Batzella would later go on to bigger  better things as a sometimes brilliant director of erotic Euro Horror  his Nude for Satan and especially The Devil's Wedding Night are two of that genre's finest efforts and little of the promise seen in those movies is evident here. There is perhaps an autobiographical nature to the film which is all I can think of to explain what a slogging indulgent and uninteresting mess of a narrative it attempts to tell. I have sat through it twice and both times failed to understand what the point of it was. Like the good Sgt. Slaughter points out the movie consists of a series of seemingly random unconnected set pieces that appear to be parts of different movies and are so ineptly staged and executed as to make one wonder if this may have been some kind of a puton or tax dodge.From what I could make of it the story is about a wouldbe priest who encounters atrocities at the hands of the Nazis goes insane wanders the countryside moaning and screaming and gabbering like a madman eventually meets up with a group of Spanish or Italian partisans and then dies. Just how the film gets from point A to B to C is confused as if large sections of a longer movie are missing or perhaps a misguided attempt at surrealism was intended. Much of the middle section of the film was shot with some sort of a colored filter on the camera lens suggesting that it's either supposed to be interpreted as a flashback or what this insane cleric is witnessing  Either way it doesn't make any sense and after about an hour becomes so annoying as to be distracting. The film opens and closes with Father Harris reminiscing about his former colleague with one of their former Nazi foes a device which might normally have worked to explain what it all means but here only has the effect of reminding us how cool it WOULD have been to see Brad Zambo Harris taking on the Nazis single handedly  cracking skulls with Gianni Garko or Enzo Girolami. Coulda shoulda woulda. It's also odd to note that Batzella and Harris would reteam in 1976 for the infamous THE BEAST IN THE HEAT  which recycles much of the battle footage from this movie and others  perhaps the most notorious of the Italian Nazi Exploitation Trash sub genre and what is amazing about it is that it's actually a better movie than WHEN THE BELL TOLLS once you get down to it.

	schema:headline " A very fun and clever satire on Ireland's policy towards the Irish language";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an extremely enjoyable Irish short film the title of which translates as My name is Yu Ming. It stars Daniel Wu as the title character a young Chinese man who is sick of his dead end job and decides to move to Ireland after spinning a globe and landing his finger on my native country. After discovering that Irish is the official language he spends six months learning it. When he arrives in Dublin however he finds that no one can understand a word that he is saying and some even assume that he is speaking Mandarin! The misunderstanding is cleared up by a Gaeilgeoir native speaker bar patron named Paddy played by the always wonderful Frank Kelly who is astonished to find a Chinese person speaking his language fluently. Yu Ming eventually gets a job as a bartender in Connemara one of the Gaeltacht regions where Irish is primarily spoken and presumably lives happily ever after.The film is a very fun and clever satire on the Republic of Ireland's policy towards the Irish language. Constitutionally speaking Irish is the national and first language of the country but this has always had far more to do with nationalism with reality frankly. In practice it is very much the second language and a very very distant second at that. According to the 2011 census only 77185 people out of 4.5 million spoke it on a daily business outside of the education system and less than half of the population can speak it at all. Speaking of the Constitution the status of Irish means that where there is a contradiction between the English and Irish versions thereof the Irish one prevails in spite of the fact that it was written in English and then translated into Irish a rather bizarre scenario which given my legal training I find more than a little silly. Some foreign people think that we all speak Irish as a first language. When I was in Edinburgh I was told by a Polish girl that I spoke very good English! I took it in the spirit in which it was meant. It's all Greek to me. As regards my own attitude towards Irish my enthusiasm for it knows bounds. However I have been able to make my peace with it as by mutual consent we have agreed to give each other a wide berth in the future this short film notwithstanding.".

But if you are familiar with situation in Ireland where the language is rapidly dying out and most people don't speak a word of it even after spending years in school learning it  in fact many people have a violent antipathy toward it  the film will be all the richer for you.Anyway Daniel Wu's performance is comedy gold. I was in stitches when he did his impression of Robert De Niro speaking Irish. I also liked the perky but clueless Australian hostel attendant.The basic premise of the movie is not as farfetched as you might think. Some years ago I met a guy from a Caribbean island who now works as a chef in the Aran Islands and speaks fluent Irish. And with the booming Irish economy attracting people from all over the world you can go into even the smallest village and are as likely to find yourself dealing with Ethiopians Estonians and Ecuadorians to mention just the E's as with nativeborn Irish people.Anyway you can watch this movie for free on the web so if you are at all intrigued do a google or youtube search and enjoy!".

Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom is an Irish 13minute short film from 2003 and it relies a lot on the audience finding the protagonist likable. That was not the case for me though as I found him pretty stupid with how foolish he was. That is also why I did not like the film as a whole and it's even worse as I am generally interested in films with an Irish background. And lets be honest this mishap from our hero is also not enough material to carry a movie alone no matter if 13 or 130 minutes. I do not recommend it.

In 99  of the movies old women are funny or touching. Not desperados or delinquent. But Tatie is. Or worst...  Despite that this movie is also very sarcastic about middle class families and a certain way of life. This is truly very unique a real mastepiece of black humor. One of my favorite comic movie of all time. Let's hope Hollywood will never make a remake.";

Her absolute awfulness is not reason enough to watch the movieafter all it would hardly be engaging to JUST watch a movie of a horrible person. Instead the writers really manipulate the viewer into ALMOST liking her or seeing something of value in this old crankand THEN she becomes even worse than you'd imagined! Its unrelenting cynicism is great. This movie reminded me of a much better written version of Problem Child with one MAJOR exception. In Problem Child they had a copout ending when the rotten child's heart changed and he realized he really DID love his adopted dad. That NEVER rang true in Problem Child and Tatie Danielle never gives in to cheap sentimentality. It is funny and irreverent and very unusual to say the least.I remember the tagline of the movie when it came out roughly translated to you don't even know her but she hates you already. Wowthis really sums up the old crow!By the way what ever DID happen to the dog....?".

They do not respect her they pretend that they do but they don't. The movie is a veiled criticism to the hypocrisy of those family ties. I liked her character from the very first minute because she's honest in the sense that she knows very well that those around her simply can't stand her nor do they respect her will to live and be free.

Her aged housekeeper companion Odile is driven frantic by this cantankerous old shrew who insists she completes the most impossible and dangerous tasks such as cleaning the chandeliers.  Her nephew and niece move in to look after her in her supposedly frail state of health and she makes life absolute hell for them too. She has a framed photograph of her late husband Edouard hanging on the wall and she consults him on all her personal matters.  I found these conversations highly amusing.  The most entertaining part of the movie is when the relatives take off for Greece leaving Auntie Danielle under the care of a young woman employed to look after her.  Sparks fly when these two obstinate individuals come face to face neither giving way to the other The bedwetting scene is quite a gem but there are many other incidents which are equally amusing.  The ending of the film in the Alps comes somewhat as a surprise as we see a complete transformation of Auntie.  The spirited singing at the beginning and the end has nothing to do with the story but I think it is a charming and original addition to a film which keeps you chuckling long after the credits have rolled.".

	schema:reviewBody "Etienne Chatiliez can keep a cool head! After the commercial and critical success of Life is a long quiet river 1988 there must have been an immense pressure on him to make a second movie. Two years later he resurfaced with a new featurelength film Tatie Danielle. At first sight this film seems to be less original than its predecessor. It is nevertheless a fact that it is a funnier movie to watch and it shows once again Chatiliez's brilliant talent.Etienne Chatiliez's strength comes from his skill at making laugh of a serious topic always with a caustic and devastating humor. Furthermore he always finds place to insert in it a little touch of social satire. These filmmaker's particular gifts were already present in life is a long quiet river. We find them again with pleasure in Tatie Danielle where the director is surpassing himself and is going further in daring. Roughly he is having a tremendous time with the adventures of this old malicious lady who is going to make life impossible for her nephews. The movie is bursting with comical sequences and noone makes sparks fly of powerful dialogs as well as Chatiliez does. Through the Billard family's trouble then Sandrine with Tatie Danielle a progressive tension grows which reaches its climax in the sequence when Tatie Danielle hopeless after Sandrine's departure ransacks her nephews' flat and accuses them!Like in Life is a long quiet river the contrast constitutes one of the author's main weapons. On one hand Tatie Danielle an old lady full of nastiness and on another hand her nephews with an excessive kindness. It is useful to point out that the director makes a somewhat mocking description of his characters. For example Tatie Danielle may be unbearable she is also a very lonely old woman. She can only confide in her late husband. The latter is depicted in a photography and he is squinting! Through this characteristic Chatiliez cocks a snook at her main character. On another hand in the Billard family the father and the children have got pretty much the same first name Jean. A discreet way to laugh at this average French familyBut Etienne Chatiliez has more than one string to his bow. Indeed he also understood that sometimes it is better to use the power of suggestion to make particular moments successful. Thus we learn that Tatie Danielle stirs up illfeeling in the old people's home through the nurses and the head doctor's words. And especially especially Chatiliez has got a sharp sense of observation. His movie abounds of little black ideas or details that irresistibly kick the bull's eye.Tatie Danielle also proves one thing. Sometimes it is nouse hiring famous actors to secure the success of a movie. At the time of its release in 1990 nearly all the actors were virtually unknown. But Tsilla Chelton gives a flawless performance and it is a delight to see Isabelle Nanty subduing the tough octogenarian.If we make an exception of some little weaknesses Florence Quentin the scriptwriter has forgotten to delete a few clichs linked to old people and there are some predictable sudden new developments you come out elated of the projection of Etienne Chatiliez's intelligent and malicious second movie. He passes us on the pleasure he took in shooting this story. A really funny movie and there's no reason to deny oneself of it.".

There are some very beautiful women in the film including the young nurse in the hospital.

	schema:headline " Imagine a whole movie about Nancy Soprano...";
	schema:reviewBody "A slight eventually monotonous fable that is frequently very very funny. Its use of the medium may be rudimentary and its general conceit  an old woman is a real pain to her family  hardly complex but there is a real pleasure in seeing sheer unwarranted nastiness in action.  Tatie Danielle is the kind of wearingly negative OAP we all hope we'll grow up into.The movie starts with Danielle being generally unpleasant to her equally elderly servantcompanion Odile in a monstrous parody of the BarbieMabel relationship in THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN.  They share a large house outside Paris  Odile doing all the chores to a chorus of ingratitude and hostility Danielle accusing her of senility and thieving .  A short visit from her nephew JeanPierre's family inspires in Danielle the desire to live with them in Paris and fortuitously or is it? Odile meets with a fatal accident cleaning the chandelier on a rickety chair.  Danielle sells her house shares the money with her nephew and spinster niece Jeanne to ensure moving in with the former.Here she is an absolute horror refusing to eat at dinner insulting JeanPierre's wife Catherine's cooking and looks kicking the dog deliberately losing the youngest child in the park.  The family refuse to believe she is mean because of her financial generosity but the barrage begins to wear.  Just before they intend to holiday in Greece with Danielle staying with Jeanne the latter is dumped by her boyfriend when she announces her pregnancy JeanPierre suggests she accompany them a helper must be found for Danielle.Outraged Danielle ups her offensive.  She begins to overeat to get sick and throws water on the bed feigning wetting.  In a brilliantly farcical sequence she disrupts her nephew's dinner with friends by turning on the TV at a blaring volume begging for food and visibly defecating in her nightie. Eventually the family find a minder Sandrine and set off.  But Sandrine refuses to take any nonsense and after a power struggle and touching thawing  leaves Danielle to spend a last night with her American boyfriend. Left alone Danielle deteriorates lets the apartment go to pot and sets it on fire.  A national outrage ensues over this perceived abandonment and Danielle becomes a celebrity while the family are taken to court for negligence.  Her fraud is revealed though and she ends up in an old folks' home...TATIE is very reminiscent of Renoir's masterpiece BOUDU SAUVE DES EAUX in which a tramp rescued by a kindly bourgeois wreaks havoc on his benefactor. Danielle for all her unpleasantness is a subversive presence disrupting complacent bourgeois domesticity telling hard truths.  The family aren't vile moneygrabbers and despite some grotesqueness are an essentially decent lot.  They are the new France boasting shiny apartments with all mod cons and bright colour schemes tolerant liberal attitudes one son is a gay dancer dinner parties trips to Greece.  Their only crimes are pretentiousness homogeneity note the similarity of their names and self satisfaction but they are hardly Bunuellian monsters.Danielle is the France they'd like to forget reminder of a colonialist and collaborationist past.  Her childlessness is linked to sterility and the pinched nature of her character her husband died 50 years ago just before the Fall of France?  He is a seeming image of French glory and military prowess undermined by his comic looks.  She is a past that refuses to be suppressed and her power reveals the fragility and superficiality of bright modern consumerist France how easily it can descend into chaos and fragmentation.  Catherine becomes a bag of nerves JeanPierre convenes Mafialike meetings to discuss family crises.TATIE is very brave in never selling out on the character of Danielle who in Hollywood would surely be reduced to mush.  There is as much ridicule as pathos in her conversation with her dead husband and her growing affection for the only character who won't cow before her is disabled by a lack of human sympathy and insight.  We love Danielle precisely because she is so unbearable a vile Id that cannot be swept away.  Tsilla Chelton's sublime performance a mixture of evil moroseness regret and childish mischief keeps the film watchable although by the end one has probably had enough.  The coda is delightful though rejecting cosy ideas of moral regeneracy.  The style is more subtle than it first appears with its plays of light and space serving to suffocate Danielle in her environment and there are some pleasant if conventionally mild surreal long shots involving an adorable soontobebetrayed dog.".

How refreshing then to see a truly great black comedy concerning a common but underexplored comic theme the evil manipulative grannie a woman whose best years are far behind her and whose only remaining purpose in life is to try to drag everyone else down to her level of misery by cynically exploiting their naive pity and sympathy sort of a onewoman Religion of Peace. As the director said in interviews at the time every family seems to have a Tatie Danielle. While the Australian television series Mother and Son was based on a similar premise Mother and Son wanted to make the characters ultimately sympathetic whereas Tatie Danielle has no such agenda. Consequently Tatie Danielle goes much further and is therefore much funnier. You could not have picked a better actress for the role than Tsilla Chelton. Her facial expression combines to perfection pure malice feigned helplessness and impish glee and the film largely succeeds on the strength of her acting. This is a mustsee comedy especially in company with your elderly manipulative female relatives. If you enjoyed this film do see the equally excellent Baxter made just one year later another highly original French black comedy albeit less funny and MUCH darker.".

	schema:headline " Tatie Danielle or the brandname for all grumpy yet lovable old women of the world..";
	schema:reviewBody "You don't know her but she already hates you. And you better believe it. One of the film's most memorable shots is a masterstroke of silent comedy in a park two old ladies are sitting on benches one of them is grumpily eating a cake the other one visibly amused smilingly salutes her. The grumpy one immediately replies by sticking out her tongue and making such a childish grimace the smile immediately turns into disgust. That's Tatie Danielle.She indeed hates everyone except her beloved deceased husband a man whose only relic is a majestic portrait of his glorious squinting face cleverly representing our perspective as viewers as she spends her time talking to him and sharing her intimate feelings. Since he's the person she truly loved she can afford to be sincere with him and leave the rest of the time for her treacheries her lies and manipulative acting. This is what makes the late Tsilla Chelton's performance so great is that there are two levels of acting she's playing an old woman who plays with people's emotions a master of emotional intelligence who didn't need Daniel Goleman for that. Still what a heartless bitch! We discover her as she torments her surprisingly obedient and equally old too servant. When she praises her good health saying I'll die before you Tatie Danielle retorts dryly I hope so as if it was the least God could do to her. Fate proves her right anyway as she dies a few days later and what a death asked to clean a chandelier she lamentably fell off the ladder. Tatie Danielle sheds no tears she only understands that she doesn't need to play the miserable rhapsody to her greatnephew Eric Prat and his well meaning wife Catherine Catherine Jacob she'll finally invade their privacy such a small price to pay for the future heirs no?In fact no for even in the sweetest and most patient environment Tatie Danielle behaves like a spoiled brat except that she's got the benefit of the age and long years of human nature study behind her. And that is the film's most refreshing aspect to finally I want to say let an old person behave badly oblivious to the hurt feelings of the beloved ones not even the smaller ones. The poor little boy can't even show his drawing and is pushed outside her room before she locks the door. Later they go outside and she accidentally loses him before getting back home. I wasn't even sure I wanted to laugh. The film would feature a similar toomeanfor laughs moment I don't dare to spoil.And the middleact is just too delightful for words and yes watching Tatie Danielle tormenting the Family especially the constantly sobbing Catherine pretending to hate basil or to stuff herself with food so she can better vomit at night to ruin a nice evening with guests by turning on TV asking for some food in the most miserable way and getting off the chair by showing an ugly stain on her pajamas hence inspiring one of the guest a commentary on the same level as De Gaulle observing Petain's downfall after the Liberation the old age is a ship wreck. What comes later will provide some interesting insights on Tatie Danielle's personality indirectly answering the comment.Following their friends' advice the couple travels to Greece for summer holidays. Sandrine a housekeeper will take care of Tatie Danielle who's ready to put her down underestimating this big blueeyed plump blonde superbly played by Isabelle Nanty the cigarette vendor in Amelie. Tatie Danielle refuses to get up to eat in the kitchen she spills water on bed but Sandrine won't have it. She lets her sleep doesn't serve her when time is past and takes her stolen money back  their psychological duel reaches its pinnacle when coming back from a messy toilet Sandrine gives Tatie Danielle one hell of a slap. Tatie Danielle has found her match and for some reason we're not surprised when later the two become friends.That's because the film carries the signature of directorwriter Etienne Chatillez whose films always work as powerful social commentaries beyond the comedy aspect. His previous hit was Life is a Long Quiet River which was about of class struggle with the case of two exchanged babies as a backdrop. Tatie Danielle is the living proof that it's precisely because old age is a ship wreck that the only strength that is still viable is the power of being a little mean spirited manipulative and greedy of not turning back a smile that's also part of human nature. It's more respectful toward old people not to make their gentleness and smiles obvious. Tatie Danielle needs this strength and only when she finds it in Sandrine she reveals her good side.With the other persons it's another story. In a retiring house an old lady who's been bullied by her and constantly prevented from watching TV with her comes happily with her daughter who just brought pastry. Later the old lady comes back and finds Tatie Danielle devouring the cake she says isn't my daughter nice? Yes but she's quite ugly a moment with the same comical impact as the park scene only with words. That's the comedic merit Tatie Danielle a comedy that also hits a sensitive chord as 'Tatie Danielle' has became a brandname for grumpy old female parent we all know and have a 'Tatie Danielle' in our family. And the film shows something subtle but very revealing about human nature we're attached to mean persons? Why? Maybe because we subtly admire them and the way they stick to themselves and succeed in whatever they try. There's indeed something strangely and appealing about this lady. After all why would we come to see someone who from the tagline already hates us?".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that I don't like this film. I love French films because I think they are more in depth thoughtprovoking and spend more time developing relationships between the characters. Unfortunately Tatie Danielle is cruel and mean. She criticizes everybody but herself. She makes everybody else's life worse than hers by her actions. The way she treats people including the old woman who cared for her in the beginning of the film is exceptionally cruel when it causes her death. She moves in with unsuspecting relatives who have two young sons. One son is obviously homosexual but the parents either ignore it just turned a blind eye to it. Not Tatie Danielle! You can imagine what she has to say and do. Just look what she does to the family pet dog. Anyway she finally meets her match in the caretaker assigned to her when the family takes a muchneeded Greek vacation for a month. If only Americans could take monthlong vacations how I envy the French. Anyway they get along until she has to leave her. Then Tatie Danielle gets famous for her poor treatment by getting national sympathy. When she's not in the old folks home after that incident she is away with her caretaker somewhere. I don't know. I think Tatie's cruelty is just too much for me or anyone.".

She moves in with unsuspecting relatives who have two young sons. One son is obviously homosexual but the parents either ignore it just turned a blind eye to it. Not Tatie Danielle! You can imagine what she has to say and do. Just look what she does to the family pet dog. Anyway she finally meets her match in the caretaker assigned to her when the family takes a muchneeded Greek vacation for a month. If only Americans could take monthlong vacations how I envy the French. Anyway they get along until she has to leave her. Then Tatie Danielle gets famous for her poor treatment by getting national sympathy. When she's not in the old folks home after that incident she is away with her caretaker somewhere. I don't know. I think Tatie's cruelty is just too much for me or anyone.";

I have to say when i say evil i don't mean Disneytype evilbutallrightunderneath evil. I mean truly evil.Odile dies after falling off a ladder cleaning the chandelier Tatie Danielle bugged her about for ages Tatie Danielle moves to Paris to live with her nephew his wife and his two sons one an innocent little boy the other a homosexual teenager. Tatie Danielle in the guise of being a frail old lady starts to make life hell for this family as well doing things such as abandoning the younger son in the park and wetting herself during a dinner party.Realising that Tatie Danielle is truly evil her nephew decides that when the family goes to Greece on holiday instead of his sister looking after Tatie Danielle as planned he will hire another helper instead.Tatie Danielle tries to carry on her old tricks with the new younger helper but she soon finds she has met her match.This film has a very dry humor and is extremely entertaining to watch. The acting is also of a high standard. As a British person living in France i watched this film in my french class at school without any subtitles and we all agreed that it was a good film. Don't be put off by the fact it is in French and you might have to read subtitles if you don't understand French. Just remember in France most of the films have come from America or Britain and the French people have to read subtitles a lot more! I would particularly recommend this film if you are learning French.".

After the death of her putupon housekeeper which may or may not have been an accident the curmudgeon is taken in by her kindly trendy Parisian relatives  a fertile ground for her spiteful venom where she reigns with aplomb. She will not entertain raw fish in lime juice kiwi salads and cheese as starters and instead satisfies herself with making her hosts' lives hell whether its by abandoning a wee lad in the park or berating an ageing female relative on her lack of suitors.Chatilliez is abandoning traditional age clichs and puts the view instead that old girls like Tatie Danielle don't think twice about knocking whatever unfortunate over with some withering putdown because to be honest about one's feeling is important. To smile put up with other people's ludicrous requests and unreasonable behaviour for the sake of avoiding embarrassment and fitting in to polite society are perhaps the root of much discontent in society these days. For example wellmeaning but dim wife of the family can only acknowledge her burden in furtive whispers to which he family can only meekly agree.Instead of confronting this cackling chippan of evil they flee to Greece for a month leaving Tatie with a nononsense young matron.

In most countries people would soon suss out Tatie for the Gorgon she is but this being Paris she's treated as the hard doneby old lady.It's at this point the film really comes into its own as a nasty piece of work. Tatie remains a dangerous element someone we laugh but heaven forfend you'd ever want to meet her in real life. The family their kindness considered are emotionally palsied and stilted in their middleclass ways.

A lot of his movies fit those categories.Washington plays a preacher's kid and its nice to see he has such respect for him.So many times Hollywood portrays fathers and especially clergymen in a bad light. John Lithgow is the villain and is such a crazy overthetop loon he's fun to watch. There are no lulls in this story yet the action scenes weren't overdone. It gets predictable in the end but I like the analogy in the film to the classic movie White Heat.I was sorry to see a few things once again white people are all the bigots Lindsay Wagner television's nice lady of the past now using very profane language here and looking hard.Overall this sometimes looks like a B action film more than a classy one but it's still an interesting crime film that sports a few different angles. It may not be one of Washington's betterknown efforts but it is still entertaining.".

Do juries really buy into bashing the defense attorney personally and do they allow DAs to jump around the courtroom waving his hands in the air like a madman and screaming like a girl? Is it possible to goto a parole hearing tell a man on the parole board you are going to have sex with his wife and his daughter AND HIS DOG and then have 3 prisoners just magically bust up in there with power drills and electric saws with no plugin around and kill everybody then make an escape on a van filled with books for sale? I mean cmon when do you want me to stop? I am able to suspend disbelief for a film in many cases but then there is this fine line between entertaining and just plain ridiculous. The only reason this movie gets a 4 is because the acting was exceptional.

Denzel Washington in a full maniacal Die Hard mode is Nick Styles a maverick cop who is framed fro murder after Blake Lithgow in electric psycho mode escapes form prison seeking revenge on Styles the man that put him on cold seven years ago. The pace is really fast the situations are extreme and the movie even manages to include some over the top twisted violence. Sure it has the very same conventionalisms and clichs of every other action movie Styles partner dies et al but still Ricochet goes over the average thanks to bravura performances by the two leads and some damn fine action sequences and camerawork.But now Russell Mulcahy has stepped into oblivion and John Lithgow has become somber family fodder in mind numbing sitcoms about aliens and rock.".

John Lithgow's performance is suitably deranged Kevin Pollack provides solid support nice impression in the early stages.

	schema:headline " A pulsepounding firstclass thriller!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm really glad I caught this flick on the Action Network because this is one way cool movie!  The excellent performances by the two main actors is alone worth watching.  Denzel is great at whatever he does.  As for John Lithgow...I am not exaggerating when I say he plays the most terrifying villain in movie history!  His cold stare alone sends shivers down my spine. He plays the kind of coldblooded murderer that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe.  This movie proves Lithgow's versatility as an actor  He can play the lively farcical Dick Solomon on 3rd Rock from the Sun as good as he can a coldblooded serial killer.  The plot is full of twists and turns and I didn't lose interest for a minute!  I felt Denzel's pain and anguish as he would try to convince everyone around him that Lithgow was still alive and abducted him and no one would believe a word he said.  I wouldn't normally regard any movie with Ice T in the cast as great but I'll make an exception this time around.  Aside from some laughably bad dialogue this film is absolutely excellent and is definitely one of the best actionthrillers I've ever seen!  I said it before and I'll say it again You gotta check out Lithgow's performance in this movie!  Ricochet is a MUSTSEE!!!!My score  9 out of 10".

	schema:headline " SPOILERS The filmmakers can richochet this one off their heads then maybe they'll realize what a bad idea it was...";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSThere is one serious problem with Richochet. It is not good.I say this with tongueincheek because one of the fundamental rules of being a film reviewer is to never say that you do not like a film but rather why you do not like a film. The problem with Richochet is that I just don't like it and I can't always tell why. Perhaps because it is made up of recycled film cliches that got old the millionth time they circled around as something fresh. I may never know. But I'd rather not know than sit through Ricochet again.The film opens with an establishing shot. What does it establish? Pretty much nothing but here's what I gather. It sets up star Denzel Washington as a rookie patrolmen Nick Styles at a small fair. He stops madman Earl Talbot Blake John Lithgow from killing a hostage by shredding off his clothes. A reason for women to see the film? Probably.An amateur photographer videotapes the dramatic collar and sells the tape to a Los Angeles television station and they become interested in Styles.Seven years later Styles is a happily married assistant district attorney well positioned to enter the local political arena. He is the father of two and his newest project in mind is focused on building a children's center under the Watts Towers. Cliche no. 1 Set up good guy as a good nice guy. In the meantime Blake Lithgow has been growing progressively more loony in prison where he has joined an Aryan pride group. Here's the catch He's not racist. He's just trying to get out of prison with a fiendish plot. Once out he drops the White Ones and fakes his death so that he can commit himself full time to making Styles' life a living beep.Ricochet borrows and borrows and borrows and borrows and after that it borrows some more. Here is a more complete List 'o Cliches1. Bad Guy gets locked up in jail by Good Guy and plans revenge.2. Good guy has good life until Bad Guy comes back into the picture.3. Bad Guy sets Good Guy up for something he didn't do in this case sleeping with a prostitute and Good Guy fights back by getting DrugSniffin' Drug Lord to help him. 4. Showdown on top of a multistory building in which Good Guy is about to die when Drug Guy comes to the rescue with his band of Cool Dawgs.5. Happy sappy predictable ending resulting in Bad Guy's death.That sums the film up. You're probably thinking that there has to be more to it but in all honesty everything else in it is a bunch of borrowed cliches too. All underlying tidbits are borrowed flaws cliches that worked the first or second time around but don't work the millionth time.I love Denzel Washington. I think he's a great actor and I always enjoy his performances.I love John Lithgow's screen presence as a villian. And y'know what? I must say it worked here. There were some scenes where I was held in awe with a sick feeling in my stomach the scene with Lithgow and Washington's daughter. But other than the two main actors being good the film fails on most levels. And furthermore the actors themselves didn't seem to strike any sense of chemistry between each other which is essential for a film like this even if they are enemies.Ricochet comes off with mixed credentials in that it's directed by Russell Mulcahy the man held responsible for Highlander and written by Steven E. de Souza who wrote the screenplays for 48 Hrs. the Die Hard films The Running Man and Commando. So what exactly went wrong here?Well here's what I put together.The copbuddy bit with Denzel and Kevin Pollack is borrowed from 48 Hrs. The battle between Lithgow and Washington which ends in a battle on a tower comes straight from Die Hard while the idea of a man taking on an army of disbelievers or bad guys is rippedoff of Commando. I wonder if Steven realized he was rippingoff his own work so much while he wrote this script.1.55 stars John Ulmer".

Hasn't anyone else noticed that he plays every single role he gets regardless of its dimensions exactly the same? Unlike other actors who do this such as Russell Crowe or Jack Nicholson he cannot even do it in an interesting way.One thing this film does have going for it is the violence which was graphic enough to get the film an Rrating in Australia during a period when the OFLC was a touch more relaxed but unfortunately there is not enough of it to make the film interesting to watch as was the case in Virtuosity another steamer in which Washington is outacted by the pot plants.I used to enjoy Ricochet as a guilty pleasure but after seeing Denzel Washington get the highest of accolades for a film that was out of theatres here almost as quickly as it was released I won't be watching it again.

	schema:headline " Underrated tightly constructed revenge pic that comes back to bite you";
	schema:reviewBody "This is probably the only R rated film Denzel ever did and is one of those films that does take me back. The great titled Ricochet has a smartly constructed story which can't be faulted. Revenge has never looked so good. Lithgow plays one of his best baddest roles as a guy Denzel puts away after a slick takedown of the wanted criminal where Denzel's promoted to a much better life of riches outside of being a cop an overnight success. How this has angered Lithgow is immeasurable. He escapes and puts his diabolically constructed foolproof plan of ruin on Denzel that includes drugging him getting videotape on him having sex with a hooker who gives him the clap where he's finally reduced to a mental wreck by the psychotic mastermind. Ricochet is stylish too but is so cleverly constructed in one of the best revenge scenarios I've ever seen where the only thing that can take down Lithgow's plan is Denzel killing Denzel. Ice T who plays a bad guy relative of Denzel's who helps in Denzel's plan to outwit Lithgow while also bringing some rapping lyrics though was really wasted or forgotten in the fact that he wasn't really needed in this film. An Impressive film directed by Aussie's Russell Mulcahy Razorback Highlander fans of Denzel's should view it and also if craving revenge it's a bonus Lithgow a villain here who can't be dead enough. What a surprise is Lindsay Wagner turning up in this as a police commissioner trying to help Denzel get a grip on his luckless predicament at the hand a mastermind psychopath who has a leech of an assistant childlike who won't shut up. One thing you shouldn't do about this movie. Violence is at a minimum though it's images are strong.".

That is not to say that he is not good in all these films I mean he even won an Oscar for the tepid TRAINING DAY.  Perhaps his agent wanted Washington to diversify into different genres including successful action pictures .  The point of all this is is to establish a better understanding of why coming off a success with MO BETTER BLUES 1990 Washington would chose 1991's RICOCHET as a follow up project.  It is another example perhaps the most obvious of the trend I have discussed above.RICHOCHET opens with young cop Nick Styles Washington taking down a treacherous villain named Blake John Lithgow.  Well the sensational arrest leads to bigger and better things for Styles as for Blake he is plunged into a prison subbasement for gladiatorial games with the Arayan Nation.  One day Blake decides to escape from said prison and creates havoc in the life of his old nemesis Nick Styles through implausible machinations and deceit.  The ensuing tension begins to drive Nick Styles mad as Blake further mounts evidence to ruin Styles' careerfreedomlifefamily. As far as the plot I will stop there although the story is pretty formulaic and predictable.  There are no new revelations or twists in RICOCHET and the movie concludes with a ridiculous finale which finds both hero and foil talking and climbing.The role of Nick Styles gives Washington very little to do except to react to the evil devices employed by Blake.  One can feel the plot playing upon this character in his reactions and especially during his choices at the end.  John Lithgow as Blake hams it up and is over the top but that's probably just what the story called for.  Kevin Pollack still in transition from comedian to actor treats us to his Peter Falk impression something he has since ceased doing as Styles' friend.  IceT who also penned a song for the film shows up for a glorified guest appearance.The film has very little style thanks to director Russell Mulcahy who after HIGHLANDER II THE REAL McCOY this film and THE SHADOW has not helmed a major motion picture since the midnineties and might never again. Alan Silvestri adds some needed support with a pounding musical score although he basically variates his theme from PREDATOR.  There is just not many good things to say about RICOCHET.  So why did Denzel choose this film over any other at the time we may never know but one can't help to surmise that there might have been a more worthwhile production he could have become involved with. 210.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of three romance comedies along with In The Mood and Can't Buy Me Love that Patrick Dempsey starred in around '87 and '88 about a young guy who knows who he wants to be with he just can't seem to figure it out at first. Loverboy actually is a plot very similar to In The Mood because it deals with a young man wooing older women and eventually they teach him something about love that he will help appreciate a young girlfriend when he finds one. Loverboy concerns the story of hot shot Randy Bodek Dempsey. Things aren't going well. His girlfriend Jenny Nancy Valen thinks he's ashamed of her because he won't tell his parents that he's living with her. But Randy doesn't want to bring up livein girlfriends to his folks yet because they're about to be baffled by a near flunking report card. So needless to say Randy is on the brink with both his girlfriend and his parents. His dad refuses to pay Randy's tuition for the next semester so as Randy says I'm going to start me real life how hard can that be? But Randy is in for a rude awakening. What started out as a pizza delivery job at Senor Pizza turns into Randy's goal to earn enough cash to get back into school and patch things up with Jenny. Things aren't so simple once Randy meets Alex Barnett Barbara Carerra an elegant but mysterious woman who Randy spends some time with. Randy Bodek suddenly becomes the love doctor of Beverly Hills according to his goofy friend Sal because now he is being personally called on to deliver anchovi pizzas the codeword to the rich lonely housewives. It seems quite shallow but Randy's agenda hardly ever includes sleeping with the women. They just want a guy to spend time with them and get some affection from when their workaholic or cheating husbands have neglected them. Randy gets an unusual education in pardon the cliche what women want. It's a pretty funny movie because Randy has to hide his new reputation from his parents and nearly everyone else so it leads to some hastily investigated conclusions as to what Randy might be up to. Plus Randy a pretty wimpy looking guy must also hide from eager husbands looking to put the kid out of business just as soon as they can figure out what it is that is making their wives all of sudden cheerful. It's good stuff lazy Saturday afternoon type comedy with a good castPatrick Dempsey Barbara Carerra E.G. Daily Kirstie Alley Carie Fisher and my favorite Bernie Coulson he plays Sal. It is a funny movie about one guy's strange attempt to show his girlfriend that he cares about her. But in all honesty I would recommend watching 'In the Mood' first as that is the better of these two similar stories.".

This generation will never ever know what its like to have basic TV channels where you can pick up a used 50 dollar TV and still see old movies like this on just basic channels. If you are antenna worked correctly. But I guess its a trade off for a lot of these movies you can watch over with streaming and such. At least their are online and you don't have to wait for someone to show it.This movie is great and its great acting. It doesn't fall any of those old forms or new forms of plot. With exception of guy messes up with girlfriend and gets her back. But we are in treat on this one. Carrie fisher who is from star wars Princess Leia is fine her older age. Kirstey Alley as well. Both great female actors in their own right and they sell their characters. Something you won't find in many female actors these days. These two girls are not acting. The tone in their voice their sarcasm that is them. They aren't faking. I'm not going to go play by play over the plot like I do in most reviews you have to watch it. There is no action in this movie unless you consider a few punches thrown here and there. I really enjoyed this movie and till this day when I listen to some frank sinatra I still remember this movie. This movie honestly has a ferris buellers day's off feel to it. And I still like this one better. The female in that movie was a terrible actress. Oh by the way this movie was just about comedy and great acting. It feels like the director just got on set and said hey lets just let it rip and read from the script and just add your own mix into it.".

Loverboy accomplishes this wonderfully. If you ever got to live the carefree life of coming and going as you please while mom and dad paid the bills then you know that it just doesn't last forever. Patrick Dempsey is Randy Bodek a college student who flunks to the point that his dad won't foot the bill for college anymore. So...Randy works for Senor' Pizza as a delivery boy and long story short becomes the goto guy for the lonely wives in town to get a little...attention from. As a former pizza jockey I can say that although this never happened to me it did happen to someone I used to work with and subsequently got her pregnant which got her husband out for his blood. This movie takes me back to the 80's where Saturdays were made for goofing off.".

	onyx:emotionText "For anyone who has ever read my previous reviews you would know that my favorite movies aren't necessarily Oscarworthy but rather movies that take you to another time. Loverboy accomplishes this wonderfully. If you ever got to live the carefree life of coming and going as you please while mom and dad paid the bills then you know that it just doesn't last forever. Patrick Dempsey is Randy Bodek a college student who flunks to the point that his dad won't foot the bill for college anymore. So...Randy works for Senor' Pizza as a delivery boy and long story short becomes the goto guy for the lonely wives in town to get a little...attention from. As a former pizza jockey I can say that although this never happened to me it did happen to someone I used to work with and subsequently got her pregnant which got her husband out for his blood. This movie takes me back to the 80's where Saturdays were made for goofing off.";

Randy Bodek Dempsey is the Loverboy in this doped up teen comedy which isn't bad for what it is. Randy works at Senor Pizza but wants to make more money to impress his girlfriend Jenny Nancy Halen. He scores older women to make extra cash on the side. Comically he services women like Dr. Joyce Palmer Alley Monica Fisher and Kyoko Kim Miyori. Randy's newfound popularity is the talk of the town and people start to look into it with ensuing hilarity.

But with all this action aren't husbands bound to find out and be very upset? Also with the money he is collecting it looks like Randy will be headed back to college. What in the world will he tell his girlfriend if she still loves him? As one of Dempsey's first big roles this is a charmer with plenty of laughs. Yes the subject matter is somewhat risqu which will not please everyone. Even so most viewers will appreciate the fine cast the nice setting the great costumes and the goforbroke attitude. No its not very sophisticated and has a good deal of crude humor. But all in all this is truly an oldie and mostly goodie.".

As the misunderstandings pile up so do the awkward physical antics of Dempsey. This is in fact the only thing that I think took away from the abundant charm of this movie. He was in my opinion too over the top with his physical acting. I'm referring some of the scenes where his stunts were not necessary like the lawn chair scene by the pool???? Then he returns to the restaurant looking for Jen and he vaults off the counter. It was funny when the Japanese woman threw him but enough already! Its too cartoonish and forced. The director took too many liberties here and took away from what could of been much better comedy.".

All in all it was top notch acting all around and that is seldom to see in an actionthriller. Usually it is the lead man or woman that carries the movie on hisher shoulder.And the story went in so many different directions that I was kept on the tip of my toes for all of the movie.The script was very tightly written the pace never dulled and the foreboding atmosphere brought forth by magnificent use of camera and lighting went as a red thread through it all. It made me believe this was something it was not.The reason I am giving Empire of The Wolves a strong 8 instead of a pure 10 is because of the scientific mumbo jumbo. It was the only part that seemed a little off. It was just a bit too much science fiction like. Now i love a good science fiction flick as much as the other guy but it did not quite fit in here i feel. They should have come up with something a bit more realistic. It isn't that easy to mess with memories.And yes i know that it probably were made that way on purpose to throw the watcher off the scent as was certain other unrealistic elements in the movie that I won't go further into. But i feel they fit better with the mood of the movie.Anyway if you haven't seen Empire of The Wolves do it as soon as you can. Because this is still a seriously well made movie. It is a shame it has such relatively low rating on the IMDb. It deserves better.Paladin Steelbreaker".

It is visually attractive and atmospheric. It is absorbing and there is not a dull moment in it.The plot is a mix of serial killer movie extreme political thriller crazed Nazi doctor movie secret antiterrorist police movie medical science fiction and old copyoung cop partner movie. But they mix all this stuff up together quite enjoyably.

The actor playing the young cop acquits himself well. The cast of villains and victims is convincing and compelling. The dialogue is good quality and there are twists and turns aplenty. Keeps you guessing until the last scene.We are taken on a wild and dark and violent ride through the grim underworld of human traffickers in the Turkish slums of Paris at least I think it was Paris.Anyway whoever made this movie really set out to entertain an audience.

If I compare the quality of this film with similar Hollywood thrillers then it's no doubt one of the best and a must see for all fans of this genre.

I hope there will be soon another one. I don't know why this movie is underrated on IMDb with actual 5.4 but I give with my wife a solid 7.510. If I compare the quality of this film with similar Hollywood thrillers then it's no doubt one of the best and a must see for all fans of this genre. I am a little disappointed why this excellent thriller didn't get enough attention at the theaters and even me discovered it accidentally in the film dates of Jean Reno.";

This is a highly mysterious and cerebral thriller  filled with plot twists  including a spectacular denouement in its final part . The main premise is the following  various slashed female corpse of immigrants show up and two detectives to investigate it and to chase a serial murderer . This original as well entertaining premise is overspread across the movie adding some brief conventional pitfalls . Along with the astonishing crimes is developed an intrigue about women exploitation  illegal immigration and drug smuggling . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action  surprises  fierce combats  shootouts  and groundbreaking struggles . Seven atmosphere and style psychological mystery  being decently directed  though hard to follow . The only scenes that used CGI are when Jean Reno falls down spiral ladder at the graveyard with CG stairs  bricks  rocks surrounding him . The cast is frankly fine  such as Jean Reno who gives a good acting as a dark retired Police Inspector JeanLouis Schiffer . This one belongs to the last period in his long career playing strong cops or mobsters as Antigang 22 bullets Armored wasabi and especially Crimson Rivers and Crimson Rivers 2 Angels of the Apocalypse and TV series Jo. And nice Jocelyn Quivrin as twofisted young detective as well as Arly Jover as unsettling girl who suffers severe headaches and glimpses of records . Special mention for Laura Morante as a cunning psychiatrist . The picture is pretty well  though sometimes complex and it has a lot of turns . However  being entertaining for its continuous suspense . Dark and rainy cinematography in Seven style by Michel Abramowicz . Strange and moving musical score fitting to action  including oriental sounds from Turkey . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios  including Paris  Istanbul  Uchisar and especially Cappadoccia Turkey . This stirring film was lavishly coproduced by producers Andrew Colton  Patrice Ledoux  Francesco Pamphili and professionally realized by Chris Nahon  though it has some flaws and gaps . Filmmaker Nahon establishes his signature style of kineticallypaced storytelling through sumptuous imagery  leading to international critical acclaim . Chris Nahon was born in France  he is a good director and writer known for Empire of the wolves 2005  Blood the last vampire 2009 and Kiss of the dragon 2001 . Rating  610  passable and acceptable .

They don't wear such silly ninja like dresses or don't live in Arabic environments as seen at the end of the movie.

The players' Turkish was also so funny that I had considerable difficulty in understanding what they were speaking. The story as an actionthriller movie besides the Turk theme was also unbelievable  How can Turkish mafia know very good french and know little Turkish? Sorry for all people who gave their energy for such a bad movie. The silly big head sculpture was another flaw in film. What was that?  Something seem to be mixed with Congo movie or king Kong??  Just awful work. Sorry. ".

When Nerteaux one of the cops asks his buddy Schiffer during one of the many unmotivated fights of the movie Could you explain this chaos to me? members of the audience will nod in agreement as that is what you want to ask the makers of this movie from the first minute on. The various pieces of the plot don't fit together the soundtrack does not at all contribute to the suspense the movie should produce. Last not least in order to symbolize criminalism and brutality and for the deflection of sympathy the movie uses Turkish people and Turkish nationalism. I do not want to discuss in how far the portrayal of the Grey Wolves is in any case realistic. What I find immoral is that the movie uses the fear of Arabs or Arabic looking people which is generated by 911 and terroristic assaults to tell its tale. By doing this the movies supports prejudices that should not be supported at all  even if it is only a thriller.".

	schema:headline " Above average action yarn with some nice twists";
	schema:reviewBody "I was pleasantly surprised by this film and have also wondered about the negative reviews. The movie has two problems 1 a problem of perception it starts off looking like a fairly routine mystery  police procedural but elements of other kinds of movies begin to trickle in as the plot reveals itself  which may have confused some reviewers wanting a pure genre piece 2 the plot IS a little hard to follow in places and depends on one important coincidence in particular. However the overall story makes sense in a gestalty kind of way and I don't think it's a killer issue. Oh and 3 the English dub which I turned on a couple of times should be confiscated and burned. It's a fairly good dub in syncing the lips but the voicing is as inappropriate as any bad dub of a Japanese film. For Pete's sake hire a mimic next time you dub an actor as wellknown as Reno.But I take real issue with the critics who labeled as ridiculous this or that aspect of the film. People have given high marks to James Bond films that stretched belief far more painfully. The real issue is that the French filmmakers aren't telegraphing the genre to the viewers.

	onyx:emotionText "I was pleasantly surprised by this film and have also wondered about the negative reviews. The movie has two problems 1 a problem of perception it starts off looking like a fairly routine mystery  police procedural but elements of other kinds of movies begin to trickle in as the plot reveals itself  which may have confused some reviewers wanting a pure genre piece 2 the plot IS a little hard to follow in places and depends on one important coincidence in particular. However the overall story makes sense in a gestalty kind of way and I don't think it's a killer issue. Oh and 3 the English dub which I turned on a couple of times should be confiscated and burned. It's a fairly good dub in syncing the lips but the voicing is as inappropriate as any bad dub of a Japanese film. For Pete's sake hire a mimic next time you dub an actor as wellknown as Reno.But I take real issue with the critics who labeled as ridiculous this or that aspect of the film. People have given high marks to James Bond films that stretched belief far more painfully. The real issue is that the French filmmakers aren't telegraphing the genre to the viewers. Good for them.Offsetting any problems is the wonderfully mysterious setup that ends in a real surprise about 40 minutes into the picture. That's the point when the picture shifts gears and we start seeing the actionadventure film which is quite well done.";

OK it was supposed to be an action thriller and in this direction it was not bad at all but with a little more work the idea of the movie could have been a lot more captivating.Conclusion the first hour of the movie is not as intense as the last.

Without a Paddle is a good example of what I'm talking about. Intern Academy was WAY funnier that that movie and WAY more people went to see that piece of crap. So how come so few people came out to see Intern Academy? I guess it's the usual Canadian thing where a Canadian Distributor thinks if they put fifty bucks into promoting something they've given it their best shot. Well too bad for Intern Academy because it deserved better. Starting with the title which put it in a league with Police Academy which has now produced 6 or 7 movies and as always is the case the farther down the sequel line they go the worse the movies become. So giving it that title was definitely a bad idea. I read an interview where Dave Thomas said he didn't like that title and it was forced on him by the distributor. Figures. Also where were the TV commercials? I didn't see a single one. And the ad in the paper was pathetic. I almost didn't go when I saw that tiny little ad because it made me think that they were ashamed of it. All in all the cast was good and although there were some gratuitous sex jokes and gory parts the movie had a nice likable tone to it. The girls were cute and the guys were okay I'm not gay. And the older doctors played by Thomas Dan Aykroyd Dave Foley and Maury Chakin were pretty good. I had a lot of laughs which is more than I can say for a lot of American movies that I have seen in the past few years. I would say go check it out but the movie is gone from the theaters already.

It certainly makes fun of being an intern and will make you laugh out a few times. What it isn't is a laugh a minute.Certainly the actors who play the set of interns the movie is mostly about all have bright futures ahead of them. Most notably Christine Chatelain Jane McLean and Peter Oldring. I'd be remiss if I didn't add the head nurse  Linda Boyd. Of course the three stars I named at the start of this review all did fantastic jobs. The others certainly had their moments of comedy.Everyone is excellent in their parts and while it's not an overly dynamic movie it's worth seeing with some popcorn when you're in a mood for light comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie will be dismissed for political reasons. There are a few laughs at the expense of characters that certain reviewers want to see only in an elevated light. But Intern Academy as a film improves as it goes along. The look is at first kind of washed out but eventually there are some more pleasing sets. I had heard this was shot on video but I could not tell as I watched it opening day. Purely I supported it because Dave Thomas deserves a hit and he has the same birthday as me. Also I appreciate his critical views of the media in his interviews for this film. I do think that he miscast himself a little bit in this film. Although Danny is shown in his requisite sunglasses and banging a drum in one scene he and Thomas should have switched characters. He might be more believable as a cold authority figure teaching students and rattling off lists of maladies whereas Dave Thomas is best as kind of a weasel or prankster or buffoon  which is especially evident when he runs. Dave Foley is right on the money as a smug egotistical heart specialist though it is jarring to see him in gray hair  especially because it is believable. The movie likes to wallow and the organ storage fight is a bit unbelievable as is the mouth examination scene which contains Maurey Chaykin's excellent cameo performance. That character could have been more central accidentally embarrassing people. Even though the girl who is embarrassed would have known better. Good enough and especially welcome as a Canadian film that is just funny and not pretentious.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. This film was killed by critics who were obviously expecting a lot more. Expecting not much at all because of those reviews it became apparent this movie deserved far better. Every joke was great the setup and executions were flawless. Dave Thomas' character was very strong not the idiocy I expected. The main cast of new interns all did a quality job and I'm looking forward to seeing them all in the future in other endeavors. There was some very intelligent sketching going on. It peaks near a moment when an intern must inform a family of failed operation resulting in death. This joke was long drawn out and agonizingly funny in a Fawlty Towers sort of way. Then it instantly shifts back to lowbrow slapstick. This can be disconcerting for some but they throw so many jokes at you so fast you quickly get right into their groove. This is polished comedy brought to you by the masters of the craft.What wasn't so great was the movie part. They spent the whole budget on the cast because the set and the costumes all looked C grade maybe even porn movie bad. Dan Akroyd as the partying hospital administrator had me thinking he was skimming hospital funds right from the beginning but that is not the case. His character needed just a few lines of justification for his lifestyle and it would be easier to identify with. Matt Frewer's character was interesting but bordering on unbelievable. They probably cut his believability in favor of outrageousness. If you are a fan of modern National Lampoon movies then you should see this one it's much better. This isn't a Classic but it's a great movie to put on when you've brought friends home after a night at the pub.".

Leaded by Sarah Calder Carly Pope the group spends the year learning how to become medical doctors in an environment of lots of confusion.I loved the unknown and underrated Intern Academy. The silly story s hilarious with many politically incorrect gags and jokes about urban legends in a public hospitals like for example the corrupt administrator that sells the equipment to raise money or the student with sperm in her mouth or the colostomy bag exploding in the face of an intern or the arrogant doctor or the lack of respect with the corpse of a John Doe or the man that arrives with a doll in his rectum or the promiscuous woman with herpes and other sexual diseases kissing the guy she has just met in the waiting room. There are many other jokes but one of my favorites is the stupid Ukrainian charwoman that unplugs the life support system of patients to plug the floor polisher. Another one that I laughed a lot is when the clumsy Mike Bonnert goes to the waiting room where three families are waiting news about their beloved relative and Mike commits a series of mistakes. The team of actresses is extremely beautiful and sexy and the actors are very funny. I did not feel the 98 minutes running time actually I expected to have more. I really recommend this movie for days where the viewer is down or upset to relax. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Os Estagirios The Interns".

I'm a proud Canadian because in part of the contribution these people have made to the entertainment industry in general.However this film is a black spot on their collective record. People will no doubt think that I didn't get it or I'm not taking it in the spirit it was intended. This couldn't be farther from the truth.Sadly this was quite possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen and one of the very few I have ever walked out of. I went to it on a free pass so I'm not even angry that it cost me money. I didn't walk out of it on the grounds that I was offended or upset but because I couldn't convince myself that there was any reason to stay. Normally if a movie is poor I would sit through it just to see how it ends. In this case because of a complete lack of plot there simply was no reason for this film to exist. Juvenile humour and gags so predictable it felt like you'd watched this as a 12 year old and were viewing it for a second time as an adult. Cardboard performances of 'cue card' dialogue reminiscent of a failing SNL skit. Interspersed with suddenly serious and gory bits of ER action. I could go on but I've already put more thought and writing effort into this comment than went into the film. Stay away from this rotting pile of exploded colostomy bags for the sake of the children.....".

Oldring and Zack Braff's characters are both quirky geeky type doctors who are definitely lacking in suave. Both narrate their shows in a satirical voiceover making for a hilarious view on life in a hospital. This is especially true in the case of Intern Academy where characters are in constant mishaps amid the womanizing director cynical supervisor terribly run surroundings and a heap of typical youngperson life problems.If you're looking for the next E.R. or a serious attempt at the portrayal of intern life this is not the movie for you.

If you like the T.V. show Scrubs and most people do then you will love Intern Academy too.This movie is kind of a cross between the Police Academy movies in a good way National Lampoon's movies and of course Scrubs.Some of the scenes are more adult oriented but this movie will have you laughing and more than once. This is definitely the best Canadian comedy of the year. I have also seen Ham and Cheese awful despite scenes with Dave Foley and Scott Thompson and this movie is so much better.Intern Academy also has a lot of recognizable Canadian actors and comedy performers who all turn in good performances.Buy this movie see this movie watch this movie!1010".

Do you want your surgeon to NOT wear a mask while operating? Yeah let's get a little spit on that heart to shine it up. Heck do you think it even feasible for a NONsurgical intern to magically do brain surgery? Something that takes at least 7 years for a neurosurgeon to master? And no it is NOT an EKG in the operating room it's a freakin' HEART MONITOR! Do a little homework and be creative with how you present those urban legends! Really I can forgive medical errors from nonmedical writers but aside from that this was just a stupid movie. I'd rather watch Dude Where's My Car again!".

It was almost like all the actors realized the movie was crap and just couldn't pull themselves together enough to actually try and act everyone in the movie had this perpetual smirk.So no intellectual entertainment but also no realism. Everything from how the hospital was run to how doctors interacted with each other and patients could be nothing more than some kind of extended joke. But it wasn't funny. So for those ER fan types this movie won't satisfy your doctor fantasies while hopefully getting a chuckle or two out of you.So all that is left is possibly comedic value. Surprise surprise...there was none. The jokes were so immature and superficial as to be simply irritating rather than funny. However I will concede that possibly this movie could be entertaining for children between the ages of 59.".

There are a lot of actors here mostly young whom you've never seen and they make up most of the screen time. You also haven't really seen Dave Thomas the actordirector in this film who makes for a stern doctorteachertype character for awhile since back on TV's Grace Under Fire. Dave Foley has wonderful acting in this film but you'll notice how dark and unfunny his character is throughout the film.The jokes in the film work about 70 of the time some are just corny or grossout humor that doesn't really work. Halfway through the film the direction turns this film into one of the newer National Lampoon's adventures complete with a stripper scene a horny staff of interns and a crazy office party for Christmas or something. There was a particularly ridiculous scene which was a 3 Stooges classic foodfight except replace food with human organs. There were also horrible props like the giant penis basically a dildo which was supposed to be one of the interns' actual penis...a little too lowbrow fake and gross for me. I thought Dr. Keller was awesome played by the Jim Careyish Matt Frewer who I've seen before.I thought the coolest thing about the film was the way it switched from a comedy to a drama in parts. It kept the action original and didn't stretch out the comedic bits. I thought it was funny that the DVD subtitles switch from English to Spanish about 54 minutes into the film as well although I'm sure that wasn't intentional. I also thought that it received a weak Rrating although there was significant talk of sex and all that between interns.I gave it a 710 stars. Go check it out if you don't mind new actors and different comedic direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Intern Academy 2004 Dir Dave Thomas  Cast Dave Thomas Dan Aykroyd David Foley Maury Chaykin Carly Pope Gross out comedy about interns completing training under horrid conditions. Humor ranges from a fight using human organs to a doll in someone's anal track. It dwells on difficulties based on experience. The humour is vulgar and seems pitched at the lowest common denominator. Screenplay had potential but the third act goes sour with sentimentalism which is almost always a deal killer in comedies. Dave Thomas directs and stars as the head doctor bent on failing the interns. As director he does have a sense of timing and originality but the characters are all one note types that never elevate beyond their initial flaws. Dan Aykroyd runs the hospital by selling equipment to pay salaries. Dave Foley plays an uptight surgeon. Maury Chaykin plays an instructor with a speech impairment. There are several veteran comedians who are somewhat underused that might have livened things up had the material been stronger. Given more focus they could have been interesting but they are just talented comedians thrown into material that is in worse shape then the patients that enter their hospital. It works only on its satire of medicine but as a story it fails miserably in terms of creating personalities as well as a plot that needs more than surgery to bring life to its pathetic existence. Score 6  10".

	onyx:emotionText "Intern Academy 2004 Dir Dave Thomas  Cast Dave Thomas Dan Aykroyd David Foley Maury Chaykin Carly Pope Gross out comedy about interns completing training under horrid conditions. Humor ranges from a fight using human organs to a doll in someone's anal track. It dwells on difficulties based on experience. The humour is vulgar and seems pitched at the lowest common denominator. Screenplay had potential but the third act goes sour with sentimentalism which is almost always a deal killer in comedies. Dave Thomas directs and stars as the head doctor bent on failing the interns. As director he does have a sense of timing and originality but the characters are all one note types that never elevate beyond their initial flaws. Dan Aykroyd runs the hospital by selling equipment to pay salaries. Dave Foley plays an uptight surgeon. Maury Chaykin plays an instructor with a speech impairment. There are several veteran comedians who are somewhat underused that might have livened things up had the material been stronger. Given more focus they could have been interesting but they are just talented comedians thrown into material that is in worse shape then the patients that enter their hospital. It works only on its satire of medicine but as a story it fails miserably in terms of creating personalities as well as a plot that needs more than surgery to bring life to its pathetic existence.

The Canadian government finally funding a movie that has no pretentious and boring art and instead is geared to a wide audience? Written and directed by funnyman Dave Thomas? I decided to check it out... though when I got the chance to see it for free since I have been burned by too many bad Canadian films.After seeing it I'm glad I didn't pay any money to see it.The problems with it are simple. First there are the movie's production values. Now I will admit that in recent years the production values of Canadian films have improved greatly. But there is still a lot to be desired in a number of them including those in this movie. While the movie doesn't look dirt cheap it has the look of a television drama instead of a feature film.The second and main reason why the movie doesn't work is simple IT ISN'T FUNNY. Dave Thomas used to be funny  what happened when he wrote and directed this movie? The theory I have come up with is the setting A hospital is a place full of pain suffering and death. It's still possible to find humor in this setting but it needs a steady and sure hand. Thomas doesn't seem to have the ability to find funny black comedy in this setting. When interns throw human organs at each other or vomit on corpses it isn't funny it's just gross.P.S.  I would like to comment on the inept marketing campaign TVA Films put forth when they put this movie in Canadian theaters. Not only did they release it in about half the theaters an American release usually gets but the promotion was lousy  I never saw a TV commercial for this movie despite all the hours of TV I watch. And in the newspaper ads they did not promote the name stars the movie had Thomas Dan Aykroyd Matt Frewer Saul Rubinek and Dave Foley instead promoting the noname members of the cast! The problem with the Canadian film industry is not just that the government funds very few movies that might attract an audience but when one does get made the government does nothing to push distributors to properly market and release the movies.".

The climax is a direct steal from POLICE ACADEMY but that's OK too. The actors playing the interns are likable enough and the females in the cast are all dropdead gorgeous and quick to get drunk and down and dirty and sometimes even naked which is the way I remember my student years working as an orderly at a midsize hospital.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I'd like to say that it's a shame this movie isn't out on DVD yet because I'd very much like to see some bonusmaterial on this one especially with all the talent that's been crammed into it.The plot is about two moronic musclebrothers Peter and David Paul who work for an angry boss flamboyantly played by the always mad and funny Richard Moll and they drive toxic waste across the USA in their 18wheeler. During their trip they hook up with a young woman Holly played by the beautiful Ari Meyers who has invented a groundbreaking new device which can control every mechanical item and turn it upside down make red lights turn green open locked securitydoors make a cokemachine spew out free soda and money etc.  of course she is followed by a bad man played by the recognizable comedian Martin Mull who wants to use her invention for evil purposes. Holly's friend Irene Marsh Claudia Christian from Babylon 5 also joins them and falls in love with one of the brothers. The two brothers are followed by an eager repoman called Sweeney playing very comically with lots of laughs by the otherwise more serious and frowning David Carradine in one of his most lighthearted roles.Also among the talented supporting cast are Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. everybody knows this guy at least as the President from Fifth Element and here he plays one of the brothers truckingpartners who has a Z shaved in his hair. Rafer Johnson famous athlete in his final movieperformance as Johnson also plays one of the brothers coworkers who won't drive toxic waste. Al Septien the writer of Leprechaun 2 and Candyman 3 plays a security guard. David Bowe who played Bob in Al Yankovich's UHF is also a security guard here.. JeanClaude Van Damme's wife Darcy LaPier is also in this movie playing a hot waitress who almost rapes one of the brothers. Famous German talk show host Thomas Gottschalk also plays one of the bad guy's henchmen and constantly gets beaten up by the brothers who mess with his ponytail. FURTHERMORE Yes there are more stars in this movie Michael Winslow the funny black guy from the Police Academymovies is also one of the brothers' trucking friends and he also does a few funny voicesaccents here although his part is so small and insignificant that he doesn't really get a chance to shine. And don't forget about the huge muscleman Tony Longo who's also in here somewhere..Well back to the plot The brothers drive across the USA with toxic waste and at the same time tries to save Holly from Dr. Bruekner. All the other characters in this movie are just there to make the runningtime reach a reasonable length for a featurefilm. The dialogue is sometimes slightly funny but mostly just dumb and dull. The highlights of the film is undoubtedly every scene with Richard Jaws Kiel who steals the whole movie. If he played the lead in a movie it would be the best movie EVER.. just look at Eegah!Conclusion The plot is lame the two stars are hideous and terrible actors the comedy is mediocre at best and there's no logic connected with anything that happens here either. BUT.. this is Jon Turtletaub's debut as a writerdirector so it has some value just for that fact alone.. and Jim Wynorski helped him make it too! And all these fabulous actors crammed together in one movie is also a very good selling point so I definitely think it is worth watching especially if you're under 15 I suppose..So let's get this movie on DVD soon!".

The two brothers are followed by an eager repoman called Sweeney playing very comically with lots of laughs by the otherwise more serious and frowning David Carradine in one of his most lighthearted roles.Also among the talented supporting cast are Tommy Tiny Lister Jr. everybody knows this guy at least as the President from Fifth Element and here he plays one of the brothers truckingpartners who has a Z shaved in his hair. Rafer Johnson famous athlete in his final movieperformance as Johnson also plays one of the brothers coworkers who won't drive toxic waste. Al Septien the writer of Leprechaun 2 and Candyman 3 plays a security guard. David Bowe who played Bob in Al Yankovich's UHF is also a security guard here.. JeanClaude Van Damme's wife Darcy LaPier is also in this movie playing a hot waitress who almost rapes one of the brothers. Famous German talk show host Thomas Gottschalk also plays one of the bad guy's henchmen and constantly gets beaten up by the brothers who mess with his ponytail. FURTHERMORE Yes there are more stars in this movie Michael Winslow the funny black guy from the Police Academymovies is also one of the brothers' trucking friends and he also does a few funny voicesaccents here although his part is so small and insignificant that he doesn't really get a chance to shine. And don't forget about the huge muscleman Tony Longo who's also in here somewhere..Well back to the plot The brothers drive across the USA with toxic waste and at the same time tries to save Holly from Dr. Bruekner. All the other characters in this movie are just there to make the runningtime reach a reasonable length for a featurefilm. The dialogue is sometimes slightly funny but mostly just dumb and dull. The highlights of the film is undoubtedly every scene with Richard Jaws Kiel who steals the whole movie. If he played the lead in a movie it would be the best movie EVER.. just look at Eegah!Conclusion The plot is lame the two stars are hideous and terrible actors the comedy is mediocre at best and there's no logic connected with anything that happens here either. BUT.. this is Jon Turtletaub's debut as a writerdirector so it has some value just for that fact alone.. and Jim Wynorski helped him make it too! And all these fabulous actors crammed together in one movie is also a very good selling point so I definitely think it is worth watching especially if you're under 15 I suppose..So let's get this movie on DVD soon!";

The whole movie revolves around two appropriately airheaded truck driving twin brothers who have to save a teen genius and the world's ultimate weapon from the clutches of the bad guys. The weapon? A device that looks like an otherwise ordinary remote control but can control virtually every electronic device.Of course the humor comes in when the lamebrained gymrat twins bumble around trying to defeat the baddies. As expected in any bmovie the humor is substandard and often crude. The Paul brothers play the role of the bungling duo pretty well. The movie also boasts a fairly decent supporting cast with Martin Mull from Sabrina The Teenage Witch Richard Moll from Nightcourt as the brothers' boss and of course Claudia Christian.In short Think Big isn't a bad movie for what it is and what it tries to be. Taken lightly this low budget picture's sophmorish humor and sexual innuendo can be entertaining for a day's rental. Just try to think as little as possible while watching it and the bmovie lover deep inside you will enjoy it.".

As can be surmised I decided to give the film a whirl as part of my ongoing marathon to commemorate the 10th anniversary from the passing of its male lead  Frank Sinatra curiously enough given his reputation as one of the foremost American singers he appeared in few vintage musicals over the yearsand its certainly a tribute to his acting talent that his nonmusical work often in hardhitting even groundbreaking films has tended to overshadow this more familiar aspect of his personality  at least on the silver screen! Anyway to get back to the film proper I found it quite engaging and its considerable length not overly taxing  and this to a large degree is thanks to the formidable star cast which apart from Sinatra included Shirley MacLaine Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan. The first two had already appeared together  albeit in dramatic roles  in SOME CAME RUNNING 1958 while the others had been wonderfully teamed in the same genre and a similar ambiance in GIGI 1958. Ironically both these films were helmed by a master stylist  Vincente Minnelliso perhaps Fox should have struck a deal with MGM to acquire his services for CANCAN  but given director Langs previous musical success with THE KING AND I 1956 they obviously thought he could do no wrong. The fact is that his handling is sterile and more accommodating to the Widescreen ratio than the necessities of the plot and characters  filming events from a distance and rarely cutting or even moving the camera this lazy approach which still landed him a nomination from the Directors' Guild Of America! is doubly frustrating when viewed on a small screen!! Apparently the production went through a lot of script changes Sinatras role reportedly wasnt even in the stage original to begin with! songs were dropped and replaced by other Cole Porter standards which dont really fit in such as Jourdans You Do Something To Me the rest of the soundtrack isnt particularly outstanding unlike that of GIGI for instance but a number of tunes are cleverly reprised sometimes with variations and by different characters during the course of the film. It was nice too seeing two worldrenowned singers with such different styles as Sinatra and Chevalier come together and having fun with it Chevalier and Jourdans roles then are virtual carbon copies of their GIGI characterizations  but its a formula that seems to work even if its not as central to the main plot this time around Jourdan having been relegated to The Other Man type.MacLaine did few musicals as well but her vivaciousness as a dancer and owner of an establishment which finds itself frequently in trouble with the law over the forbidden CanCan dance but who manages to charm the stuffy judge at the trial ensures that her numbers emerge as the shows highlights the Apache Dance the drunken recital of a vulgar song at her engagement party to Jourdan at the instigation of lawyer Sinatra who loves her but is unwilling to commit himself and the Garden Of Eden sequence intended to demonstrate that Sin wasnt invented in Montmartre  it was only perfected there!. Two other important figures though both severely underwritten are those played by Juliet Prowse and Frenchman Marcel Dalio as the nervous but devoted manager of the Bal De Paradis the latter was a versatile actor in his native land but he was stuck with this kind of unrewarding role during his long tenure in Hollywood! the former appears as a leading dancer at the club and MacLaines prospective rival  interestingly the two actresses physiognomies are strikingly similar  for Sinatras attentions a situation which is indirectly played upon during the aforementioned Garden Of Eden number apart from which theyre teamed for the climactic CanCan performanceto the predictable enthusiasm of the formerly disapproving head of a female Legion Of Decencytype group.In the end while this film cant be considered a classic musical as such it still seems to me to have been unfairly maligned  as some fantastic talent has been assembled in the service of a charming albeit unsurprising narrative to provide colorful if uninspired entertainment which the genre was capable of during its studiosystem heyday".

	schema:headline " Gigi and the Rat Packers meet Cole Porter";
	schema:reviewBody "After his greatest stage success KISS ME KATE Cole Porter entered the last decade and a half of his life with a track record of hit and miss musicals. It was not that he lost his abilities to compose great songs. It was that not everything he touched turned to gold.The gold of this decade was his music for SILK STOCKINGS his version of NINOTCHKA and his musical CANCAN. His misses included OUT OF THIS WORLD his attempt at a modern retelling of the Amphitryon myth from Greece. OUT OF THIS WORLD has entered the history of Broadway as a potentially great musical that was too advanced for its period. Apparently much of the musical involved homosexual as well as heterosexual sex in keeping with ancient Greek culture both forms of love were acceptable. Unfortunately they were not acceptable in 1950 New York City and one may add in 2008 California and elsewhere. Only one number from OUT OF THIS WORLD survived FROM THIS MOMENT ON. It got grafted into the film version of KISS ME KATE.It is a tradition that none of Porter's scores survived totally intact in Hollywood. Songs were dropped from films or pushed into others. So CANCAN has Let's Do It in the film score although it was not in the musical it was over thirty years old by that time and yet I LOVE Paris Porter's greatest anthem to the foreign city he adored above all others was dropped from the film. Still there is enough Porter in this film to appreciate his best work. And as was said in another review Sinatra's singing But It's All Right With Me to Juliet Prowse happens to be quite the best moment for old Blue Eyes in the film.The film tried to capitalize on the success two years before of GIGI by reuniting Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan from that film with Sinatra and fellow ratpackers Shirley MacLaine and Prowse. Set again in the France of the 1890s here we are not watching a young girl blossom into womanhood and win the man of her dreams but we are watching the sleazier theatrical world of the day in the Montmartre District. For MacLaine runs a dance hallbar that has the town in a tizzy due to the dancing of the forbidden cancan by the dance hall girls. MacLaine's partner is her lawyer and lover Sinatra. When a bunch of reformers cause a raid on the dance hall they just miss arresting Sinatra MacLaine and a corrupt or friendly jurist played by Chevalier. MacLaine has to appear in court and the judge there is Jourdan who is known to be incorruptible. He is but he falls for MacLaine. It enables Sinatra to beat the legal attack temporarily but it leaves MacLaine with a lovesick Jourdan to worry about.GIGI is not the only recent film that has an influence on CANCAN. The Montmartre area is where Toulouse  Lautrec and other painters of that period resided. The color of Huston's MOULIN ROUGE 1953 and the background of the cabarets Toulouse  Lautrec went to is evident in the film too. However there even is a little joke no pun intended. While singing the opening song Montmartre Sinatra is in the street and passes Toulouse  Lautrec holding one of his canvasses. Toulouse  Lautrec shows it to Sinatra who looks at it and says It'll never sell!The film follows MacLaine trying to get a commitment from Sinatra that will make their sexual relationship permanent but he is too independent. So she is slowly finding the interest of Jourdan a kind of refreshing alternative although she does suspect it just cannot work. Chevalier is pleased to see this troublesomely honest protg of his somewhat corrupted so that he won't interfere with the business at the dance hall but he realizes that Jourdan is serious enough to consider marrying MacLaine and ruining his career. Their duet Your Business is Your Business and My Business is Mine. is not one of the best recalled Porter tunes but it is a bouncy enough one and it certainly illustrates Chevalier's realization that what was previously a useful slip by Jourdan is now totally out of hand.The conclusion of the film is set in the dance hall where the puritan critics are given a demonstration of the sinful dance and discover it has a charm and excitement they had not expected. The dance sequence at the end was the only time that MacLaine a pretty affective dancer before she became an actress shared film dance time with Prowse. Juliet Prowse was a mediocre actress at best see my review of MONA MCCLUSKY her attempt at a sit com but she was a first rate dancer and the production number of her and MacLaine leading the CanCan is quite memorable. The number is a fine way to end the film and also for it to enter diplomatic history. As pointed out elsewhere on this thread Khrustchev was touring Hollywood when they were shooting CanCan and watched the dance number being shot. He did condemn the film as proof of the decadence of the west. However that did not prevent him from having his photo taken with Sinatra and MacLaine. I guess there is decadence and there is decadence.".

Just One of Those Things You Do Something To Me. And of course the book was sanitized by the Hollywood censors.Briefly the plot is a girl who's a Can Can dancer played by Shirley MacLaine has to choose between two men of the legal profession. Upright judge Louis Jourdan and less than scrupulous attorney Frank Sinatra. Maurice Chevalier is an older judge who knows all of them and presides over the film like an avuncular grandfather.The performers all do justice to the Cole Porter score and the best musical moment is Frank Sinatra's singing of It's All Right With Me. He's singing it to Juliet Prowse who was his main squeeze at the time. It's one of Sinatra's best musical moments on film a perfect mating of singer and song.I'm sure glad neither Sinatra or MacLaine attempted any kind of phony French accent. Sinatra tried a Spanish one in The Pride and the Passion and the results were hilarious.Shirley MacLaine before she came to Hollywood was in the chorus of CanCan on Broadway so she was a perfect fit for her part as Simone Pistache the cabaret owner where the illegal CanCan is performed.For reasons I don't understand a duet with Frank Sinatra and Maurice Chevalier singing I Love Paris was cut though it remained in the original cast album. Blockheads at Fox what were they thinking?It also would have been nice to have some Paris location shooting for this film it was all done at 20th Century's backlot where Nikita Khruschev paid a historic visit and said this was an example of western immorality and decadence.

	schema:reviewBody "Well CanCan is not a total loss but it's not a 10star gem of a movie either but  it IS entertaining but the biggest problem that I see with the film is that everyone looks like they're embarrassed to be in the movie with each other because no one is actually looking at each other when they're saying their lines.  Look at the scene where Shirley McClain is making up the story as to how Louis Jourdan was trying to overcome her sexually and the scene goes something like thisSHIRLEY  And I fought him and fought him and stuggled but what could a person do? MAURICE  embarrassed to say Uh  submit  of course! SHIRLEY  slightly glances at thim and them says loudly SUBMIT?The film just kinda lays there and doesn't do anything.  Come on  it's not Gigi!  It was really a reuniting of Louie and Maurice because of their hit movie Gigi and that's about where the uniting ends but there are some highlights to the film.  Shirley McClaine's apache dance with the guys while Louis Jourdan looks on is a great number and the Adam and Eve Ballet is quite good and Shirley's line before the ballet is wonderful when she says something like this  Be it known that sin may have been invented in the Garden of Eden but it was perfected in Monemart!It just seems like all they're doing in the film is walking through their dress rehearsal without putting any oomph into the acting and at the same time the some of the costumes are so tacky that they look like we did as kids when we played dressup as adults!  And look at the scene before Maurice and Louis sing Live and Let Live.  It looks like it was inserted on purpose so that they could have the opportunity to sing the song and the scene in which Maurice sings It Was Just One of Those Things.  Even that looks like it was inserted on purpose just to give him a chance to sing a song but the songs are great even though most of them were never in the original broadway play such as You Do Something To Me Let's Do It and It Was Just One of Those Things It's Alright With Me which is slow and a very boring rendition and oddly enough I Love Paris a duet between Frank Sinatra and Maurice Chevalier was deleted from the movie and only heard in the the original soundtrack album and the Oveture and beginning Credits of the video that is if you have the first video version of CanCan in which you get the Oveture Intermission Music and Exit Music with all the musical numbers letterboxed and why they deleted I Love Paris from the movie is beyond me since it was the hit of the show.  Again Hollywood has been known to do some dumb stuff!Juliet Prowse's big number Maids From France is quite good but it's obvious why she's in the scene with Frank Sinatra when he sings It's Alright With Me because at that time they were having an affair and I guess if it was alright with them it should be alright with us but later he would marry Mia Farrow and since Frank was Italian it was only obvious that his kids would call her UhMama Mia!Anyway I sure wish they would rerelease the original video version of CanCan or a whole widescreen version on D.V.D..  Other songs from the Broadway Show were deleted from the movie such as Never Give Anything Away AleVouZon which is only used in Shirley McClains apache dance as a melody There Is No Trick To A Can Can which is just used as a melody for the CanCan at the end of the movie and again even though they deleted a singing version of the hit of the play I Love Paris at least they use the melody of it in the Adam and Eve Ballet but Shirley McClains drunken version of Come Along With Me is delightful and here goes the insanity of Hollywood again at the end of the film when the PaddyWagon is pulling away with Shirley and Frank in it  the chorus is singing the last lines of I Love Paris!So  why didn't Louis get Shirley in the end?  Well it's obvious that she was in love with Frank Sinatra all the time but more than  that Once a Rat Packer always a Rat Packer!".

CanCan has Shirley both French charmers and Ol' Blue Eyes.Set in the 1800s when the cancan dance was forbidden in France because it was too risqu Shirley MacLaine decides to buck the system and allows her and her nightclub dancers show off their legs. Lots of dancing from choreographer Hermes Pan lots of pretty costumes lots of Cole Porter songs and a love triangle that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time CanCan is definitely one to see if you like old musicals. I've seen them all and while this one doesn't make it to the top shelf in my collection I'm glad I saw it. Many famous songs come from this movie including I Love Paris Let's Do It Just One of Those Things and It's All Right With Me so if you like any of those rent it during your next musicalfest weekend.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1960 when CanCan was released Frank Sinatra was at the top of his gamemost powerful performer in Hollywood 1 box office draw with Elizabeth Taylor at the dawn of his Rat Pack Leadership and he was making the best and some of the most popular records around. Those were truly Ringa Ding days and Sinatra as he stated in song had the world on a string. And it was then that CanCan came along.When you take a huge star hunt around for some little property that at least loosely fit's his screen persona put his name up in colored lights and try to make a lot of money by shouting '' Frankie's in this!!!!'' you have made what is known as a VEHICLE.Like there are good and bad authors insurance salesmen and hula hoop instructors there are both good and bad vehicles. This I am very happy to say is NOT a good vehicle. It is a MAGNIFICENT vehicle.The reason for it's greatness does not lie in Shirley Maclaine Louis Jourdan or even Maurice Chevalier although they are all quite good and entertaining.No. The real magic in CanCan comes from what Frank Sinatra can do with a Cole Porter song. Even though they stuck him in France in the 1800's he's still Sinatra the incomparable ringa ding ding cool the essential charm and star quality the cocky grin and blue eyes and of course that voice. THE Voice.Never would that voice be more perfect than in that scene in CanCan where he put away that lovable arrogance and gave one of the finest performances of his career with the aching tenderness of '' It's All Right with Me.It's no wonder Juliet Prowse who he sang it to proved it was certainly all right with her as well. Although that little romance like most of Sinatra's was not long to last the song's magic will last forever.Overall if this film did not star Sinatra it would still be fairly good. Shirley would be as cute and nutty as ever Louis Jourdan elegant though not amazing in either the vocal or ''cool'' departments and Maurice would be Maurice charming talented timeless. Then of course there are the CanCan numbers fabulous Cole Porter tunes and an entertaining story.WITHOUT Sinatra I would probably rate this about 8 and a half. But with the magic of IL' Blue Eyes making an unforgettable classic out of a pretty good picture CanCan get's an easy 10... and then some. Highly recommended.P.S For those of you who believe it's impossible to find a Sinatra fan under the age of forty I have just turned fourteen and have loved his music his moviesetc. for years. That's not surprising when you think about it. Why settle for today's idiotic trash when you can have the best? And that's all I've got to say.".

	schema:headline " Considering the talent this should have sparkled so much more";
	schema:reviewBody "'CanCan' from personal opinion is one of Cole Porter's best later musicals and there was so much talent involved in this film. It's just sad that something that should have sparkled like diamonds fell as flat as overegged souffl despite some very great things.There's more to the problem than it being a butchered treatment of the Broadway hit including a mangled rewritten story with an additional character to cater Frank Sinatra omitted songs and changes to lyrics. Pretty much all of the problems with 'CanCan' are to do with how it fared on its own terms which is while nowhere near one of the duds in musicals it's one of the classics either if anything a missed opportunity.Despite how this all sounds there is a good amount to like about 'CanCan'. The film is visually stunning opulently produced and photographed with spectacular gorgeousness. Porter's music and songs even with how they're treated most inexplicable being the lyric liberties in the title song the original ones are brilliant and part of what makes 'CanCan' one of Porter's better later musicals are still superb. Especially the very touching It's All Right With Me sung or crooned beautifully by Sinatra.Parts of the script has wit and charm especially with Maurice Chevalier. Chevalier and Louis Jourdan give the film's two best performances the former performing with a humorous twinkle and effortless charm and the latter having an urbane likability. Juliet Prowse also proves herself to be a wonderful dancer and the choreography and musical numbers are really where 'CanCan' really picks up in the interest value.Yet 'CanCan' despite the music Chevalier and Jourdan and the production values never makes one properly feel like they've been transported to late 19th century Paris. Part of it is to do with the mostly anachronistic and talky script especially in the courtroom parts that really dragged the film down pacewise and a larger part is do with the miscasting of the two leading roles. There is no denying that Sinatra sings beautifully with impeccable phrasing and breath control but he is too contemporary and completely fails to bring personality let alone any endearing traits to a total sleazebag of a character. Shirley MacLaine is also too American annoyingly shrill and doesn't look like her heart was completely in it.As a result of the numerous changes despite some moments the story suffers consequently the material needed more wit emotion and life than what the film provides. Sluggish pacing in the nonmusical moments and a rather too overlong length doesn't help. It's indifferently directed the Garden of Eden sequence despite great dancing and choreography is overblown and goes on for far too long and the ending with Simone's decision completely ringing false feels like a cheat.On the whole some definite great things but considering the source material and talent 'CanCan' should have sparkled so much more. 510 Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "'CanCan' from personal opinion is one of Cole Porter's best later musicals and there was so much talent involved in this film. It's just sad that something that should have sparkled like diamonds fell as flat as overegged souffl despite some very great things.There's more to the problem than it being a butchered treatment of the Broadway hit including a mangled rewritten story with an additional character to cater Frank Sinatra omitted songs and changes to lyrics. Pretty much all of the problems with 'CanCan' are to do with how it fared on its own terms which is while nowhere near one of the duds in musicals it's one of the classics either if anything a missed opportunity.Despite how this all sounds there is a good amount to like about 'CanCan'. The film is visually stunning opulently produced and photographed with spectacular gorgeousness. Porter's music and songs even with how they're treated most inexplicable being the lyric liberties in the title song the original ones are brilliant and part of what makes 'CanCan' one of Porter's better later musicals are still superb. Especially the very touching It's All Right With Me sung or crooned beautifully by Sinatra.Parts of the script has wit and charm especially with Maurice Chevalier. Chevalier and Louis Jourdan give the film's two best performances the former performing with a humorous twinkle and effortless charm and the latter having an urbane likability. Juliet Prowse also proves herself to be a wonderful dancer and the choreography and musical numbers are really where 'CanCan' really picks up in the interest value.Yet 'CanCan' despite the music Chevalier and Jourdan and the production values never makes one properly feel like they've been transported to late 19th century Paris. Part of it is to do with the mostly anachronistic and talky script especially in the courtroom parts that really dragged the film down pacewise and a larger part is do with the miscasting of the two leading roles. There is no denying that Sinatra sings beautifully with impeccable phrasing and breath control but he is too contemporary and completely fails to bring personality let alone any endearing traits to a total sleazebag of a character. Shirley MacLaine is also too American annoyingly shrill and doesn't look like her heart was completely in it.As a result of the numerous changes despite some moments the story suffers consequently the material needed more wit emotion and life than what the film provides. Sluggish pacing in the nonmusical moments and a rather too overlong length doesn't help. It's indifferently directed the Garden of Eden sequence despite great dancing and choreography is overblown and goes on for far too long and the ending with Simone's decision completely ringing false feels like a cheat.On the whole some definite great things but considering the source material and talent 'CanCan' should have sparkled so much more. 510 Bethany Cox";

It's a bit unusual to see such divergent reviews and my assessment of the film is somewhere in the middleit's not a good nor a bad filmjust a secondrate musical that isn't bad as a timepasser.When the film begins most viewers will probably be surprised to see Shirley MacLaine and Frank Sinatra in the leads. This is because the film is set in Paris and they are about as French as gefilte fish! This inappropriate casting is made more obvious since Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier are 3rd and 4th billed! So automatically the film loses a point for such poor casting. It's a shame but Hollywood SHOULD have been more focused on appropriate casting than on getting bigname starsproblems that did NOT plague a much better musical from the same period Gigi which starred Jourdan and Chevalier among others.MacLaine plays Simonea woman who runs a night club in Montmartre a district in Paris known for its adult entertainment. Her place has gotten in trouble for having CanCan dancersand police have vowed to arrest her if they put on that wicked dance again. Well eventually this does occur although the charges are soon dropped by the prosecutor Philipe Jourdan. Why? Because Philipe has fallen in love with her and wants to marry her. This is a VERY weak aspect of the film as the upperclass Philipe doesn't even know this ladyso why would he be willing to destroy his career for a dance hall girl?! Eventually Simone agrees to marry Philipe. However Philipe's friend Chevalier and Simone's exlover Franois Sinatra don't want the marriage to occur and so they conspire to break up the couple. They invite the cream of society to an engagement party get Simone drunk and get her to entertain her guests. Well although Philipe STILL inexplicably wants to marry her Simone is determined to end this relationship.As for Franois his character is...well...annoying. He wants Simone but is very honest in his wicked intentions. He has no desire to marry her but wants her so he breaks up her marriage. This is pretty sleazy and the song he sings about this is pretty nasty as well. So because of this the film's ending REALLY made no sense at all...none.In addition to a confusing and occasionally unbelievable plot the film features a very mixed bag of music. Some is greatsuch as It's All Right With Me and You Do Something to Me. However much of the rest of the music is subparparticularly the lyrics. It's like they got Cole Porter's secondbest not his best for this movie.As for the dancing this was VERY odd. Despite the title of the film there is almost no CanCan dancing in the film. However and this just shows you how out of touch Hollywood could be there is LOTS of modern dancethe sort of stuff you'd NEVER see in 1898. In particular the violent dance number involving the knife is pure Hollywood and has no place in the film though there are several other numbers that just don't belong in the movie.Overall the film is a seriously mixed bag. The plot isn't terrible but it often makes little sense the songs range from awful to terrific and the dance numbers often aren't appropriate to the film. I think it's a tepid little film that SHOULD have been much better.According to IMDb trivia the reason the CanCan was so scandalous was because the dancing girls did NOT wear underwear. Although Wikipedia can occasionally be unreliable it insists that this is an urban legend and the dancers certainly DID wear underwear.".

There's an Adam and Eve ballet an Apache Dance of course! and the wittiness of Porter's lyrics which reflects his Parisian era seen earlier on Broadway in shows like Fifty Million Frenchmen and Paris which claimed some of his more risqu lyrics. All in all there's nothing special about this likable but overstuffed piece of fluff but the performers all put their best foot forward or dancing shoes and the direction by Walter Lang is swift in spite of the running time. While this may not stand out as a classic among the golden age of movie versions of Broadway musicals it certainly doesn't rank up there with some of the disasters either.".

While this may not stand out as a classic among the golden age of movie versions of Broadway musicals it certainly doesn't rank up there with some of the disasters either.";

A hunter and Army Scout in the early part of his life he rescues a US Senator and his beautiful daughter Louisa Frederici. Cody is portrayed as someone who admires and respects the Indians and is a good friend of Yellow Hand who will eventually become Chief of the Cheyenne. Everyone else including the military politicians and businessmen on the other hand hate the Indians and are perfectly prepared to trample on their lands and destroy their buffalo hunting grounds. He's eventually forced to fight the Cheyenne however. He's also met a writer Ned Buntline who writes about Cody's exploits and he becomes a sensation when he travels East. His career is not assured however particularly when he attacks those in positions of authority over their maltreatment of the Native American population. He eventually establishes his wild west show that becomes an international sensation.";

That's the image Cody liked to convey even if it wasn't exactly the truth.The real Cody was a brave enough hero all right and this film does mention some of the highlights of his real life the buffalo hunt with Grand Duke Alexei of Russia the hand to hand fight with Yellow Hand at War Bonnet Gorge and the formation of his wild west show.The trouble was the real Cody got into show business and he was ballyhooed out of all proportion to his real accomplishments. And Cody was lent himself admirably to exploitation.The movie is the kind of ballyhoo that Cody would have approved. Cody's chief publicist in real life was Ned Buntline who is faithfully portrayed here by Thomas Mitchell. Maureen O'Hara is Louisa Frederici Cody and she's the faithful but eastern bred wife. No hint of the real marriage problems that plagued the Codys.Linda Darnell and Edgar Buchanan are in this film and I don't really know why. Darnell is an Indian school mistress and Buchanan is a grizzled old army trooper. No real reason for either of them in the film. Darnell is killed at War Bonnet Gorge and she must have been the first squaw who rode into battle. Buchanan's character is also left hanging in the air. Anthony Quinn is Cheyenne chief Yellow Hand and is Cody's worthy adversary on the screen.Buffalo Bill Cody's real contribution was the wild west show. Cody had many imitators but he was the original. Until Hollywood took over with the making of the first silent westerns these shows created the myths surrounding the winning of the west. Sadly that part of Cody's life is given short shrift.But Buffalo Bill would have loved this film. Whether today's audience would is open to speculation.".

	schema:headline " Amazingly a proNative Western from 1944";
	schema:reviewBody "Buffalo Bill 1944 is a a fictionalized biopic of the life of Buffalo Bill Cody Joel McCrea who worked as a scout for the US Army and later traveled East establishing his Wild West show and becoming an international sensation.Director William Wellman and a writer worked for months on a script that told the true story of Buffalo Bill including that he was a drunk a charlatan and an unfaithful husband but  ultimately  they said they couldn't destroy the legend so they destroyed their screenplay and hired writers to write the myth.This explains people's criticism of this classic Western but if you can accept that it's more myth than fact it's quite entertaining especially considering the time it came out. Several things surprised me about this movie. For one it clearly takes a proIndian stance and this was a full two decades before it become hip to do so. Secondly the depiction of the Indians is good and they used real Natives as peripheral characters. Although Anthony Quinn plays Yellow Hand he looks convincing probably because he had Native blood.The Cheyenne and Sioux are portrayed in a noble manner as people protecting their way of life from the Europeans who don't keep their word and slaughter the buffalo en masse for no logical reason. There's a stunning scene when the Natives confront the cavalry and Yellow Hand stands up to Buffalo Bill. After the battle Bill holds the body of an Indian woman he knew Linda Darnell and someone asks A friend of yours? Bill sadly responds They were all my friends.Interestingly a black boy is shown in one of the carnival scenes and even has a line which is notable considering this was a full two decades before the Civil Rights movement. Some facts The character of Yellow Hand was taken from the reallife Cheyenne chief Yellow Hair whom Cody shot stabbed and scalped after Little Big Horn. As already noted the movie is a whitewash and omits the fact that Cody sued his wife Louisa Frederici Maureen O'Hara for divorce in 1905. They had four kids but two died when they were young.Some criticize the way Bill stands at attention while prince Yellow Hand walks in halfnaked wherein Bill lifts his hand and says How. My Response Didn't the Europeans sometimes talk with halfnaked Natives when they met which was fitting since it was the heat of the summer? So what's the problem with depicting this in the film? And wasn't Howgh an actual greeting with some tribes? It was. Hau was a greeting of the LakotaDakota Sioux which is one of the two tribes depicted in the film in fact this greeting is still used by Sioux people today. Other tribes had similar words for greetings. As such what's wrong with depicting this in the film particularly since the actors pulled it off? Besides at that time in the early 40s it hadn't become the stereotypical clich that it later became.Bottom Line Yes there's some rollyoureyes mythmaking in Buffalo Bill like the kid with crutches at the end but the story maintains your attention and there's a lot of rollicking entertainment especially the exciting Cavalry vs. Indians segments. Beyond that McCrea and Quinn are great the locations are spectacular the women are beautiful and the Natives are presented in a respectable and believable way particularly considering the picture was made in the early 40s.The film runs 89 minutes and was shot in Utah Arizona and Montana.GRADE BADDITIONAL COMMENTARY Buffalo Bill was one of the first proNative Westerns which came into vogue by the 60s70s. This is a good thing because it's important to see the other side of the Indian Wars but let's not whitewash history. The Black Hills were first inhabited by the Arikara tribe followed by the Cheyenne Kiowa Pawnee and Crow. These tribes were defeated by the Sioux who migrated out of the Minnesota woods actually chased out by their enemies the Ojibwa and Chippewa. The Sioux then used their superior numbers to take the Black Hills from the other tribes that resided in the area.I point this out because Native Americans were guilty of the very thing we accuse European settlerssoldiersprospectors of doing  invading lands that weren't theirs. Furthermore applying modern thinking is a dishonest tool when inspecting the relations between Native and settlersoldierprospector. We always hear of the injustices committed by the US Army or settlers and get a handful of examples Wounded Knee Bear River and Sand Creek. Yet we never hear the other side of what caused these events nor do we hear of the atrocities of Natives committed against New Americans. For instance we never hear of the Dakota War of 1862 Santee Sioux went on the war path and murdered between 600800 white settlers which constituted the largest death toll inflicted upon American civilians by an enemy force until 911 The Ward Massacre The Nez Perce uprising which killed dozens of settlers in Idaho and Wyoming and the Massacre at Fort Mims. We never hear of the countless innocent settlers who were murdered by roaming bands of young warriors While a chief was signing a peace treaty on the tribe's behalf they were out robbing raping and murdering. I'm just saying that it's easy to be proNative sitting on the comfort of your sofa but not so much when you and your loved ones are threatened with slaughter.The Europeans wanted the Native's land and resources while the Indians wanted the technology of the Europeans. Both sides used treaties to make peace while still trying to get what they wanted when war was too expensive. Both sides made war when they felt no other option. I love Native American culture but the whitewashing of Native atrocities and this revisionist history stuff is dishonest and unbalanced.".

	schema:reviewBody "Buffalo Bill is a highly romanticized picture of 'Buffalo' Bill Cody. While IMDb is correct that most of the things in this biopic are actually based on Cody's reallife exploits most of the relationship between him and his wife was pure hooey. Sadly there was no great love in Cody's lifeor if there was it wasn't his wife! Most of their life was spent apart by his choiceand there were other women in his life. But this image of Bill would not have gotten past censors back in 1944 so the studio fictionalized this aspect of his life. The rest however is reasonably accuratesomething that surprised me as I watched the film. He was a scout for the US Army in the west he fought in the Indian wars and he did start up an incredibly successful Wild West Show.Another aspect of the film that struck me was its treatment of the American Indiansparticularly the Cheyenne. It was odd as the major roles of the 'Indians' were played by Linda Darnell and Anthony Quinn!!! This insensitivity was pretty much the way American Indians were portrayed in American films through the 1950s. HOWEVER despite this insensitivity the film did correctly assert that the Indian wars were forced on these people due to how they were treated by the government. And in this way the film was much more balanced than many westerns of the day.Overall a somewhat inaccurate film that looked nice and featured the excellent acting as usual by Joel McCrea. Worth seeingjust not exactly the Gospel! And the final line of the film might make you throw upso when that little kid in the audience stands up PLUG YOUR EARS!!! By the way the film made one HUGE mistake. General Sherman NEVER said The only good Indian is a dead Indian. This quote was actually from General Sheridanthough it's not exactly what he said. When he was asked what a good Indian was like he said very succinctly ...a dead one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most noticeable thing about this fairly routine Western is its sympathetic portrayal of the native American  something of a rarity for a Hollywood film of the 40s. The white man is the villain here  or more specifically the white man from the East who is unfamiliar with both the culture of the Indians and their needs. Coming from New York in their droves they decimate the buffalo population as part of a fashion fad and uncaringly leave the starving Indian nation with no option but to go to war. Despite this sympathetic portrayal stereotypes still abound. Anthony Quinn plays the legendary Yellow Hand onetime friend of Cody who has been educated by the White Man but still talks in that curious pigeonEnglish so beloved of Hollywood filmmakers. And for all the Indian's nobility whiteness is still something to which Indian squaw Linda Darnell still aspires. It's difficult to understand why she is included in the plot because she has little to do other than gaze longingly at an oblivious Cody. Even the writers don't seem to know what to do with her and end up having her bizarrely taking part in a pitched battle between Indians and cavalry.Joel McCrea plays Buffalo Bill and he is as reliable and unspectacular as you would expect McCrea to be. Cody himself is something of a paradox. Initially friendly with the Indian he sacrifices his position in order to save the father of the Eastern lass he has his eye on a radiant Maureen O'Hara and then helps organise guided hunting trips to give witless city types the opportunity to take part in the orchestrated massacre of the buffalo perhaps then a better title for him would have been Buffalokiller Bill?. Having helped drive his old friend Yellow Hand's tribe to the edge of extinction he then deliberately baits the Indian chief into a battle to the death to buy himself some time when outnumbered by the combined forces of the Sioux and Cheyenne. Despite later railing against the 'civilisation' that has claimed the life of his son Cody then embraces that culture and finds a niche within it as an entertainer recreating his exploits in a travelling sideshow before the titled heads of the world. When you think about it this isn't exactly the most admirable of people we're learning about here and you're left feeling that the writers really hadn't given much thought to the overall impression they were trying to give of the man.Although the film overall is something of a dull affair it's lifted by some good action sequences and early use of technicolor.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's good news and bad news here.Let's start with the bad news. Like many Hollywood biopics of the day this one apparently strays a bit from being an authentic biographical sketch of WIlliam F. Cody. And it gives little more than lip service to the latter part of his life when he became the toast of half the world his traveling shows are covered in less than ten minutes at the end of the film in a fairly meaningless way.But there's plenty of good news here too. For example...a movie about cowboys and Indians where most of the Indians were played by real Indians except for the two main Indian characters played by Anthony Quinn and Linda Darnell. Nevertheless the rest of the Indians seem to be real Indians...not white guys with heavy makeup. That's pretty impressive. And the movie is relatively favorable to the plight of the Indians something that was not yet in style in the mid1940s. The scenery  in Utah  is quite beautiful although the quality of the print shown on TCM indicates a real need for a restoration.Joel McCrea was a fine actor although I don't think that was his best performance. He's satisfactory. Maureen O'Hara is lovely as ever although she didn't have enough really good scenes. Linda Darnell's role as an Indian girl is rather stereotypical. Thomas Mitchell is Thomas Mitchell if you know what I mean. Edgar Buchanan has an interesting role as a veteran army man. And it's interesting to see Anthony Quinn as a hunky Indian at the age of 29.The film was directed by William Wellman. I can't help but think that he must have wished he had had a bigger budget. This film could have been topnotch. It still has its positive attributes but it doesn't do the man justice.".

And the movie is relatively favorable to the plight of the Indians something that was not yet in style in the mid1940s. The scenery  in Utah  is quite beautiful although the quality of the print shown on TCM indicates a real need for a restoration.Joel McCrea was a fine actor although I don't think that was his best performance. He's satisfactory. Maureen O'Hara is lovely as ever although she didn't have enough really good scenes. Linda Darnell's role as an Indian girl is rather stereotypical. Thomas Mitchell is Thomas Mitchell if you know what I mean. Edgar Buchanan has an interesting role as a veteran army man. And it's interesting to see Anthony Quinn as a hunky Indian at the age of 29.The film was directed by William Wellman. I can't help but think that he must have wished he had had a bigger budget. This film could have been topnotch. It still has its positive attributes but it doesn't do the man justice.";

I've only seen the 1944 version and his fictional portrayal in the musical Annie Get Your Gun. Buffalo Bill follows his friendship with Native Americans and shows his courtship and marriage to Louisa played by Maureen O'Hara.Since this movie was made during the good ol' Hollywood era of racism the Native American characters who were prominent enough to have dialogues with the leads were played by ethnics Anthony Quinn and Linda Darnell who were subjugated to these types of roles throughout their careers. Maureen O'Hara's character is given a healthy dose of racism but it's never really addressed just accepted. As usual she overacts every line and contrasted with Joel McCrea's wooden monotone delivery both actors come across as incredibly mismatched. He's so incredibly boring and the rest of the production values are pretty cheap. Unless you absolutely love Joel McCrea check out another version.".

The dichotomy in Cody's Joel McCrae character is given resonance following the Battle of War Bonnet Gorge when he comments on the terrible loss of life  They were all my friends.For a while I thought the introduction of Linda Darnell's character was intended as a romantic tease vying for Cody's affection for Miss Frederici Maureen O'Hara but that plot line wound up going nowhere. If Darnell's character name was mentioned in the story I had to have missed it she's called Dawn Starlight on the credits page here.Same thing with Edgar Buchanan's character the Cavalry Sergeant Chips McGraw. He wound up not really having a lot to do in the story eventually learning he was dismissed from the Army after serving for thirty years. Talk about your slow postal service. One thing you'll only catch in this picture though it's the only time I've ever seen Buchanan with a white handlebar mustache! As with most of these Western films of the era there's not much to go by that's historically accurate so the best thing to do is just settle back and enjoy it for what it is. McCrea seems to be unusually laid back in his role as the frontier hero his best moments perhaps while dealing with Cheyenne war chief Yellow Hand Anthony Quinn. But once again any story that introduces Ned Buntline Thomas Mitchell as a character has to be taken with a grain of salt. He always did his best to sell newspapers and magazines even if it meant streeeeetching the truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most underrated films of all time. It excels in every area  cinematography acting writing direction editing and production values. Yet New York Times Critic Bosley Crowthers dismissed it as just a colorful film when it opened in 1944.Yet scene after scene is brilliant the comedy works the romance works the action works and the politicalphilosophical points about the American West work. For example take the comic second scene of the film where Bill Cody has to wait for a letter while the postman delivers the mail according to rank. There are many ranker than you he says. Delicious. There is hardly any romantic scene in a movie that matches Maureen O'Hara being taught Native American mating customs by Joel McCrea. The Battle scenes between the soldiers and Native Americans are as good as anything until the Magnificent Seven. Politically it intelligently denounces racism and shows that the Native Americans fought largely in selfdefense. At the same time it shows Native Americans as both fierce in battle and dignified. It makes the point that the only Indian that the EuroAmerican ever cared about was the Indian inscribed on their money.The movie has great writing and great lines. For example after the army massacres a group of NativeAmericans Joel McCrea finds the dead body of Linda Darnell. She was his NativeAmerican schoolteacher. He picks up the woman and carries her body in his arms. A friend of yours? quips a soldier. They were all friends of mine answers Bill.McCrea and O'Hara are flawless in the leads but the acting is great down the line. Anthony Quinn and Linda Darnell as native Americans have some great scenes. Before he is about to go into battle Quinn tells himself the grass will still grow the sun will still shine and the river will still flow. It eloquently shows the way Native Americans see themselves as part of nature. Darnell is wonderful as she tries to fit in with EuroAmerican Society only to realize that they will only always see her as an Indian. This is the perfect Western both exciting and intelligent. It beats out Stagecoach Cimmaron Once Upon a Time in the West the Magnificent Seven and McCabe and Mrs. Miller as my favorite Western only because it seems so effortless and modest.".

Historically this was known as the Battle of Warbonnet Creek herein called Warbonnet Gorge. In the film this is followed by an exciting handtohand battle between the 2 cavalries largely taking place in a wide shallow river. Historically this 'battle' didn't happen. After Yellow Hand's death the Cheyenne dispersed back toward their camp in view of the large number of cavalry they saw. Historically Bill killed Yellow Hand with a bullet  not a drowning and scalped him shouting First scalp for Custer in relation to the recent extermination of Custer's cavalry company.Like many of the other scouts for the armies in the Indian Wars Bill Cody had an ambiguous relationship with the Native Americans scouting for the army in pursuing them and slaughtering the bison they depended on for practically everything. Yet he was interested in their cultures and often friendly with them including them in his wild west shows. Whether true or not in his speech an a banquet honoring him with the Congressional Metal of Honor he blasted the the only good Indian is a dead Indian mentality of too many suggesting that the only Indian they cared about was the Indian on their pennies.Thus this film provides a rare for the times sympathetic treatment of Native Americans some years before the overrated in this respect Broken Arrow. It's also a rare for it's times Technicolor western.Thomas Mitchell as Ned Buntline imparts occasional humor as does Edgar Buchanan as an old army sergeant who gets his walking papers and vanishes. Beautiful Linda Darnell has a strange illdefined peripheral role as a Cheyenne maiden who is sometimes the school teacher but rides off to join the warriors at Warbonnet gorge where she is killed during the ferocious battle.

Bill says its a Cheyenne courting blanket for maidens. He shows her how it is worn. She asks how the brave responds. If he accepts he plays a special tune on a small flute as Bill demonstrates.

	schema:reviewBody "A fascinating recreation of an American legend. Certainly it's not factual. Oddly one of the few true elements the hero's descent into sideshowing emerges as a toofamiliar clich though given a bit of flesh here by McCrea's admirably stoic acceptance and the idea that he's forced into showmanship not by gambling or drink but by sheer financial necessity. In fact Buffalo Bill the man is presented as a composite of all the virtues whilst Buffalo Bill the picture is handled with such gusto and panache so breathtakingly and colorfully photographed so full of marvelous action with running inserts of stampeding cavalry and Indians on the warpath  all set against superbly eyecatching locations  and so ingratiatingly narrated by Reed Hadley that one can't help but cheer such a grand epic show produced on such a dingdong lavish scale. Great technical credits too including a vivid score and faultless special effects.All this is not to say that Buffalo Bill doesn't have its faults. Miss O'Hara is the worst. Looks about as much like a frontier lady as a bird of paradise imitating a sparrow. Even in labor she's incredibly painted and groomed. In the tiniest of tiny roles Linda Darnell wipes out Miss O'Hara in their one scene together. McCrea of course is ideally cast. Amongst the support players we glimpse George Chandler as a sleepy cavalryman and Sidney Blackmer as Teddy Roosevelt. All are effective with the one proviso that Charles Winninger's oldage makeup is a bit phony and he tends to overdo his usual mannerisms.If I wanted to carp I could complain about some of the obvious studio backdrops particularly in the opening scene. Yet despite its occasional faults and unlike Wellman I loved the closeout Buffalo Bill is one exciting movie. What exactly was Wellman's gripe? Here it is I didn't like the picture but I tried to do the best I could with it but when that poor little crippled kid at the end stands up and says God bless you too Buffalo Bill I felt absolutely nauseated.On the other hand I'm sure Wellman would agree with me that generally the script has its heart in the right place with pertinent comments to make on wild life preservation and the fate of the Vanishing American. There are better ways to die says Yellow Hand when the white man sets about killing off the precious buffalo it's a bad thing to starve... while Cody himself is given the final word on the subject Dawn Starlight has been killed in battle. Sadly Cody carries her away. A friend of yours? asks the General. They were ALL friends of mine Cody quietly replies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Buffalo Bill is directed by William A. Wellman and collectively written by Aeneas MacKenzie Clements Ripley Cecile Kramer and Frank Winch. It stars Joel McCrea Maureen O'Hara Linda Darnell Anthony Quinn Thomas Mitchell and Edgar Buchanan. A Technicolor production out of 20th Century Fox with music by David Buttolph and cinematography by Leon Shamroy. The Sioux and the Cheyenne must strike together. No history lessons to be learned here just the core essence of one William F. Cody and his life trajectory is used for entertainment purpose. Which if history is not what you are after makes this a grandish production worth spending time with. 99 of the pic is given to his time out on the ranges as a pioneer his romance with Louisa Frederici and his political movements. His move into the Wild West showmanship that he would become famous for is sadly dealt with in what is little more than a coda at story's end. Damn the East! As the story arc moves into the Indian War territory this lets Wellman show his skills as a constructor of action sequences. The Sioux and the Cheyenne have joined forces and in spite of the arrogant claims by the army suits that the War will be over in a week it proves to be anything but that. The battle here is that of Warbonnet Creek AKA Hat Creek and it's brilliantly crafted by Wellman and his team the highlight of the pic for sure and a merciful change in direction after previously we had witnessed some on screen Buffalo killings which while not shying from the reality of that moment in history is still upsetting and tough to watch. I don't hold with General Sherman that a good Indian is a dead Indian. Other notable tech accomplishments are attained by Buttolph and Shamroy's respective work while Wellman continues his fine direction with some nifty locomotive sequences. Acting wise the performances are just about good enough. McCrea and Quinn as Buffalo Bill and Yellow Hand AKA Yellow Hair respectively have the required amount of machismo and emotional fortitude to make the roles work and crucially they convince in action scenes. O'Hara and Darnell get poorly written roles but both are radiantly beautiful and costumed up to the nines whilst Mitchell and Buchanan are solid as usual. Lively colourful emotional and fanciful good entertainment for the Western movie lover but maybe not the Western purists. 710".

Tall arrowstraight broadshouldered softspoken McCrea is simply the embodiment of the famous Indian scout and world renowned showman. Along with the underrated actor himself credit Fox's casting department tough action director William Wellman and perhaps most to costumer Rene Hubert. There a many photos of Bill Cody including a couple from when he was still an unknown Army scout and Hubert's outfits match them right down to the Indian leggings. But most of all credit whomever  Wellman Hubert or McCrea himself decided he had to have a large mustache goatee and long hair like the reallife character. This was a harder decision at the time than it may seem to the modern generation. The 1940's was a closely barbered cleanshaved generation of men. To them and their women having a beard or even a mustache bigger than an eyebrow made a man look like his grandpa. Anathema to a leading man surely! But there was McCrea with the realistic Cody facial hair. No doubt the decision was heavily influenced by the fact that so many people living in the 1940's had actually seen the real Buffalo Bill who lived until 1917.This is a lively and wellproduced western with a top cast including McCrea gorgeous Maureen O'Hara as Mrs. Cody Linda Darnell as the prettiest Indian squaw who ever existed Thomas Mitchell as Ned Buntline Anthony Quinn as Yellowhand backed up by Edgar Buchanan Moroni Olsen and a gang of other solid character actors such as seemed to grow on trees in that golden era of Old Hollywood. Sumptuous threestrip Technicolor photographed by Leon Shamroy under the sure guidance of Technicolor Corporation's Czarina Natalie Kalmus exciting battle scenes rousing David Buttolph score rich characterization intelligent if at times heavyhanded script. Cody is idealized but then so are the Indians who were in reality not nearly so noble as the present politically correct generation would like to think. Nevertheless the basics and the spirit of the story are there and presented in a highly entertaining manner. That's all that counts in a movie.Buffalo Bill is a good show and that no doubt would have been good enough for the reallife Buffalo Bill Cody!".

His wife and daughter find out and walk out on him while his seductress is institutionalized but lets him have the videotape she made of their sex sessions apparently loving him. He is reassigned to Africa and leaves her there and we later see him being Danteanly brutalized in his destination by thugs.Giving us older guys hope De Niro plays a heart transplant Italian American history prof whose lecherous landlord quickly becomes reestranged from his voluptuously beautiful daughter Monica Belucci no less when he is scandalized to discover she has been a strip teaser and pole dancer in Paris ... and our prof gives her shelter. Is there any male on Planet Earth who wouldn't give Monica Belucci shelter?

If she has a sister or niece who needs shelter I am at her service.But without Monica Belucci I would not have rated the film as high as a 6.

The world it seems is Jimmy's oyster but problems at home of the heart and socially could scupper Jimmy's last chance for glory and life fulfilment.Completely fantastical rags to riches sports movie with a keen eye for working class based social realism When Saturday Comes is one of the better football based movies out there. But it is in a genre splinter that's hardly brimming with quality anyway. True enough to say it's treading familiar turf and the ending holds absolutely no surprises at all.

There's issues and goofs within especially obvious to those who know about British football like how old is Bean? Mel Sterland playing for Sheffield United? A home semifinal in the FA Cup?

	schema:headline " Roy of the Rovers the movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Sean Bean stars as equally Sheffield Unitedmad brewery worker Jimmy Muir a talented footballer who was let down by authority figures as a young man. After ten years working a deadend job the frustrated Muir meets Annie Doherty a pretty Irish love interest played by English actress Emily Lloyd and soon after gets the second chance at his dream that such people always seem to get in these modern fairy tales. Yes the formulaic plot is predictable and clichd but it is still enjoyable to watch and there are quite a few touching moments.Funnily enough although this is a football film I felt one of the strongest aspects of the film was the way it dealt with the personal relationships between Jimmy and his family members and friends Pete Postlethwaite for example playing Jimmy's mentor Ken Jackson puts in a strong convincing performance as well as John McEnery as Jimmy's abusive father Joe. A subtle sidetrack detailing Joe's past and its relevance to Jimmy's present is cleverly done and is to me an important part of the film's overall message.Unusually for a sports film the actual football is very well done. Director Maria Giese manages to do what so few directors have before or since in getting both the match itself and the atmosphere right. Every game portrayed is totally believable from the park football at the beginning to the climactic final match at the end. Giese should really be commended here each match is very different and she gets the overall feel of each one at least very close to spot on.One criticism I will give the film however is its ending which seems incredibly rushed and not really believable  I know I said before that this is a fairy tale but watch the film and I'm sure you will see what I mean. I think that if you cut out ten minutes from earlier in the film and add a few more minutes of action just before the film's climax the movie would work a lot better. It just seems very sudden to me that's all.Nevertheless When Saturday Comes is an enjoyable watch especially if you're a football fan. By no means brilliant but still well worth the night in. 710.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sean Bean stars as equally Sheffield Unitedmad brewery worker Jimmy Muir a talented footballer who was let down by authority figures as a young man. After ten years working a deadend job the frustrated Muir meets Annie Doherty a pretty Irish love interest played by English actress Emily Lloyd and soon after gets the second chance at his dream that such people always seem to get in these modern fairy tales. Yes the formulaic plot is predictable and clichd but it is still enjoyable to watch and there are quite a few touching moments.Funnily enough although this is a football film I felt one of the strongest aspects of the film was the way it dealt with the personal relationships between Jimmy and his family members and friends Pete Postlethwaite for example playing Jimmy's mentor Ken Jackson puts in a strong convincing performance as well as John McEnery as Jimmy's abusive father Joe. A subtle sidetrack detailing Joe's past and its relevance to Jimmy's present is cleverly done and is to me an important part of the film's overall message.Unusually for a sports film the actual football is very well done.

The film has a great story builds plot up well with minor stories that intertwine within the main story and ties up at the end very well.

Oh didnt all the coal mines close in Yorkshire sometime in the late 1980s ? In other words weve got a kitchen sink drama full of stereotypes and anachronisms That said I did like WHEN SATURDAY COMES just because its a gritty drama well acted by its cast . Despite being too old for his role by about ten years Sean Bean plays his role very well especially if you only know him as a baddie from films like GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES . Emily Lloyd is also good and you really do feel for the characters in this film unlike the overrated comedy drama THE FULL MONTY which was also set in Sheffield".

It just seems a fiendishly difficult sport to transfer to a cinematic canvas in a dramatic and involving way. When Saturday Comes is not the film to put right this strange unwritten law of the cinema. It's not that it's a hopelessly terrible turd of a movie  far from it  but it's just a very average pedestrian sports drama which doubles up as yet another social commentary on the grimness of northern life. Will there ever be a film about people who thrive and enjoy life north of the Watford Gap? Who knows?Typical workingclass beerswilling womanchasing factory worker Jimmy Muir Sean Bean has been stuck in dead end jobs since leaving school. The thing is he could have had a much different life if his talents had been channelled correctly by the people around him as he was growing up. You see Jimmy is a pretty damn fine footballer but his archetypal lad's lifestyle plus constant negativity from his abusive father Joe John McEnery mean that he never really pursued his talent with the required dedication. Jimmy's future begins to look a little brighter when he falls for feisty wages clerk Annie Doherty Emily Lloyd and is scouted by celebrated nonleaguers Hallam FC coached by Ken Jackson Pete Postlethwaite. Gradually Jimmy works his way up to playing for professional side Sheffield United. Although that side's captain played curiously by exSheffield Wednesday star Mel Sterland despises Jimmy the hopeful newcomer gets his chance to enter Sheff Utd folklore when he comes on as a substitute in a cup semi final match against Manchester United. Will he seize his moment in the spotlight or fold under the pressure when the stakes are highest?When Saturday Comes is better in its dramatic scenes than its sporty ones. The football sequences capture neither the onfield drama nor off field camaraderie one would hope for. The climax is especially disappointing  a strangely rushed and muddled sequence which trips over itself in its haste to get to Jimmy's alltoo predictable 'punchthe airindelight' moment after all those years of rejection and hardship. Erroneous little details don't help much either such as the fact the FA Cup semi final depicted here is played at Brammall Lane home of Sheffield United when in actual fact FA Cup semis are always contested at a neutral venue. The performances are OK though. 36 year old Bean is too old for his role but plays it enthusiastically enough. As a real life Sheff Utd fan this is something of a wish fulfilment film for him or perhaps some might say a vanity project. He certainly seems more at home in this sort of kitchen sink stuff than playing Bond villains or traipsing across Middle Earth with a bunch of hobbits. Lloyd's spirited girlfriend character and Postlethwaite as the supportive coach are also strongly realised characters who contribute to the film's positives. As far as films set in Yorkshire go When Saturday Comes is not really one of the best. It hardly taxes the patience and is certainly not a complete disaster but it never rises far above the level of a runofthemill time filler.".

I think When Saturday Comes deserves 6.5 stars.The performances were good for what the movie needed standing out Emily Lloyd with a good work playing Annie Doherty the girlfriend of the lead character Sean Bean. Sean Bean surprise me because at least one can tell that he has played some futbol when he was a kid not like many others as Michael Caine who is a good actor but he had never kicked a ball in his life before filming Escape to Victory 1981. In my country almost always put actors who are terrible playing football in roles of futbol players at the movies.spoiler in this paragraph What I didn't like about the movie was the final game where Jimmy Muir Sean Beanscores 3 goals in his debut game come on he is not Pele Maradona Messi or George Best to do that It would have been more realistic if he had given one goal assistance and score two goalsI give you that if you want. At least the plays in the final game were OK and look realistic.Jimmy Muir is a very good amateur football player who works in a factory and he will have the great chance of his life to become a professional player when one day he receives an invitation for a proof at Sheffield United..........If you are a fan of footballsoccerlike me you will like this movie otherwise stay away from it..".

Whilst you correctly play guess the next plot development try to count the accents as the cast struggle to convince. Emily Lloyd  watchable and feisty but what is that accent? Jimmy's younger brother tops the lot though with his constant references to 'Joonited'. I've never cheered a pit accident before but here its a welcome relief. The effort is clear especially in trying to cover football effectively but the overall result is disappointing as the film reverts to stereotype and formula.

	schema:reviewBody "What if a platoon of G.I.'s from the Japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate? Great pitch right? The movie does exactly what it says on the tin.Thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the usually ridiculous in scifi movies scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport. No how's or why's. They just did. However the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful if not a bit dated. Not as silly as one would imagine.The rest of the movie follows the premise to a T. But while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the G.I.s arrival to medieval Japan it picks up with a devastating battle sequence. Undoubtedly it's the main order of the day. The whole concept and by extension the movie itself was probably originated from this simple pitch what if G.I.'s equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais? And boy does it deliver.The main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of THE best of its kind in 70's actionwar movies. Not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length it's also a terrific mishmash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like G.I. Samurai can deliver. I mean where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ninjas complete with shuriikens a helicopter and samurais in the same shot? The G.I. platoon led by lieutenant Iba tears literally through hundreds of extras gunning them down with machine guns mortars grenades and tanks.This mishmash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidaigeki epic of Kurosawa's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Banners while the other is in western action and war movies. There are stylistic touches like the wonderful slowmotion shots and bloody violence that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari circa Keoma to mind. Japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other Hollywood works and vice versa and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turns this eastmeetswest melting pot into an exciting film.The filmmakers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it. Not that tongueincheek mentality is completely absent it's just that it doesn't try to pander to sobadit'sgood audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies. The budget was probably hefty as it is evident in the hundreds of extras elaborate costumes very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidaigeki and special effects. The camerawork and editing are all top notch almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves.It's not withouts its flaws either of course. There are many song scenes where all sorts of 70's Japanese rock disco and country songs play over montages there's a bonding scene a loveinterest scene a war is hell scene etc. The songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing. Although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes it flies like a bullet for the most part. Still some scenes flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect.The cast also deserves a mention featuring such prominent names as Sonny Chiba Isao Natsuyagi Goyokin Samurai Wolf Tsunehiko Watase The Yakuza Papers and Hiroyuki Sanada all of them hitting the right notes.".

But I did really like the concept. If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie. That said having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it though not as much as when I was seven  I remembered the ending . There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism  the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music  listen to the lyrics . For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll. By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing when seven I though the 'relationship' guff was a bad thing.For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors. The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and lets face it humorous. I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid and I am not ashamed to say that I still do.I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum they've got heavy calibre machine guns mortars rocket launchers a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs. Which is what I'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots.In short the movies worth watching it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I. Samurai is so unique.".

	schema:headline " One of my favourite Japanese films  up there with Battle Royale";
	schema:reviewBody "A typically intense  not to mention insane  example of a Japanese Bmovie that actually feels like an EPIC thanks to its nonstop action carnage chaos and plenty more besides. The plot is one of those simplistic one sentence ideas you can just imagine some powerful executive in an office had let's see a war fought between samurai soldiers and modern army officers!. The execution is splendid gory violent and everything else that you could hope for. The time slip itself is hilarious a plethora of cheap flashing lights and plenty other weirdness which set the time of production firmly within the 1970s.Once the action starts to beef up it doesn't let up at all right until the climax. The last thirtyforty minutes depicts a war between modern and ancient soldiers and is as gratuitous exciting and adrenalinepumping as you could ever hope for. Topnotch choreography by martial arts legend Sonny Chiba and some outstanding makeup effectscostumes help add to the realism. Hard man hero Chiba also stars as Iba the tough powerhungry lieutenant who leads the modern day army and his acting skills are as good as ever. I love the scene where he turns into a hardass at the end of the film riding horses and kicking backside all over the shop. It's one of his best performance and I would put this up there with THE STREET FIGHTER as his two best movies. Don't cry  fight! is one of the many classic lines he gets to deliver at the film progresses.Those of a squeamish disposition note this film is full of gory bullet hits and some damned explicit decapitations which seem to come out of nowhere! Gotta love those arrow hits though which are truly hilarious. Anyone who has seen a '70s Japanese samurai film will know the level of violence to expect from this one. The war itself is the best part of the film a truly frenetic and often horrific experience showing the true terrors of warfare the action and death is often enhanced by an experimental soundtrack in which moments of dead silence add to the viewing experience. Animallovers would also be well advised to look elsewhere as the film has dozens of violent horse falls where the horse's legs are yanked out with wire leaving the horses crippled and likely to be sent to the knacker's yard. No wonder this was extensively cut  in an extremely bizarre way  for its 18 certificate UK release. Cut or not this is an outrageous and dramatic movie which despite being downbeat offers up an amazing good time. Check it out!NB Since I wrote this review I've bought the DVD under the better title G. I. SAMURAI. Seen in a widescreen print with an extra thirty minutes added to the proceedings I'm now convinced this is a masterpiece which belies its Bmovie budget. The cost of kitting out the hundreds of Samurai warriors must have been huge and the authenticity is spot on throughout. The opening timeslip isn't too bad and in fact is the only moment in the whole film that the thing feels cheesy. Elsewhere the viewer runs the gamut of emotions from AZ from happiness and outlandish joy through to sadness and downbeat misery. Suspense is topnotch throughout and great performances from an entire cast  especially the actor who plays the samurai commander ally. I love this film to bits.".

	onyx:emotionText "A typically intense  not to mention insane  example of a Japanese Bmovie that actually feels like an EPIC thanks to its nonstop action carnage chaos and plenty more besides. The plot is one of those simplistic one sentence ideas you can just imagine some powerful executive in an office had let's see a war fought between samurai soldiers and modern army officers!. The execution is splendid gory violent and everything else that you could hope for. The time slip itself is hilarious a plethora of cheap flashing lights and plenty other weirdness which set the time of production firmly within the 1970s.Once the action starts to beef up it doesn't let up at all right until the climax. The last thirtyforty minutes depicts a war between modern and ancient soldiers and is as gratuitous exciting and adrenalinepumping as you could ever hope for. Topnotch choreography by martial arts legend Sonny Chiba and some outstanding makeup effectscostumes help add to the realism. Hard man hero Chiba also stars as Iba the tough powerhungry lieutenant who leads the modern day army and his acting skills are as good as ever. I love the scene where he turns into a hardass at the end of the film riding horses and kicking backside all over the shop. It's one of his best performance and I would put this up there with THE STREET FIGHTER as his two best movies. Don't cry  fight! is one of the many classic lines he gets to deliver at the film progresses.Those of a squeamish disposition note this film is full of gory bullet hits and some damned explicit decapitations which seem to come out of nowhere! Gotta love those arrow hits though which are truly hilarious. Anyone who has seen a '70s Japanese samurai film will know the level of violence to expect from this one.

It's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length.Chiba gives a gruff performance as Iba initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him.

The plot in a nutshell is... a small group of Japanese Defense Force soldiers go back in time 400 years and fight samurais. Made in 1979 this movie delivers some ultrabattle action! The group of about twenty guys led by Sonny Chiba whose character's name I can no longer remember find themselves propelled backwards somehow to feudal Japan via a Time Slip this movies alternate title among others. The special effects are somewhat shoddy but they work. Not only are the men flung back into time but get this a tank halftrack jeep with .50 cal. machine gun supply truck helicopter and a freakin' patrol boat also! They find themselves in the middle of a feud between the local warlords one of whom takes a fancy to them. They decide to team up with this guy and take over ancient Japan. Forget about messing with the spacetime continuumin battle after battle many many samurais and foot soldiers are gunned down blowed up and generally done away with without regard to the historical consequences. The soldiers have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of ammo. Clocking in at over two hours we have all sorts of Japanese tomfoolery to contend with. There is some truly awful music sprinkled throughoutsome with English lyrics. I liked this movie a lot. There are so many things about this movie to like and few reasons not to. I cannot remember all the elements in this movie...there was just too much going on. Ha. The soundtrack was Japanese with English subtitles. I understand there is a chopped up English language version out there too which should be avoided.".

A battle group travels in time for unknown reason. I can buy that. You can give the audience every possible Make sense fact for the time travel but at the end time travel is still considered a myth and no one knows if it's even possible some argue it's not as we had no visitors from the future in the known well documented history so not giving the audience any fact for time travel is not really a problem. It just happened. It's OK.2.Iba suppressed the mutiny and regained control of the patrol boat. Then he made the most ridiculous and insane move. He blew the boat. Even if he had no use for the boat he had to keep so he can use the diesel in the tank and tucks yet he blew the boat with all the fuel and I assume with everything inside it including the ammo.3. It is a known fact that tanks are short range vehicles. You can't just marsh half of the country with a tank in single tank of fuel. It is just impossible. In the beginning we see that they just march with the tank back and forth wasting the fuel and then marching with the tank to the battle. Even by 1940s standard that was just ridiculous.4. Same thing goes with the helicopter. Helicopters do not fly on nuclear fuel they run on gas and they are not a regional passenger jet. Again we see that he flies the copter just to show off like there is no future.5. They waste ammo just to show off!6. Iba marches with the entire battle group without protecting his rear. Japan is not a big country. He had to save the patrol boat for escape and if he wanted march he had to do it along the coast line so at least he had protected back. Coming from the future he had the precise map of Japan's coast line so he could find a strategic peninsula secured from 3 sides with water and gun boat and entrench on the land connection try to lure the enemy to his position. Of course if they wanted to play it right they had to re wright the whole screenplay but considering the insane effort they put into creating such awesome battle sequence it was worth it. This movie had the potential of being a cinematic epicclassic.7. So he marches inland with his battle group which in reality suffered from shortage of ammo an fuel with absolutely no supply line. They got encircled and... It was very well made. They lost everything. Historically such thing happened in WWII when Germans sneaked into soviet line to Stalingrad and everyone knows the outcome. No army commander sneaks into enemy line without having a solid and well protected supply line unless he is on suicide mission! So aside from some entertainment factor the movie was a total disaster.Soundtrack was good except for the fact that the Japanese singer was singing the mix of English and Japanese... Whenever I heard a song I wanted to hit my head to the wall.Overall the concept was good we saw the concept in several western movies like the Timeline and I bet we will continue to see more movies based on similar concept in the future. I would say 610. The production was so good that I can not downgrade the movie as much as I like.".

It shows a great deal of drama and historical events made by Portuguese people the good decisions and the bad ones!! I don't like Manoel de Oliveira's films too much...in fact this is the only film directed by him that I was able to see till the end of it and be in fact interested!! So I think this opinion can give you the picture of one of the great movies made in Portugal!! I gave it an 10 out of 10 because this movie has it all...you can even match it with some of the million dollar productions of Hollywood movies...the historical battles...with lots of soldiers...and lots of costumes...the great amount of horses and the reality given to shots taken not those of Hollywood that send the guy flying through the air when he gets shot with a huge scream!!...Even the details given to the camera looking of the actors...the pauses...the way to tell the story...all it's done greatly!! I strongly recommend you to see this movie...you'll have a good point of view from Portuguese history!! And the final scene...with the doctor writing the death report...excellent!!".

And what more adequate episode of Portuguese recent History than the Colonial Wars? From 1963 to 1975 thousands of Portuguese soldiers were killed wounded maimed in the forests of former Portuguese colonies in Africa Angola Mozambique GuineaBissau leaving a permanent scar in Portuguese society that's not healed even today... Oliveira joins everything from the myths of the past to AlcacerQuibir to the Colonial Wars attempting closure. It achieves none. The movie becomes too dull too slow although the photography is amazing and the marriage of King John Henry the Navigator's father and the one that started the Portuguese Centuries after defeating the Castillans in Aljubarrota in 1384 shows exactly that a priest reciting in Spanish with actors placed like cardboard cuts imitating a famous painting. The only scene with stamina belongs to the famous actor Ruy de Carvalho a warrior ranting about the uselessness of war...

The movie was a big winner at the German Film Awards that year and that may have had to do with the contemporary impact the film made back in the day. It is another attempt of Germany's filmmakers in the 1950s to depict and elaborate on what happened in Germany back between 1933 and 1945 a topic that has been worked on on so so many occasions. And with huge quantity there also comes huge forgettable stuff. Sadly this film is not among the best the country had to offer in terms of warthemed film. It is not really lead actor O.E. Hasse's fault as he does a convincing job with the lead character. I personally however felt that the film was way too long for its own good. At almost two hours it lacked focus on many occasions and I felt there were many scenes that could have been left out because they added little to none to the overall picture. In terms of the story many people may not have heard about Canaris who really existed but his story is a bit of a mix between Stauffenberg and Rommel so you know the general direction this film is taking. It is about resistance against Hitler in the broadest sense. If this subject interests you then you can check it out. You just should not be expecting too much.".

There are other great German actors taking part in this period drama with Martin Held as a chilling coldblooded Nazi General Heydrich. The film is far from being flawless as two hours aren't enough to cover life of this highly tragic man who happened to live in Hitler's times and who chose to fight not run. There are weaker parts when the movie slides into a typical 50's schmaltzy detective flick or when very important events are mentioned just as a faint glimpse. Still in general this is a very decent antiwar film with slightly skint but still powerful message that often it takes much courage to say No when all scream Yes.

His conscience bothers him about his father's career but instead of taking the usual route of performing a string of silly pranks like you would see in a lot of children's shows he tries reasoning with his dad.  He also asks question after question  not just about the technical aspects of whaling but he also delves deeper into the more important questions of life Do you always have to do the right thing even if it hurts?. One of the things I liked best about Free Willy 3 was the realistic and sympathetic portrayal of the father even though he was the villain of the story.  He was a man doing a job that has been in his family for years and without it he wasn't sure who he was.  Despite having a career others disagreed with he was a caring compassionate person who loved his son. Other characters are drawn out nicely as well  Jesse and Randolph from the first two films and their new coworkers on the sea  showing their tempers as well as their more positive sides.Couple all these features with stunning cinematography and a beautiful score and you have one fine film!".

If you can't appreciate such a touching film as Free Willy 3 The Rescue I'd like to see what you guys watch. This movie really touched me so did the other two movies in the trilogy. I'll admit this movie may not have been as good as the other two which is why I'm only giving it a 9 out of 10 but it still is quite the masterpiece. It's better than any of those other bullshit movies about animals like air bud or MVP! Those movies were garbage and have absolutely nothing on free Willy. Free Willy 3 The Rescue has and always will have a special place in my heart. I grew up with this trilogy and I hold it very dear to my heart. If you're a parent and you want your child to see some quality film making I advise you to rent Free Willy 3. This movie doesn't have any violence or anything that'll warp your child's mind into growing up to be some crackhead animal beating criminal which is what most movies tend to be doing these days. No this movie will inspire your kid to do good with his life it'll make your child appreciate the beauty of animal life. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend you watch it asap. It will appeal to people of all ages.".

Richter should be given some sort of an award for all the whales he has seen under the influence of bad sequels. Schellenberg also returns because he obviously pitied Richter and decided to share the blame. Also with Annie Corley and Patrick Kilpatrick who must deal with having this junk on their resumes. The animal rights message doesn't really matter here. This is just feeding off another franchise that never really had a fresh angle to begin with. We all understand the need to preserve wildlife but this feels more like an opportunity to milk a dying franchise to death. Even the whale looks like it ought to be moving on to better things like the stage version of Orca. Perhaps the filmmakers should free Willy and come up with a new idea. Score 1  10".

He is working with old friend Randolph Johnson August Schellenberg sarcastic scientist Drew Halbert Annie Corley and on the ocean he is of course reunited with old friend Willy the Whale Keiko. Meanwhile on a whaling ship is John Wesley Patrick Kilpatrick and his young son Max Vincent Berry who after seeing many of them isn't very keen on killing the Orca whales. While he doesn't have the guts to say no to his Dad Jesse gets Max to meet Willy and his new girlfriend who is pregnant with their baby and he realises that his Dad is doing something illegal and nasty to nature. Also starring Tasha Simms as Mary Wesley Peter LaCroix as 1st Mate Sanderson Stephen E. Miller as Dineen Ian Tracey as Kron and Matthew Walker as Captain Drake. The problem with this one is that the human story takes over and we hardly see enough of the beautiful originally show stealing creatures the birth of a baby nearly makes up for the lack of time they are used but the first film is always going to be the one to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "I liked two previous Free Willy movies when original was completely a perfect masterpiece while the first sequel was also pretty good. . Now I watched the third movie and I found it excellent almost as great as the original though the first Free Willy movie is without a doubt the best in the trilogy. In this movie our main hero Jesse is now 16 and he begins to work with his old friend Randolph on a scientific researching ship. This summer new danger threatens his relations with giant whale Willy  illegal whalers. Jesse meets young boy who is son of the captain of whaler's ship and he tries to convince him that whales are living creatures and not just a food for expensive restaurants. The relations and dialogs between captain of whaler's ship and his son Max played by two newcomers Patrick Kilpatrick and Vincent Berry and dialogs between them are the strongest parts of the movie. Acting is still pretty good and young Vincent Berry who was much better than slightly annoying Fransis Capra is the second movie created an excellent and memorable performance as Max young and innocent kid who learns that his father is involved in illegal fishing. Jason James Richter one more time to my great sadness the last time showed his acting abilities with strong performance as almost grownup Jesse. Free Willy 3 is beautifully shot movie with gorgeous cinematography which is as good as in first movie but here we can entire ocean instead of small pool. With such a good cinematography great scenery well written and poignant story and good soundtrack the last Free Willy 3 is an excellent example how good can be a family movie. Sweet and innocent bright and entertained and that's the most important to me without any sign of vulgarity and typical rude humor it easily became to alltime family classic. Anyone must realize that whales and others animals can be more human than people.My rating 95 out of 10. The movie is dedicated to memory of Keith A.Walker the man who brought two great characters Willy and Jesse into our life. IMDb is a great source for any movie lover but some ratings can be exceptionally misleading.".

It isn't often that a moviemakes you both Sad and happy at the same time and makes you want to stand up and cheer at the ending but FREE WILLY was one of the few movies that did it.  Willy and Jesse met again in FREE WILLY 2 and it was great to see them together again but unfortunately the enterprising premise involving an oil spill in the ocean endangering Willy and his Family turned out to be a bit too slowpaced and in some cases too hokey like the scene where Jesse and Willy reunite again after the first time Jesse plays the harmonica...it could have been thought out better.  Also the film spent too much time dealing with the issues of Jesse's new Stepbrother Elvis. However the suspenseful last halfhour of the movie was great.  Which brings us to Part 3 which is actually almost as good as the first film and a lot better than part 2.  The storyline involving the wrongful and illegal hunting of Whales and Jesse  Randolph's quest to stop a crew of nasty hunters is very well written and emotionally charged like the first movie. I wish this film was marketed and advertised better because it really deserves to be seen!  It is emotional and heartfelt like the magic of the first FREE WILLY and in the end you will stand up and cheer.  It's cool to see what has become of Jesse and how he has grown up and it is good to know that Jesse and Randolph will always stick together to do what is right! If you passed on this because you were afraid that it was more of the same guess again!  It is another wonderful story that deserves to be enjoyed again and again!  Check it out!!!".

Most people who gave it a low rating were expecting exaggerated things amazing adventure like no other and hence they were disappointed. This move though short that's what I thought was simple and sensitive. The ending was rather lame they could have spiced it up like sending the guy to jail or something like that but right afterward you see the female whale give birthhence with the facts without being too much like a lot of movies are nowadays. So this movie deserves a solid A and even Sisko and Ebert gave it two thumps up and they are movie experts so there you go.".

It's the best conflict in all of the movies and it has a quiet dreamy tone that is radically different from the other two. It seems that at this point WarnerRegency were just letting the director do whatever he wanted and thus Free Willy 3 feels more like a director's movie than a cashin or something assembled by a committee.It's mad that the first movie did such huge business only for the better sequel to barely make back its budget then this third entry the best of the series barely makes it past the impossibly low 3 million mark.

I also loved the scenes between Nikki and Willy and the one when Nikki gives birth which was brilliantly done. The score is absolutely beautiful the pacing is brisk and the direction is amiable. And the characters are appealing especially Willy and Nikki while Jesse and Max are great characters and the father is a sympathetic figure even for the villain of the piece except I don't see him as a proper villain just someone who means well but doesn't know exactly what he wants. The acting is good too Jason James Richter and Vincent Berry are very likable August Schellenberg makes a welcome return as Randolph and Patrick Kalpatrick does a great job with his character.All in all a pleasant family film. 710 Bethany Cox".

Jesse gets a job working with his longtime buddy Randolph. They discover that Willy is going to be a father so Jesse is excited. Meanwhile young Max Wesley sees his father illegally hunting wales. Max knows that's wrong but his dad convinces him it is not a big deal. Max befriends Willy and starts to feel for him. When Jesse and Randolph get involved they try to stop Max's father from more wale killings. Richter and Schellenberg are the only two returning cast members. Many people wonder what happened to Elvis and Nadine from the previous flick. I found Jesse and Randolph alone to be fine as they are the best characters. One may also not like half the story centring around Max and his family. They also may not like seeing his father hunting and killing wales which is shown. There are also brawls which make things less settling. Having said that this movie needed that action and brutality. Doing another Free Willy movie in the same fashion as the first two would suck.

	schema:headline " the screenplay for Free Willy 3 The Rescue follows its politically correct formula without a whole lot of style";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1998 a man named Steinar Bastesen publicly declared his opinion that the money spent on training the captive orca Keiko should instead be spent on grinding the poor animal into six tons of meatballs as foreign aid for the starving people in Africa. This coming from the same man who would probably encourage families with more than a single pet to grind up one of their cats for the villages of China. Well Mr. Bastesen would have probably beenand just might have been depending if he saw the movie or notjust as infuriated by the content of the last movie that Keiko had starred in. The movie is Free Willy 3 The Rescue and it takes a politically correct hand holding a politically correct spear and jabs it into the guts of people like Mr. Bastesen. I support the cause all the way. I just wish I could support the movie for its dramatic content. Again this is a review of the movie not the movie's cause.Free Willy 3 The Rescue is a prime example of an underwritten kids' movie sequel something we unfortunately get too much of these days. It is the third anduntil just recentlylast installment in the popular franchise about a young boy Jason James Richter and his friendship with a sixton whale Keiko. In the previous two movies Mr. Richter saved Keiko first from a neglectful theme park owner and then later from oilinfested waters. Now the threat comes from a band of poachers the leader of whom is taking his son along on the hunt for the very first time. As one would expect the son Vincent Berry doesn't conform to his father's illicit way of making a living and ends up siding with Mr. Richter to save Willy and his family.There are good elements to Free Willy 3. One of the promising dynamic between Mr. Berry and the superb actor Patrick Kilpatrick as his father. The latter does a particularly good job portraying a man who devotedly loves his family and blindly does what he does partially out of the desire to support his loved ones and partially because his family tree essentially demands it of him. His grandfather harpooned sperm whales so he feels he should harpoon orcas. I also appreciated how well Mr. Berry displayed enthusiasm at the beginninggoing on a big event with his fatherand then the horror when he first sees an innocent animal getting run clean through with a harpoon. The emotion in this sequence doubles the emotionand lessens the gimmicky disturbancefrom a similar scene in Michael Anderson's pretentious 1977 film Orca. I also enjoyed Mr. Richter's thirdtimearound performance. The only other returning character is August Schellenberg he's reliable as well. Apart from that I did enjoy some of the scenery when the characters on land there's something magnetic about looking at a coastal village the docks the boats the water shoreline the coastal trees. It's the sort of place one thinks about retiring to someday.However the screenplay to Free Willy 3 follows its politically correct formula without a whole lot of style. Now the first Free Willy movie released in 1993 did not say anything we didn't already know about the issue of whales in captivity but it approached the subject with a great deal of heart. Hence why it won over the hearts of many children myself included. But John Mattson's script for the third movie does not have very much of this and there is zero sense of friendship between Jason James Richter and the whale. As far as the movie is concerned these two just met for the first time and Mr. Richter is merely fascinated by the whale. And even the whale is not given much to do. The movie might as well be about a trivial whale not one that starred in two previous pictures. The animatronic standins for Keiko are utilized too often now and the jaws open and close with too much hectic speed to convince that it's flesh and blood. A scene where the protagonist feed Willy and his mate oranges is very revealing. There's no sensation from past events such as the time Willy saved Mr. Richter from drowning in the tank in the first film. And although Vincent Berry does have some cute scenes between him and the whale at one point they start to play volleyball with the whale launching the ball back onto the decks of the boat there are not enough of them.The movie overall is a lazy effort with a rushed mindset. It ironically comes alive mostly when it is on land and is not so exciting when on the water. And even the usually interesting concluding shots of the whales swimming and leaping freely through the frigid North Pacific waters is disappointing this time around as they are merely reusing stock shots from the previous two pictures. It's really jarring when at one point the whales are moving behind a blue sky then a redlaced dusk setting and then a blue one again.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good Philip Glass score  albeit one that's rehashed from the original  is the only good thing about this lacklustre sequel that's more like an endless slasher flick than the evocative and atmospheric ghost story of the first film. Here Candyman is given a back story and the flashbacks are the only effective part of the production while going after various characters who may or may not be his own descendants.This is a lifeless and vapid film one that it's genuinely difficult to watch while keeping your eyes open. Every signposted death is familiar from the original and no extra lashings of grue are going to change that. The story delivers an uninspiring lead actress Kelly Rowan and gives her an equally uninteresting brother William O'Leary neither of whom do much to elicit sympathy in the viewer. Tony Todd of course is exceptional but it takes more than a single actor to make a great film.Bill Condon later won plaudits with GODS AND MONSTERS but I found his direction here to be stultifying  and dated in the worst mid1990s way. Aside from those aforementioned flashbacks I can't think of a single moment of life or energy in the entire plot. It's merely uninspired with Candyman whittling off one character after the other while way too much time is given to one of those awfully clichd subplots about the police suspecting an entirely innocent victim of the killings. Throwing in some 'name' character actors like Veronica Cartwright and Bill Nunn doesn't soften the experience either.".

And the kicker is that the child that Robitaille fathered was Annie's greatgrandmother.Candyman Farewell to the Flesh was the first of two sequels to CANDYMAN an impressive but slightly overrated horror sleeper of the 1992 season that became a big hit  was the second major cult creation of horror master Clive Barker already famous for the Cenobites of the HELLRAISER series. The film was based on one of Barker's short stories.While the original was an excellent horror flick that engaged on both a cerebral  a visual level this sequel is strictly by the numbers. Bill Condon relies on far too many false jumps  red herrings during the first half that becomes tiring to watch. This coupled with the overuse of Philip Glass' score from the original to the point that the ethereal effect it had in the first film became nothing but meaningless in this one makes the film's first half decidedly mediocre.But once the story kicks in the second half  Kelly Rowan's heroine is on the chase to defeat what is essentially her ancestor Farewell to the Flesh picks up considerably to rank as a passable sequel. The visual effects are good especially the ending where Tony Todd's hookhanded ghost is defeated by Rowan smashing the mirror causing his form to shatter like glass an effect that looks remarkable. Another thing that elevates the film slightly is the whole connection between the heroine  the Candyman as well as revealing the ghost's origins finally solving the mystery behind the legend.The acting is okay in places. Tony Todd practically owns the film from his first appearance. He is probably the only actor besides Hellraiser villain Doug Bradley to really get into the nuances of his character giving the film a good monster. As for the rest of the cast everyone does passably well although I found Veronica Cartwright's neurotic mother a bit of an eyesore.".

	schema:reviewBody "In New Orleans during the Mardi Gras festival an author who wrote a book about the legend of the Candyman is murdered and someone who he had a confrontation with that night is accused of the act. Although the accuser's sister a schoolteacher tries to discover who actually did kill the expert and learns that the legend of The Candyman is for real. She has conjured up the mythical serial killer by repeating his name in front of the mirror five times. This is where the horrifying nightmare begins and some surprising revelations occur.The sequel to the underrated original you could say its just another slasher because it lacks the psychological edge but I thought it was a reasonably good one and above the usual routine slasher. Sure it doesn't have the hypnotic power and impact of the original but it still delivers enough well arranged shocks and has an mildly interesting plot that delves a little a bit more into the Candyman's background. With it showing us flashbacks of the painful ordeal he faced and how he became this legend. The plot isn't entirely focused on the Candyman legend like the original was with the investigation leading more towards the sister finding out about her family secrets while trying to get her brother of the hook and basically the legend is woven into it. Though it's not as smart or incredibly gripping this time around with it leading more towards graphic violence and having some tedious moments slowing down the pace. It starts off rather slow but it gets better as the story moves along and some moderate surprises pop up but really it isn't that hard to guess to where the story is heading and some things just don't add up. The cloud of mystery around the Candyman just seems to be gone or I should say far less evoking with it seamlessly rehashing a lot material and ideas which were done so more effectively in the first film. On a whole it just doesn't capture the intense power and poetic tussle of the original's subtle plot and elegant dialogue. The material seems to want to forcefeed us the information and the narration by the damn DJ was really starting to get on my nerves after awhile. But nonetheless it's a bloody treat literally and at least it's not just another slasher involving hornydrunk teenagers with a shallow plot.The look and direction of the film was alright but it lacked the polish production values and the touch of detail and class. Atmosphere was slightly disappointing because the dreaded build up is only effective in short pockets because it's was replaced by too many jump out scares that eases the tension. Although saying that it did provide some freaky sequences but that was on the behalf of Todd's towering presence. Also there's a nice amount of nasty deaths and blood splattering for gore fanatics. Great makeup achieved and you got to love those special effects. The score from the original is used again and it creates that sense of mystic and doom that flooded the original. On show again is strong camerawork that truly catches your eye. The performances are fair with two reasonable standouts. Easily Tony Todd as the harrowing Candyman who lives the part as the tormented soul perfectly and Veronica Cartwright turns in a surprise performance. Kelly Rowan as the heroine isn't bad either. The dialogue isn't that riveting but Todd's echoing voice causes chills to run up your spine. Something about this fictional legend is quite impressive in my eyes. He lives on the pain and the people's fear of him. This is what gives him power and keeps his legend alive. Really he is nothing but a heart lorn soul.Overall it doesn't hold up to the original but as for a sequel it's not all that bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Candyman 2 isn't bad at all. It may lack when compared to part 1 because it isn't as scary as part 1. That might be because Clive Barker was more involved with the 1st. I'll even admit the 1st had a better plot compared to many horror movies.This movie does reflect on Helen Lyle from part 1. Purcell who appeared in part 1 even appears in this one.The acting and plot are all really underrated. This movie shows how good an actress Kelly Rowan really is. The ending is something to watch out for as wellpretty cool. The flashbacks are perhaps the best EVER. Its also refreshing to see Tony Todd reprise his role as Candyman. This movie may not be as scary as part 1 but is a God among movies especially compared to candyman 3.".

	schema:headline " Candyman Farewell to the Flesh A fun but uninspired followup.";
	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was an underrated horror classic of the 90's that is unfairly looked over or even often looked down upon it's the beautiful and haunting film Candyman inspired by the stories of famed author Clive Barker. The 1992 original is one of the few true classics to emerge from the genre in its decade of release boasting moody visuals clever writing fantastic characters and a unique pointofview with its leaning towards being a sortof dark urban fable. It cleverly used African American culture commentary on racism and social unease to its benefit crafting a thoughtful and heinous story revolving around the urban legend of a devious figure that emerges should you call his name into a mirror five times. A figure with a hook for a hand that was birthed from the dreadful murder of the son of a slave... a man who had fallen in love with a white woman and was hunted down and tortured to death as a twisted form of retribution from the racist townsfolk that surrounded him.It was in many ways a perfect horror film. It was filled to the brim with tragedy and heartbreak. Demented scares and horrific visuals. But also welldeveloped and wellrounded characters and strong visual storytelling. Even to this day there are people who are too frightened to say the name Candyman into a mirror because of the fears that the film has left with them.It should come with no surprise then that a sequel was soon commissioned and delivered just three short years later. Candyman Farewell to the Flesh is very much a highly entertaining and enjoyable sequel building the lead villain into much more of a classic boogeyman figure and piling on the scares and bodies to new heights. With some good direction and the continued grand performance of the devilish Tony Todd as our antagonistic vengeful spirit the film has a lot going for it. However as is all too often the case with sequels bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. And despite the fun that is certainly to be had with the concept and execution it does unfortunately come at the cost of a developed story and thoughtout characters. The original Candyman was horror as art. Farewell to the Flesh is horror as junkfood. Just satisfying enough to be worth a go now and then... but not as fulfilling or as highquality as you'd probably prefer.Set in New Orleans just before the city explodes with Mardi Gras fever we follow schoolteacher Annie Tarrant Kelly Rowan a young woman whose life has been shattered by the myth of the Candyman her father murdered in the fashion of the mythical killer and her brother accused of murdering academic Philip Purcell Michael Culkin in a funbutshortlived reprisal of his character from the original who had written a book based on the myth and the events of the first film. Trying to prove to herself that the urban legend of the Candyman cannot possibly be true Annie inadvertently summons him forth setting off a chain of events that will not only reveal his dreadful origins in shocking detail but threaten to tear Annie's life apart piece by piece.The thing that really throws me for a loop with this particular followup is just how often it seems to both hit and miss the mark in each and every scene. Director Bill Condon is certainly adept when it comes to moody stylish visuals and he seems to be having a grand bit of fun behind the camera. And he often does help elevate sequences beyond the shaky writing giving us plenty of scares and jumps that will keep the audience entertained throughout the proceedings. But it never quite amounts to much outside of being general movie fluff. It's not substantial it's just shallow entertainment. This is mostly because of the script courtesy Rand Ravich and Mark Kruger which is so focused on bringing us blood by the bucketful that all sense of story and character is often lost in the rush to get to the next horror setpiece. And while I am perfectly fine with horror as entertainment and fluff it'd be hypocritical for me to say otherwise as I do like mindless entertainment quite a bit the issue is that this is a sequel to a highly artistic and deliberate original. It feels like too much of a step backward.Still I can't say its not a fun ride to take. Those stylish visuals and constant attempts at scares make it a breezy watch. Tony Todd once again delivers the goods with his continued chilling presence and phenomenal performance as a tragic villain with a dark history. There's a lot of interesting things to explore with its setting in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. And it even occasionally does some really cool things with the concept. At its core there's just enough going on here to make it well worth checking out. It may be a bit of a shallow retread of the much better original. But you'll have a blast watching it and you won't regret giving it a shot.I'm giving Candyman Farewell to the Flesh a slightly above average 6 out of 10.".

Candyman is not very spooky in this film because we are manipulated to feel sympathy for his plight his humanity rather than his mythos is emphasised. Without the mythos Candyman is nothing more than a deranged serial killer indulging other people's suicide fantasies but without a will of his own. Hardly the stuff of great horror! The combination of humanity and lack of free will destroys the narrative and any suspense which can be derived from it.

I think why I enjoyed this more than I thought was the atmospheric settingMardi Gras New Orleans mostly the slums areas the menacing Toddan actor I'm quite fond of the wonderful Philip Glass score Condon's photography and the wellstaged death sequences.I won't lie to you this is above all a slasher film and director Bill Condon allows Candyman to do some damage in this sequel penetrating quite a few victims through the torso with the hook bursting through the stomach often lifting them right in the air..Condon for added effect often closes in on the horrified expressions of those being thrusted through. My favorite sequence is when Annie revisits the home of her youthwhich was a plantation house with a slaves quarters nearby follows a walkway into a large room with an altar of candles and skulls enshrined to Candyman with this incredible painted portrait on the wall above of him crying out in anger with his hook and other arm reaching out.There's a great scene where Detective LevesqueDavid Gianopoulos who believes wholeheartedly that Annie has been murdering people in the fashion of Candyman with brother Ethan covering up for her calls on Candyman and is thrown through the interrogation room window after being penetrated through..and extended in the air.. by the true monster.".

The third movie was so bad that I couldn't watch past 30 minutes of it. The second I thought had the best storyline of all of them. It was all around really good! Definitely my favorite movie of all times. The first movie wasn't too bad but that was like i said hardcore gore. I was pretty grossed out by the end and I'm really into slasher flicks that should tell you something. I urge everyone to give this movie a chance. It had a great story even though it was basically the same as the first movie I think this one was way better as in location great actors great everything! The end was the best very suspenseful.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the story of a couple whose only son Adam is diagnosed with cancer but it's by no means a weepie as from very early in the film we learn that Adam pulls through. So what does this leave us with? Well perhaps more interestingly the movie becomes more about Romo Jrmie Elkam and Juliette's Valrie Donzelli struggle to stay together. With knowledge of Adam's safety in the bank we can concentrate on the two main protagonists and whether they will be able to survive as a unit.The film is also scripted by the pair and directed by Donzelli and it must be said they are a remarkable duo. Their onscreen characters are very likeably played if a little saccharine sweet while they fall in love in the first twenty minutes. However while some of the early musical interludes might jar a little they don't feel entirely out of place with the scenario. Their relationship forms the beating heart of this movie though and they play off each other beautifully gradually winning the audience round and permitting forgiveness for the conceit of their characters' names!Bringing a rather sudden end to the romantic beginnings new baby Adam arrives on the scene and all is not rosy in the garden from very early on. Parents beware the quarter of an hour that gradually builds up to Adam's diagnosis is as genuinely affecting a movie sequence as I can remember from any recent movie outing and I'm only an uncle!And from there it becomes about coping about managing and about survival. As I said the audience is blessed with the foreknowledge that the couple do not have so we're in a privileged position but as Romo and Juliette soldier on rising to every new challenge and facing up to every fresh heartbreaking piece of news you are still right there with them. Their support networks too play an important role in the movie but really this is the story of Romo and Juliette's struggle to survive.If cinema is about escapism then 'Declaration of War' will certainly transport you placing you right in the middle of this young couple's lives as they battle with something you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.I can't recommend it highly enough for lovers of French film or possibly even just for parents who need a reminder of how lucky they are. It's bordering on stereotypical picturepostcard French in the opening twenty minutes as the two central characters tombent amoureuses... but kind of suits the mood and is perhaps intentional. Two excellent central performances make it very watchable but an excellent narrative device elevates this story from a traditional weepie into entirely more interesting territory. A real contender for the Oscar next March.".

And not only do they write the story and direct at least the woman but they play their own characters as well carefully replicating a reality that almost destroyed them. How courageous how daring! A move close to sheer madness... How on earth can one go through the pangs of such an unbearable ordeal... TWICE? And how the devil can one make such a luminous film able to deal with such a risky subject without falling into the many traps it contains? And how can one manage to give people hope and confidence by talking about death during most of a film? Well miracles exist since Valrie Donzelli director writer main actress makeup artist and hair stylist! and her former life companion Jrmie Elkam cowriter main actor have done just that with La guerre est dclare giving an example that such a feat is within the realms of possibility.They manage this achievement by immediately finding the right tone and by never falling out of tune afterward. A winning principle announced in the title Declaration of War for both the characters are seen fighting instead of crying and moaning. This does not mean they never express their suffering  how could they help it?  but it is the dynamics of their struggle that is put forward not the apathy their grief and anxiety are likely to generate.Valrie Donzelli is to be given special credit for her inspired direction. Not only does she pour her heart and soul into the filming of this painful chronicle but she also proves imaginative and creative making use of an amazing variety of registers devices and techniques which wind up making this movie unique incongruous gags including during the most dramatic times classic documentary the way the little boy is treated in turns in Marseilles in Paris and in Villejuif original montages inspired use of musical pieces creating the unexpected but effective cohabitation of Vivaldi Delerue and pop music resort to musical comedy with the characters occasionally singing their feelings use of metaphor Juliette's disjointed run through the hospital corridor. And those examples are only a sample of all the personal touches Valrie Donzelli brings to this exceptional work.Never indulging in pathos or sentimentalityLa guerre est dclare nevertheless contains very moving scenes or sequences my personal favorite being the one in which the unfortunate couple unable to find sleep on the night before their son's operation tell each other their fears to best calm their fears.A great shock but a salutary one La guerre est dclare both the sincere account of a personal drama and a talented work of art for all is one of the year 2011's masterpieces.".

Not only does she pour her heart and soul into the filming of this painful chronicle but she also proves imaginative and creative making use of an amazing variety of registers devices and techniques which wind up making this movie unique incongruous gags including during the most dramatic times classic documentary the way the little boy is treated in turns in Marseilles in Paris and in Villejuif original montages inspired use of musical pieces creating the unexpected but effective cohabitation of Vivaldi Delerue and pop music resort to musical comedy with the characters occasionally singing their feelings use of metaphor Juliette's disjointed run through the hospital corridor. And those examples are only a sample of all the personal touches Valrie Donzelli brings to this exceptional work.Never indulging in pathos or sentimentalityLa guerre est dclare nevertheless contains very moving scenes or sequences my personal favorite being the one in which the unfortunate couple unable to find sleep on the night before their son's operation tell each other their fears to best calm their fears.A great shock but a salutary one La guerre est dclare both the sincere account of a personal drama and a talented work of art for all is one of the year 2011's masterpieces.";

It's not the same old story of a family grieving to a new born's certain aberrancy. It's beyond that. It's about people who can overthrow anything with a weapon as simple as a smile and a gear as simple as adaptability and confidence. A good observer will grasp a light undertone that emphasizes on the importance of having the right partner in times of need. What cant you conquer when you have a partner like Juliette who is smart profound charming understanding and strong willed something that's extinct today. A well established RomeoJuliet chemistry that can smile their way through every phase of life. And look they win in the end. All they had was the courage and happy go easy attitude. They adapt everything that comes their way and walks over it saying Hey! Well tried. But we're moving on. Could all of us be that way the world would be the best place to live in.

	schema:reviewBody "HEAVY SPOILERS Teresa a Austrian woman in the age of about 50 spends her holidays in a Kenyan beach resort. She meets there her disgustingly horny friends and soon it is clear that all the holidays are about is to get sex with young black men. Teresa is a little reluctant first not knowing how to get in touch. This changes quickly when she ends up in a cheap motel with the first of the many intrusive street merchantsdefacto male prostitutes. He treats her too harsh so she leaves in horror before intercourse starts. Though agonized at first she meets the next day the softer and seemingly more romantic Munga with whom she spends two days drinking smoking dope and having sex. Munga starts to have steadily increasing financial demands covered up by stories tho help relatives who are sick and in need. When Teresa refuses to give him more money he forbids her to touch him and hides from her the next day. You can run but never hide  soon she discovers at the beach that his sister she got to know earlier is actually his wife and berates him rips his rastas and beats him in a humiliating way at the public beach  only to have sex with the next merchant later that day. This time she gives that guy money without second thought when he tells her that he needs it for the treatment of his brother who just happened to have a motorcycle accident. The climax is Teresas birthday. While her teenage daughter does not give her a phone call even when she reminds her on the mailbox for that her Austrian friends have a surprise. They try to start a sex party and have one Kenyan man with them who strips for them. The four elder women try to heat him up by stripping themselves getting touchy e.g. so that he will get an erection  without success. Later when the friends left Teresa tries to have sex with a little shy clerk of the club whom he seem earlier when she and another friend make fun of him in a little offensive way. Teresa throws him out angrily when he refuses to lick her pussy. Then she cries. Seidls paradise love is a multidimensional movie who is definitely hard to watch for the viewer. Especially the sex scenes are kind of an endurance test for several reasons. You see the extremely obese Teresa partly or fully naked and some of her friends. Also while you never see the actual intercourse the scenes are very long and they deal mainly about how Teresa kind of negotiates in an awkward way what the males shall do and not for example how to touch her titties. While many other viewers say that they feel more for the Teresa towards the end of the movies I feel different. When her need for a little romanticism is put to a test by Munga and she learns how prostitution there works she becomes kind of mean and even more demanding for cheap sex. In between she deals  towards her friends and the men  with her selfpity telling them how ugly she is. The whole prostitution business is shown very realistic here and not so much different how it works for men. I like how Seidl shows despite their is a mutual business agreement it does not really work out many times. The Austrian women here are despite sexhungry often a little racist and many times openly offensive towards the Kenyans. The interesting thing is that the environment in that very touristic place supports that attitude. The most impressive picture to me is early in the movie On one side in the club the allwhite tourists laying on their sun lounges on the other side at the start of the beach the lurking street merchants just separated by a little white line  guarded by a paramilitary looking black guard of the club. The imagery is great anyways the camera man of this has a very good feeling how to use light and manages f.e. to show the dreamlike beach in a bright but also cold and threatening light one time. This movie is not fun never mind what other critics say and though some parts of it are very satirical I think it goes more in the drama direction  with a main character that is hard to like. Anyway it is strong powerful movie but only for those people who like to look in the depths of human society enjoy highly realistic movies or like movies where you can think a lot about.".

We were told that it was the first of three related films the two successors to be named 'Paradise Faith' already released and 'Paradise Hope' to be released in 2013. Quote from festival announcement On Kenya's beaches they are known as 'sugar mamas' European women who seek out African boys selling love to earn a living. Teresa a 50yearold Austrian woman travels to this vacation paradise. 'Paradise Love' tells of older women and young men of Europe and Africa and of the exploited who end up exploiting others.The festival screening took place in a fully booked venue 225 seats. More than half very unusual of the people stayed for the final QA with the principal actor Margarete Tiesel and there were also unusual many relevant questions. She admitted upfront that she had not read the script prior to shooting though she did after wards. She is a professional actor but the African boys are all amateurs.What struck me the most when watching this film is that the boys never ask money for their services in a direct way. Rather they always seem to have a family member in financial difficulties badly in need of financial support medical bills being the most common story. We see that happen on Terese's first trip outside the hotel where her boy takes her to his sister not really as we see later on and subsequently a school teacher. Each one has a sad story and needs money. And when she does not cough up enough money the boy refuses to be touched anymore. On her second trip Teresa seems very aware of all this recognizing it as standard operating procedure. She starts playing along without feeling awkward about it and gradually appears to have found her way in this game.In the final QA the subject exploitation came about several times apparently without easy answers. It is not exploitation per se when both sides look happy with the arrangement. She talked with several other women there with ample experience in the matter. Some bought for instance a motor bike for her African lover or even a house and travel a few times per year to the area. The boys speak one of the usual European languages English German etc which one is dependent on the area. Yet while the story progresses we nevertheless observe a certain language barrier several times causing misunderstandings about mutual intentions.All in all this is a remarkable feature film bordering on a documentary about sex tourism. We have heard about sex tourism in Thailand particularly for men. This time it is about women with money to spend. The film clearly demonstrates to us how it works. What the films shows is very explicit even to the extent that we see Teresa explaining to the boy how she prefers to be touched and we closely observe him learning which way works best for her. This scene marks the duality of their respective roles not parasitic but rather symbiotic. Showing all this in a natural way without too much embarrassment for us viewers is an achievement in itself. I scored a 5 out of 5 for the audience award when leaving the theater.".

There is no transition to this new world no waiting on airports no planning for the journey we are immediately swept as if by the urge to be there. Once there we see as she does stylized images arranged symmetries. In the hotel resort there are trivial games senile safety control the Africans are confections to be toyed with and enjoyed ranges for the eye to roam. The question that looms is is she there for the encounter and surprise or merely looking for images to bring home to a dull life? You'll see this early in the metaphor with the monkey that takes her bait but refuses to be photographed eluding her. More importantly are we here on cinematic vacation or to come to an understanding? Out in the streets there is a more palpable tension however all about baring yourself to be seen and the quest for meaning. I like the subject the lush Africa the sexual frankness the fact that sex and meaning are sublimated in a viewing space between people.So I believe this could have been tremendously powerful stuff in the right hands. Alas the filmmaker is Austrian and this means that we see in the same stark light they bring to everything they do from logic to politics to music. What does this mean a stark light ? It means every encounter has to be sooner rather than later exposed as meaningless because the ultimate point here is some void at heart the same that originally creates the journey there which is also the filmmaker's. It means that he can't let go and not allowing himself to yet know coast on the tension of an encounter that may be false that most probably is false yet like movies and love work in life that we can throw ourselves in it as if it is real and in doing so imbue it with truth weave it from air. A Mood for Love with a question behind each glance. I'm dreaming of the film Cassavetes would do all about building to this more or less certain horizon of betrayal with momentary truths small moments like passing a joint in the dark riding this tension hiding the logical knowledge. So I lament this because his failure is the same as his heroine's failure to find fulfillment. He resorts to more obvious stuff merely chronicling the lack disillusionment loneliness and how that gives rise to dehumanizing spectacle as in the scene where the woman is offered in her hotel room a witless African to tease and fondle. Ordinary.You can even see this reluctance in his camera when now and then he lets it wander we don't deeply feel the textures we are never truly enmeshed in the world. Again this is as much cinematic translation of the woman's pov as it is inescapable worldview for the filmmaker the same boxed worldview that Herzog runs from by journeying to the edges to throw himself on the manifold strangeness of things letting his eye roam staging boats tugged over hills so it can become real.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the first part of Ulrich Seidl's PARADISE trilogy you just have to answer to one question to know whether this Austrian director is doing worth watching material or not  would I like to watch the second part? And well I would. There's really nothing quite like this film for better or worse although some of themes it touches aren't something we couldn't find elsewhere. It's about a woman or better said women in their fifties or something who aren't happy  they have never been satisfied with the way they look and with their whole love life. The first unusual thing is the setting the African country Kenya. To call this some sort of definitive look at the culture of Kenya would be simplify things very much. It's really just a look at the Kenya that's close to the tourists. Nevertheless is a very rich film for that matter with a quick learning of part of the culture  it's funny that we get to learn some African phrases that most likely well one in specific will make you remember Disney's THE LION KING!The reason we don't see much of Kenya is that our main character Teresa Margarethe Tiesel is the representation of a tourist who's not traveling just to know a different part of the world but to find a new part of herself and to do that she doesn't need to go very far from her hotel. PARADISE LOVE is one of those films that constantly make you feel sorry for the respective protagonist. Ulrich definitely succeeded in creating a piece where things aren't totally messed up only superficially. Teresa is leaving her country Austria for the paradise of the title. The paradise refers to both the place and the things she believes is up to a complete sexual freedom in Africa that ultimately could end in an experimentation of love  love is unlike in Europe eternal in Africa says one of the main Kenyan characters As you can tell things aren't going to be as good as planned for Teresa. You may be thinking this is therefore a very sad film with the likes of a Todd Solondz film. After all we have an upper middle class European woman with overweight continually suffering as sadness and dissatisfaction. Like I said superficially things aren't quite depressing. PARADISE LOVE is a womenhavingcrazyvacationfun film too  I'm writing this as a guy in his early twenties but if there's an audience that will get the film is definitely women in their forties or something close. What we have here is a very feminine point of view. Therefore its sexual content is unusual as well  I'm pretty sure this film is one of the most if not the most explicit one of the year yet we don't have any intercourse scene. It's a take on male prostitution too  this is why I think the explicit material is only there to capture those women's lust and essentially idea of a real paradise. In other words there's a lot of male nudity you've been warned! The film is a deep and very different sortof chick flick a sad look at a real issue that sometimes is funny. Watched it on 02 December 2012".

	onyx:emotionText "After watching the first part of Ulrich Seidl's PARADISE trilogy you just have to answer to one question to know whether this Austrian director is doing worth watching material or not  would I like to watch the second part? And well I would. There's really nothing quite like this film for better or worse although some of themes it touches aren't something we couldn't find elsewhere. It's about a woman or better said women in their fifties or something who aren't happy  they have never been satisfied with the way they look and with their whole love life. The first unusual thing is the setting the African country Kenya. To call this some sort of definitive look at the culture of Kenya would be simplify things very much. It's really just a look at the Kenya that's close to the tourists. Nevertheless is a very rich film for that matter with a quick learning of part of the culture  it's funny that we get to learn some African phrases that most likely well one in specific will make you remember Disney's THE LION KING!The reason we don't see much of Kenya is that our main character Teresa Margarethe Tiesel is the representation of a tourist who's not traveling just to know a different part of the world but to find a new part of herself and to do that she doesn't need to go very far from her hotel. PARADISE LOVE is one of those films that constantly make you feel sorry for the respective protagonist. Ulrich definitely succeeded in creating a piece where things aren't totally messed up only superficially. Teresa is leaving her country Austria for the paradise of the title. The paradise refers to both the place and the things she believes is up to a complete sexual freedom in Africa that ultimately could end in an experimentation of love  love is unlike in Europe eternal in Africa says one of the main Kenyan characters As you can tell things aren't going to be as good as planned for Teresa. You may be thinking this is therefore a very sad film with the likes of a Todd Solondz film. After all we have an upper middle class European woman with overweight continually suffering as sadness and dissatisfaction. Like I said superficially things aren't quite depressing. PARADISE LOVE is a womenhavingcrazyvacationfun film too  I'm writing this as a guy in his early twenties but if there's an audience that will get the film is definitely women in their forties or something close. What we have here is a very feminine point of view. Therefore its sexual content is unusual as well  I'm pretty sure this film is one of the most if not the most explicit one of the year yet we don't have any intercourse scene. It's a take on male prostitution too  this is why I think the explicit material is only there to capture those women's lust and essentially idea of a real paradise. In other words there's a lot of male nudity you've been warned! The film is a deep and very different sortof chick flick a sad look at a real issue that sometimes is funny. Watched it on 02 December 2012";

	schema:reviewBody "Without knowing anything more about this than getting quite OK reviews I went to see this as they had taken the film I came to see off the day before. Choosing away Skyfall Stone's Savages and the German film Barbara because I heard this film was provoking.It is provoking at least to many I'll guess. But I found it to be a very good film with just as much emphasis on other qualities. The opening scene is simply hilarious an made the whole crowd instantly fall in a good mood with a LOLmoment but not without us feeling a tiny bit of shame. This has nothing to do with the film itself except giving us a glimpse of the main person Theresa's background. Completely brilliant way to set tone and making the audience aware an f...king hilarious!We soon see her as a 50'ish woman preparing for holiday trip to Kenya. Arriving there we see the obvious goal for a paradise holiday in the sun and obviously something a lot of German speaking tourists do as the locals are quite good in German phrases. we are soon seeing that sex tourism is quite big down here and a reluctant Teresa goes along after getting recommendations from her experienced travel friend which already is going steady with her sugar mama.As th film plays on we get a close look at what this sex traffic is all about. Not much prettier than we have learned from men's trips to Thailand or Indonesia. It unravels both he understanding of the reason as well as the less pretty sides of it. It's shown in a good way but is more an more showing the unpleasant and nasty sides of it as well. It's after a while thrown Directly and literary in your face.Director Ulrich Seidl is perhaps taking after his well known and brilliantly provoking countryman Mikael Haneke and succeeds very well. This is the first if a trilogy starting with Paradise as first word in the title. I'll be sure to see the two next ones as this simply gave me the same great feeling to watch as the first of Kieslowki's Trois coleurs back in 1993. This film is many things at the same time and a gem for those not to easily offended. It's fun in a quirky Scandinavian way it's beautifully filmed and great and neatly told. It doesn't take a stand but it wants you to do so. It's both beautiful and sad both funny and tragic both charming and disgusting. But most if all it feels very true and not at all fake. But I think all the laughs here are fabulously loosening up what gives us bad tastes in mouth. It makes the very balanced even though taking up a severe subject to discussion.I guess many will have troubles watching the naked bodies as well as heavily overweight women indulging in sex acts with young local's but I heavily recommend to give it a shot. This gem won't leave you for a long time. It even gives a great picture of Kenya as a travel goal with th draw backs of what tourism might lead to. Stunningly good filmmaking and surely something you haven't seen on screen before!".

From adjectives limited to a spectrum anywhere between grotesque obese and tubby comparisons in style between Seidl and fellow Austrian Michael Haneke to referencing the exact same quote by Werner Herzog used in describing Seidl's 2011 documentary Animal Love I could not help but wonder what the heck is going on? And when did pundits unite in thinking that female sex tourism in cinema would die eight years ago after Laurent Cantet's Heading South Vers le sud a French film based on three middleaged women and their search of sex and intimacy with Haitian men?Herzog's candid remark conflated into a handy overused critique isn't worth repeating here.Loneliness exploitation the prison room of cultural and self repression are themes in this Austrian drama. Cruelly soaked in the warm currents of colonial past Ulrich Seidl meticulously sincerely unapologetically paints the portrait of Teresa Margarete Tiesel  a 50 year old woman living in Vienna upper middleclass divorced mother of a teenager. Most of the film depicts events that gradually unfold during her lone vacation on the shores of Kenya.Sex tourism is probably only part of the canvas though. For in the process it scratches and destroys the heteronormative lenses with which we understand taboos. Written by Seidl and Veronika Franz Paradise Love is a film so explicitly honest to the point of being awkward that most viewers embarrassed for Teresa will look away during moments of vulnerability and selfrevelation. The camera of cinematographers Edward Lachman and Wolfgang Thaler looks on unflinchingly during a scabrous encounter with her first companion does he find her attractive? Isn't she too old for him? Why would he want to make love to her  a beached whale with sagging upper glands belly full of fat soggy exterior flawed with celluloid? But most pressingly having considered the social realist tradition of framing with minimum distortion why would anyone wince and look away when confronted with mirrors reflecting the consequence of corporeality?This seventeenth feature by the controversial auteur has been slammed shamed and shunned for being brazen in its visual audacity. Suggestions that Seidl manipulates viewers with exploitative logic are also suspect in affecting the film's overall reception. Yet it would be prudent to withhold from believing such. In Paradise Love  seekers movers malcontent inhabitants are drenched in the rich luxurious texture of a sunlit paradise. The narrative path however doesn't build up to sex love or Maslowian truth as its payoff lesser films would.I have no doubt this film is a difficult watch because Ulrich Seidl forces Teresa and us to acknowledge the naive illusions of paradisaical beauty. But in rhythmic throes that oscillate between anguish ecstasy and depravity  the African rendition of La Paloma perhaps a bit saddened by its contrast with the ugly ordinary trading off between flesh and soul  Seidl derides the remarkable irony of what it means to be human. The dewyeyed bourgeois privilege suffers. I suppose this is the real reason why Paradise Love can seem so offensive and unglamorous.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com".

It premiered In competition at the 65th Cannes International Film Festival 2012 was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival in 2012 and is a AustriaGermanyFrance coproduction which was shot on location in Vienna Austria and Kenya and produced by producers Philippe Bober and Christine Ruppert. It tells the story about Teresa a middleaged single mother who lives in Austria with her adolescent daughter. Teresa is looking for the love she can't find in her native country and goes on vacation to Kenya with three friends. There are many young men to choose from in East Africa but in her search for an affectionate partner she is bothered to the point of harassment. Teresa begins to doubt that she'll ever find someone who can love her as she is but then she meets a young man named Munga and her hot and sunny holiday changes. Precisely and statically directed by Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints draws a pointed and unrestrained portrayal of a woman's meeting with another culture and her quest for love in a cynical paradise far away from home. While notable for its distinct naturalistic milieu depictions colorful production design by production designers Andreas Donhauser and Renate Martin prominent cinematography by American cinematographer Edward Lachman and Austrian cinematographer Wolfgang Thaler strong contrasts and raw authenticity this characterdriven drama challenges the perception of beauty and depicts a fine though unsettling study of character. This bleak and at times humiliating portrait of human beings and interpersonal communication where a woman sets out to buy love for money and tries to find out if being loved for one's personality rather than one's surface is possible is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure improvised dialog variegated characters the brave and reverent acting performance by Margarethe Tiesel who really goes into the core of her contradicting protagonist and the realistic acting performances by the firsttime actors. An externally bright internally dark and scornfully humorous tale about an inhumane sex market where all boundaries have been crossed and where the distinction between animals and human beings are long gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first movie of the 'Paradise' trilogy. All the three stories happen in the same time in different locations with different themes. But the protagonists from all the three were a family like two sisters and a daughter. So this movie which unfolds the story of 'Love' of a woman who is mother to a 13 year old. And her journey afar seeking men who make love. Kinda never heard about men called 'sugar mamas' so for me this movie was totally afresh.It chronicles the story of a 50 year old Austrian women Teresa who travels to Kenya seeking sexual pleasure. As she arrived her destination to a seaside resort she begin to explore like what most of the European women come there to seek. She finds her man but as they all are prostitute do they find her an attractive as she's a fat woman from the north. She tumble into a confusion state but sooner she things she got her perfect one. Does it long lost or she slip it away as usual for her typical reasons is the remaining.The movie had a strong nude scene all over but not sexual intercourse like reality. If there are no beautiful young women and men that mean it is not belong to an adult movie. Sex is still a sex with any age men and women so I consider it is an adult movie which suits only for selected audience to view. When it comes to the story it was completely different than most of the movie that belongs to male prostitution theme. Much appreciable for the director for his unique approach to tell on the social issues.".

As she arrived her destination to a seaside resort she begin to explore like what most of the European women come there to seek. She finds her man but as they all are prostitute do they find her an attractive as she's a fat woman from the north. She tumble into a confusion state but sooner she things she got her perfect one. Does it long lost or she slip it away as usual for her typical reasons is the remaining.The movie had a strong nude scene all over but not sexual intercourse like reality. If there are no beautiful young women and men that mean it is not belong to an adult movie. Sex is still a sex with any age men and women so I consider it is an adult movie which suits only for selected audience to view. When it comes to the story it was completely different than most of the movie that belongs to male prostitution theme. Much appreciable for the director for his unique approach to tell on the social issues.";

	schema:reviewBody "Paradise Love or Paradies Liebe is Ulrich Seidl's first installment in his Paradise trilogy. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last year but only recently has been widely available. Even on your first glance at a promotional poster or still of the film it is pretty clear that the word paradise is meant to be sarcastic. The film stars Margarete Tiesel as a middle aged Austrian housewife named Teresawho lives in an apartment block in Vienna with her overweight teenage daughter. Teresa is a single mother and longs for a man to satisfy her sexual needs as well as show her love and passion. She and her two friends decide to go on a vacation to Kenya to unwind from the stresses of everyday life. Teresa's friend Inga has visited Kenya multiple times and is a regular patron of it's wide range of male prostitute's. She convinces Teresa to try out their services and claims that the experience is fantastic. Unlike Inga Teresa faces a psychological dilemma of whether on not the young men find her attractive. This leads her to backing out of the sex that she is offered until she meets a man named Munga played by Peter Kazungu who offers his services for free and only asks for love. Unfortunately for him love qualifies as financial aid to his relatives. Teresa soon realizes that she is being used and how low she has sunkDirector Ulrich Seidl seems to have a very bleak and distorted view of the world. Paradise Love is an incredibly depressing examination of the human condition but at the same time it is painfully honest. Similar to Lars Von Trier Seidl seems to enjoy exploring the filth hidden inside human beings and seeing how much humiliation a human being can endure. In no way could I possibly say that I enjoyed this film but it most definitely is good cinema. Despite it being utterly repugnant it does provide some intricate social commentary not only on prostitution but on the state of decay in which Africa is currently in. The film forges it's own sick brand of cynical humor which intentionally does not bring some light to the story but make it feel even more cringe worthy. On a technical level Paradise Love succeeds at showcasing Kenya's beauty as well as diving into it's dark recesses which is topped off by very long takes and tracking shots which are always a great addition to a film.I'm not sure I would like to see it again but nevertheless Paradise Love is a painfully honest example of great social commentary and an examination of Africa's recent decay. Margarete Tiesel gives a great and incredibly brave performance which is topped off with Ulrich Seidl's fantastically disgusting direction. After seeing this I'm very keen on seeing the next installment in the series Paradise Faith".

Nominated for the Palme D'or at this year's Cannes Film Festival where it actually lost out to Amour it's the first part of a trilogy looking at the despicable sides of human nature the following two parts will be screened at festivals in 2013.Just like his other previous works in documentary Jesus You Know and fiction Dog Days Love is an infuriating film whereby we have no idea where the story is going and seemingly Seidl doesn't have a clue either. Shot in his trademark static mid shots with copious amounts of skin on show it's paradoxically beautiful and grotesque. Like a Lucian Freud painting with just as much of his grandfather's' psychoanalytical subtext to boot.Margarete Tiesel plays Teresa a middle aged single parent living in drab suburban Vienna. The first scene sees her smiling from a distance as she watches a class of disabled children fumbleplay on a bumper car track. It's a harrowing typically nasty opening and really sets the film off in mean spirited territory with Seidl doing his token unflinching exploitation gimmick.From here Teresa decides to leave her daughter behind at fat camp and flee to Kenya for a paradisiac holiday. Meeting up with her Austrian expat friend Inge Maux the pair talk in typically colonialist terms about African culture and black men's genitalia. Later on her own she's constantly harangued by the pushy salesmen on the beachfront trying to sell her homemade necklaces and pearls at tourist prices. Although she's reluctant to purchase their crap she willingly buys into the perilous sex tourism trade first as a customer and later as one of it's scammed victims. Bleak in tone yet idyllically colourful in palette the proceeding 90 minutes follows a series of degradations Teresa must go through in her troubled pursuit for paradise.Similarly to his other work flesh and body politics play a central role to the narrative character dynamics and control of the movie. Wandering around in flip flops and skimpy bathing suits Teresa's slightly rotund exterior is used to exaggerate the character's wealth decadence and presumed dominance over the comparatively slight underfed and suffering Kenyans. It's a sentiment made painfully clear in one scene where Teresa partakes in an orgy of sorts where three other overweight GermanAustrian women force a lean black Kenyan man to perform for their pleasure and much to his embarrassment.Whilst this may be the most palatable of Seidl's fiction films it's certainly not an easy watch. At an excessive two hours he wallows for too long in the audiences' discomfort without ever given us a worthwhile payoff. Whilst the landscape is filmed beautifully by regular cinematographer Wolfgang Thaler this bastardised version of Shirley Valentine is a pretty loveless film experience.More reviews at www.366movies.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very sad movie. It explores some of the worst sides of human nature I should say. To begin with I can sympathize with Theresa because her longing for love and sex although she has become too old and fat for Western European men  is after all a natural thing. I feel sorry for her when the African men only try to suck her out of more and more money in a completely shameless way.But then Theresa also changes into someone harder who does not expect love anymore but just seeks sex on her own terms. She is getting ruthless and in the end  and in the company of her women friends who are the same  she can even treat a very young man almost a boy as if he was some kind of animal... By then she has lost me and I feel an equal disgust against the Western women and the African men customers and sellers in the sex trade alike. I have also lost all desire to visit Africa South of Sahara ever...The photo is very bleak and dark and it does not seem very professional. But maybe this is intentional  to make it look more like a documentary or a reality show? I think it would have been more entertaining with Hollywood standard on the photo and filming though.This is not a movie that you should watch if you are already depressed and have doubts about the human race... And absolutely not in the company of children or teenagers as there is a lot of nudity here and sex showed in an unpleasant way  the opposite of romantic. But if you want to learn something about what your sister mother colleague or friend might have been up to on her cultural tour of Gambia or Kenya... you might give it a go!".

A woman a nurse. who is obsessive compulsive about cleanliness and who micromanages her daughter escapes to Kenya for a vacation. She 'loves' her daughter and she wants 'love' from these male prostitutes. The whole concept is extremely sad. Maybe it is true that this is the human condition for some women but I just found it too offensive to watch. It made me sick to my stomach to see the racism and objectification going on. I disagree with other reviewers' descriptions of the sexual frankness and naturalness. The whole film is fraught with awkwardness and vulgarity. None of these characters is really there for love. It is a docudrama on sexual exploitation and racism. And it reveals painfully the incredible imbalance of power that exists on this planet as well as the extreme lack of sexual maturity and ability to create intimacy in our lives. Eros permeates everything and is what can lead us to experience true intimacy and ecstasy. But when all is seen as an object for one's own pleasure for an escape from pain there is no eros no love. Of course the filmmaker isn't trying to show us true love. Obviously this is about the whole problem of the emptiness in these women's lives. And perhaps it shows men who are into sex tourism just what they're doing better than if it were a male centric sex tourist film. But I find it so flat and I agree with one of the reviewers that that is because the director never takes a moment to allow even a bit of connection true humanity to shine through. It's hard to find this scenario plausible because I can't believe that the only thing these woman want to do is get laid. But then again I might be naive. Maybe that is all they want after all.".

That seemed a bit odd to me...then I read a French report on Islamic extremistsmost were surprisingly women converts! Then I began thinking about cults...the Manson Family...mostly women...Branch Davidians....mostly women....and so on. Then there is the phenomenon of the kidnapped girls some of whom had the freedom to run away but refused to do so Elizabeth Smart et al.. While watching Beatles Eight Days a Week which is mainly about the concerts the Beatles gave it struck me that virtually the entire audience was young girls all hysterical. Why???? Then when thinking one day about Obama's mother married a Kenyan student when she was very young then married an Indonesian I stumbled across this subculture of women who search out exotic locales for sex tourism. It's not a new phenomenon but I'm not sure when it began Heading South about female sex tourism is supposedly set in 1979. Bezness as Usual is set in Tunisia in present daybut it concerns what happened almost 30 years agoso c. 1986 or so. Paradise Love is present day so 2012. I am curious when this phenomenon beganwhen women as well as men began taking sex holidays. Maybe the sexual revolution of the 1960s unleashed something??? What's up with all these women? If anyone has a clue please answer in FAQ comments.As for exploitation it is not an easy issue. Clearly the power is in the hands of the EuropeanAmerican women. They have the money they have passports to leave when they're ready and they seem to be relatively safe. One movie said something like Tourists don't die. The beach boys on the other hand know exactly what they're getting into. Yeah you could say they don't have a choice but as Sartre said There is always a choice. And they do have power toothe women get emotionally attached to them they never ever get emotionally attached to the womeneven if they marry them. They manipulate the women as Paradise Love shows so well. The hero of this particular movie is Joseph or something like that the bartender. At the end of the movie he says he wants to have sex with her but is not used to doing such things. In the end his reluctance gets him kicked out of the room. But he is the moral force such as it is of the movie.If this is the face that the West presents in these countries it's no wonder the West is hated and despised. But the womenin all these moviesdon't give a second's thought to that. It's all about them personally and the larger picture is not even on the horizon.This is a good movie in the sense that it at least tries to take a stab at explaining the women's motivations. A second movie Dutch 2016 is Benzess as Usual where the son of one of these vacation idylls returns to meet his father. In this case it's Tunisia. But exactly the same thing is going onolder women using younger poor men for sex. And as hinted at in Headed South in this case the beach boy is taken to the Netherlands and then Switzerland by different women!. He marries both but of course it ends badly. A third movie in this genre is Heading South. In this case it's French and American women in Haiti. But it happens throughout the Caribbean esp. Jamaica. The location changes the story is the same. There are also numerous youtube videos on this theme. And then of course there are books like The White Masai about a young ! Swiss woman who marries a Masaiand not an educated Westernized one but a native from a village living in a mud hut. It's beyond bizarre. She is shocked when things don't work out. I am simply speechless.".

That seemed a bit odd to me...then I read a French report on Islamic extremistsmost were surprisingly women converts! Then I began thinking about cults...the Manson Family...mostly women...Branch Davidians....mostly women....and so on. Then there is the phenomenon of the kidnapped girls some of whom had the freedom to run away but refused to do so Elizabeth Smart et al.. While watching Beatles Eight Days a Week which is mainly about the concerts the Beatles gave it struck me that virtually the entire audience was young girls all hysterical. Why????

	schema:reviewBody "Do not be fooled by the title of this movie or by what you see at the surface during these 2 hours. Despite the music the noises and the bright colors this is a pretty depressing film. And depressing does refer to almost everybody in here. First of all we have a main character who is looking for true love but finds pretty much nothing but scam until she joins in the exploitation at the end. Then there is the African men. Their struggles do not necessarily have to do with emotion but with hoping for a better life and not being afraid of abusing other people emotionally as a consequence of their poverty. And finally it's the other Austrian women in here. If they do what they do with these African men it tells me that their life back at their home must be truly unsatisfying and out of balance.Paradise Love is the first film from Ulrich Seidl's Paradise trilogy. Obviously lots of irony in that title. The other two films are about religion and adolescenceobesity. But back to this one. Seidl was nominated for the Palme d'Or and won Best Picture at the Austrian film Awards. Lead Actress Margarete Tiesel who carried this film nicely with how likable yet suffering a character she portrayed won Best Actress at the same event and was also nominated for a European Film award that went to Riva. The scene when she talks on her daughter's answering machine is pretty heartbreaking. And even if this is probably my least favorite from the trilogy it was a good watch. No doubt Seidl is among the finest Austria currently has to offer. And even if you do not care for this film or like it in terms of the action it is still an interesting watch because it takes us into a culture and society that could not be any more different from the one in which we live. A film that is painful to watch yet it's difficult to look away. Well done by Seidl and I certainly recommend it.".

The Austrian made film was a mix of German and English but with enough subtitles to make it quite watchable. It seemed realistic  real people with different agendas all trying to get what they want and without the usual political correctness seen in so many American films. The leading character seemed very believable  typical overconfident middle aged German on holiday speaking English with German grammar. This film not for everyone  the storyline is not mainstream and hard to relate to if you do not understand the emotional turmoil of aging. It was unusual in that the frequent nudity was of the older and fatter female tourists  it certainly added to the story  but quite unusual for a film.".

Then again the subject may be interesting for age groups of 40 where aging feeling of belonging dream of true everlasting love etc is definitely much more relevant. For me the movie felt empty and a bit too slow. There were some interesting clues left to point finger on how the Western world is dealing with the 3rd world problem or how shallow most people are in foreign cultures but other than that it was a rather painful trip through a world of grotesque reality.To sum up go and see if you're a huge fan of social criticism or Ulrich Seidl otherwise don't waste your time please. Although I have to admit the movie did create some interest towards Seidl's other works as the underlying idea was good just the execution lacked and I hope the other works in the series work out better.

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't looking for anything deep I wasn't looking for anything serious no Oscar winning actors no award winning script I just wanted an action movie this summer we got Death Race a movie where the script and characters are just never explored but the action is non stop and so exciting. I don't know why but we just need action movies like that and one of the things that I did enjoy about this was that it reminded me of those old grind house films that have quick editing and fast paced stories that are just awesome stories to watch because of the stunts. This is a different form of The Fast and The Furious only just not with all the fancy gadgets which I like. Also Jason Statham this guy is just awesome in action movies he makes such a great lead in any action role and is such an awesome tough guy that you don't want to mess with.Based off the 70's film Death Race 2000 it's 2012 the economy is in bad shape employment is down but entertainment is up especially in prison where racing has become the new gladiator fights. Jenson's wife is murdered and he is framed for it landing him him in prison where he is approached by the leader of the Death Race program Hennessey and she offers him to race for his freedom if he can make it out alive. But there's something a little deeper when it seems like he was put in prison on purpose so he could race.Death Race is just pure entertainment it's nothing original we don't really know the characters that well or what their motives are but the reason why this movie is enjoyable is just the awesome action that is endless. I loved the editing it made the race scenes that much more exciting. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for fun like I said before we just need a pure action movie sometimes and Death Race is a perfect film on that level. I had a great time watching this movie and am looking forward to seeing it again for a good time.710".

Roger Corman's name on the producing credits gave me hope at the start and his seal of approval seemed to mean something perhaps as counterweight to Paul W. S.

Fans of the Twisted Metal video game will love the newest wrinkle in the race the addition of weaponry  a needed bloody bump for version 2.0. And what a bump it is with each car's chugging machine guns indiscriminately spewing hot rounds at every foe shredding Detroit steel like it was used Kleenex. It's unabashed gun fetishism at its gleeful best and it makes you want to strap an M60 to the hood of your Prius in order to cut your commute in half.Jason Statham does his standard toughguy job as the scowling Frankenstein Joan Allen plays a ballbusting warden perhaps a bit in the mold of Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched and Ian McShane of Deadwood has a solid cameo as the prisonwise mechanic Coach.

	schema:reviewBody "I shouldn't write reviews for movies like this because it feels like I'm lining up to kick a puppy. A movie like 'Death Race' can only be judged fairly through a set of lowered genre expectations. I'll try but I'm not making any promises. It is fun very loud and unabashedly dumb. It was never envisioned to be anything other than an attempt at 'cool.' The average viewer will  without fail  be able to pick out every moment where Paul W.S. Anderson had an idea during the script writing and thought to himself That'd be awesome! before looking around the room for someone to high five. I shouldn't pick on him because I actually do enjoy his movies. He isn't trying to make 'Casablanca' 'Robocop' is more his style. Just without the boring stuff like characterization and development. And as little subtlety satire or nuance as needed. Unless unintentional or totally by mistake and ironic  That'd be alright.This movie's lone strength is the special effects and it lives and dies by the car chase the machine gun firing and the gory deaths. Michael Bay eat you heart out. Anderson knows the art of kaboom and action junkees should be satisfied with his efforts here  especially during the second race when the 'Dreadnought' enters the race. As long as you numb your brain into not asking serious questions about things like physics. Or how massive amounts of armour on a car wouldn't make flesh and soft tissue any safer in horrifying car crashes. Or how the American economy of the Dystopian future has crumbled but 70 million can still afford the payperview price to watch. Maybe some of the viewers are from Canada.If you were to put any consideration into serious film criticism where 'Death Race' is concerned then you'd be the first one. The movie is so predictable lazy and unambitious that it asks you to hand it the popcorn. In fact have you seen the trailer? You've seen the film. Tyrese's character is homosexual which I thought was stunningly inventive given the scriptwriter. Sliding back into predictability it is used solely to make a few tasteless jokes before being forgotten about. Pretty standard fare for Anderson. If you've watched his other films you know exactly what to expect. Except less. Brain still hurts too much to think about it. I think the annoying thing is that Anderson has potential. I wouldn't keep going to his movies if I didn't enjoy them. It annoys me when the problems at script level are so apparent. He has a tendency to go to predictable places Requisite gay jokes for the prison? Check. Incredibly hot women on screen? Cue horny Rap music since I need a musical cue to point out the obvious. I'm annoyed when one character asks another if they think that they're really the best choice of parent for their offspring and the second character says later Someone once asked me if ... like they and the audience have forgotten the specifics of the first conversation. The audience doesn't need to be spoonfed the obvious. It's a weakness that I hope Anderson can shed. He clearly loves making movies. Trusting the audience a little more and giving us some credit might let him make better ones.The crazy thing is that despite it all I enjoyed 'Death Race.' It is flawed from top to bottom but wears the flaws so honestly and endearingly that you really shouldn't hold it against the movie. Need to go see a mindless distraction for an hour and a half? 'Death Race' isn't a bad choice. With 'Death Race' you get exactly what you expect and exactly what you deserve.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Race puts me in a moral dilemma. Its deliberately trashy shallow and inept and for some reason I still like it. Making my feelings even more conflicted is the fact that it was directed by Paul W.S Anderson a director who tries to turn movies into video games and always fails. But as they say in Hollywood you're only as good as your last picture so Anderson is as good as anyone right now.Not too far into the future our economy has collapsed maybe McCain won poverty reigns supreme and crime has become unstoppable. The prisons are filled beyond capacity and Americas number one form of entertainment is watching the inmates fight to the death. The fights to the death got old and America needed something new. Death Race was invented. The concept is the same as death fighting only you slug it out in an armor plated car with machine guns. The last man alive wins and if you win enough races you win your freedom.Enter Jensen Ames a former Nascar driver prior to his prison conviction who loses his job when the local steel mill is closed. He goes home to his wife and infant daughter only to have a masked man break in and kill his wife. Ames is framed for the crime and sent to prison.Ames is sent to prison where the warden Hennessey played with excellent restraint by Joan Allen informs him that he must replace Frankenstein the most popular death racer if he is ever to leave the prison. Ames agrees and the games begin.As a satire Death Race completely miss fires. The opening prologue informs us of the downfall of American society and its never brought up again. Were informed that Death Race has become more popular then the Super Bowl with more then seventy million viewers but we never see one of those people watching. For some reason the drivers are paired with sexy women to navigate even though they have a pit crew to do that. The women are in it for ratings to make a statement about our own for sex as well as violence but the viewers cant see the women inside the cars so how do they help ratings? Just a few examples of the missed satire.But this isn't an Oliver Stone movie. When you buy a ticket to see Death Race you want to see some death and some racing. And you get both but mostly death. The racing scenes are electrifying. The combination of great stunt work special effects and art direction give this films action the boost of adrenaline it craves. Andersons vision is to immerse us in a Twisted Metal video game and he pulls it off with magnificent results. He captures the sadistic mentality of Twisted Metal perfectly. One driver turns his car around just to shoot another driver.You cant drive backwards his partner remarksI beg to differ. That scene will remind Grand Theft Auto fans of many rampages.Anderson keeps his eyes on the finish line and Death Race moves towards its conclusion in a heart beat. Despite my immersion in the story it was way too predictable. The framed for murder set up is too obvious and before you can even figure it out for yourself they give it away. And as for the ending only a few things can happen at the end a prison movie and you know what they are. But despite the twists you can see coming a mile away they're still satisfying. Death Race is one of the few examples where a bad script can become a good movie.The acting is wonderful all around. Jason Statham is a read deal action super star. He's got the physique of Van Damme and a million times the acting ability. His character's quest to see his daughter gives the film its only sliver of humanity and all a prison movie needs is a sliver.Joan Allen as the warden plays her character so tightly she could probably crack a cashew with her but cheeks. Hennessey is so tightly wound I often wondered is she was going to implode. And towards the end she gets a chance to deliver some perfectly timed profanity. Maybe the last four letter words you ever hear out of her mouth.Newcomer Natalie Martinez has infinite sex appeal as Case the sexy vixen who rides in the passenger seat beside Ames. But more then a pretty face she gets a chance to act and proves shell be around for years to come. Ian McShane is perfect as the simply named Coach. His job is to coach. His weathered face and gravelly voice perfectly fit's the prototype of a man who's spent a long time in prison. But he was good in a stinker like Hot Rod so its no surprise here.Director Paul W.S Anderson has always attempted to make his films into video games and Death Race really does play like a video game. That's the films intention and it works. It satisfies the blood lust lurking deep within us all. Society hasn't gotten to the point where we watch snuff films but watching fictional people kill each other is still loads of fun and so is Death Race. stars".

Were informed that Death Race has become more popular then the Super Bowl with more then seventy million viewers but we never see one of those people watching. For some reason the drivers are paired with sexy women to navigate even though they have a pit crew to do that. The women are in it for ratings to make a statement about our own for sex as well as violence but the viewers cant see the women inside the cars so how do they help ratings? Just a few examples of the missed satire.But this isn't an Oliver Stone movie. When you buy a ticket to see Death Race you want to see some death and some racing. And you get both but mostly death. The racing scenes are electrifying. The combination of great stunt work special effects and art direction give this films action the boost of adrenaline it craves. Andersons vision is to immerse us in a Twisted Metal video game and he pulls it off with magnificent results. He captures the sadistic mentality of Twisted Metal perfectly. One driver turns his car around just to shoot another driver.You cant drive backwards his partner remarksI beg to differ. That scene will remind Grand Theft Auto fans of many rampages.Anderson keeps his eyes on the finish line and Death Race moves towards its conclusion in a heart beat. Despite my immersion in the story it was way too predictable. The framed for murder set up is too obvious and before you can even figure it out for yourself they give it away. And as for the ending only a few things can happen at the end a prison movie and you know what they are. But despite the twists you can see coming a mile away they're still satisfying. Death Race is one of the few examples where a bad script can become a good movie.The acting is wonderful all around. Jason Statham is a read deal action super star. He's got the physique of Van Damme and a million times the acting ability. His character's quest to see his daughter gives the film its only sliver of humanity and all a prison movie needs is a sliver.Joan Allen as the warden plays her character so tightly she could probably crack a cashew with her but cheeks. Hennessey is so tightly wound I often wondered is she was going to implode. And towards the end she gets a chance to deliver some perfectly timed profanity. Maybe the last four letter words you ever hear out of her mouth.Newcomer Natalie Martinez has infinite sex appeal as Case the sexy vixen who rides in the passenger seat beside Ames. But more then a pretty face she gets a chance to act and proves shell be around for years to come. Ian McShane is perfect as the simply named Coach. His job is to coach. His weathered face and gravelly voice perfectly fit's the prototype of a man who's spent a long time in prison. But he was good in a stinker like Hot Rod so its no surprise here.Director Paul W.S Anderson has always attempted to make his films into video games and Death Race really does play like a video game. That's the films intention and it works. It satisfies the blood lust lurking deep within us all. Society hasn't gotten to the point where we watch snuff films but watching fictional people kill each other is still loads of fun and so is Death Race. stars";

Death race plot is quite similar to those racing or survival games plot. It reminds me of DOA Dead Or Alive which Paul produce. The story Jensen Ames Jason Statham is framed for murdering his wife. He is then sent to jail. Hennessey Joan Allen picks him to join the brutal surviving game. He has to kill the other inmates who join the game. The prize is to get his freedom. Every inmate will get his own partner. The partners are mostly some hot chicks. From there exciting vehicles chases scenes and blood ooze out. There isn't much gore but there are blood and language. The plot is so simple but the idea and the chase scenes make my heart pound. It is like watching a survival game unfolding by itself.It just explode the screen and your time and nothing else. And you won't care about the plot you will just care about the thrilling game. Overall Those expecting a move to kill time this is one.

Death Race has given me something worthy of hate and deserving of the dishonor of being the worst film of 2008. When Statham is stripped of his predictable yet consistent charisma someone has messed up something awful.Inspired by the cult classic Death Race 2000 this is a prime example of a remake done wrong where earsplitting sound and migraineinducing camera moves make one feel trapped inside a twohour earthquake. The action doesn't thrill and the characters are developed through egregious oneliners and clich events. In 2012 the economy has collapsed and an American public the upperclass only I guess eager to let off some steam finds their opiate in Death Race a payperview event where prisoners condemned to die on Terminal Island vie for the ultimate prize freedom. It's an old premise but one that has been retooled to entertaining effect in other films.Even lousier than the dialog and Anderson's attentiondeficit technique is the characters who are not only a catalog of bland stereotypes Family Man framed for a crime he didn't commit Stuttering Nerd Hardened Old Sage and the token HipHop Styled Badass but utterly fail to convince us for a second that they're hardened killing machines deserving of their sentence. As a result the bloodshed that ensues is pedestrian and ineffectual and even worse when played for ironic effect while the outcome of Death Race is as predictable as you would expect the total lack of Bmovie charm and fun is simply unforgivable.Stranded in this murk is Joan Allen who as the blackhearted warden Hennessy seems to be channeling an androgynous cross between Louise Fletcher and Keanu Reeves but is relegated to standing around watching monitors while delivering Anderson's subpar dialog. What should come across as icy methodical menace with maybe a bit of tongueincheek irony is instead sleepwalking boredom proving that great actors cannot always salvage terrible scripts. When even the head villain is a clich devoid of personality to the point where her eventual fate elicits total indifference you know you have messed up something awful.For all its efforts to pummel on a miserably superficial level Death Race left me feeling nothingnot empathy for the characters not excitement at the alleged action which is cut so rapidly it's next to impossible to tell what's happening and where just a void left unfilled by anything resembling experience.

	schema:headline " Ebert Is Right";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of Roger Ebert one thing I have quickly noticed about his reviews is that the worst insult he can give to a movie is  that it resembles a video game  . Click on the external reviews on the left and look up Ebert's review and you'll find in one short paragraph of his that it's impossible to add anything because he has all the angles covered Still I may as well contribute something to this page . At least one thing the producers of this remake have got right is if you don't like the opening sequence then at least they're putting their cards on the table letting the audience know where the movie is going . If you get invited round to a friend's house for them to show you their new racing game on their play station and you're not very entertained merely watching a game then you probably be too thrilled by watching this remake of DEATH RACE 2000 One can't help thinking that after casting Statham and McShane perhaps the producers should have just made their own film instead of doing a remake of a film that far from being a masterpiece was at least very entertaining . The first third of the movie is by far the best part . Blue collar worker Jensen Ames receives his pay packet at the end of the month and goes home to his wife and before he knows it he's in a rough tough prison where inmates are beaten up for infractions such as swearing or because the guards feel like it .

Anyone doing time for minor crimes such tax evasion is not considered so it's okay for Ames to go on a race killing members of the Aryan brotherhood and other assorted violent criminals because Ames is really a good guy . It's never revealed why the state would think it's a good idea why all these psychos get armoured cars complete with 30mm cannon to race about in but one never questions the internal logic of a video game".

	onyx:emotionText "Being a big fan of Roger Ebert one thing I have quickly noticed about his reviews is that the worst insult he can give to a movie is  that it resembles a video game  . Click on the external reviews on the left and look up Ebert's review and you'll find in one short paragraph of his that it's impossible to add anything because he has all the angles covered Still I may as well contribute something to this page . At least one thing the producers of this remake have got right is if you don't like the opening sequence then at least they're putting their cards on the table letting the audience know where the movie is going . If you get invited round to a friend's house for them to show you their new racing game on their play station and you're not very entertained merely watching a game then you probably be too thrilled by watching this remake of DEATH RACE 2000 One can't help thinking that after casting Statham and McShane perhaps the producers should have just made their own film instead of doing a remake of a film that far from being a masterpiece was at least very entertaining . The first third of the movie is by far the best part . Blue collar worker Jensen Ames receives his pay packet at the end of the month and goes home to his wife and before he knows it he's in a rough tough prison where inmates are beaten up for infractions such as swearing or because the guards feel like it . Looking on the bright side inmates are still allowed to smoke so it's not all bad . Good news too if you're a lesbian in a female prison because the inmates make Angelina Jolie look like Freddy Kruger Since the film then needs to justify it being a remake featuring car chases and a large body count logic gets thrown out of the window .

	schema:reviewBody "Regardless of the politicallycorrect finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes this was a fun film to watch simply because it entertained. It was a good diversion filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosteronegonewild. In other words this was a typical Jason Statham film. No matter how many of these ultramacho men he plays he gets away with it with charm and likability.In this story Statham as Jensen Ames is like David battling Goliath but with no slingshot and Goliath having a flame thrower and AK47 too. Yet you just know David will a find to defy all odds! Here are some movie clichs of today. See if they sound familiar.Not only has our hero suffer with his beautiful and loving wife murdered but he's framed for the kill. Sent a brutal prison he finds the female warden is responsible and the killer of his wife also is in the jail. Too add salt to the wounds that guy taunts Jensen. Filmmakers haven't made a niceguy warden since the 1950. Here the sadistic boss is a woman Hennessey played by Joan Allen who I thought had some class before I saw this film. Spewing the fword cocsucker and a few other choice words sort of ruined that image I had of her.Anyway the mean old warden got our hero in prison there so he can be the new Frankenstein race driver. The races at her prison it turns out are filmed live and are big internet moneymakers for her. Frankenstein is the favorite driver of the computeraudience but he's too injured to go on so Hennessey recruits Mr. Ames whom she knows is a great driver.Mostly there are nothing but bad folks in here and a lot of ultraviolent scenes oneaftertheother. You also have other clich prison characters the kind you see in all prison films since The Longest Yard. Beware of jiggling handheld camera scenes if that kind of thing gives you a headache.Having said all that I admit the film is interesting starttofinish the racing scenes terrific the film effectively manipulative and overall qualifies as a decent means of entertainment. Statham is the new Steve Seagal JeanClaude VanDamme etc  but that's okay some of their movies were fun to watch too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis  In 2012 the United States economy collapses and life for everyone is not the same. Once a NASCAR champion Jensen Ames Jason Statham hits rock bottom and spent several years in prison. His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy Janaya Stephens and having a baby girl. Then the steel mill closes and he loses his job. But that was not the worst thing to happen to Jenson that day. Suzy is brutally murdered and he is framed for her murder. Jenson is sent to Terminal Island the worst and toughest forprofit prison in the country run by Warden Hennessey Joan Allen. She has created the country's most popular payperview sport a killorbekilled car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins. Every inmate driver is driving a monster car that they built which is loaded with machine guns missiles flamethrowers napalm and no rules. Warden Hennessey convinces Jensen to secretly take the place of the late 4time superstar winner Frankenstein and wear his metallic mask in the race. If Jensen wins just one race he can go home to his baby daughter. To get to the finish line Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.My Comment  This is kind of a remake inspired by the 1975 movie Death Race 2000 in name only. This movie stands on its own. The title Death Race tells it all. If you want to see an action pack race where all the drivers go through a gauntlet of death then this movie is for you. There are some scenes that take the race to the max. If you ever had road rage I am sure you would love to be driving one of these cars. You can see why the forprofit prison puts on these races because I calculated that they would make a tremendous profit of 12.5 billion for 3 payperview races. Jason Statham played his usually part as the tough kickass Jensen Ames very well. I know everybody will like the ending. Universal Pictures 139 minutes Rated R810".

I really enjoyed this movie because the story was great and it had a lot of meaning. This was a great movie to start ending the summer with. The acting was very good. Jason Staham played a perfect role maybe his best role yet. Tyrese Gibson added a good performance as well. The stunts and driving that was performed in this movie was amazing. The visuals were so cool and so were the special effects. the movie really was entertaining and a wild ride from beginning to end. Just strap in and get ready for a really fun enjoyable action packed film. This movie holds nothing back it goes for it all. The blood was crazy and their were a ton of people dying. I also loved the originality of this film. I don't think there are to many maybe no movies that are anything like this movie. The title for this movie describes the movie perfectly. This was definitely worth seeing for a couple dollars. I will see it again and again. It is way better than what I was expecting it to be. It isn't boring for one second in the movie at all. Another great thing was the movie was very unpredictable. Twists and turns kept coming in every scene in the movie. The outcome was very good. Overall this movie was great and you will be very happy in the end after you see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Race was written and directed by Paul W.S Anderson a filmmaker whose toiled away trying to make the perfect movie based on a video game. I'll give you a few moments to process that before I sayyeah that's right he's made some really terrible movies. Death Race actually looks sort of fun though definitely a racing film that will erase the memory of the Speed Racer Technicolor DreamCoat at least and Jason Statham is usually so good in movies like this that he'd make Fast and the Furious look like Beach Blanket Bingo all by himself. This may be Anderson's first real entertaining movie but there has been some question as to whether it really is his movie. Writer Adam Stone says Anderson stole his work leading to some speculation of plagiarism and possibly to a denied wide release. So there are two questions one of course will be answered if your reading this review and the other will be is this movie even worth stealing in the first place? Statham stars as Jensen Ames a former professional racer turned Steelmill worker. It's the future 2012 and work is hard to find. Ames is laid off from the steelmill and when he comes home his wife is murdered by a masked assailant and he is framed for it. Months later he finds himself in Terminal Prison the bitch to a domineering warden named Hennessey Joan Allen. Since the prison system has become overcrowded the prison participates in a death race a payperview event that allows people to watch cons in cars equipped with machine guns rocketlaunchers napalm and other goodies try to kill each other for sport. Hennessey wants Ames to drive and wear the mask of a famous and muchloved competitor Frankenstein so that her viewer ratings can stay up and she makes the promise that if Ames wins the race he can have his freedom. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Ames will become the new Frankenstein and its not long before he is going up against violent and vicious competitors including three time winner Machine Gun Joe Tyrese Gibson. Watching this movie I could just imagine a group of 13year old boys sitting behind me each wearing his WWF and StoneCold Steve Austin shirts having a gay old time with it. So much so that I'm surprised the movie actually went for an Rrating. It's incredibly dumb and for the most part uninvolving but going back to the Rrating it does have some decent carnage. The movie is shot in a dreary blue setting letting us know that the world is no longer a warm and loving place but a cold violent and ugly looking cess pool. The story means next to nothing and is mostly a threestage race that gets increasingly redundant as it goes along. Cars go around in circles really fast blood bullets and explosions ensue people meet grisly deaths and then everything happens all over again. Death Race does have a few actual dramatic car duels however one where Ames goes up against the man that killed his wife and another when he and Machine Gun Joe go up against a tank. The rest is take it or leave it stuff that will interest you only if your really gungho about your blood guts and soupedup killer cars.Statham is perfect for this type of role though giving Ames a gruff hardcore quality that's even more high octane than the cars. And Joan Allen is his perfect antagonist. Icy manipulative and devious she makes Hennessey one of the better villains to come out this summer. Its just too bad she's not apart of a better movie. And like always Ian McShane is gravelvoiced testosterone. I think that Tyrese Gibson is falling into a pattern here and I hope someone takes him out of it soon. As he showed in Baby Boy he is a much better actor than being the sidekick in racecar movies.Death Race has some fun and the actors do what they can but its not so much a movie than an excuse to watch carnage and fast cars. When you see an action movie that's this dumb you know the summer is pretty much over.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer seemed to suggest that this is another take on the Running Man theme. Actually the original Death Race came out before the RM novel but I did not see it so I do not know how close the 2008 version is to the one from 1975. However I do know that the main plot of the 2008 version is essentially identical to that of RMa guy wrongfully imprisoned and exploited for his skills in some gladiator contest this time with tanklike cars. The RM featured some overthetop characters and action that was clearly tongueincheek and was essentially a media satire with an action theme. I interpreted Joan Allen's involvement as an indication that perhaps this would be an update of that idea.Turns out I was wrong. This is not Running Man with cars it's Running Man with cars no brains no humor in the form of a video game including ridiculously videogamish sensor pads that cars have to drive over to get weapons and shields.

What is left is a lamebrained video game turned into a movieI can almost see half of the audience manipulate imaginary game controllers in the cinema...In an online QA on mtv.com the director has to face complaints about the lack of random killing of pedestrians and does so by mounting a feeble defense around the observation that at least one person who left his car and was subsequently killed should count as a pedestrian and that in his movie they went much further with the use of vehiclemounted firearms. I suppose that kind of debate between the audience of a movie and its director is a fairly clear indication of just what to expect and not to expect from it.Another complaint in the same QA is that the trailer gives away the entire plot of the movie in response to which Anderson reveals that he has seen the movie and that it's not so. Well I have seen it and it is. The plot of course is paperthin and the fact that it can actually be revealed in its entirety in the trailer really says all you need to know about it. Plot is not what you should expect from this movie.But then what should you expect? It's not really funny the funniest moment to me was when one of the characters discovers the essential uselessness of the copilots his creators have written into the script and consequently throws out his copilot it is not really sexy all we get to see is a little bit Ms Martinez' cleavagec'mon if it's already Rrated and considering the audience of adolescent boys on sugary caffeinated drinks one could at least have thrown in some solid nudity but no such luck it's not funny and the acting is nonexistent I can only hope for Ms Allen that this is the lowpoint of her career and that things will be looking up from now on. It's really a hamfistedly strung together collection of videogame sequences. If you own a game console you could just put GTA or something like that in demo mode and watch that instead. Saves you the annoying dialog and embarrassing attempts at plot as well.".

	onyx:emotionText "The trailer seemed to suggest that this is another take on the Running Man theme. Actually the original Death Race came out before the RM novel but I did not see it so I do not know how close the 2008 version is to the one from 1975. However I do know that the main plot of the 2008 version is essentially identical to that of RMa guy wrongfully imprisoned and exploited for his skills in some gladiator contest this time with tanklike cars. The RM featured some overthetop characters and action that was clearly tongueincheek and was essentially a media satire with an action theme. I interpreted Joan Allen's involvement as an indication that perhaps this would be an update of that idea.Turns out I was wrong. This is not Running Man with cars it's Running Man with cars no brains no humor in the form of a video game including ridiculously videogamish sensor pads that cars have to drive over to get weapons and shields.

Some of the things allowed are machine guns rockets smoke oil and spiked balls of iron to flatten tires. The winner is the one who is alive at the end.

It doesn't take itself seriously and try to be existential and have a point. There is no point.

It's insane.Don't worry about the acting as there isn't much to act. Jason Statham delivers yet another nuanced and subtle performance filled with rage. Although 85 of the film's action sees our characters in the steroid pumped racecars true Statham fans should be pleased with the amount of hand to hand combat as well a lot was kept out of the previews so it was surprising. Tyrese Gibson gives us more of the same while descending into a darker role with ease. It's basically as if his character from Waist Deep was murderous instead of heroic. Joan Allen is the lone real performer in this movie and she provides quite the presence as the Warden of the prison.Destined to become a cult classic just like the original Death Race gives us some of the most exciting action of the year while reminding us that we will never be as cool as Jason Statham. While the lack of iconic lines and characters is bothersome the memorable action somewhat makes up for it. I do take points away from Death Race for being the most predictable movie of the year and I'm not talking about the ending which tries to be clever slaps Paul W.S. Anderson across the face. I was able to predict lines of dialog how action sequences would play out and which characters would die. Actually the latter one isn't that hard to figure out...If you're looking for your typical mindless action vehicle that is sure to leave an explosive impression Death Race will fit the bill.

Karan is a cartoonist and his character Hum and Tum reflect his perspective on the strange lovehate relationship between men and women. Rhea is sensitive well bred and selfconfident. She can give as good as she gets and is not afraid of standing up to men. Initially the two have very little in common. But as life would have it their paths keep crossing and over the course of a decade their relationship evolves from hate to mutual respect friendship and finally  In a cinematic universe that offers simplistic scenarios to the complex relationship between men and women.

	schema:reviewBody "Hum Tum is an extremely modern and lighthearted romantic comedy. It is very well directed beautifully shot and is interesting and entertaining. Kunal Kohli makes a very good job in depicting the world of young Indians who travel the world and live their individual lives with passion and independence. The portrayal of relationships between the characters in the film particularly that of the main lead Karan and Riya is handled with a mindblowing mix of comedy and emotional drama. The film moves at a steady pace the animated characters of 'Hum' and 'Tum' are really fun the music is suitably racy the cinematography and editing are excellent and the entire concept of following the hatetolove relationship of two young people for a period of several years across many different countries is refreshing and convincingly done.The film leans on a truly electrifying chemistry between the two leads Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee. Mukherjee is very appealing and natural and performs brilliantly throughout the film but it is Saif Ali Khan who steals the show big time. Playing a trendy humorous carefree yet gracious womaniser Khan seems to be tailormade for the role of Karan which gives him ample scope to showcase his superb comictiming and neverseenbefore acting skills. He performs with natural ease infusing the part with the right amount of depth wit and energy and always appearing so real and effortless that it can be rightly concluded that no one else would have been able to do it as well as he did. This is an exceptional unforgettable performance and according to me one of the greatest comicdramatic performances in history. In support Rishi Kapoor is very enjoyable in one of his finest and funniest performances. Kirron Kher is outstanding and simply hilarious in an allout comic part as the loud and loving mother. Rati Agnihotri is as beautiful as ever in a smaller part and Jimmy Shergill and Isha Koppitar provide great support. The soundtrack as already mentioned perfectly suits the film's mood the title song is particularly beautiful. Please note Hum Tum is definitely not a ripoff of When Harry Met Sally as some people have suggested. There are some tiny similarities in the general concept but nothing more than just that and it has pretty much a story of its own. Finally Hum Tum is a lovely and memorable film. It is both very funny and moving and is overall a heartwarming picture which can always be a great watch for the entire family.".

Someone asks him what his story is and Karan agrees to tell them. He begins where he first met a girl named Riya Rani Mukherjee on a New York destined flight. They meet and on a long layaway in Amsterdam they can agree on one thing. They loathe each other. Riya thinks that she will never see Karan again but she is wrong. When she is to wed Sameer she sees Karan again. Karan was the wedding planner's Rati Agnihotri son. They still loathe each other but Karan starts feeling a pull towards her. They have a couple of other quirky meetings that may either end in love or misery for them both.As the main story is going on Karan's cartoons take life and basically form a subplot. Hum and Tum are ironically each of the cartoon characters' names. Hum is the boy and Tum is the girl. At first they aren't friends and as Karan's story goes on theirs goes on in a similar way. Will Hum and Tum ever get together and form the celebrated Hum Tum? Or will they also never ever fall in love? This movie is a very cute clean romance between two people. It is not one of the regular Bollywood formulas there is no parental interventions and it just shows that love may develop over time. The romance that develops between Riya and Karan is strong that even after viewing the movie the watcher feels that they have been given something different from regular romantic movies. I recommend this film highly for anyone who even thinks of watching a Bollywood movie. Yes there are cartoons but they in no way detract from the movie.".

I don't quite understand what's happened to him. It's like one morning he wakes up and all of a sudden he's amongst the top actors in Bollywood.I'm not a big fan of songs in movies but the songs in this one were amusing and fitting.The movie did have some cheesy tearjerking moments... but it can be forgiven as there were plenty of hilarious moments to keep you entertained.Go watch this movie. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "The similarity to When Harry Met Sally is obvious at the beginning of the movie but besides the plot following a chronological time frame similar to that movie there is little else in common. The story is entirely different. What I loved about this movie was that it was not a love at first sight or your regular boy meets girl type movie. It was much more realistic in approach and a lot more intelligent. I loved Saif's acting. Saif has finally come to his own. His comic timing is excellent just like in Kal Ho Na Ho. But you see him portray a touching sensitivity in certain scenes when it is required.Like the scene where he is trying to tell Rhea how sorry he is about her husband dying.I liked Rani as Rheaher character is both strong and sensitive.The dialogs where really good. The scene of the argument between Rhea and Karan at Mihir's Jimmy Shergill engagement is my favorite scene in the movie bar the conversation between Rhea and Mihir when she finally realizes why she and Karan are so short tempered with each other. This part of the movie has the most depth when things come to an anticlimax between Karan and Rhea. Karan offering her marriage after the night they spent together and Rhea refusing was possibly the most sensitively written scene in the film. It's obvious why Karan asks her to marry him but only a women would understand why Rhea refuses him. Not your typical Indian movie. Kiron and Rishi add the final touch to the movie. Their characters are well written. The cartoon Hum Tum was so funny and innovative they are the most memorable characters in the movie.Watch it. It's a heart warming story. Really good for a cold winter's evening.".

Karan a cartoonist meets Rhea on a flight to New York. They get well acquainted during a 6 hour stop over in Amsterdam. They have a fall out and they end up going their separate ways once they get to New York. Their chance meetings over then next few years and how their friendship develops gradually over time and how they end up falling in love without even realizing it forms the gist of the story. Saif Ali Khan fits Karan's role perfectly and Rani makes a wonderful Rhea. Even the supporting cat has done a great job. The use of the cartoon characters Hum and Tum in the story narrative adds some color to the movie. It is a welcome change from the cop flicks that have dominated the Indian screen in 2004. All in all a wonderful movie worth watching at least once on the big screen.".

I was rather delighted to see all the guest appearances.  I was completely unaware of that.  I really am not a fan of Rishi Kapoor.  I don't know why but I find him really irritating.  He just doesn't seem that convincing to me.  The cartoons got really irritating.  It's weird in the middle of a realpeople movie to all of a sudden start watching cartoon characters.  Thankfully the cartoons died down a bit in the second half.  It's also a bit annoying how the film spans over nine years.  Every half hour it says 3 years later 1 year later 4 years later.  Being a Yash Raj film my expectations for this movie were superduper high but I still liked it.  It's a funfilled romantic comedy.".

Hope that is self explanatory!!! A movie that excelled in every department but mostly will be remembered in times to come  of the mesmerizing chemistry between the lead pair.. I never expected saif to have pulled off that role of a lifetime but surprisingly he races off faster than anticipated  Be it his comic timing his emotional outburst or the best part i.e. that lovely on screen pairing with talented rani the guy just rocks!! He does deserve all the accolades that come in his way.. But the star of the show is I guess none other than rani  the director kunal kohli  the guy above.. A great director is one who is able to ooze out award winning performances from his caste  here  he excels .. Though the movie's theme is heavily inspired from another cult classic when Harry Met Sally  but mind you the comparison ends there.. Kunal kohli with his beautiful smart direction witty dialogs laced with right amount of humor  emotions delivers a fine piece of art a movie which you cant miss surely Ooooh how could I forget her she is such a fine actress  a rocksolid performer who has been behind some great movies already.. Watch her match step by step with her costar her looks her persona emotions anger gosh she has got everything in the book She is the beat of the movie. Rishi sir in his extended appearance leaves an undeniable presence  look for his comic timing..  the ever dependable Mrs. Kher as always makes every role just hers only But all this wont have been possible without a script  even though it does sag down a bit in the middle but boy it does give the actors lots to enact loaded with twists.. with unmatched wordly wise dialogs .. Captured astonishingly well.. the movie also has to its credit those cartoons that pop up at regular intervals  are kinda good say quite many things The beautiful hummable music by the talented duo but to date unrewarded with a single filmfare award.. Alkaji just woo you with that singing of that title track.. And my personal favorite is that arranged marriage scene beautifully acted upon It ain't a fare to be missed.. A must watch.. 910".

Karan of course is played by the hilariously dashing Saif Ali Khan and Rhea is played by that classact of an actress called Rani Mukherji. They meet aboard a plane heading to the USA from India and instantly sparks fly but not the kind you're thinking of. They both irritate each other to the extent that they argue over the slightest things and everything becomes a debate or battle of the sexes. While in Amsterdam in the heat of an argument Karan kisses Rhea and when they arrive in NYC she is soon to find out that they are going there to meet the same person her college bestfriend who happens to also be Karan's girlfriend. Karan gets the punishment he rightfully deserves and as years pass by he returns to India one day to find out that his mum a wedding planner by profession is planning a wedding for none other than Rhea whom he becomes reacquainted with. He realises during the course of her engagement and marriage that he is in love with her but can do nothing to stop it. Oh and let me also add that there are cartoons included in between many scenes hence the title Hum Tum with the cartoon characters on the cover. Hum Tum You and I or Yours and Mine in Hindi are Karan's characters from a column he does for India Times newspaper which is a big hit for him and in fact the film starts off with him giving a speech at a press conference for a book about the cartoon characters which he has just written and is a bestseller. Abhishek Bachchan who appears briefly in the film seems to have carved out a niche for himself with these sort of silly blink and you'll miss it cameo roles he loves to play see his roles in Salaam Namaste and Rakht nowadays. But then again he's Jr. B so he can pretty much do whatever the heck he wants. The premise of a philandering husband who deserts his wife and after 17 years he returns and she accepts him back is barbaric to say the least! Did the writer's expect the audience to side with or feel sorry for Karan's dad? That was a weak point within the film. Sob subplots like that and I've seen many in a lot of Hindi films make Hindustani men look bad.The producers not only stole from the Hollywood classic When Harry Met Sally for the cartoon characters there was a scene in which they not only stole the flying scene from Titanic they also stole the My heart will go on melody.

And with this film he has proved that he can do solo hero films as well. Rani Mukherjee has shown once again that she is one of the finest actresses today her pairing with Saif is flawless. Kiron Kher is First Rate as Rani's mother . Rati Agnihotri is adequate and Rishi Kapoor is fine in a small role. Although the screenplay is good in the first half during the second half and towards the climax the film drags and is very much predictable towards the end. I don't think the cartoon characters helped the proceedings in anyway. The cinematography is awesome and the music is great especially the title track Chak De and Ladki Kyon. And they have been shot well too. On the whole a good film with wonderful performances and great music. I give it 8.510".

	onyx:emotionText "on the surface everyone's condemning it for its 'inspired' storyline. but then even Shakespeare picked up stories from the common database. i am not comparing it to his work.. you could point a finger at its not so original storyline but credit is due where it is due. the movie is refreshing in the treatment it gives the girlguy thing. it incorporates a cartoon strip  animation smoothly. and not only does the movie manage to stay restrained almost throughout without following the general second half drag it also deals with more than just the cover story or theme. at its base is this endearingly constant bickering and loving relationship between karan and rhea. but go a little deeper and you see the sub plots of the rishi kapoorrati agnihotri marriagethatdidn'twork and the lonely kirron kher. kunal kohli deals with the theme of loneliness and puts his point forward subtly in their stories. no one can live alone. and finding a way to make relationships work  is in our hands after all  as rati says towards the end  god might not give us a second chance but we have to find it for ourselves. the movie is realistic enough  contrary to what some of the obtuse commentors have posted already. and definitely a complete whole structure. minor glitches notwithstanding it's a delightfully entertaining and heartwarming movie.";

The movie gets a bit dreary near the second half and starts to slow down. Either way I liked the way Kunal Kohli showed the feelings of the two main characters. Hatred at first  and then it warms up. It is very realistic and many will identify.Saif Ali Khan is mindblowing. This is my favourite image from Saif the playboywannabe. He does a remarkable job and I think he deserved every award he got for Hum Tum. I enjoyed every second of his performance. Rani Mukherji also does a wonderful job. She looks very pretty and pulls off Rhea with ease. She and Saif have a great chemistry on screen and it shows very well.Hum Tum is a slow but deeply emotional funny movie! The ending was slightly obvious though it seems impossible when you see the climax. And I loved the way the animation and 3 years later etc was added.The music is catchy. Each song fits in beautifully and all are enjoyable. They add an extra point to Hum Tum.I love it!".

	schema:headline " Hum Tum A Bollywood Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "Hum Tum focuses on Karan a cartoon illustrator for a popular Indian newspaper. The story takes place over several years and showcases the character's path from hate to love. During a trip to New York Karan meets Rhea. At first Rhea is very turned off by Karan's annoying behavior and unsolicited flirting. However years later they become friends and eventually lovers. The film adds animated sequences to show a break in time. The comic characters hum and tum mirror Karan and Rhea's relationship. I believe that this was not a necessary part of the film and at times distracted me from the main plot. However it does use this original narrative that is not a typical film technique. During a layover in Amsterdam the characters explore the city. Karan gives Rhea an unwanted kiss resulting in her slapping Karan. However he does not give up and insists they will one day meet again. This is very similar to the iconic film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. In both films the main couple does not have an initial attraction. However it builds naturally after a long period of time. The first time that Raj and Simran walk past each other the extradiegetic sound lets you know that the universe wants them to be together by playing an upbeat tune. In Hum Tum when Karan and Rhea first touch the lights on the airplane go out and it starts to shake. This lets the audience know the unshakable bond between the characters. I really liked the songs in the movie as they added a fun lighthearted energy that nicely added to the story.The film uses a variety of locations across time and space to show how Karan and Rhea's love story progresses. As Rachel Dwyer discusses in her book Cinema India The Visual Culture of Indian film the Bollywood sphere uses remote spaces as a tool to showcase romance. Since it does not take place in India these remote locations act as a getaway for the couple to exist in the private domain without the surveillance of any family. She sites that films will typically use specific backdrops such as mountainous areas log cabins parks rivers and beaches. Hum Tum uses the location of Amsterdam to launch the love story of Karan and Rhea. The film features the couple walking through the countryside of the Netherlands displaying the mountains and log cabins in the background. The song sequence Ladki Kyon has scenes including a boat ride down a river a stroll in the park and a beach pier. This shows how the use of foreign locations plays a major role in their budding love story. Hum Tum is filmed in India Amsterdam and New York each location adds to the characters love story. The chemistry between the main characters the electric music and the lighthearted story make Hum Tum a success that I would definitely recommend!".

	schema:reviewBody "The writers have done a remarkably good job with the story. Taking an outline of When Harry Met Sally and weaving a whole new story and mind you likable was really tough and they have succeeded. Saif has definitely matured as an actor and improved his comic timing. He as Karan is one of the big factors who has contributed to the likability of this movie. The other factor is the female lead Rhea played by Rani Mukherji who adds to the fun as well as the sensitive side of the movie. Rishi Kapoor and Rati Agnihotri's Arjun and Anju Kapoor of the movie bit of titbit was not at all needed. However the good part is the director did a good job containing that subplot in its small shell and not interfering the main storyline. The main hindrance to the movie were not the songs as one would typically expect from a BollywoodIFI movie but small snippets of animation. I felt that was really unimportant. A good recommendation on similar lines would be the Korean movie My Sassy Girl Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo. However unlike My Sassy Girl this film is a bit predictable nothing compares to that huge twist of My Sassy Girl that ends the movie and lacks heavily in subtleness of emotion. If you are new to BollywoodIFI Indian Film Industry this might be a good place to star off with. The same applies to people who wish to introduce someone to BollywoodIFI. Overall this film is highly enjoyable. Highly Recommended.".

And I would give 9 out of 10 to the director on that. It is probably my most favorite romantic Hindi movie after DDLJ. As usual Rani did a good job. But Saif was fantastic! His portraying of Karan Kapoor was so perfect that I don't think any other Bollywood actor would fit in this role. The transition of relationship between the two protagonists was so smooth and well executed that you won't feel anything over imposed. The songs were great specially the title track and Chak De. Overall I would give 8 on 10 to this movie.".

Rani has shown a lot of maturity while playing the role of the serious kind of girl in the latter part of the movie. Kiron Kher plays the role of Rhea's mother and has done justice to her role. The best of the guest appearances is obviously that of Rishi Kapoor who sings the song Main Shayar to Nahin along with Saif. Well the old timers never seem to lose their charm. Bacchhan junior is again back with his I wonder what kind of look that he has in all his other movies. Only thing is that he at least cracks a joke with Saif in one of the scenes. About the others i.e. Jimmy Shergill Shehnaaz and Isha Koppikar they are just around average. The music is OKOK type and does not have any dance numbers that you would want to have for your parties. However the title song and 2 others may be worth listening once or twice. The dialogues for saif have been written well and moreover saif has played his role well. The director err.. never mind... nothing as great as getting an award. Although the film has a predictable story and typically shot in the locations abroad no great music etc etc you can be sure that Saif has done a good job and you can check out the movie for 'timepass'.".

	schema:reviewBody "UPDATE January 2018 Code Red Releasing has released this film on Bluray fully restored to 107 minutes under the title THE APARTMENT ON THE 13TH FLOOR. Unfortunately the only audio option is the English dub but at least it's the longer cut. So I'll just set aside my 98minute Anchor Bay and Blue Underground copy of Cannibal Man and have this Code Red edition be my main choice.WEEK OF THE KILLER is definitely a more satisfying title for this film it is at least an honest title as well. It's a shame that those marketing this film to help it gain a profit opted for the title CANNIBAL MAN as here in the U.S. and its trailer trying to make it look more horrific than it really is with chipper sounding narration in a nice weather we're having tone!! That is a shame because it's useless to try and lure in horrorgore hounds for a film that's basically a nice moody drama that will leave one with a saddened downbeat mood rather than thrills. The Cannibal Man title is silly particularly because there really isn't any cannibalism in the film. The closest thing to that is found to be a coincidence and even upsets the main character when he realizes what was in his soup. Though I'd rather have seen it in the original language with subtitles I'm still happy Anchor Bay has rescued it and released it on DVD and now Code Red on Bluray restored to the full 107 minutes for folks like me who enjoy obscure films.The story is basically about a slaughterhouse worker who accidentally starts a downward spiral of killing and madness in his life unable to cope with what he's done and finding it's just easier to off the people who get too close to his secret. The wide open landscapes of yet to be developed land and the minimal score add amazing scope to the loneliness Marcos Vicente Parra feels and mirrors the loneliness of his newfound friend that lives in the highrise literally next door to his little house. Even the swimming scene had a quiet beauty to it. Considering the time and politics for 1971 in that area there's more to this story than just a man not able to cope with his murderous actions.The neighbor's sexuality is handled in a rather refreshingly basic manner not being stereotypically gay nor lecherous. It's also great how throughout the film we wonder if he really knows more about what Marcos is doing than we can guess with lines like You better bury them is he talking about Marcos' memories or the bodies starting to add up in Marcos' bedroom? Their interactions are always fascinating and were very much highpoints of the film. It was wonderful to see a scene like the swimming scene with these two men somehow I get the feeling that if this film were to have been made today the powers that be in Hollywood would have tried to work that scene with two women. An increasing depressing tone sets in up through to the end but some nice dialogues keep the story in check and moving despite the slower tone of the film. The violence works in context to the situations rather than seeming gratuitous to satisfy those who feel they need to see that in order to enjoy a film. For me I was far more disturbed by the first minute of the film seeing the animal slaughtered. It was difficult getting through that. The sexual element is surprisingly minimal not as much nudity as you'd think a film of this storyline would have but since it's not really an exploitive film having less breasts to gawk at works in its favor. Like many films of that European source and time having no end credits leaves the viewer in a more affected mood with the film's rather abrupt ending.LA SEMANA DEL ASESINO is great viewing for fans of drama but horror seekers should stay clear. It's good to see other people commenting about the film's interesting qualities instead of reading comments that they felt ripped off that it wasn't about cannibals or full of tense scary scenes. It's pure drama and I'm glad some people are managing to get around the unfortunate marketing ploys this film was given and see how worthwhile it really is! Indeed a nice discovery.".

It's good to see other people commenting about the film's interesting qualities instead of reading comments that they felt ripped off that it wasn't about cannibals or full of tense scary scenes. It's pure drama and I'm glad some people are managing to get around the unfortunate marketing ploys this film was given and see how worthwhile it really is! Indeed a nice discovery.";

In spite of the English title The Cannibal Man this is not a movie about cannibalism. It's a Spanish slasher classic of the chilly grotesque with a convincingly gruesome playing .

Meanwhile a neighbor Eusebio Poncela is watching the creepy events .Eloy De La Iglesia's great success is compelling directed with well staged murders plenty of startling visual content  though was submitted to censorship. The picture packs atmospheric blending of eerie thrills and creepy chills combined with a terrific finale. It displays lots of guts and blood but it seems pretty mild compared to today's gore feasts. It's an unrelenting shockfeast laced with nice acting by the Spanish stars that deserves its cult status . Vicente Parra plays his part to the hilt unafraid of Eloy De Iglesia's unsympathetic camera and the viciousness of his character . The early 80s UK video made a prohibited list and was successfully prosecuted but only made the list due to it's 'cannibal' title . Apart from some massacre footage this is not a very violent film and would almost certainly be released uncut in the UK if it was submitted now.Passable photography with juicy atmosphere by Raul Artigot but unfortunately turns too much murky in some video print  being necessary a a correct remastering . Good casting with usual Spanish secondaries as Rafael Hernadez  Ismael Merlo  Jose Franco  Valentin Tornos  Antonio Del Real  among others. The motion picture is professionally directed by Eloy De La Iglesia  a good Spanish movies director. He began working in cinema in 1966 though he became notorious in the years of the Spanish transition to democracy with provoking and polemic films as El Pico 1 and 2  El Diputado The priest  Clockwork terror and many others . Drugs delinquency terrorism and generational problems are the habitual subjects in his films  as well as the gay world  here represented in Eusebio Poncela's character who falls in love with Vicente Parra's role .

One night he goes out on a date with his girlfriend and accidentally kills a taxi driver in a fit of rage.

He manages to kill five more people including his brother his future fatherinlaw and a waitress who's real friendly towards him in a desperate act of covering himself up before the inevitable end comes.  He takes the body parts to the local slaughterhouse so they can be ground up by the machines.  He also has to buy multiple cans of air freshener in order to get rid of the smell.The one person who convinces him otherwise is the young homosexual on the 13th floor of the highrise who knows his secret but doesn't say anything about it.

The production values are pretty good the English dubbing is tolerable and the acting particularly the two male leads is competent if not excellent throughout plus there are even a couple of black comic suspense scenes worthy of Hitchcock particularly one with some neighborhood bullies playing keepaway with Marcos' bag.Originally titled LA SEMANA DEL ASESINO THE WEEK OF THE KILLER but released in the US as APARTMENT ON THE 13TH FLOOR with an exploitation ad campaign reminiscent of Last House on the Left.

	schema:headline " It won't be long  soon the fuzz will be swarming here. Decent little Euro thriller.";
	schema:reviewBody "La Semana del Asesino which apparently translates into English as The Week of the Murderer or the misleading  exploitative title of Cannibal Man as it's commonly known amongst English speaking audiences starts in a slaughter house run by a company called 'Flory' we witness various cows having their throats slit bleeding all over the shop  other gory establishing shots. We are introduced to one of the workers Marcos Vincente Parra who has a crap job picking all the guts up  generally has a crap life living in an old house in one of the oldest districts in town. One night while out with his girlfriend Paula Marcos becomes involved in a fight with a taxi driver  ends up accidentally killing him. The next day Paula says they should go to the police  confess an idea that Marcos is not keen on saying that the police will never believe them because he is poor  cannot afford an expensive lawyer. Paula says she will go to the police on her own at which point Marcos strangles her. Racked with guilt Marcos confesses all to his Brother Steve who also says he must tell the police in no time whatsoever Marcos beats Steve to death with a wrench. Marcos continues to kill to keep his secret  has dug himself into a hole from which he sees only one escape to dispose of the evidence at the slaughterhouse...Originally gaining some notoriety in the UK  presumably elsewhere where it was banned as a 'Video Nasty' in the early 80's this Spanish production was cowritten  directed by Eloy de la Iglesia  is a surprisingly good character study of a serial killer  one mans descent into madness through fear  panic. The script by Iglesia Anthony Fos  Robert Oliver isn't perfect by any means it starts off really well with the bodies piling up thick  fast but slows considerably towards the end which is odd as it's usually the other way around. La Semana del Asesino concentrates on Marcos  his thoughts  feelings what makes him commit murder  the situation he has created that he can't seem to escape no mention of the police investigation is ever made if indeed there was one. I was impressed with the ending it's certainly not what I was expecting  was maybe a little low key for some but I thought it worked  worked well. The film moves along at a fair pace but does drag a bit in places which would probably put me off watching it again anytime soon. Director Iglesia also manages to throw in a bit of satire amongst the blood of which there is a fair amount but the title Cannibal Man is so misleading it's untrue. In fact there is not one single instance of cannibalism in the entire film although we are treated to some decent gore even if it doesn't reach the heights of some other splatter filled Euro horror there is an effective slit throat someone has their head bashed in someone gets his face split down the middle with a meat clever  there are various gory sequences inside the slaughterhouse  all that entails. Technically La Semana del Asesino is basic but professional enough Iglesia films it in real locations which add to it's grittiness  credibility while at the same time giving the film a nice atmosphere throughout the cinematography is OK the music forgettable while the special effect's aren't going to impress too many people these days they are good enough. The acting by Parra is very strong  I was both engaged  gripped by his character no one else gets that much screen time but they all do a fine job nonetheless. As long as you can get over the misleading title  not go into La Semana del Asesino expecting an all out cannibal gore fest like Cannibal Holocaust 1980 or Cannibal Ferox 1981 then you may just be rewarded with an intelligent  satisfying dramathrillerhorror!

	onyx:emotionText "La Semana del Asesino which apparently translates into English as The Week of the Murderer or the misleading  exploitative title of Cannibal Man as it's commonly known amongst English speaking audiences starts in a slaughter house run by a company called 'Flory' we witness various cows having their throats slit bleeding all over the shop  other gory establishing shots. We are introduced to one of the workers Marcos Vincente Parra who has a crap job picking all the guts up  generally has a crap life living in an old house in one of the oldest districts in town. One night while out with his girlfriend Paula Marcos becomes involved in a fight with a taxi driver  ends up accidentally killing him. The next day Paula says they should go to the police  confess an idea that Marcos is not keen on saying that the police will never believe them because he is poor  cannot afford an expensive lawyer. Paula says she will go to the police on her own at which point Marcos strangles her. Racked with guilt Marcos confesses all to his Brother Steve who also says he must tell the police in no time whatsoever Marcos beats Steve to death with a wrench. Marcos continues to kill to keep his secret  has dug himself into a hole from which he sees only one escape to dispose of the evidence at the slaughterhouse...Originally gaining some notoriety in the UK  presumably elsewhere where it was banned as a 'Video Nasty' in the early 80's this Spanish production was cowritten  directed by Eloy de la Iglesia  is a surprisingly good character study of a serial killer  one mans descent into madness through fear  panic. The script by Iglesia Anthony Fos  Robert Oliver isn't perfect by any means it starts off really well with the bodies piling up thick  fast but slows considerably towards the end which is odd as it's usually the other way around. La Semana del Asesino concentrates on Marcos  his thoughts  feelings what makes him commit murder  the situation he has created that he can't seem to escape no mention of the police investigation is ever made if indeed there was one. I was impressed with the ending it's certainly not what I was expecting  was maybe a little low key for some but I thought it worked  worked well. The film moves along at a fair pace but does drag a bit in places which would probably put me off watching it again anytime soon. Director Iglesia also manages to throw in a bit of satire amongst the blood of which there is a fair amount but the title Cannibal Man is so misleading it's untrue. In fact there is not one single instance of cannibalism in the entire film although we are treated to some decent gore even if it doesn't reach the heights of some other splatter filled Euro horror there is an effective slit throat someone has their head bashed in someone gets his face split down the middle with a meat clever  there are various gory sequences inside the slaughterhouse  all that entails. Technically La Semana del Asesino is basic but professional enough Iglesia films it in real locations which add to it's grittiness  credibility while at the same time giving the film a nice atmosphere throughout the cinematography is OK the music forgettable while the special effect's aren't going to impress too many people these days they are good enough. The acting by Parra is very strong  I was both engaged  gripped by his character no one else gets that much screen time but they all do a fine job nonetheless. As long as you can get over the misleading title  not go into La Semana del Asesino expecting an all out cannibal gore fest like Cannibal Holocaust 1980 or Cannibal Ferox 1981 then you may just be rewarded with an intelligent  satisfying dramathrillerhorror! Personally I definitely think it's well worth a watch surprisingly good.";

Despite not being about cannibals the movie features more than enough blood and the opening scene which takes place in an abattoir will adequately set most audience members up for what is to follow. What follows is a rampage of violence as our character slips deeper into insanity and kills the people around him. It all starts with the sort of accidental death of a taxi driver. After that our hero kills his girlfriend for fear that she might tell the police and follows that murder up with his brother's his brother's girlfriend's etc etc. This chain of murders could become rather dull but the relaxed tone of the film and the way that we always focus on the escapades of the central character throughout his decent into insanity ensures that the film never turns into a riotous slashfest.Aside from the fact that Franco was in power I really don't know anything about Spain at the time that this was made. Cannibal Man reflects life in the country at the time but to be honest whatever social study there is really gets lost under the murders and putrid atmosphere of the film. Rather than looking for social comments I recommend viewing this film more as a look at insanity as it can be enjoyed much easier that way. If looked at as an insight into insanity Cannibal Man is a rather potent film which shows insanity doesn't have to be something that a murderer is born with. The atmosphere that director Eloy de la Iglesia has created is fabulous. The film feels rotten like a slab of meat left out at the abattoir and this helps to ensure that we always view our central character's plight with disgust and regret rather than simply enjoying the killings. Many of the murders in the film are standard stuff with the exception of one great one that sees a thrown hatchet lodged in some poor guy's face! On the whole despite the homoerotic tone towards the end Cannibal Man is cleverer than it looks and even if viewed without intelligence  the film can be enjoyed.".

His girlfriend witnessing the attack is going to go to the police so he has to take care of her as well. Questions are asked and the body count rises.The Cannibal Man has many touches typical of an exploitation movie. Firstly the title it was given in the Englishspeaking world is a clear case of the producers attempting to mislead the potential audience into parting with their cash. There are no cannibals in the movie. Also the movie has quite a barebones plot which is ideal to prevent any distractions from its scenes of gore. One particularly memorable moment  generally displayed on the movie's case  depicts a meat cleaver sunk into somebody's face.It also has some aspects that are atypical of exploitation however and they're quite perplexing. For one the movie is much better made than you might expect this is no D'Amato or Schnaas gradeZ garbage not that there's anything wrong with that. It's filmmaker Eloy de la Iglesia was nothing if not an auteur kind of a Godard of the gutter.De la Iglesia was also openly gay and this movie features a bizarre homoerotic dalliance between the main character and someone he meets. Is the character supposed to be gay? Well they never have sex and there's a surprising lack of male nudity in the picture. De la Iglesia more than made up for that for those that like that sort of thing in later movies such as El Sacerdote but his chief sexual interest seemed to be boys not men.What you end up with is a gore movie made by an auteur with a social conscience that doesn't quite come togetherand homoerotic touches that add nothing. Therefore I think most people would find it a needless distraction. If you're looking for gore this is one Video Nasty that you'll have to fastforward a few times to get to. If you're into social commentary about Francoera Spain I for one couldn't find any.".

	schema:headline " Exceptional study of sociopathic isolation";
	schema:reviewBody "Eloy de la Iglesia's Cannibal Man is an exceptional study of sociopathic isolation that also comments on the gulf between how the rich and poor were treated by the authorities in Spain in '72. Vicente Parra is Marcus a slaughterhouse worker who accidentally kills a taxi driver. Convinced that the police will not believe his account of the incident he refuses to turn himself in. His girlfriend has other ideas and wants him to go to the police her social status is higher than his. When she refuses to understand his position he is left with little option but to kill her. Thus begins a chain of bloody murders as Marcus is threatened with exposure by his friends family members and colleagues. Eusebio Poncola who starred in the brilliant Spanish detective series The Adventures of Pepe Carvahlo plays Nestor a wealthy local who introduces himself to Marcus. Though subtly conveyed by Iglesia Nestor's interest in Marcus extends beyond friendship. A surreal pool scene in which the men become entangled in the water perfectly communicates unspoken ambitions. It turns out that the affluent Nestor is ironically Marcus's only potential ally in his descent into depression and madness but his offer of help may come too late. Similar in tone to Henry  Portrait of a Serial Killer this is a well written thinking man's thriller that doesn't blush at its atrocities. The film is full of magnificent clever details. For example Marcus is slow to rid himself of the corpses piling up in his bedroom so the place has started to reek. Iglesias conveys the situation with wonderful black humor by showing us packs of dogs loitering at his front door for a taste of the rotten meat inside. Every night Marcus arrives home he has to scream at the dogs as they swarm about like flies. During one of the murder scenes the director intercuts a game of soccer going on outside. Much more than a standard horror flick this touches on the perils of becoming more successful than your friends and the consequences of tough decisions. We sympathize with Marcus's situation even though his actions are illegal. Putting a cherry on top of the cake is a minimalist score and creepy electronic sound effects. Unfortunately most versions available including the one I saw are dubbed. I'd kill to see this in its original language.".

	schema:reviewBody "While writerdirector Eloy de la Iglesia is well known in Spain for his quinqui i.e. hoodlum films gritty depictions of young criminals and drug addicts abroad his reputation rests largely on the shoulders of his early seventies thrillers. The most notorious of these is Cannibal Man which gained cinematic immortality as one of Britain's Video Nasties. Like many titles on that list this film is far more complex than its exploitative title and marketing would suggest the original Spanish title is La semana del asesino which means The Week of the Murderer.The murderer in this case rather than cannibal man as the export title misleadingly suggests. is Marcos Vicente Parra a lowerclass employee of the local slaughterhouse. His small shack looks like a relic when compare to the adjacent highrise apartment which is populated largely by affluent students. Marcos is pressured by his girlfriend Paula Emma Cohen one of Spain's greatest actresses to marry but he insists on waiting until he's promoted. One of their outings goes horribly wrong when a cabdriver disturbed by their backseat necking kicks them out of his taxi. Marcos refuses to pay the fare and a scuffle breaks out. As the cab driver begins beating Paula he utters one of the film's best lines which is simultaneously hilarious and tinged with social commentary I'm gonna give you the beating your father never had time to give you! Marcos hits him in the head with a rock accidentally ending his life. Thus begins our protagonist's souldestroying week which finds him committing murder after murder in order to cover up his original crime.Though the film has its share of blood and gore Eloy de la Iglesia is far more interested in his character's plight as well as his social status. Marcos often reminds us that he's a poor man. When his brother and girlfriend pressure him to confess his crimes to the police he protests that as a working class schmo he'd never get a fair trial. The police will never believe me...and you need money to afford a good lawyer. The chain of murders only escalates as more people snoop in Marcos' shack and react either with hostility or fear. His only friend throughout the whole ordeal is the enigmatic Nestor Eusebio Poncela most famous for playing the inspector in Almodovar's Matador. Nestor is a resident of the nearby highrise and one of the affluent students mentioned earlier. He spends his time spying on people with his binoculars and this is how he acquaints himself with Marcos.In discussing the relationship between Marcos and Nestor it is necessary to reference the director's sexual orientation. Eloy de la Iglesia was a gay Marxist during a time in which homosexuality was still illegal in Spain. Though it's never blatantly mentioned Nestor is clearly gay and he shares the director's sympathy with the working class. Though he initially tries to impress Marcos with masculine posturing Nestor's interactions with Marcos soon become charged with homoeroticism. This reaches its peak in a memorable swimming pool scene in which Marcos and Nestor swim and shower together it's a dazzling and tender display of filmmaking and it loses not of its potency with repeat viewings. This scene as well as much of the political content was unfortunately but not surprisingly censored from the Spanish version of the film meaning that this Englishdubbed export version is the closest thing to a true director's cut. Some recently discovered deleted scenes featured on the German bluray fascinatingly hint at a more explicit version. While most of the material is inessential such as a scene in which Marcos is promoted one of the final scenes shows Nester and Marcos passionately making out. No context is provided and this scenes as well as the others features no audio. Thus this plays as a haunting footnote to the film's fascinating and complex central relationship did de la Iglesia intend for the two men to become lovers? Is this perhaps just a fantasy of Nestor's? Or more intriguingly a fantasy of the classically masculine Marcos? Unless the screenplay surfaces or someone interviews Poncela about it we may never know.Since I am both a huge fan of this film and incredibly reckless with my money I forked out a sizable amount of money to import the recent German bluray. I am pleased to say that the disc is a significant upgrade to the American DVD and lends a greater appreciation to the director's artistry. This was my third viewing of the film and I found it just as rewarding as the first. The surprise reveal in the deleted scenes only sweetened the deal for me assuring me that my money was well spent. It is a complex politically charged yet deeply heartfelt film. I shared it with a friend on my last viewing and I hope he will not mind if I share his thoughts on the experience It's really just about one man having a bad week and the trials of having to get through it without losing his whole soul. It is that but also much more a film that can be appreciated from multiple perspectives. I fear that this review does not do it justice. Suffice it to say that this is truly one of the crowning achievements of Spanish horror cinema. This will also be of interest to anyone interested in the history of queer cinema being one of the ballsiest acts of transgression ever committed under a fascist dictatorship. Though homosexuality was outlawed in Spain de la Iglesia wore his sexuality like a badge of honor and he continued to make films on his own terms.".

	schema:reviewBody "This gritty and ghoulish Spanish shocker is far more impressive than its relative obscurity would indicate. With an utterly realistic approach to the murderous deeds that anchor the plot and a surprisingly substantial character study at the heart of the film Cannibal Man is far from a runofthemill slasher flick and genre fans who enjoy delving deeply into the darker recesses of humanity will find a tremendously enjoyable exploration here.Vicente Parra's thoughtful performance is one of the best you're likely to find in the exploitation genre and even though American audiences will have to settle for dubbed dialogue Parra's expressive and nuanced delivery transcends language and ably presents the tormented killer's inner struggle as he copes with the consequences of the murderous path he's gradually led down.Parra's Marcos is not simply a remorseless maniac and the first death in the film arrives entirely by accident. The circumstance surrounding this inadvertent assassination is a situation that any otherwise normal person can relate to and when his initial foray into homicide is striking down a man who is attacking his lover it's easy to imagine that most of us would probably handle the situation exactly as Marcos does. However when the man dies as a result of the assault and the girlfriend's guilty conscience leads her to urge Marcos to go forward to the police the unwitting killer's instinct for selfpreservation supersedes his humanity and very quickly he has a second murder on his hands.From there the spiral continues and just as a liar has to continually twist the truth to maintain their original lie Marcos finds himself stacking up bodies to silence the unlucky people who discover his mounting compulsion. As his sanity begins to slowly erode he takes increasingly elaborate actions to cover up his crimes and his desperate attempts to obscure the results of his handiwork forge some compelling and tense scenes.Even if you aren't seeking a wellessayed psychodrama Cannibal Man has enough diversionary bloodshed to please gore aficionados and the undeniably sick storyline carries plenty of weight on its own. The most unsavory aspects of the film however are the sequences which portray business as usual at the slaughterhouse where Marcos works which feature scenes of genuine cattle evisceration that will make the more squeamish members of the audience take a closer look at their next cheeseburger.Director Eloy de la Iglesia's stylish approach maintains a grim and unsettling atmosphere throughout the film. He also knows when to assault the viewer with explicit carnage and when to employ more subtle tactics and since there's a fair amount of the former images like Marcos's shadow on the wall repeatedly lifting and descending his meat cleaver as he butchers one of his victims have tremendous impact despite the fact that we don't actually see the blade's grisly result. By utilizing this restraint Iglesia renders the more visceral scenes even more powerful and he strikes a fine balance between conjuring up explicit splatter setpieces and allowing the audience to summon even more gruesome tableaux in our minds.Despite its strongest aspects the film falters in at least two major areas. The first is the woefully anticlimactic ending which unfortunately does not offer a significant payoff considering the taut road leading up to it. The other major shortfall is an equally puzzling resolution to the bizarre homoerotic subplot tracking our lead's interactions with a clearly disturbed neighbor who comes across as a much shiftier character than Marcos the first time we're introduced to the neighbor he's peering through his binoculars at a group of shirtless adolescents playing soccer. The final act definitely suffers because of the tame conclusion so Cannibal Man doesn't quite turn out to be a certified classic.It's worth noting that the title itself has pretty much nothing to do with the film. I realize that the name Cannibal Man carries with it a wealth of implied atrocities guaranteed to lure in eager grindhouse audiences but since our titular figurehead doesn't actually eat anything in the movie except for soup and bread the moniker utilized for American audiences sells this offering short and muddles the complex dissertation on madness that ultimately drives the film.Even if Cannibal Man doesn't go as far as the inappropriate title might suggest there's no denying that this is a truly twisted and unique vision. Audiences looking for a pure exploitation vehicle might feel a bit shortchanged but viewers up for an engaging and intricate thriller will find this a very rewarding experience.".

The film moves by slow and carefuland the plotdevelopment is too tame to keep your solid attention. Heck even the sexsequence is shot  in a dreadfully tedious way.

The girl wants Marcus to confess what he did to the police but Marcus doesn't want this and sees no other option than to kill her too before she talks. Later he kills his brother for not being supportive about it then his sisterinlaw for becoming suspicious etc etc etc You get the picture Marcus descents further and further into madness!I guess the controversial value is the most remarkable thing about Cannibal Man'. Director Eloy de la Iglesia notso subtly criticizes society's lack of communication solidarity and the entire authority  justice system! Bearing in mind the film was made during the reign of the Spanish dictator Franco this was a risky operation to say the least.".

No. Random gratuitous breast shots? No. Overuse of gore? No.What the hell is this supposed to be? A few skulls placed on rocks and some people with white paint in the face don't make no cannibal movie. There's no suspense no gore no humor no nudity and no plot whatsoever. And it doesn't have a message in some political way or something like that. It's a movie who just doesn't get going and once it does it's over.The acting is pretty decent and the camera work is very nice at times. But that's about it. If you wanna see a REAL cannibal movie go get Cannibal Holocaust or one of the early 80s movies the Italians did. They are indeed BAD but hey... At least they're gory!".

The pace and directorial style is stolen from The Blair Witch Project whilst the nihilistic plot and certain visuals are taken from the film that inspired Blair Witch Ruggero Deodato's infamous Cannibal Holocaust. It is hard to admire something that so shamelessly rips off other genre classics no matter how well put together it is.Writerdirector Jonathan Hensleigh's extremely derivative plot sees two couples a pair of hedonists and their more sensible friends travel to a cannibal infested jungle to try and find the heir to the Rockefeller fortune who went missing in the area over 40 years earlier. As the going gets tough tempers become frayed and arguments inevitably break out. But things really go tits up when one of the group angers the locals by pilfering a skull from a native burial site. The extremely miffed gutmunchers stalk the amateur adventurers and teach them not to go messing with their ancestors' remains.What follows is undeniably tense occasionally quite nasty and technically well handled by cast and crew but I fail to see how the makers of Welcome To The Jungle expected to present this film without criticism. Perhaps if it had been as unrelentingly harrowing as Cannibal Holocaust is that even possible? fans of extreme horror would have forgiven the plagiarism and admired the film's willingness to shock and disgust. But instead even the nastiest moment in Hensleigh's film in which one of the victims is shown impaled on a bamboo pole is a weak copy of a much more disturbing image in Deodato's movie.Horror fans who have yet to experience the 'delights' of Cannibal Holocaust or the effectively creepy atmosphere of Blair Witch will probably find much to enjoy about Welcome to the Jungle. However the rest of us will be annoyed by the barefaced cheek of its makers. To give it a rating any higher than 510 just seems wrong.".

	schema:headline " Interesting premise but lost in translation";
	schema:reviewBody "The premise was interesting a search for Michael Rockefeller who disappeared in the jungles of New Guinea in 1961. Tying a story especially a horror story to an actual historic event intrigues me. Like adding Ambrose Bierce to Dusk til Dawn 3 or Edgar Allan Poe to any number of films it adds an extra dimension to the whole spirit of suspension of disbelief and then to add cannibals to the mix without taking them out of their natural element is like icing on the cake. Then it falls apart. When is this found camera fad going to go away. It is a filming technique that worked once 40 years ago in Cannibal Holocaust but has fallen on hard times. After a while the shaky camera thing gets irritating. And when you add in the Blair Witch stylings the whiny bitchy filmmakers who are more interested in themselves than the thing they are documenting then things go from bad to worse.Too much of the dialogue and storyline seemed improvised. Rather than adding character depth or an interesting plot development it only took 1 dimensional characters and made them even more uninteresting and unlikeable.Some of the cinematography was good though some was too dark intentional perhaps but grating non the less and there were some beautiful location shots. The impaled girl on a stick scene lifted from Cannibal Holocaust was impressive. Okay that is pretty much the extent of it's finer points.As to the aforementioned suspension of disbelieve it requires an involvement in the story to work and that wasn't present. These weren't professional documentary filmmakers with a get the shot no matter what mentality. They were spoiled 20 something or others who would have dropped the camera and run for their lives at the first sign of danger. The danger that came by the way in the last 30 minutes or so. Up until then it was all the kind of self indulgence that one would expect from from these two particular couples taking videos of their journey. In other words trite nonsense that has nothing to do with either the documentation of the search nor true progression of the story.They did keep it fairly realistic in that they didn't show what the cameras would not have shown. Bodies dragged out of view of the lens killings happening out of sight etc. Unfortunately that meant that most of the really good scenes occurred off camera. So realistic yes boring double yes. In other words show me the blood and gore. In low budget horror filmmaking when you are working without tension acting or reason then you have to make up for it with some added gore and a little T  A. Consider that my gratuitous gratuity to the genre.If you have to continue in the found camera vein then do it with a new twist. Maybe a filmmaker who finds the footage and then attempts to recreate it in his or her own film with perhaps horrifying repercussions. Then we can use a few bouncing camera shots and then move on to some decent filmmaking.I love low budget horror. I even love bad low budget horror. But when I see a film that actually had potential let down by poor execution by people who should know better I feel nothing but regret.".

	onyx:emotionText "The premise was interesting a search for Michael Rockefeller who disappeared in the jungles of New Guinea in 1961. Tying a story especially a horror story to an actual historic event intrigues me. Like adding Ambrose Bierce to Dusk til Dawn 3 or Edgar Allan Poe to any number of films it adds an extra dimension to the whole spirit of suspension of disbelief and then to add cannibals to the mix without taking them out of their natural element is like icing on the cake. Then it falls apart. When is this found camera fad going to go away. It is a filming technique that worked once 40 years ago in Cannibal Holocaust but has fallen on hard times. After a while the shaky camera thing gets irritating. And when you add in the Blair Witch stylings the whiny bitchy filmmakers who are more interested in themselves than the thing they are documenting then things go from bad to worse.Too much of the dialogue and storyline seemed improvised. Rather than adding character depth or an interesting plot development it only took 1 dimensional characters and made them even more uninteresting and unlikeable.Some of the cinematography was good though some was too dark intentional perhaps but grating non the less and there were some beautiful location shots. The impaled girl on a stick scene lifted from Cannibal Holocaust was impressive. Okay that is pretty much the extent of it's finer points.As to the aforementioned suspension of disbelieve it requires an involvement in the story to work and that wasn't present. These weren't professional documentary filmmakers with a get the shot no matter what mentality. They were spoiled 20 something or others who would have dropped the camera and run for their lives at the first sign of danger. The danger that came by the way in the last 30 minutes or so.

Jonathan thought to pick in on the docu style flicks by making the most shocking of them all the cannibal script. To add more believability he added some backstory to it. Michael Clark Rockefeller disappeared during an expedition in the Asmat region of southwestern Netherlands New Guinea. His body was never found and it was believed that he was attacked by a crocodile although some say back then in the sixties cannibals were still living in that area. 4 friends are going to do some research towards Rockefeller on the island. Of course things go wrong an they do enter cannibal territory.The most shocking was Cannibal Holocaust back in 1980. Still up to today people are afraid to watch this gory flick. The problem with Welcome To The Jungle is that they tried to remake Cannibal Holocaust. It failed on all bits. The script is really boring. You have to wait until the last 20 minutes before the cruelty comes in. Before that there is a lot of talking and arguing between the friends. And even when they enter the cannibals it looks ridiculous. It's not by putting some skulls on a rock that you have a cannibal zone. On the part of the gore what's a natural fact in those kind of movies well it's low too. You do see parts of bodies everywhere but nothing is shown onscreen. Maybe the best part is when they discover one of their friend's corpse. The acting was okay but the script failed on all parts. Guns 'n' Roses Welcome To The Jungle sounds creepier than this flick.Gore 25 Nudity 055 Effects 25 Story 15 Comedy 05".

The video camera obviously wouldn't see everything because when you're being dragged off to be decapitated you would usually take the camera with you?! So basically two couples decide to find out where Michael Rockerfellar disappeared to in the 60's. They fall out  one couple nick a raft and go their own way. They find natives are following them armed with bows and arrows. They get hit with arrows and are taken off to be tonight's dinner. Next couple follow en route with a raft they've made and find the remains of their friend. They hear the screaming of their other obviously alive friend and foolish follow it. They escape narrowly just in reach of the sea but are seen by another native. They surrender and are sat down to dinner but then realise everyone's suddenly disappeared.

This film is very reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project only more polished and less shaky. It takes the best elements of The Blair Witch Project and pushes them slightly further. In this writer's opinion it draws a bit more from BWP than Cannibal Holocaust although both of those aforementioned films' influences are very apparent.The bad You don't really care for the characters. Some of their actions are questionable and while you care more for the good couple than you do for the drunken drugged bad couple all four of the principalcharacters come off as greedy yuppie crybabies.While some reviewers will say that the film is boring in it's first half I wouldn't go so far as to make that claim. The film does a good job of building up to it's final scenes. In fact I'd go so far as to say that the first half is kind of compelling. The way the characters interact with each other is really entertaining to watch especially when they turn on each other and split up.Overall this film is really good. It's miles ahead of the usual DTV crap that you're accustomed to especially from Dimension Extreme.710".

In this writer's opinion it draws a bit more from BWP than Cannibal Holocaust although both of those aforementioned films' influences are very apparent.The bad You don't really care for the characters. Some of their actions are questionable and while you care more for the good couple than you do for the drunken drugged bad couple all four of the principalcharacters come off as greedy yuppie crybabies.While some reviewers will say that the film is boring in it's first half I wouldn't go so far as to make that claim. The film does a good job of building up to it's final scenes. In fact I'd go so far as to say that the first half is kind of compelling. The way the characters interact with each other is really entertaining to watch especially when they turn on each other and split up.Overall this film is really good. It's miles ahead of the usual DTV crap that you're accustomed to especially from Dimension Extreme.710";

For me a good horror must have suspense make me jump shock me in some way and sometimes a bit of gore helps. Although it was very gory i felt there was no suspense i was never jumpy and wasn't shocked at all either. In fact it was quite possibly the worst horror film i have seen to date!!

Four young adventurers head into jungle cannibal country in search of the missing Michael Rockefeller. Found footage that they shot on their journey tells their story. Sounds a bit like Cannibal Holocaust? Yeah pretty much.So what do we get? Well pretty much what one would expect. The production values and acting are pretty decent. The story is pretty much unoriginal very similar to Cannibal Holocaust with a few changes. We get no sex no rape no animal killing. We get a tiny itsybitsy bit of tit. Gore wise we get a few found body parts but most of the killing is off screen. This is a cannibal movie aiming for a mainstream audience.Pacingwise it is more like The Blair Witch Project. Rather than get a selection of atrocities along the journey as typical with 80's cannibal flicks this journey mostly consists of our group fighting more and more among themselves with no real sign of the cannibals until the end.This is the second unofficial remake of Cannibal Holocaust in recent years. The other was Bruno Mattei's Mondo Cannibale in 2003. This film is basically the antiMondo Cannibale. MC had some pretty bad acting and very low budget production values but it gave us gore and gratuitous nudity and animal killings and all the other exploitation elements that CH was known for though on the cheap.On the other hand Welcome To The Jungle is a cannibal movie with all the exploitation elements removed. I'm not quite sure who the intended audience for this film is. Fans of oldschool 80's exploitation cannibal movies are going to be disappointed and left wanting. Younger folks are going to think it a Blair Witch ripoff albeit with a little bit more of a payoff.I expect the upcoming CH remake will also suffer this kind of mainstreaming and I don't think it really works. I think there was a reason that the Americans pretty much stayed away from doing cannibal movies in the 80's and that's because the whole point of the genre is that it is exploitive and nonmainstream. Take that away and as Welcome To The Jungle demonstrates there isn't much left.".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to the Jungle starts in Fiji where newlywed couple Mandi Sandy Gardiner  Colby Callard Harris are enjoying their honeymoon they meet up with old friends Bijou Veronica Sywak  Mikey Nick Richey who decide to get together. The two couples remember the story about Michael Rockefeller mysteriously disappearing off the coast of New Guinea in 1961 they recount stories of a helicopter pilot seeing an old white man living with a native tribe in the jungle  the two couples feel certain it's the missing Rockefeller. Sensing they could earn an absolute fortune if they do find him the two couples decide to travel to New Guinea  try to locate Rockefeller the task turns out to be anything but easy as they have to deal with armed robbers violent locals whom dislike Americans unforgiving jungle terrain  hungry native cannibals...Not to be confused with the sometimes similarly titled action film starring The Rock this was cophotographed written  directed by Jonathan Hensleigh who has written some really heavy weight Hollywood scripts including Die Hard With a Vengeance 1995  Armageddon 1998 this seems a rather odd choice of film for him to be involved with anyway I can't say I particularly liked it that much but strangely by the end I was warming to the style  the story. Lasting just under 80 minutes Welcome to the Jungle is a ripoff of The Blair Witch Project 1999 with it's 'found footage' recorded by those no longer with us structure it's odd because many say that The Blair Witch Project was a ripoff of Cannibal Holocaust 1980 which it was to some extent so for this film to introduce cannibals in the jungle as it's main plot feels strange to me. All of Welcome to the Jungle is 'found footage' so we get really bad edits all over the place where people are cut off scenes begin  end abruptly  while I am sure that the makers were trying to make it look  feel as homemade as possible it gets incredibly irritating. The idea that these four friends would trek through some really dangerous New Guinea jungle on the off chance they might find Michael Rockefeller is a stretch to say the least I mean if one of the richest men in the US couldn't find him what makes them think they can? The mysterious disappearance of Michael Rockefeller is true by the way nothing else in Welcome to the Jungle is though. A large problem with Welcome to the Jungle is that the four main character's spend the vast majority of the film arguing  bickering which gets annoying I did start to get into the film a bit by the end  was getting used to the style but that's about the best thing I can say about it.Because of the 'found footage' nature of Welcome to the Jungle it's an absolute eyesore to sit through there are times when the screen is pitch black  we just hear what's going on there are times when the camera jerks around all over the place  the editing feels strange as well. I know it's meant to have the look of a homemade film but it just gets irritating  annoying to watch. There's barely any gore a few dead bodies  a weaker take on one of Cannibal Holocaust's iconic imagery. Despite being about cannibals I can't remember any actual on screen cannibalism  it's really tame. Certainly not worthy of an 'Unrated' release it was released as a soft '15' over here in the UK. The only thing that works in the films favour are the locations which are very authentic looking very isolated  seem pretty dangerous  remote but that's not enough to save the film.Apparently filmed entirely in Fiji the film looks like what the makers intended it's just that I don't particularly like this style of filmmaking  think it looks cheap. The acting is alright the actor's have no material to work with apart from 'argue about this' dialogue.Welcome to the Jungle is probably about as good as the makers could have pulled off with what they were trying to do but I dislike the whole 'found footage' genre which doesn't help neither does the fact that there's no cannibalism or proper gore or shock's in it. Not my cup of tea at all.".

Sensing they could earn an absolute fortune if they do find him the two couples decide to travel to New Guinea  try to locate Rockefeller the task turns out to be anything but easy as they have to deal with armed robbers violent locals whom dislike Americans unforgiving jungle terrain  hungry native cannibals...Not to be confused with the sometimes similarly titled action film starring The Rock this was cophotographed written  directed by Jonathan Hensleigh who has written some really heavy weight Hollywood scripts including Die Hard With a Vengeance 1995  Armageddon 1998 this seems a rather odd choice of film for him to be involved with anyway I can't say I particularly liked it that much but strangely by the end I was warming to the style  the story. Lasting just under 80 minutes Welcome to the Jungle is a ripoff of The Blair Witch Project 1999 with it's 'found footage' recorded by those no longer with us structure it's odd because many say that The Blair Witch Project was a ripoff of Cannibal Holocaust 1980 which it was to some extent so for this film to introduce cannibals in the jungle as it's main plot feels strange to me. All of Welcome to the Jungle is 'found footage' so we get really bad edits all over the place where people are cut off scenes begin  end abruptly  while I am sure that the makers were trying to make it look  feel as homemade as possible it gets incredibly irritating. The idea that these four friends would trek through some really dangerous New Guinea jungle on the off chance they might find Michael Rockefeller is a stretch to say the least I mean if one of the richest men in the US couldn't find him what makes them think they can? The mysterious disappearance of Michael Rockefeller is true by the way nothing else in Welcome to the Jungle is though. A large problem with Welcome to the Jungle is that the four main character's spend the vast majority of the film arguing  bickering which gets annoying I did start to get into the film a bit by the end  was getting used to the style but that's about the best thing I can say about it.Because of the 'found footage' nature of Welcome to the Jungle it's an absolute eyesore to sit through there are times when the screen is pitch black  we just hear what's going on there are times when the camera jerks around all over the place  the editing feels strange as well. I know it's meant to have the look of a homemade film but it just gets irritating  annoying to watch. There's barely any gore a few dead bodies  a weaker take on one of Cannibal Holocaust's iconic imagery. Despite being about cannibals I can't remember any actual on screen cannibalism  it's really tame. Certainly not worthy of an 'Unrated' release it was released as a soft '15' over here in the UK. The only thing that works in the films favour are the locations which are very authentic looking very isolated  seem pretty dangerous  remote but that's not enough to save the film.Apparently filmed entirely in Fiji the film looks like what the makers intended it's just that I don't particularly like this style of filmmaking  think it looks cheap. The acting is alright the actor's have no material to work with apart from 'argue about this' dialogue.Welcome to the Jungle is probably about as good as the makers could have pulled off with what they were trying to do but I dislike the whole 'found footage' genre which doesn't help neither does the fact that there's no cannibalism or proper gore or shock's in it. Not my cup of tea at all.";

If they portrayed any character i would have been happy to sit for longer and wait for it to appear but it was like the script was produced by a teenager with an attitude problem. All the main characters were obnoxious and self centred. You may argue that this was to an extent partly at least the point of the film? like cannibal holocaust and others in same elk which portrayed the white people from privileged backgrounds were actually more sinister and barbaric than the characters who ate humans in the jungle maybe the idea was that these the main charters were more hateful than the cannibals?

As with the others the biggest issue besides the low budget that means we have cheap sets and costumes and special effects is that they take a short story and stretch it to the breaking point. The best part of the movie are the really cheesy songs many of which are unintentionally? funny. The song about ripped pants I kid you not had me rolling. The cast does a fine job.

	schema:reviewBody "On the most part while with their flaws and some are better than others the Cannon Movie Tales films are worth a viewing. Sleeping Beauty is not one of the best like Hansel and Gretel and Beauty and the Beast if anything it is a lesser effort but even with its faults it's more watchable than The Emperor's New Clothes.Sleeping Beauty's strengths are a good deal. Apart from some ropey special effects and less than elegant costumes for some of the human characters this is one of the betterlooking Cannon Movie Tale films and certainly could have looked far worse for lowbudget. It's beautifully photographed with a simply colourful rustic look the sets are some of the most lavish of any of Cannon's films the film is nicely lit and not as dim and faded as some of Cannon's other films and the fairy costuming and makeup are appropriate and colourful as well as more imaginative than most of Cannon's costume designs.Loved the use of the Waltz from the Sleeping Beauty ballet and the slow motion fairy dance choreography accompanying it really enchants and is not tacky at all. The crucial christening scene is well written and has the right amount of simple charm and nailbiting tension. The cast are hitandmiss but the good performances belong to Jane Wiedlin's alluring and sympathetic White Fairy Kenny Baker's amusing Elf and especially Sylvia Miles' genuinely scary and gleefully played Red Fairy.Was mixed however on the music and Nicholas Clay's Prince. The incidental score has the right amount of whimsy but has more of a synthesised 80s sound than the rest of the Cannon Movie Tale films which struck me as odd. The songs are pleasant in melody especially All in Sleep and Slumber and aren't too distracting but they are not one of Cannon's most memorable song scores either and a few contain some corny lyric writing like the pretty tacky Spin Spin Spin. Clay does bring some charm to the Prince but his screen time is limited and the character not that interesting so he is a little bland too.There are some misses in the cast however Morgan Fairchild is a blank as the Queen David Holliday overacts and mugs his way through his role and in particular Tahnee Welch's acting in the title role is more reminiscent of sleepwalking. The script and the story are very meandering the details of the fairy tale are all here but not always with the magic charm and tension needed apart from some welldone scenes like the christening. On top of this however the film is padded out with numerous other scenes that hold very little relevance to the story. This is particularly true with the Elves their scenes have tiresome humour feel out of place and just grind the film to a halt. The spindles subplot is not quite as bad but gets rather silly. Pacing is erratic the actual fairy tale feeling hurried and the padding drawn out.All in all decent but a lesser Cannon Movie Tale and not as enchanting as it could have been. 610 Bethany Cox".

When I was about 11 the video shop closed down and since then I have been searching for this film. I can still remember the words to the songs and I am now 21! Finally I have found a copy of it and cannot wait til I get it. I'm sure my son will enjoy it as much now as I did then. It is well recommended for children of all ages although some children may find the witch a little frightening it just depends on the child. It is a hard film to find but I would recommend looking for it and the other titles I mentioned earlier it will be a well loved film for children and for adults!".

They think they have found shelter but have really landed in the liar of an evil witch who likes to eat children.The opening is not faithful to the Brothers Grimm story but it is forgivable because of the terrifying last half Cloris Leachman's performance Nicola and Hugh as the two children and some nice sets and music numbers.Keep this one away from children under age 7.".

I managed to get my hands on this one my first of hopefully many Cannon Movie Tales. The story is the simple one of Hansel and Gretel padded out enough to make a movie.It starts with the worst family ever. The mom sits at home bitching while the wussy dad David Warner lets himself be pushed around and underpaid for the wood he cuts without putting up a fight. The two kids are deeply stupid singing and dancing around like morons who have no understanding of how messed up their situation is. Maybe this is some subtle propaganda for helping the underprivileged and mentally challenged. The mom gets mad at the kids and sends them off into the woods. Soon the dad returns home having finally sacked up and gotten his money. But now the kids are lost and come upon the candy house of a witch named Griselda a barely recognizable Cloris Leachman in a nice makeup job. Once the kids get lost the story gets good. There are spooky woods creepy gingerbread statues and a scary witch. It's quite a bit of fun and a nice change of pace from today's overpolished kids films.Despite this being from Cannon there are no guns anywhere. Nor is there any machismo or heaving bosoms. There are some terrible songs and an often sad story told in the most upbeat manner possible. Also the most unsettling happy ending ever. It's a good time though. I will definitely seek out more Cannon Movie Tales and recommend you do the same.".

Hansel and Gretel is one of the finer examples of the latter and gets my vote as the best of the series.It's not without its flaws all of the films in the series do some bigger and more serious than others. The lowbudget does show in the less than inspiring and toofancydresslike costumes and the witch's death underwhelms instead of being nailbiting like in the story the way it's done here causes some unintentional humour.Visually however on the most part Hansel and Gretel is actually one of the betterlooking Cannon Movie Tales films. It's lovingly photographed and has charming colourful settings and a fantastically realised Witch's House its delicious to look at but at the same time quite nightmarish design being one of the standout set designs of the Cannon Movie Tales films. The songs adapted from Humperdinck's wonderful opera are simply lovely and are beautifully adapted with the best performed being Sugar and Spice and the most effective melodically being A Fairy Song. The script is filled with fun and charm and also with a real sense of dread in the second half while the story adaptationwise follows the Grimm story fairly closely while expanding on some parts though actually it's closer to the story of the opera.The storytelling is whimsical and charming while also witty and poignant the Witch and her scenes also effectively induces nightmares without distorting the tone the Witch scenes are quite dark and are pretty tastefully handled. The film's nicely directed and the performances are solid with the standout being Cloris Leachman as the Witch. Her makeup is excellent and Leachman clearly has a ball without overcompensating too much and is genuinely frightening. Hugh Pollard and Nicola Stapleton are appealing as Hansel and Gretel and David Warner does bring a touching degree to a character who could easily have been portrayed as an idiot going by how he was written.Overall a winner from the Cannon Movie Tales series and my vote for their best. 910 Bethany Cox".

I'm glad they didn't make the mother so cold as in the original tale where she didn't seem to care about them. Nicola Stapleton was a nice little Snow White and plays the role of Gretl eagerly well but so does Hansel. But the real star is the evil witch she is so ugly and scary really I wouldn't want to be trapped in that house with her even not as adult. And all that sugary food shown it makes you want to have pie and cake for real! I think the movie found the perfect balance between scary the witch and sweet thanks to the songs.".

	schema:reviewBody "There will always be movies that try to make a quick cash grab at something that wasis popular and Speed Zone is one of many. Without 99 of the original cast this Cannonball Run fails to capture what made the first two movies special.Actually the actors they do have aren't bad at all they all seemed to have fun with their parts and all were some pretty big name actors. The problem is the plot it seems to go all over the place and it never really decides what direction it wants to go.Essentially you have a police chief who is obsessed with stopping the Cannonball at all costs and you have everyone else who is trying to keep in the race. That's about as much of the plot you're going to understand because the movie likes to throw in little subplots that literally go no where I swear it feels like I'm writing driving puns at this point.For exampleYou have a scene of the two female racers who happen upon a lone Chevy S10 in the middle of nowhere the driver of which is coaxed into racing them. This scene serves no purpose as it only last about a couple minutes and is never brought up again.Another glaring sub plot is when Cronan suddenly veers into oncoming traffic and almost hits a semi head on. The semi turns and gives chase. On and off again we're treated to a chase between Cronan and the truck with some eerie horror movie style music. The entire tone of the scenes does not mix well with what is supposed to be a fastpaced car movie and once again like the previously mentioned scene it abruptly ends and we never figure out what happened to the truck or why the driver chased Cronan in the first place.You will find lots of scenes like this that don't actually have a beginning or an end and really only feels like they were filmed from other movies then cut together as filler which at only 112 minutes they could have had a lot more story.The movie also loses focus on who the main characters are as it jumps around between everyone equally and other characters not so equally like the scene with Richard Petty who I don't believe was really him even though it says it was but unaccredited.The entire movie is just a major failure of random mini plots that has almost no climax and an ending that is by far subpar. It literally ends with the Smothers Brothers skiing? into the water with circus music.That being said despite it's glaring errors and no real direction it's still a fun movie to watch if you just want something to turn your brain off during and I did get a couple chuckles here and there from some of the silliness. I certainly wouldn't add it to my collection as part of the Cannonball Run movies but if I find a copy of it for a good price I may have to acquire it.".

Naturally right behind this Italian supercar the cops are in hot pursuit. In the meantime Lee Van Cleef in a very small cameo plays an elderly grandfather teaching his grandson how to skip stones across a small lake. Van Cleef tells the young boy how to throw the stone at just the right angle so it can skip across the water. All of a sudden the red Lambo comes roaring up to the waterline and flies across the obviously shallow lake skipping just like a flat stone...kinda it then takes off once it hits dry land. The young boy looks at his grandfather and asks him about the angle he should throw the stone Van Cleef looks at the car in disbelief and...annoyance I guess. The whole setup is cheesy as hell and doesn't really work to be honest its not funny at all and Van Cleef is wasted totally shame. The intro is good its always good to see an 80's Lambo tearing it up but it doesn't hold a candle to the first two movie intros.I think you can guess what the plot is here its another race from east Washington D.C. to west Santa Monica and the winners this time stand to receive 1 million Dollars. Unfortunately the D.C. chief of police Peter Boyle manages to arrest all of the drivers prior to game time so a whole bunch of new drivers must be found. One by one each sponsor clambers to find a new driver any way they can no matter who they are.In the starting grid this time we have Charlie John Candy who has been tricked and bullied into driving for his so called best friend from school Gus Eugene Levy. Charlie is a parking valet and brilliant driver hence Gus wanting him for the race. Along for the ride is Tiffany Gus's love interest for some reason mainly because she is eye candy. They use a BMW.Matt Frewer plays Englishman Alec who is in debt to loan sharks. They send a hitman to whack him Joe Flaherty but Alec persuades Vic to ride in the race with him in order to pay back the money he owes. Vic may have other ideas though. They drive a Jag XJS.The two sexy ladies for this movie aren't quite as sexy as the previous two but hey you gotta have the sexy ladies in a sexy car its obligatory. Here they manage to persuade a Ferrari owner to use his Spyder. The duo are MIT grads and electronicsgadgets experts so they use their brains and electronic gizmos to assist them in gaining the upper hand. This is the easy bit of tame progression for the movie and 80's having the sexy females actually going against the norm and being intelligent and skillful characters instead of just skimpily dressed sluts.Tim Matheson is a TV reporter who gets caught up in the race in his van so he decides to race. The driver of the red Lambo from the intro sequence John Schneider of 'The Dukes of Hazzard' gets arrested with all the other original drivers its left in the hands of an Italian porter. An ice cool dude called Flash steps up outta nowhere and takes control to drive it he's an excop and wants the money for his own unknown reasons. Flash is a super cool shades wearing driver where as the Italian is a trembling nervous wreck.Lastly Nelson and Randolph Sloane are two millionaires who spend their whole time trying to cheat their way to the finish mainly by catching a plane to the finish line. They drive a Bentley Corniche. Jamie Farr makes a cameo as the Sheik from the first two movies but he doesn't race.As you can imagine much of the run time is taken up with the predictable scenarios of the various characters getting into all sorts of close calls. There are some nice moments of car porn but nowhere near as much as the previous two movies this time an emphasis has been put on making the few set pieces bigger. Hence the race from downtown Washington D.C. which is a highlight admittedly the race into Santa Monica and the use of a large aircraft. In between all that there are various small cameos of course and the usual tomfoolery and slapstick routines. One such sequence sees Candy pretty much redoing homaging? a famous scene from his classic movie 'Planes Trains and Automobiles'. Another sees a learner driver being taught by a racist instructor who bullies the learner into overtaking any foreign car whilst he verbally abuses the driver as they pass. Definitely another highlight as its actually very amusing to see this guys reaction to a Volvo and Alfa Romeo.All things considering there aren't many if any car wrecks in this movie it seems they were too scared to possibly damage anything or maybe the budget wasn't high enough. The movie takes an age to get going and an age to actually finish and once the race is done it carries on with boring fluff. Its not a particularly funny film or exciting film alas we've kinda seen it all before now and this feels very much like beating a dead horse. Nonetheless it is fun at times the cars are great as always as long as you like cars and the range of character actors on display is reasonable. 410".

The only reason I figured out that this was a sequel to those movies is the Jamie Farr character who makes a very brief appearance in this movie. Other than that the movie is almost completely different. This one was not all that good but I thought it was a bit better than the second movie anyway even though this movie was full of b stars galore with only John Candy being the only real alist star to appear in this movie. The film is not only not that good for the most part but it is also rather forgettable as other than a few scenes involving Candy and a plane I have very few memories of this movie. Granted I only saw the movie once but I still usually remember a movie when I have seen it before. So in the end another unnecessary sequel to a somewhat enjoyable comedy that being the first movie and not something I would really recommend. However it had some funny moments and at least it did not try to be exactly the same movie like the second movie did.".

I had just bought a jaguar XJS in blue with a red stripe. The exact same type from Speed Zone. I remembered the name and tried to find it in Europe. I couldn't and after long and hard searching on the internet eventually found it on ebay. When i watched it i was disappointed. Yes the car chase sequences are good  but for an hour and a half long film there are not enough. Half of the film is trying to build on John Candy's love relationship with his passenger  and while the first few of these scenes are quirky and amusing  they get boring very quickly. Alex and Vic in their XJS are the best characters to follow but they seldomly appear. The news reporters are also annoying with random wrong comments that the writers obviously put in to liven the film up. John Schneider from the dukes of hazard's name appears high up in the list of names in the credits from the beginning but he only has 4 lines and appears for about 30 seconds. I like this film despite it's corny mess and the actors bad acting because the car chases are good. If you are a car person then this is a must but if you enjoyed all the other car chase films  leave this one out. you'll be glad you did.".

Wishing to dedicate themselves entirely to the service of society they have renounced personal happiness considering their love as an impermissible sidetrack from the requirements of the time. Now after all this time they are reviving the memory of the tiny garret room of the shortlived feelings which they have sacrificed.

	schema:headline " One hell of a good complex thriller !!!";
	schema:reviewBody " Los Sin Nombre 2 Synopsis The story of a woman who fights against her destiny a daughter who inherits the terrible past of her father who will not resign herself to her given role and takes control of her fate to change things.The beginning of the movie we see a guy getting dressed taking his Jaguar while at the same time there are shots edited inbetween of a woman ready to give birth. The shots jump from the guy in the Jaguar to people praying in a church and back again to the women giving birth. While this runs by on your screen the guy shoots himself thru the head. At this point we see a 'church scene' and we see the burial of this man who committed suicide. A few minutes later we will know this man was the father of the woman in labor. Why this marvelous scene was edited this way and the reason of the suicide we will discover later on in the movie. I'm trying not to spoil too much.The movie has a very strong opening !!! Just like and we can compare the both of them a little 'Jade'. Same set up as in Jade with that same unbelievable strong opening sequence. So you know right away from the beginning of the film you are in for some great movie quality time! Openingscenes like this are marvelous and I just adore them!In this movie the music is just impeccable. We have here some orchestral choir with unbelievable great voices. Sounds bringing the right atmosphere to the whole opening scene and throughout the rest of the movie. The beginning of the movie the editing of the shots in combination with that powerful and strong music piece gives me time after time goose bumps. The overall music 'dramatic' in this movie is just perfect. Like some of you will know a movie stands or falls already 50 with the music they use for it !!! Here we get a mixture of some Celticfolk cathedral orchestral choir voices. At certain times my mind jumped to the sound of the Wicker Man and in particular Jade. Some of the best soundtracks ever used for movies.The main character called 'Deedee' a special name her father gave her. Deedee  Daniella Logan played by Erica Prior. It is one of her first important roles she plays and she lives up to it. Her character is set and stands strong on screen her acting isn't bad at all. She gives a real emotion and believability to her character.The story further on the way is as followed. Watch it may contain SPOILERS while you read this. For a bizarre reason when she returns to her father's grave she sees that the grave has been broken burnt and the body has been stolen. Police will or can't do anything about it and leave her in the cold so to speak. This is the only predictable thing in the movie starting her own investigation! After some days the police find her father's body naked in a certain position all tangled up in barbwire.We have some autopsy scenes and dead body scenes. Well the director made a good decision by keeping it in mind that quality counts and not quantity. The setup of these scenes are very much like the first 'Los sin nombre'. This means quality FX not overdone and in the right proportion. Thru this philosophy 'Less is more' you are in for some great FX shots. Scenes though very disgusting by times have a very nice and peaceful overall feeling. Again it is just knowing how to put on which music by editing the scenes. While we get along in the movie the mother of Deedee and her uncle Harris become very important characters. As for the tree she has in her front garden. As said before already a few times the music reminds me of the Wicker Man but also the story has some Wicker Man and Omen roots. I don't wont to spoil the whole movie because it is a 'Must SEE'. The only thing I want to add to end. This is a complex story that handles the subject of sects and the atrocities that flow out of religions. In this case the sect of the 'Abrahamites'. Up to you or you want to find out what this sect is all about. Seek see and enjoy.So you want to see a complex horror related movie that has a logical order and will explain itself minute by minute. With marvelous camera angles and shots good acting marvelous music go then for this one El Segundo nombre! He can certainly compete with the first one. Los Sin Nombre I would even say this one is better much stronger. For me 8.510.Dario Sayonara. Not to be confused with cyanide which is of course goodbye in any language".

	onyx:emotionText " Los Sin Nombre 2 Synopsis The story of a woman who fights against her destiny a daughter who inherits the terrible past of her father who will not resign herself to her given role and takes control of her fate to change things.The beginning of the movie we see a guy getting dressed taking his Jaguar while at the same time there are shots edited inbetween of a woman ready to give birth. The shots jump from the guy in the Jaguar to people praying in a church and back again to the women giving birth. While this runs by on your screen the guy shoots himself thru the head. At this point we see a 'church scene' and we see the burial of this man who committed suicide. A few minutes later we will know this man was the father of the woman in labor. Why this marvelous scene was edited this way and the reason of the suicide we will discover later on in the movie. I'm trying not to spoil too much.The movie has a very strong opening !!! Just like and we can compare the both of them a little 'Jade'. Same set up as in Jade with that same unbelievable strong opening sequence. So you know right away from the beginning of the film you are in for some great movie quality time! Openingscenes like this are marvelous and I just adore them!In this movie the music is just impeccable. We have here some orchestral choir with unbelievable great voices. Sounds bringing the right atmosphere to the whole opening scene and throughout the rest of the movie. The beginning of the movie the editing of the shots in combination with that powerful and strong music piece gives me time after time goose bumps. The overall music 'dramatic' in this movie is just perfect. Like some of you will know a movie stands or falls already 50 with the music they use for it !!! Here we get a mixture of some Celticfolk cathedral orchestral choir voices. At certain times my mind jumped to the sound of the Wicker Man and in particular Jade. Some of the best soundtracks ever used for movies.The main character called 'Deedee' a special name her father gave her. Deedee  Daniella Logan played by Erica Prior. It is one of her first important roles she plays and she lives up to it. Her character is set and stands strong on screen her acting isn't bad at all.

In 1591 he reached Venice where he displeased a Mocenigo and was denounced to the Inquisition. He was sent to Rome where he spent six years in prison before he was burned at the stake for heresy.  Gian Maria Volont one of the great actors of the century who appeared in such disparate films as For a Few Dollars More The Abyss and Il Caso Moro stars as the sensual and highly intelligent monk. The narrative begins with Bruno's arrival in Venice and naturally the movie compresses much and doubtless has simplified.

Gian Maria Volonte is magnificent as Bruno he couldn't have been made more convincing in his increasingly desperate argument and protests showing also his very human sides while the chief merit of the film is its marvellous visual language often turning the film into pure expressionism aided by the at times overwhelmingly apt music by Ennio Morricone. This is more than a film it's an inspired passion of a film showing Italian historical realism at its best. I didn't know this film existed before I stumbled upon it searching for something else and starting to watch it there was nothing else to do but to see it through till the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Most 80's teen flicks leave a rather sick feeling in my stomach but this one has always been a favorite despite the stereotypical shallow bighaired girls and the Animal House wannabe jocks. The difference is that the stars Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson are not so stereotypical in their roles as lonely nerd and ultrapopular head cheerleader.Patrick Dempsey has always been underrated as an actor with style and it is unfortunate that his character Ronald is so unlikable after the film's premise kicks in. Ronald goes from geek to chic and back again. But Dempsey himself seems too inherently confident to really pull off the geek aspect believably and he's too cruel to the girl whose heart he won for Ronald to be a truly sympathetic character. The hip version of Ronald however is a hoot to watch even if it is somewhat overdone in the context of an already unlikely plot. The standout in this film is Amanda Peterson whose character Cindy has to be one of the most genuinely likeable stuck up high school girls on film. Watching her character grow and open her heart to Ronald is the main reason I've given this film repeated viewings. Although the genres are quite different I'd compare Peterson's character to Renee Zellweger's character in Jerry MaGuire in terms of sheer likability. Making characters likeable is much more difficult than making them sympathetic and I'm frankly shocked that Peterson's career did not skyrocket after this performance.Whether you're looking for creative ways to invest 1000 or dancing lessons Can't Buy Me Love is one 80's teen flick that has a lot to offer.".

Although the genres are quite different I'd compare Peterson's character to Renee Zellweger's character in Jerry MaGuire in terms of sheer likability. Making characters likeable is much more difficult than making them sympathetic and I'm frankly shocked that Peterson's career did not skyrocket after this performance.Whether you're looking for creative ways to invest 1000 or dancing lessons Can't Buy Me Love is one 80's teen flick that has a lot to offer.";

What was the reason for making an exact replica of the film Love Don't Cost A Thing except geared for young black audiences? Why not just make an original romantic comedy altogether instead of trying to replicate this particular teen movie? I hate remakes. Can't Buy Me Love ridicules the high school caste systemthat popular kids are the invincible social class that other social groups strive to be part of but are limited by the understood rigid rules of their place among the social system. Ronald Patrick Dempsey is supposed to be the hopeless nerd. He's a quiet kid that flocks with loners one of them being the cool Max Perlich. Ronald is in love with senior cheerleader Cindy Mancini Amanda Peterson. As the popular rich cheerleader she is definitely hands off for Ronald. Ronald wants the girl. He wants to be popular. Is it possible for the geek to transcend his expected role in the game of high school social groups? Definitely but for Ronald the consequences are disasturous and also conducive to helping Ronald straighten out his priorities of friendship love and the like. Is he willing to trade it all in for popularity and all the superficiality that comes with it?Ronald's opportunity arrives when Cindy stumbles into the mall one day looking to return or exchange her mother's outfit stained with wine thanks to Cindy who wasn't supposed to be wearing it anways. The price of a new outfit 1000. So Ronald who happens to have that cash since he was saving up for a telescope makes Cindy an offer to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. Ronald expects that this will give him just the popularity he wants. To be a high school senior friends with Cindy and make the A List? For Ronald that's all he wants. Cindy's grossed out by the idea at first not wanting to be scene with Donald as she constantly mistakens his name. But with the Mancini make over Ronald's on his way to being the new stud on campus. One month later Ronald is rubbing elbows with Cindy's senior friends cheerleaders Barbara and Patti and and jocks Big John and Ricky. But Ronald in his transition seemed to forgot that what he wanted all along was a date with Cindy Mancini who's makeover has turned Ronald into some kind of monster. Ronald doesn't only push Cindy away but also his closest friend Kenneth Courtney Gains and the rest of his old crowd of friends who hate their friend's newfound social life. But how far is Ronald willing to go? And how long can he live down the lie?It was one of three good movies Dempsey made in 1987 along with Loverboy and In the Mood actually the latter is better than the former all being cute romantic comedies. But I think Can't Buy Me Love will always be my favorite. Patrick Dempsey Amanda Peterson Seth Green who plays Ronald's little brother Chuckie or hell even Max Perlich fans are certain to like this movie. It's got good style for the 80s too and hot teen cast. I still think it is one of the top 80s teen comedies.".

Maybe this movie was even a huge cliche back in the eighties.  But I'm still gonna give it the benefit of the doubt.  I catch this movie on TBS quite a lot of times and I can't help but enjoy it.  There are certain cliched scenes that just force me to roll my eyes and sigh yet I can't change the channel.  Well there are two key elements that make this flyweight teen comedy work  Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. They both give charming performances and have a wonderful chemistry.  Even though you know exactly what will happen between them it's still a delight to see them on screen.  Dempsey hasn't had a big role in years and you can technically classify him as a hasbeen but he is a good charismatic actor. And it would've been nice if his career actually took off.  As for Peterson I don't remember her from any other movies so I have no knowledge of her career.  All I know is she's goodlooking and I liked her in this movie.  The story is as predictable as you can get with paperthin characters but as I said it's good flyweight entertainment.  Strictly a guilty pleasure. If I were in the mood for a goodand by that I mean good in qualityhigh school movie I'd watch Ghost World or one of the American Pie movies. But if I just want to kick back and watch a cheesy high school movie that will put a smile on my face and contains no intellectual value I'll watch Can't Buy Me Love.  Of course the movie has a message at the end about being yourself and not caring what others think of you but the message is delivered with the finesse of an afterschool special and is strictly pasted on.  When you have characters that are so stereotypical and implausible it's hard to fit in a believable message.  But what would a high school movie be without a schmaltzy third act?  That's why I recommend this movie just as a guilty pleasure.  It's far from great yet undeniably appealing.  But please do not bother to analyze this movie.  You'll be wasting your time.    My score  7 out of 10".

In a way not all will agree with Neil or the song but this movie had me in stitches at times given that I didn't laugh as much as Fast Times At Ridgemeont High this was a more heart felt story of a young nerdgeek Dempseywho is definitely coming into his own. Not all geeks stay geeks. Not all nerds stay nerds either. Patrick Dempsey successfully plays the guy you root for! And on top of it all are Cindy's gorgeous girlfriends that he is now a part of ...their world.Look back at your high school days and see who really changed. It's quite amazing sometimes. In this fun flick made in good Ole Tucson Arizona the cast of nuts and crazies was like the stock market with that 'Popularity' thing up up up then down and out. Patrick Dempsey was so right in this 'Ronny' character I still laugh. I kind of remember a Cindy Mancini type in high school which I'm sure many do. That superhot chic guys were lining up for. Back in 1998 I was working at a resort in Phoenix and got to meet and put Amanda Petersen Cindy Mancini into a towncar for the airport. She was very nice and looked great in person. She signed my little ticket and called me 'Babe' I was charmed by her she was very wonderful to meet even briefly. She kissed me on the cheek before getting into the Towncar...it was one of those moments in life. I probably looked like Charlie Brown after being kissed by the little redheaded girl at that point as the car was pulling away.I recommend this for all the high school crazy antics we all did and or miss from that era in our lives.

I can tell you why this movie was not a hit when it came out but really is a cult favorite now. This movie exposed the 'popular' myth it showed just how fragile and shallow the 'popular' thing is and how many are simply followers. Of course popular kids at the time would not warm to this movie it showed them to be either manipulators or followers neither of which anyone wanted to admit to.People mention how this movie does not compare to John Hughes films and you are right. Because in his flicks the popular kids come out looking good at the end. Hughes films are better written and overall acted but they are not as honest or real as this movie.I am sick of people complaining about stereotypes. WhyHow does a stereotype exist?!?! Because there are many many people who ARE the stereotype. Stereotypes are not created from nothing they are the single expression of large whole. Complain about stereotypes when they are inaccurate. The stereotypes in this movie are spot on.I know personally that a big reason I love this movie is because I was on both sides of the fence. I was in the popular crowd when I was young from 1st  7th grades. Then we moved. For a year I was kinda a nerdloner I just hung around the perimeter. I was friends with most of the 'popular' girls but disliked almost all the 'popular' guys so eventually did my own thing. I was liked by most groups at the school but was not part of the 'popular' group.. by choice. But I also did one of the meanest things I have ever done in my life. I basically stole another guys friend and then told him to beat it because he was not 'cool' enough. I am still ashamed of that. I was basically a kid trying to be cool that really was a nerd inside. Moved again for my last 2 years of HS. This really was a bizarre experience as the 'popular' group was small and not well defined. I think this was due to so many new students moving into the area and I guess disrupting things. My best friend was a nerd but a very very smart one and a year younger. Again I did my own thing and liked who I wanted to like. It was also at this HS that I witnessed something very similar to the movie.This was in the grade below me. A 'popular' pretty girl dumped a jock and began dating a guy from the 'bad' crowd you know the group that wore metal concert tshirts and smoked. Wow it was amazing to see the effects this had on the school and in particular that class it turned the whole 'popular' thing on it's head.One other reason this movie works is that the chemistry between Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson is obvious. They just have it.".

I could tell just by the description in the photo cover that I was going to really like this movie.Cindy and Ronald have amazing chemistry in this movie and both of their characters really surprised me. I thought I had the movie predicted that she would fall for him during their deal but I never suspected that he would become such a jerk in the process. He really did let it go to his head!My favorite scenes were of Cindy and Ronald together my only complaint is that I wish we had seen them bond more before he became a narcissistic jerk. The scene with the airplane graveyard and the moon was absolutely beautiful. It broke my heart that she thought they were going to continue seeing each other but he thought otherwise. It's sad because if she had expressed her feelings right then and there I do not think that chaos would have ensued as it did.I also would have liked more clarity on Cindy and Bobby's relationship. Did he seriously not call her from the first day of school through new year's? Because that's what it seemed like and if so I have no idea what he thought he had to be angry about. The remains of their relationship seemed to be a joke to me and deep down I think Cindy knew that and that was why she was dating other guys.Lots of laughs and tears throughout the movie with great acting by the main cast. And a baby Seth Green! It was sad but understandable why Kenneth would not forgive Ronald for what he had done. I am glad they all worked it out in the end like true friends. It is very insightful how Ronald becoming a bad person made Cindy become a better person. She saw first hand how she had been behaving all these years and how it wasn't worth it. Her character really surprised me. I wish the ending hadn't felt so rushed but it was definitely a happy one! I would definitely recommend this movie to all!".

Of course this creates unforeseen problems. Courtney Gains plays his geek friend and Seth Green his little brother. This is better than some 80's teen flicks e.g. Molly Ringwald's movies but not as good as others Fast Times at Ridgemont High. It's arguably on par with Just One of the Guys and Some Kind of Wonderful. Unlike those films however it has a semicampy vibe wherein the cast members often exaggerate their lines in an artificial way which telegraphs that what's happening isn't real. If you can roll with this odd element there's a lot of good in Can't Buy Me Love and the ending is genuinely moving. There are many seriousrealistic scenes like the notable airplane graveyard sequence. The two protagonists have good chemistry and their relationship arc is convincing. Tina Caspary Barbara and Darcy DeMoss Patty are serviceable on the fringe female front. THE FILM RUNS 1 hours  34 minutes and was shot in Tucson Arizona. WRITER Michael Swerdlick. GRADE BB 6.510".

I say they copied Grease or any other Greaser films just so Patrick Dempsey looked good in this which he did but Rom Com is definitely not for him to act in!".

Ronald Miller Patrick Dempsey is the head nerd and essentially avoided by everyone except his fellow geeks. One day in the local shopping mall he happens to observe Cindy in some emotional distress and goes over to see what is wrong. He then learns that one of the jocks at the school accidentally spilled red wine on a very valuable suede jacket she took from her mother's closet and she desperately needs 1000 dollars to replace it. Since she needs the money and he wants to feel what it's like to be popular in school he offers her the money he has saved mowing lawns in exchange for her being his girlfriend in public for a month. Unfortunately for them neither of them realize the ramifications. Now as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that that this is one of the better 80's teen comedies produced with both Amanda Peterson and Patrick Dempsey performing in an exceptional manner. One particular scene involving the African Anteater Dance was especially hilarious. In any case I highly recommend this movie for those interested in a film of this type and rate it as above average.".
