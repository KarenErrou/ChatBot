The eternal triangle wrapped in pretentious dialogue which was the trade mark of playwright Henry Bernstein. To admire Resnais achievement one has only to look at the previous film from the same source Paul Czinner's Dreaming Lips 1936starring his elfinlike wife Elisabeth Bergner a very good melodramatic film with a magnificent work by Miss Bergner and Raymond Massey but nothing more. The Resnais film hypnotizes you and forbids you to apart your eyes from the screen simply by moving the camera among the characters in closeup after closeup while they deliver an extremely intelligent but not specially profound dialog. A sixminute close up of Andr Dussolier while he tells a story is only one of the astounding achievements of the director in treating a film as if it were a play and at the same time treating a play as if it were a film. We have even a curtain between the acts. But the marvelous camera movements make all the difference. I know nothing about Sabine Azema except that she won the French Cesar award for her work in this film but certainly her performance in Melo is something that anybody would like to tell about to his grandchildren. The film is slow but you don't feel it as slow because all the performers are taking their work seriously and giving their best to their parts. Melo  proves that Alain Resnais is a true artist. Many have tried to do something like Melo but only Resnais has succeeded. I must be fair and declare here that I did not care a bit for Hiroshima mon Amour.".

Assuming that oiling the wheels of creaky vehicles is worth doing at all then Resnais does it as well as anyone and it would be bordering on the impossible to assemble a cast containing in addition to Sabine Azema Pierre Arditi to say nothing of his sister Fanny Ardant and Andre Dussolier and not produce a finished product worth watching.  It also says a lot for panellists and juries that one of them saw fit to bung Azema a major Best Actress gong for her work here.

Resnais still has my trust but this is certainly no example of what he's capable of.Well that is to say the direction is perfectly fine as is the acting. Really everybody does their work quite well. The problem is the play that this movie is based on and the way the movie does not open the play into a broader world.The play itself is almost pure melodrama the type where the woman literally roles on the ground in existential and emotional agony over how in love with someone she is. Yes that type the type where you're staring at the screen with your mouth half open and thinking Really? REALLY? What have you done with your life surely there's more definition to your existence than this one random guy! And the guy is a boring French concert violinist. Indeed.The lighting is fun because Resnais takes the stagestyle lighting and makes it even more directional letting the spotlights serve as closeups to distinguish what the eye is attracted to as opposed to drawing the camera too close. The camera movements are decent in that they keep the eye looking at precisely what he wants you to look at. But I miss the formal experimentation and the breaking of editing boundaries inherent to much of Resnais's work. This is the first time I've seen his movie edited for strict continuity and thus you are trapped in basically the one place you don't want to be trapped in a Resnais filmreal time. What with the methodical intellectual agonizing of most of his plots doing it in real time is not much more fun than doing it yourself with no idea when it'll end.Resnais is usually able to completely recreate the emotional experience of memory and desire in his movies. Here he has completely unrelatable characters grimacing and trying not to say what everybody knows they mean. It's a shocking difference.PolarisDiB".

Musically. the film is better than average for a rock and roll film even with Jimmy Clanton's usual nasal and bland vocalizing. The Cadillacs do two songs Jay Walker dressed as Policemen and the wonderful Please Mr. Johnson. Jackie Wilson is terrific as usual he was a very close friend of Alan Freed  and proves once again what a tremendous talent he was. The movie has some historical musical moments as well. This film has the only motion picture performance by the late great Ritchie Valens he does the Little Richard inspired Ohh My Head. Also featured is Eddie Cochran doing Teenage Heaven.  Unfortunately performances by Eddie are rare because of his death in a traffic accident in  England the following year. Check out Harvey of The Moonglows doing a rare solo number and a good performance by Jo Ann Campbell. Costar Sandy Stewart performs two songs including a nice up tempo called Playmate. Jo Gohnny Go's plot is a little above average and the acting is fine in most cases. Chuck Berry is especially believable as is veteran character actor Herb Vigran. I just wish someone other than Jimmy Clanton were cast in a co starring role. Sure he's the right age but his acting is a bit wooden and his songs and voice makes you want to reach for the fast forward button on your remote control. Still I would recommend this movie. Don't miss this one for a good time great music and a little rock and roll history.".

I found it and bought it on VHS some years ago and felt lucky to find it. Jimmy Clanton was one of my musical heroes and he sang Ship on a Stormy Sea in this plus several other songs. It is one of the few viewings of the great Eddie Cochran although he does not have his electric guitar plugged in it is still worth seeing him. Others in the film are great musically. Yes the plot lacks but most of this genre of movie lacked a plot. They were a quick and cheap way to rush the visual aspect of our stars to us the young audience and they entertained us. Remember that they were made for our 1319 year old minds and we were not technically aware. But it did not differ from Dick Clark having the same people on his shows when they did not sing but mouthed the words. It has flaws but it is well worth having for anyone who wants to see and remember Jimmy Clanton Jackie Wilson Chuck Berry Eddie Cochran and Richie Valens.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of several Hollywood movies made in the 1950's attempting to be cool by featuring the new fadto them called rock 'n' roll. The only time Hollywood ever featured real rock 'n' roll from the early days of the new teen music was when rock artists with hit records were allowed to perform on the big screen. The Hollywood concocted rock 'n' roll was unbearable then and even more so today. The best of the rock 'n' roll films by far was The Girl Can't Help It which was clever and humorous plus featuring many of the big rock artists of the day including an outstanding scene showing Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps. Of all the others this one Go Johnny Go succeeds the best and as has been noted by others is the only place you can see the multitalented seventeen year old superstar Richie Valens strutting his stuff on the big screen just before his tragic death.Since there was no such animal as a music video most teens heard their favorite rock stars on vinyl or on the radio. From time to time rock phenomena would appear on television on such shows as Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen. Dick Clark's American Bandstand seldom let the rock performers do their own thing. Most of the time the artists were asked to lipsynch their recordings. A major exception to this rule was Jerry Lee Lewis who insisted that he be allowed to do his hits live with his band. Therefore it was truly a treat to get to see rockers on the big screen.This movie has one of the best lists of great rock performers of the decade. There were many socalled asphalt Elvises around by 1959 especially the notorious Fabian but lumping Jimmy Clanton with them is a mistake. Like Ricky Nelson Clanton had a feel for the music he made. His looks left much to be desired but his songs were not half bad particularly his one big hit Just a Dream one of my favorite teen ballads from the period.Fans of early rock 'n' roll will get a kick out of watching the antics of such wonderful do wop groups as the Flamingos and the The Cadillacs. What an entertaining stage show these groups must have delivered. The only other do wop group to surpass these two were the outrageous Coasters. The legendary Jackie Wilson who even impressed the King himself Elvis when he saw him in Las Vagas shows why he was one of the seminal entertainers of the decade. Chuck Berry not only performs some of his best songspossibly Johnny B. Goode is his bestbut does a decent job acting as well. Too bad he was set up by the government and had to spend time in prison not long after this movie was produced. Then the viewer gets to see the talented Eddie Cochran one of the best songwritersmusicians of the era. Harvey Fuqua helped make the Moonglows a hit but the rest of the do wop group added that little extra oomp needed to have it all jell. Still Harvey is fine as a solo act.Allen Freed who not long after this picture was produced was crucified by the press and made the fall guy for the payola scandal adds a touch of authenticity to the movie though he leaves a little to be desired in the acting department. Many in the US governmentsomewhat of a holdover from the McCarthy periodviewed rock 'n' roll as subversive never mind that the Communists felt the same way but for a different ideological reason. By promoting the asphalt Elvises such as Fabian Frankie Avalon and Paul Anka the politicians hoped to stifle the real rock stars. The government put Chuck Berry in jail drafted Elvis wrecked Allen Freed's career prodding him to succumb to alcoholism and encouraged Little Richard to pursue a calling to be a preacher. Indirectly the government aided the free press in publicizing Jerry Lee Lewis' third marriage to his thirteen year old cousin. All this and more...but the beat goes on.The story told in Go Johnny Go is a juvenile one about Freed a rock promoter making Jimmy Clanton a star through a talent search. This time it's innocuous enough and doesn't get in the way of some of the best music this side of heaven. Rock on cool cats rock on!".

The film is also one of the first offerings under the new banner the company is using The Sprocket Vault.I was familiar with the name Kit Parker from my college days a time when his company was just starting out. At that time his company handled a number of 16mm films for rental most of them classics from the golden days of Hollywood. By classics I'm not talking huge budgeted studio features the studios had the rights to those. But Parker made a name for himself and his company by offering great old films at decent rental prices. When video and then DVD rolled around he transferred those films and continues to market them.GO JOHNNY GO tells the story of young Johnny Melody Jimmy Clanton with a name like that he's destined for showbiz an orphan who's out on his own now and looking to make his mark as a professional singer. He knows he has talent now all he needs is a break. Fortune smiles on him when he runs into Julie Arnold Sandy Stewart a young girl he knew in the orphanage who was adopted. They share dreams both wanting to become singers and plan to meet up again sometime.Both of them get the chance when radio personality Allan Freed and his PR man decide to have a contest giving some young singer the chance to become the next big star with a spot on his rock and roll road show. This is where Berry steps in as a musician who works for Freed as well as being a star himself. Julie is recording her record to submit when she runs into Johnny again spending his last money of his recording.The submissions roll in and Freed hears Johnny's song. The PR man and Berry insists that the kid has potential. But he doesn't have a phone. His plan to call run astray when Freed and his group step out to visit a club. Fortunately Julie and Johnny are at the same club! And yet they miss their chance to talk to Freed! Good heaven's what will happen next? Watch and see to find out.Throughout the film there are performances by some of the top solo artists and groups of the day. That is one of the things that makes this movie so special and one to add to the collection of every classic rock and roll fan. Those performers include Richie Valens Jackie Wilson The Flamingos Eddie Cochran Harvey Fuqua JoAnn Campbell and the Cadillacs. All are tremendous fun to watch listen to and enjoy. Even Berry gets the chance to perform his classic Memphis and do his signature duck walk.In the fifties and sixties movies like this were being made to meet the demand of fans who wanted to see their favorite music stars. It wasn't like today when everyone can click on YouTube on their cell phone and watch a performer. These moves were made on the cheap but they still offered a combination of story musical performances and entertainment as well as a huge heap of charm that drew fans in. Now you can enjoy it as well with this release.In addition to getting the best quality print that can be found of this film it also offers a commentary track featuring Richard M. Roberts Randy Skeetvedt and Brent Walker. There is also a copy of the original trailer as well. If you grew up listening to this music you'll want to add this one to your collection.".

The bus had been having engine problems and the interior heating system was not working. As a result Jape was coming down with the flu and asked Buddy Holly if he could have Holly's bass player's seat on the plane. The bass player for Holly at that time was Waylon Jennings. Jennings gave up his seat and the Big Bopper Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holly took off at 100 AM in the morning from Clear Lake Iowa and entered rock and roll history only eight miles from the airport.At the time of the crash Ritchie Valans's singles La Bomba and Donna made him the most popular artist on the bill.".

He and Freed actually act together in this one as they try to get singer Johnny Melody Jimmy Clanton on his way to stardom. Now that I just got much of the plot out of the way I'll just say that it was quite a pleasure seeing Berry performing his hits Memphis Tennessee and Little Queenie here. Also loved Jackie Wilson being showcased among the other performances. The movie itself was quite compelling dramatically but I'm glad things get resolved quickly so it doesn't drag. Unfortunately after this both Freed and Berry would be involved in scandalsFreed in payola and Berry in a sex charge involving a minor with the result of Freed drinking himself to death and Berry serving a few years in jail before making a comeback several years later. This would also become the only appearance of Ritchie Valens before his untimely passing in a plane crash that also took the lives of The Big Bopper and Buddy Holly. He was good too! On a lighter note since I always like to cite when players from my favorite movieIt's a Wonderful Lifeare in something else here it's Dick Elliotwho was that man who told Jimmy Stewart to kiss Donna Reed instead of talking to her to deathwho's impatient about going into the phone booth after Clanton and his girlfriend keep hogging the phone! It was hilarious! It was also his last film appearance though he continued to appear on TV before his death in 1961. Anyway I highly recommend Go Johnny Go! to any Chuck Berry fans out there. P.S. Jimmy Clanton is a native of my current hometown of Baton Rouge LA.".

That's particularly the case with Chuck Berry who could do a driving beat with the best of them. Not here however. The producers have even added white bread Jimmy Clanton to headline even though his crooning style better suits preRR. The movie is clearly a commercial product running a bit scared of the raucous style it's gently alluding to.

	schema:reviewBody "Go Johnny Go! from 1959 is a showcase of Rock and Roll talent from its early years. Eddie Cochran Jackie Wilson Ritchie Valens the Cadillacs and Chuck Berry are all on hand here. Unfortunately poor Ritchie was already gone by the time this film came out and Eddie Cochran would be killed in an auto accident the following year. It didn't take long before Chuck Berry was being indicted which put the skids on his career for years. Still it's great to see these legends in their prime. The simplistic plot of this movie only serves to give the musical acts some brief intervals so there isn't much to say about it. It revolves around a chip on his shoulder teenage orphan Jimmy Clanton who wants to become a singing star in the worst way. The worst way describes the rest of his flimsy story. On the plus side Clanton sings a few tunes himself and there's no doubt that he had some talent although this movie did little to advance his career. Of historical note is the appearance of record deejay Alan Freed who is instrumental in the plot of this film. Within a year or two after this movie's release Freed was testifying before the U.S. Congress regarding his role in the Record Payola Scandal and his career never recovered. Mr. Rock and Roll died a broken man a few years later. He is chiefly remembered now for having the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame being built in the city of his original home station Cleveland Ohio. Long Live Rock and Roll!!".

Granted the trite ragstoriches central story ain't much ditto the nondescript direction drab static cinematography flat TV movieish production values and very basic editing. However one doesn't evaluate this type of golden age of rock feature on either its technical finesse or narrative expertise it's simply how smokin' the music is that's the chief concern.

Harvey pleasantly croons the catchy charming Don't Be Afraid of Love. The Cadillacs goof it up something silly on the funny Coastersstyle novelty numbers Jay Walker and Please Mr. Johnson. Rockabilly giant Eddie Cochran does a killer rendition of the stupendously boss You Better Know It. Richie Valens moans outrageously through the socking Ooh My Head. Lead actorsinger Jimmy Clanton an affably boyish Louisianaborn lad with a strong bluesy rasp of a voice commendably holds his own amid this fantastic wealth of remarkable musical talent the snazzy Ship On a Stormy Sea the dreamy Don't You Know the lovely Angel Face and the pretty swoony ballad Once Again are all firstrate tunes. And the flick's disarmingly effervescent evocation of the nifty 50's rock milieu definitely hits the sweetly nostalgic spot the kids are decent and cleancut the adults tolerant and understanding the songs all possess cheery upbeat messages there's nary a trace of irony or cynicism to be found throughout and even notoriously jerky skinflint Chuck Berry almost succeeds in coming across like a nice guy !.".

On that cold and dark evening the love sick kook slammed a brick into the storefront window of a jewelry store and just stood there like he forgot what he was supposed to be doing robbing a 45.00 gold heart pin for his girlfriend and waited like a brainless moron for the cops to come and arrest him.We go into a long flashback as Freed after Johnny finishes his act reminds Johnny how fate is really strange and how if it wasn't for him going out of his way to save Johnny's sorry a he would have ended up a hardened criminal instead of the new American Idol. A singer that wild and hysterical teenage girls as well as women in their twenties and thirties and even forties by the tens of thousands would like to go out on a date with and even more fantastic pick up the tab.Being orphaned he was left at the steps of the orphanage at an early age Johnny was into music but the music Rock  Roll he was into wasn't exactly what the head Mr. Martin of the church quire that Johnny was trying out for cared for. Hurt and humiliated at being kicked off the quire Johnny ran away from home or the orphanage determined to strike out for himself as a Rock  Roll singer. With no job he was fired as an usher in a theater or money he didn't even have enough cash to make a demo recording to sent the Rock  Roll promoter Alan Freed to hear his great and untapped talents.Freed interested in Johnny's singing ability is more then willing to give him a chance but has other things on his mind like the big Rock  Roll show he has planned at the Brooklyn Paramount. That causes Johnny to feel that he was given the cold shoulder and brush off by the legendary Rock  Roll promoter and acts accordingly like the big jerk that he is. Sulking in his beer and not wanting to have anything to do with improving himself Johnny doesn't take the time to notice that people Alan Freed included have their own problems and commitment to attend to and take care of like he should do for his own.Freed does with the encouraging of his top honcho Bill and assistant as well as member of his troupe Rock  Roll singer Chuck Berry play Johnnys he somehow got the cash to make one demo record My Love is Strong on his radio show. After he heard it Freed was so impressed by it that he decided to get whoever this Johnny is to hear it on the radio and call in to identify himself. This so he can give him the opportunity to strut his stuff on the stage in front of a live and cheering crowd of Rock  Roll music fans.Johnny as you would expect seems to be the only person in NYC to not listen to the show as he's in the car with his girlfriend Sandy and turns off the radio broadcasting The Alan Freed Rock  Roll Radio Show. Johnny is still ticked off at Freed for not letting him do his thing which Freed was just about to do in showing what a Rock  Roll sensation he's capable of being. Feeling like a sack of horse manure in not being able to get Sandy the Christmas present that he promised her the golden heart pin Johnny plans to rob the jewelry store where the pin is on the display in the window. In the end Johnny gets his butt saved from being thrown into prison by Alan Freed and Sandy who got to the scene the jewelry store before the cops did. That saved the bumbling klutz from blowing the big chance becoming a Rock  Roll teenage Idol that he always dreamed off but was just too dimwitted to see it even when it was right in front of him!".

In 1988 he put a belated end to Dirty Harry in the Dead Pool in 1990 he had a PG13 bondage scene with Sonia Braga in The Rookie and in between there was this streetwise chase caper that was to our loss his only work with Bernadette. Bounty hunter Tommy euphemistically a skip tracer since he's chasing a girl captures bail jumper Lou Ann in Las Vegas and becomes caught up in the chase for a cash stash hidden in her pink '59 Caddy convertible by her drugaddict husband  his white supremacist counterfeiting friends. Clint is at his most likable in these averageJoe toughguy roles men who survive only by their wits in seedy jobs bounty hunter bank robber detective street boxer  take their lumps when they fall for lost causes or damsels in distress. Peters is fantastic in a humdrum role going from sullen to sassy to sexy to sensitive without letting us down for an instant. The film is pure fun for its first two thirds featuring little besides the two stars Clint mimicking Bernadette's unique soprano is not to be missed. Geoffrey Lewis an essential in all Eastwood movies like this is entertaining as ever this time as an addled hippie forger. The story follows the formula of several movies of this period the best of which was Midnight Run Copbounty hunter finds initial quarry who's a patsy holding the key to bringing down a really nasty criminalterrorist outfit. Unfortunately the bad guys are too psychonasty for the lighthearted script which also features Lou Ann's baby as a hostage. The preSopranos mob bad guys of Midnight Run brought just the right amount of humor to distill their menace but if you can find anything funny about neoNazi redneck drug addict survivalist militiamen who kidnap babies please seek therapy. Clint actually gives it a shot near the end so never let it be said he's not up for a dramatic challenge. Pink Cadillac isn't worthy as the only vehicle for the Broadway star and the greatest tough guy of his day but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours at sea. Compliments to Speed Channel's Lost Drivein for bringing this  other forgotten car movies back to the small screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew the leading actor was in this film because I had heard the title quite a few times I didn't realise it was meant to be a funny as well as serious and I had to see why it wasn't highly rated. Basically Tommy Nowak Clint Eastwood is a skip tracer with a talent as master of disguise who fool a criminal on the phone or in person into thinking well of him and then he makes his move to catch them for whatever crime they are wanted for. His latest target is Lou Ann McGuinn The Jerk's Bernadette Peters who has skipped bail and she married to husband Roy Timothy Carhart who is Nazi inspired and has a stash of counterfeit money which he hides in the pink Cadillac. Tommy does catch Lou Ann in Reno Nevada but he comes to like her with the time they spend being chased by Roy's gang of thugs for example. It is when the bad guys kidnap her baby who was being looked after by sister Dinah Frances Fisher Tommy decides to help his new friend get her baby back and deciding to forget about her in to the police. While driving through the West and catching a few more criminals with the disguise tactic along the way romance is blooming between Tommy and Lou Ann. Eventually after some adventure they do eventually catch up to Roy and the other criminals and in the end they do manage to get the baby back and Tommy and Lou Ann drive away in the pink Cadillac together seemingly as fugitives. Also starring John Dennis Johnston as Waycross Michael Des Barres as Alex Geoffrey Lewis as Ricky Z William Hickey as Mr. Barton Home Alone's Gerry Bamman as Buddy James Cromwell as Motel Desk Clerk Bryan Adams as Gas Station Attendant and young Jim Carrey as Lounge Entertainer. I will admit I did giggle a little at the moments where Eastwood was in disguise as the radio DJ the rodeo clown the casino hotshot and the trash pool player Peters was also quite amusing as his female companion and the car of the title is obviously nice but the film is too long the more serious side of the story is silly and not all the jokes are funny so all in all a disappointing comedy drama. Adequate!".

A Pink Cadillac that runs on Valium is no fun ride me thinks. Still I hung on in there and am not disappointed that I did.Eastwood's attempt at playing characters was vaguely cringeworthy. Let's face it his best role is playing Clint Eastwood. Even so he still has enough charm to get away with trying. Bernadette Peters adds subtlety humor and integrity to her role. The film is well made. It hangs together. It was just never worth a special trip to the cinema. But fine on DVD or video with wine and a pizza.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pink Cadillac is directed by Buddy Van Horn written by John Eskow and stars Clint Eastwood Bernadette Peters  Timothy Carhart. Story sees Peters as Lou Ann McGuinn  who finally has enough of her no good husband Roy Carhart and flees off with their baby in his treasured pink Cadillac. Unbeknown to her the car contains a lot of money garnered from illegal means by the white supremacist group that Roy was hanging around with. Bounty hunter Tommy Novak Eastwood is then brought in to capture her since she has skipped bail. Once locating her an unusual friendship begins to form as both of them get deeper and deeper into trouble as the gang close in.Pink Cadillac was a flop on release and now it's almost forgotten by not only the casual film fan but also by many of Eastwood's loyal fan club. Yet it's hardly the disaster some have painted it out to be. Yes the plot is a thin one and has been done brilliantly before notably Midnight Run a year previously. While there's not enough action and comedy to sustain the 2 hour running time. It's also not unfair to say that the villains herean array of dunderhead white supremacistsare weak and in the case of Carhart  badly acted. But Pink Cadillac does have its moments and in Eastwood  Peters we have a most engaging unpredictable odd couple act that is easy to warm too. Peters turns in a fine comedy performance both psychically and verbally. Her ability to blend cute and needy with spunky feistiness works well off of Eastwood's more rugged charms. It seems that finally having a costar of some worth is loosening the big man up for here he enjoys playing comedy with his series of caricature disguises that he uses to catch the bail jumpers that form part of the story.Perhaps it's a little unsettling to some fans to see Eastwood not being overtly macho but this does make for a nice change of pace for Eastwood. A return to his days with the Orangutan which incidentally up to Pink Cadillac's release were his biggest hit movies. But breaking it down it's a neat character that Eastwood has taken on with Tommy Novak. Almost antimacho yet able to single handedly protect Lou Ann and her baby. You feel that this was a personal and deliberate choice for Eastwwood in a decade that for him mostly consists of diminishing sequels and poorly scripted misfires. Pink Cadillac has been lumped in with the worst of his career but viewing it now it holds up much better than nearly all of his 80s output. File it along side Bronco Billy as one of his most underrated performances.Not breaking any rules of the genre or showing technical prowess and sharp scripting Pink Cadillac is still the kind of inoffensive fun that knows its limits. Boosted by a relaxed Eastwood and a perky Miss Peters it's just waiting to be reappraised by a new audience. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't care for this movie when it first came out but now it plays much better than most late 80's action flicks. There is great chemistry between Eastwood and Bernadette Peters. Eastwood has been canny about who he teams up with. Pink Cadillac is in the mold of Two Mules For Sister Sara The Enforcer and The Gauntlet in which Eastwood's macho character gets saddled with a female partner and has to make the best of it. In fact this plot device is used in Million Dollar Baby.Pink Cadillac is simply good oldfashioned Hollywood filmmaking no fancy cinematography or special effects just a simple but welltold story with two characters that we like and care about. Eastwood is gracious in allowing his female characters to live and breathe and have unexpected reservoirs of strength and resilience. This is evident in movies like Tightrope with Genevieve Bujold and The Enforcer with Tyne Daly.As for Eastwood he makes it look effortless but he is an underrated actor. Pink Cadillac gives him the opportunity to do some odd character acting bits as he adopts eccentric accents and disguises in his job as a skip tracer. One gets the feeling Eastwood is enjoying himself immensely and it is a joy to see him doing offthewall stuff although it is also cool to see Eastwood being Eastwood during the action sequences.Pink Cadillac also shares with other Eastwood films like Bronco Billy Thunderbolt and Lightfoot A Perfect World and Honkytonk Man an affinity with American people living on the margins. While most filmmakers such as the smug Coen Brothers treat rural American characters with contempt Eastwood views all people with a measure of respect and affection except for the white supremacists.There is also a great sense of place in this film as it captures off the beaten path locations in Northern California that are seldom used in film. Director Buddy Van Horn provides efficient craftsmanship that doesn't call attention to itself but his eye always alert to the telling details of character and setting.In all an unexpected pleasure and an underrated road film.".

Actually this must be one of Clints least known films its very rarely shown on TV here in Great Britain in fact I think it went straight to video a Clint Eastwood film straight to video! It must be really bad yeah? well no not really but not exactly great either. Its a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours and does show Clint doing different things. He takes on different personas in his Bounty hunter role to catch the crooks including a DJ and a redneck which I thought was hilarious really funny. Bernadette Peters was really good in this I thought as well bright and quirky. What really let it down was the gang of Nazi redneck bikers or whatever they were meant to be they bordered on comedy villains in fact I kept waiting for Clyde the Orangatun to wander on screen and punch them out and drink all their beer!

Smug coy and far too dependent on his tired toughguy persona he's just going through the motions in this senseless and silly turkey burger.We've seen Clint coast on charm before and this type of film might have worked in 1979 but by the time the movie was made in 1989 it was sloppy and insubstantial and it can't be saved even by Clint's frequent winks to the audience that imply there's a funny teddy bear beneath his badass characters. Awww.... vomit.The plot throws everything into the mix counterfeit money crystalmeth amphetamines the titular vehicle kidnapped babies grenades Vegas and a militia training complex. It still doesn't make any sense. Permababy Bernadette BoobyDupe Peters shows up to coo and gurgle while managing to conceal her prizewinning bazongas the entire time. Boo!Clint definitely thinks he's funny here impersonating a fasttalking radio DJ and pretending to be a dirtstupid redneck in order to infiltrate a criminal gang. Our standard for Clint humor is usually set pretty low if only because he's so stiff and dry that ANY comedy seems hilarious but his routine here is corny and embarrassing. He comes off like your Uncle who believes he's funny enough for Saturday Night Live but in an ironic twist is nowhere near funny enough for Saturday Night Live.The movie also features an awful cameo by Geoffrey Holder as an aging hippie who can't stop saying whoa man and oh coooool! This painful anachronistic performance only twenty years out of date is further evidence of the arrogance that went into the film. When the bad guys burn Idiot Hippie's house down he responds by saying major bummer. Are you laughing yet?I'm gonna go ahead and assume that the makers of this film came up with the title first and wrote the screenplay around it. Oh... just a hunch. I love Clint Eastwood I truly do and his Dirty Harry films and westerns are some of the most enjoyable action films ever made but Pink Cadillac is a sloppy contrived ride which goes nowhere fast.

Actually this must be one of Clints least known films its very rarely shown on TV here in Great Britain in fact I think it went straight to video a Clint Eastwood film straight to video! It must be really bad yeah? well no not really but not exactly great either. Its a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours and does show Clint doing different things. He takes on different persona's in his Bounty hunter role to catch the crooks including a DJ and a redneck which I thought was hilarious really funny. Bernadette Peters was really good in this I thought as well bright and quirky. What really let it down was the gang of Nazi redneck bikers or whatever they were meant to be they bordered on comedy villains in fact I kept waiting for Clyde the Orangatun to wander on screen and punch them out and drink all their beer! So one for Clint fans only I'm afraid like me! P.S See if you can spot Jim Carrey AND Canadian rocker Bryan Adams in the film.".

Eastwood's joyfully loose performance has to be one of his better ones though not the movie which he generates warmth wit and truly gives out zesty attitude that shows he loving every minute of it.

This is a person who works for a bail bondsman in order to track down folks who ran away to avoid prosecution...thus leaving the bondsman with a huge debt. He's really good at what he does and is very clever in order to catch these people...which is why what he does with Lu Ann McGuinn Bernadette Peters makes very little sense. In her case for once her tears and request for his help after she's captured makes little senseespecially since she is on the run from the law AND already lied to him and escaped from him already. However the pair go off on an adventure to see her baby before she is turned in...and along the way the sleazebag husband and his NeoNazi friends show up and Nowak must contend with them.There are two huge problems with the film. First Nowak's character is very inconsistent and makes little sense. Second and most importantly there really is no chemistry between him and Lou Ann. These are problems and good writing wouldn't have let such glaring problems get into the script.

	schema:reviewBody "Pink Cadillac is one of those films which seem to owe their existence to a scriptwriter or studio executive noticing a catchy song title thinking it too good to waste on a mere song and concocting a film script to fit it. See also Pretty Woman Sweet Home Alabama Addicted to Love Jumping Jack Flash and others. At least the film does actually feature a pink Cadillac.The film also served another purpose that of finding another role for Clint Eastwood who had recently made his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie The Dead Pool. Having tried tough cowboy and tough cop with occasional forays into tough soldier and tough trucker Clint decided to try tough bounty hunter. His character here is Tommy Nowak a skiptracer that is to say a bounty hunter who specialises in tracking down people who skip bail. The name Nowak is pronounced either in the authentic Polish way as Novak or as the anglicised Noack depending on who is speaking. His latest target is a young woman named Lou Ann McGuinn who has run off in her husband Roy's pink Cadillac. This was however an unwise choice of getaway vehicle because Roy is a member of a violent white supremacist movement and the car contained a large quantity of counterfeit money belonging to the group. Now Lou Ann is being chased not only by Tommy but also by a scary gang of NeoNazi fanatics. Let's just hope he gets there first.Although Eastwood was nearly sixty when he made the film he could not resist the chance of an on screen romance with an attractive younger woman in this case Bernadette Peters so when Tommy finally does find Lou Ann it is inevitable that they will fall in love and join forces to fight the evil white supremacists.The film was not generally popular with the critics. The New York Times called it the laziest sort of action comedy and predicted that it will probably settle comfortably near the bottom of the list of Eastwood's movies. There is probably some justice in that criticism. The plot could have been taken straight from the Lazy Screenwriter's Guide to writing bynumbers and the film will never rank alongside the likes of the first Dirty Harry or Pale Rider or Unforgiven or Gran Torino in the pantheon of Eastwood's work. I have always found Eastwood more effective in serious drama than in comedy and Pink Cadillac is essentially an actioncomedy rather than an actionadventure.That said however it is not altogether bad. Eastwood and Peters make a likable couple despite the age difference and although the bad guys are predictable and stereotyped that is probably inevitable in the context of an actioncomedy a genre which operates under different laws from those which govern serious action dramas. Pink Cadillac may be lazy but it is also fairly amiable. 510".

	onyx:emotionText "Pink Cadillac is one of those films which seem to owe their existence to a scriptwriter or studio executive noticing a catchy song title thinking it too good to waste on a mere song and concocting a film script to fit it. See also Pretty Woman Sweet Home Alabama Addicted to Love Jumping Jack Flash and others. At least the film does actually feature a pink Cadillac.The film also served another purpose that of finding another role for Clint Eastwood who had recently made his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie The Dead Pool. Having tried tough cowboy and tough cop with occasional forays into tough soldier and tough trucker Clint decided to try tough bounty hunter. His character here is Tommy Nowak a skiptracer that is to say a bounty hunter who specialises in tracking down people who skip bail. The name Nowak is pronounced either in the authentic Polish way as Novak or as the anglicised Noack depending on who is speaking. His latest target is a young woman named Lou Ann McGuinn who has run off in her husband Roy's pink Cadillac. This was however an unwise choice of getaway vehicle because Roy is a member of a violent white supremacist movement and the car contained a large quantity of counterfeit money belonging to the group. Now Lou Ann is being chased not only by Tommy but also by a scary gang of NeoNazi fanatics.

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing my plan to watch every Clint Eastwood movie in order I come to the comedy Pink Cadillac 1989Plot In A Paragraph Skip tracer Tommy Nowak Eastwood is tracking Lou Ann McGuinn Bernadette Peters for a bail bondsman in California. Lou Ann is also being chased by her husband Roy McGuinn and his white supremacist friends a gang called the The Birthright. The last comedy Clint Eastwood would ever make. The movie was an attempt at returning Clint Eastwood to the actioncomedy genre which gave him the highest grossing movies of his career in Every Which Way But Loose and Any Which Way You Can the latter had the same director as this movie and the last Dirty Harry but sadly it's neither funny charming or even watchable.The most interesting things I found watching this movie for the first time since it's release was Jim Carrey turns up here his second Eastwood movie in a row billed as James Carrey as an Elvis impersonater. Regular Eastwood co stars Bill McKinney and Geoffrey Lewis pop up here in their last Eastwood movies too whilst Frances Fisher makes her first appearance in an Eastwood movie. Clint who has saved worse movie plots than this seriously has his work cut out here. He tried hard but it just doesn't work. Part of the problem is it's trying too hard to recapture the magic of the Philo Beddo movies trailer parks rowdy bars motels and even another car wash even the members of The Birthright can be compared to the bikers from those movies. Another is racism and a baby being kidnapped are not very suitable topics for the gentle charming comedy this is aiming to be. Played straight it may have turned out different but as it is this is a tough one to say good things about. The 1980's ended with a whimper rather than a bang as Pink Cadillac was the second Clint movie to under perform as it only grossed 12 million at the domestic box office to end 1989 as 74th highest grossing movie of the year. Making it Clint's worst performing movie since Joe Kidd seventeen years earlier. It actually didn't even get a cinema release in the UK making it the first Clint movie to go straight to home video since he became an A list star.".

It also has some funny lines and wittiness. And of course Eastwood with his intensity as well as his piano playing is in true form as usual. The costumes are great. The sets are delightful and the cars dazzling. The treat in the movie is Jane Alexander as Reynold's long suffering brilliant secretary. Worth watching just for the pleasure of her company.The plot is a good one and the story believable just poorly executed despite good performances. There's not a whole lot of saving graces other that what has already been mentioned but at least you can see some different although hollow acting performances by Madeline Kahn Rip Torn Richard Roundtree Jane Alexander and Irene Cara. Clint didn't direct this film but his production company produced it and Buddy Van Horn directed it. Van Horn is Clint's stunt coordinator and Clint surrogate and has directed several Clint films most notably The Dead Pool. Maybe that's the idea of this film but it didn't succeed in delivering the camp factors. The whole film felt like a middling effort but at least it had the grace of showing a young Jim Carrey doing standup which showed how little he changed over the years.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

I found it rather humorous and I liked how it played out. I enjoy films of this nature just as I enjoyed Midnight Run. This one has a bunch in common with that film it also reminds me a bit of a film called Dead Bang with Don Johnson as the bad guys at the end were very similar. This one though is a bit of a road trip movie on a smaller scale than Midnight Run however it works in its own simple way. Mainly because Clint Eastwood is in it and he adds something to this movie to be sure. The film features Peters as a woman who is married to a guy who has been hanging with the wrong crowd. She ends up arrested jumps bail with her husband's pink Cadillac and her and her baby are on the run. Enter Clint who is the bounty hunter assigned to tracking her down. Things are not all that cut and dry though as something of interest is hidden within that car. Like I said for what it was I enjoyed it.

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1994 La Reine Margot' dispensed of every preconceived notion of traditional costume drama bringing a radical and shocking slant on history. The lavish sets and costumes remained but the atmosphere was now tainted with bloodshed poison lust and incest. The regal palaces that were so stereotypically populated by loyal subjects are transformed into a viper's nest of power politics schemes and deceit where royal heritage counts for little and deviousness is the key to success.The year is 1572 France is torn apart amidst the conflict between Catholics and Protestants whilst the King is a mere puppet first to his domineering Catholic mother Catherine de Medici played with superlative coldness by Virna Lisi and later to the protestant leader Coligny. In a half hearted effort to bring peace to the land Catherine marries off her daughter Margot Isabelle Adjani to the protestant Henri de Navarre Daniel Auteuil a political manoeuvre that deludes no one. Margot and Henri are certainly a less than content couple as they walk down the aisle they engage in a hissing match with one another where Margot succinctly informs him that Just because we're married it doesn't mean I have to sleep with you' and suggests he steer clear of her bedroom. They also fail to adhere to any form of decorum during the wedding reception whilst Henri brawls with the Catholics and flirts with a very youthful Asia Argento of xXx fame Margot goes window shopping amongst the male guests looking for a viable one night stand. When the wedding guests prove unsatisfactory she simply dons a mask and takes to the streets masquerading as a prostitute and continues her search amongst the hordes of Protestant soldiers who have gathered for her wedding eventually settling on the dour La Mole Vincent Perez. However any illusions of peace are shattered after a botched attempt to assassinate Coligny as the Catholics fearing a revolt slaughter 6000 Protestants in what becomes known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. The sheer horror of the massacre is reproduced with unflinching realism by director Patrick Chireau who manages not only to shock but also recreate an atmosphere of utter chaos exemplified by the moment when Margot is wandering amongst the palace corridors which have been besieged by soldiers and are strewn with corpses Margot is curtly told return to your room and lock the door'. Unfortunately some of the impact of the massacre is lost due to the fact that we know barely any of the characters who are being murdered and it begs credibility that the Protestants seemingly put up no resistance. One of the few survivors of the slaughter is La Mole who is saved by Margot when he breaks into her chamber looking for sanctuary which Margot freely gives to him and more. In the aftermath of the massacre Margot also manages to save Henri de Navarre forging a valuable alliance in the process. However suspicion has been aroused that she is a traitor and she finds that she is in a decidedly vulnerable position where her only hope of freedom is to flee to Navarre with Henri.Isabelle Adjani France's premier actress delivers one of her finest performances as the stubborn and promiscuous Margot who despite initially coming across as vain and conceited later earns our sympathy as she finds herself in an impossible situation where her position in the royal family is of little consequence her brothers love her in a perversely incestuous way and her mother sees her as an inconvenience and potential threat to her authority and the threat of assassination always looms around the corner. Whilst the political manoeuvrings and power struggles are intriguing the same cannot be said for the tepid romance between Adjani and Perez. The pair lacks any chemistry even their scenes of erotic passion come across as frigid and awkward. They make an attractive couple but not a particularly convincing one.La Reine Margot is also one of the most visually sumptuous films ever released the big budget clearly didn't go to waste in recreating the gothic decadence of the period and the costumes were deservingly nominated for an Oscar. It's easy to view La Reine Margot' as a precursor to the acclaimed 1998 film Elizabeth' as both centre around a female historical figure who has to endure the conflict between Catholics and Protestants whilst surviving assassination attempts usually via poison and overcome tragedy as those who they care for are systematically murdered. Indeed if nothing else La Reine Margot' provides a chilling insight into one of history's most horrific atrocities and offers an unsettling portrait of the moral bankruptcy that pervaded throughout 16th century society.My Score 8 out of 10".

Naturally the highlight of the movie is the reenactment of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre.  The horrendous scenes of the murders in all their crudity are terrific. The actors did a wonderful job here.  Isabelle Adjani is as usual terrific. Her nude scenes depicting the queen's adultery lust and incestuous affairs are acted in such a way that they are a form of art. Vincent Perez is in one of his best roles  his interpretation of La Mle is second only to his acting in Indochine.   The great Virna Lisi is simply marvellous posing as Cathrine de Mdicis  no wonder she won the Best Actress Award at Cannes. She is the ambitious woman par excellence stopping at nothing to get where she wants not even if she has to see her sons being killed one by one and sell her daughter in a convenient marriage to unite the Catholics and the Protestants.  The others especially Asia Argento impersonating the tragic countess Charlotte de Sauve  did a good job too.  A very well deserved Prix du Jury.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everything about this picture is beautiful even the ugliness is beautiful...an oxymoron but the only way I can describe it. This is a stunning tale of 16th century sex and violence with a dirty realism but still an overlay of beauty.Isabelle Adjani is intense beautiful and sensuous as Margot the highly sexed intelligent and dutiful sister of the doomed King Charles IX of France. She is forced into a marriage of political and religious convenience by her bitterly ambitious mother Catherine de Medici Virna Lisi to the repulsive Henri Navarre sympathetically played by Daniel Auteuil. There is a tremendous amount going on and Margot's incest with her brothers is more than hinted at.The searingly sensual Vincent Perez plays La Mole who eventually becomes Margot's doomed lover. Their first encounter is an acrobatic feat of anonymous sex in an alleyway that is breathtaking. Their later love scenes are intensely erotic. This film only becomes better on repeat viewings. I found I was able to grasp more on my second viewing. There is so much going on so many twists and turns and shocks and the film is also quite long. It never lags and even Margot's grudging tolerance if not love for her husband is believingly portrayed. Very highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the American people that have seen this excellent French movie I will say just one thing in many countries around the world we get to see movies from abroad with subtitles. Most of the movies that we see in South American countries come either from North America or Europe and we don't usually complain about the subtitles. Only kids movies are dubbed in Spanish. A great part of the romance or charm about French movies comes from the fact that they are actually spoken in French. Nobody in these films expects the rest of the world to understand as they speak but to make a little effort and appreciate the beauty in each language is something I think is missing in American culture. I've seen nothing but comments on how difficult it was for some members of the American public to understand this film. I only ask myself in times of globalization isn't it interesting to learn from people from other parts of the world in their own language specially a French film based on a French novel by the French Alexandre Dumas placed in the 16th century directed by one of France's best directors and acted by some of the most wonderful French actors and actresses of the last decades? Would you want to see this film in English? Sorry but I think you would be missing a great deal of the depth and emotion of this unique film!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "French dynastic history in the late 16th century does not seem a promising subject for a film but Patrice Chereau a prominent French stage director has teased out some personal drama out of the larger historical picture and provided a vivid and absorbing tale. The story itself is adapted from Alexandre Dumas' novel which is a pretty highly colored piece to begin with. Chereau theatrically plasters the set with blood and gore and we are left in no doubt that an atrocity has occurred the St Bartholomew's day massacre of the Hugenots. The mendacious Queen Mother Catherine di Medici and her weakminded son Charles IX seem to have set it off to deal with the protestant problem without realizing how bad it might get.In all this horror is the rather cute tale of the relationship between two disparate personalities thrown together in marriage Catherine's daughter Margo and Henry of Navarre later Henry IV of France and one of its better kings. Margo is repulsed at first sight by Henry the peasant' while Henry rightly regards her as about as loving as a trapped tiger. Yet they reach an accommodation and finish up friends. Both have other lovers and both respect that but neither can prevent the lovers from coming to sticky ends.It's always a bit hard to assess the acting when you are relying on subtitles if only the French didn't speak so fast but Isabella Adjani at the age of 40 pulled off a remarkable job and had me convinced she really was a spoilt willful little nymphomaniac in her early 20's. She looked as young as she did in the Story of Adele H' 20 years earlier. Daniel Auteuil was also excellent as the unprepossessing but very intense and quickthinking Henry. Virna Lisi a sex symbol in her earlier film career made a good villainess as Catherine. Most of the other principals seem to have been chosen for their looks by rentanego casting though JeanHuges Anglade was suitably pathetic as the doomed King Charles.The rather claustrophobic sets brought home the medieval lack of privacy even perhaps especially in royal palaces  the old Louvre was about as spacious as the loo. The film fades a bit in the second half but it's still not a bad story if at times a bit difficult to follow.  I have to say I found Elizabeth' more interesting and a lot less bloody. Anyway Margo' is very French and not to be judged by Hollywood standards whatever they are.".

This film portrays the complicated machinations performed by Catherine de Medici and her cohorts in furthering her Catholic ambitions for her country and debauched family against the perceived threat of dour Protestantism and centred around the St. Bartholomew Day Massacre.It's the rather beautiful Isabelle Adjani's stunning performance as Queen Margot that can leave you as breathless as she often is in the film without her it would have been a much poorer film. She seemed to live the part with every emotion imaginable on display. Would French breathlessness or those huge rustling dresses sound as good dubbed into English?! On the other hand the rest of the cast are superb in their roles too but especially Daniel Auteuil as Henri de Navarre and Jean Hugues Anglade as Charles IX making them both extremely believable sympathetic characters when they weren't. The bloodbath and the anarchy of the Massacre and aftermath is vividly presented  we are not spared a single thing in the entire film all manner of violence and depravity is nongratuitously displayed. It's impossible to convey a part of what happens in this film  the same as it must have been impossible for the film to convey a fraction of what happened in that era too it really is a mustsee. I've seen it a number of times now since 1994 and I find something new I hadn't spotted before every time. It's a film that can make you realise if you didn't before that millions of ordinary folk all around the world could and still can believe in such arrant religious nonsense to the point of committing multiple ghastly murders in the name of empty air.Apart from all that it's a beautifully crafted film the best of its kind there's ever been.".

Dumas must be dancing in his grave ! When I see IMDb critics saying that this is a great artistic movie I wonder if people saw the same movie I did...Topmost I find it inadmissible that Chereau permits himself to rewrite such a masterpiece written by one of France's most beloved writers as if what Dumas wrote wasn't good enough to make a decent movie. It is a common flaw in movie making to change the story pretexting that the original material isn't suited for screen play.A few examples  the St Barthelemy night which we have to endure for a long 15 or more minutes in the movie merely takes one page on the 600 of the book...As for the friendship between La Mole and Coconnas  who are amongst the most interesting characters of the book  which is at the center of the original material it is largely omitted in the movie and furthermore is totally incoherent  after fighting to the death and being quite unknown to each other the fall in each other's arms in one ridiculous scene that had me laugh because it was so bad.Anyways all this is bad french cinema making the kind which we would like to stop seeing. Do not bother to waste your time on that piece of trash and rather watch real french cinema d'auteur like Coup de Torchon or Rene Clair's movies which are the real heritage of french movie making that knew about the art but are from another age which is sadly over.Pityful !

	schema:headline " Gorgeous and smoking Adjani in a sumptuous historical drama  but an invented heroine.";
	schema:reviewBody "I love well done historical fiction and films. This one is excellently done in it's acting sumptuous sets costumes lively pace and adventure and occasional high violence. It's also sensually smoking with the gorgeous and intensely passionate and feminine Adjani holding nothing back. She even manages at twice the age to look almost young enough to play 19 year old Margot at her wedding.It's a fairly easy film to enjoy if you don't worry too much about the plot turns and detailed historical machinations and even more rewarding to watch several times or more seriously especially if you do some background reading at Wikipedia or elsewhere.Its historical accuracy is however a decidedly mixed picture. The sense of 16th century French court life the major historical events including the massacre and almost all the major figures are quite accurately portrayed. Even such figures as the Protestant Admiral Coligny and Guise Margot's principal lover at the time of her arranged marriage are accurately portrayed. De la Mole seems to be either wholly or largely invented but it's common for more wholly personal charters to be in historical fiction and that's generally fine with me. So too is it here except in essence it portrays him as the love of her life  whereas she doesn't seem to really have had one.The film though seeks not merely to view Queen Margot and her voluminous affairs sympathetically but to entirely lionize her for invented reasons. Given that she's the principal character in the film and not a trivial historical figure that's not unimportant. While not hiding the fact that she never loved her husband and had many lovers it did soft peddle her pronounced and highly indiscrete promiscuity and largely invented both her sisterly loyalty to her husband and tolerant and humanitarian heroic acts on behalf of him and the Protestant Huguenots more generally.Following Dumas it seeks to portray her as a woman who loyally and enduringly loved a man through thick and thin just not the man she was forced to marry but instead the minor Huguenot la Mole. In fact Margot's relationships seemed to have been if often passionate also often simultaneous overlapping in quick succession and not especially marked by enduring loyalty. If the contemporary portraits at Wikipedia can be believed she while attractive was also not the transcendent beauty that is Adjani though I hardly complain that Adjani was chosen. I'm not condemning Margot's sexual voraciousness but I am saying that the whitewashed false and sanitized view of it here is rather in the nature of propaganda or myth. At one point for example la Mole says she's been fated to have lovers who die off on her which seems to have had little basis.It was not unaccepted at the time for queens or female aristocrats in passionless arranged marriages to have lovers but they were generally supposed to do so discretely in a way that did not bring ridicule or dishonor to their husband if honorable. Husbands too though admittedly more universally tolerated in having affairs were supposed to honor their wives. Both were also expected to try for some sort of marital love or at least a kind of intimate respect and to attempt to produce legitimate heirs. Queen Margot seems to have never done any of this or certainly not much. Most unreformed male libertines who accomplish little aren't so loved either.It's not clear she ever accomplished much including having any children not to mention any heir to the French throne  which she could have done unless as seems likely she was or became barren  STD's?.More important though is the way the film seeks to portray Margot as a heroine to the persecuted Huguenots not because she believed in their religious cause but because she was a firm believer in tolerance and humanitarianism or became both after witnessing the massacre. Both were true of her husband Henri who acted upon them especially after becoming the Good King Henri of France but I see little evidence they were of Margot. Instead I strongly suspect she was lionized by Alexandre Dumas and likely by earlier Huguenot tales traditions and perhaps lesser novels in aide of gallantry the Huguenot and liberal cause and their integration into French national affection. There was after all they said at least one good French royal at the time of the St. Bartholomew's massacre. This seems built largely on Queen Margot's being the one member of the French royal family who wasn't intent on persecuting the Huguenots since her interests were rather elsewhere than religion politics or idealism.As well her close personal sisterly relationship with her husband seems to be almost or entirely invented by Dumas in service of our sympathy for her. Instead Henri several times provided sanctuary to her when she had nowhere else to go despite their at best strained and tempestuous and thereafter icy relationship. Henri did not in fact seek to bring Margot to Navarre with him when he fled Paris nor did she want to go with or without her lovers. Instead several years later she partly fled there from her brother King Henry III of France who takes power as the film ends and was partly banished due to her increasingly scandalous and heedless behavior. Again much later when she had long been divorced from Henri and grown old isolated and nearly penniless in an act which speaks much more about Henri's character than their relationship Henri brought her back to the French court where she eventually had some role in helping care for his children by his second wife. I've also seen no evidence she helped Henri escape to Navarre or before that convinced him to convert to Catholicism to save his life.I can see much reason to understand and have some sympathy for Queen Margot but little reason to view her as a heroine.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not flawless filmmaking but it IS flawless cinema. One won't bother recounting the story or the plotline a viewer can gather that from history OR previous reviews OR even a casual overview of Dumas novels. One would like to speak to the filmmaking here and along the way on the movie.If one is at all interested in French history one has already seen this movie a thousand times  meaning enough. However a digital dvd transfer of the movie as it was originally intended to be seen by M. Chreau without subtitles without interferencethe VO version originale is stunning. The first and foremost difference is the lighting  il te frappe as the French would say it strikes you. Not being a technician one can't speak to the difference between the film one saw on DVD and the film one saw in American theaters or on American DVD or even on VHS French andor American. The difference is striking. From the opening scenes one is suddenly almost frightfully drawn into the 16th century an epoch without the cushions of modern life. The light is everywhere and it shines in a way that is pitiless and revelatory. This was never unfortunately appparent to theater goers here and I suspect to cinema goers in France. If it had been there would have been Oscars. One is not sure cinema projection equipment can convey what M. Chreau did with this film. Where there is light there is liminality and where there are shadows even there there is light but it is dim thus not liminal and the cadaverous flesh of the living players conveys more than anyone could ever say in dialogue  these are dead people living out a drama that is already predestined for them which is a marvelously conceived conceit of the filmmaker. M. Chreau is playing with predestination and Fate here and it is through the art of cinema that he is doing it. Mlle Adjani turns in a bravura performance and it is only by grace of Jeanne Moreau's 1954 performance that we have any scale of comparison. Moreau's performance is cool ice and politics but Adjani's is heat love and politics and suited to her generation. Vincent Perez is suitably heroic watch the rose tones come and go on his flesh as the light changes. The kudos for male performances however are shared by JeanHugues Anglade long an underrated French actor and Daniel Auteuil too long appreciated for his bravura performances elsewhere and not given enough credit for what he can do with a gesture with a line with a look. M. Auteuil is almost always lit with cool hypocrisy ambers and greens as suits his performance but M. Anglade turns in one of the best roles of his career as the doomed Charles IX and he never looks less than on death's door. A naturally sensitive actor he adds a touch of soullessness to his Charles IX that is unforgettable  weak yes king yes momma's boy yes but also in the end needy child. It is stunning in its ultimate simplicity as a performance for cinema. Very few performances in film measure up to Virna Lisi's Catherine de Medicis the s is French spelling. She is incroyable incredible and something was wrong when she wasn't recognized universally as '94's best supporting actress. Her queen is multilayered loving hating deeply cynical yet naively superstitious playing son against son and daughter against political reality in other words a perfect incarnation of the 16th century in France. Any political woman you can think of could have sat at her feet and learned lessons on how to do it. Mme Lisi herself might have been a confidante to the real Catherine she is that good in this role. She was crowned for this performance in Europe but should have been crowned universally. Watch her as she vacillates between love and hate and politics and especially watch the lighting  it subtly changes according to her role of the moment. Watch her carefully towards the end as Fate winds things up and watch an actress give herself up totally to the role to the moment in order to incarnate a character that is absolutely unforgettable.Apparently M. Chreau lets his actors know what he is doing because they respond in according  shades of emotion. When the lighting is dim or the focus is midrange they fuzz a little giving the viewer a sense of their uncertainty but if he focuses they focus too and there are frightening moments of soulbaring intimacy when you almost want to look away  it is like watching your intimates make love too much too intimate too deep. Dominique Blanc turns in a nearly flawless performance as the overthetop ladyinwaiting to Margot  watch her lighting too and how she responds. Conspiratrice duchesse cynical woman in love despite herself she is very very good. Pascal Greggory as the future Henri III is wonderful and the rest of the cast stand out. This was obviously a labor of love and intensity and all gave their best to M. Chreau.In the end one keeps wondering what it is about the film that was so memorable  and the french dvd transfer makes it perfectly clear. The performances yes the mise en scne yes the director certainly. But it is the whole the light and the shadows the darkness and the glow as in those candles in the marvelous square paper lanterns in the late night of the Louvre as the people begin to weave their plots that make it memorable. Good actors great performances and a sure director  flawless cinema.".

The writers didn't even get the age she died at correct.  They said she died at 68... she died at 62!!! She lived from 15531615.  You do the math.  If the film had any other title and didn't claim to be about Margot it would be an incredible film!  The imagery was beautiful and the costumes while at times were inaccurate as well were fabulous.  The wedding was very well done even though the real colors used were blue and gold.  I liked however that they used the color red as the main theme since the focus was on the St. Bartholomew day Massacre.  That scene was a bit long and the gore was at times unnecessary but it showed the horror that the Protestants underwent that night.  Isabelle Adjani and Virna Lisi were very good in their roles as was Vincent Perez.  One thing I found fascinating was that the gentleman who played Henry de Navarre looked exactly like the real Henry of Navarre as seen in paintings done during his life.  While I was disapointed that the French made a film out of the Alexandra Dumas novel since he was so wrong about everything if you're able to look past all the inaccuracies about her you can truly enjoy this film.".

It is close to hilarious to see the portrayal of Charles the ninth as a hypochondriacdrunk always under the control of external influences. External from himself. Himself representing France. An acute sense of this movie can be derived from a dialog lasting fifteen or so seconds and which I could not get out of my head and I kept telling myself throughout the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Since antiquity tragedy has been regarded as the highest and most important form of drama for its ability to arouse the deepest sense of pathos and empathy from its audience.Remind yourself of this if you choose to watch 'House of Sand and Fog.' I can state emphatically that 'House' is one of the most artfully directed and acted films of the last five years but make no mistake it is a tragedy and only the hardest and most jaded of hearts will emerge from the experience undisturbed. It is a dissertation on sorrow and while I'm glad I saw it I can't say I had a whole lot of fun.'House' was directed by newcomer Vadim Perelman who also adapted the screenplay from the acclaimed novel by Andre Dubus III. Perelman tweaks the story in some respects but is ultimately faithful to the novel's style and sensibility. As in the novel the story is filtered through alternating perspectives the foremost of which are Behrani Ben Kingsley a Persian expat and a former highranking officer under the Shah in Iran and Kathy Lazaro Jennifer Connelly a severely depressed recovering alcoholic tenuously holding onto sobriety but nevertheless gradually selfdestructing after the collapse of her marriage.The two characters are drawn together appropriately enough by the house of the title a small but elegant coastal property in fictional Pacific County California the novel sets the house in Malibu. The house belongs to Kathy who inherited it along with her older brother who lives elsewhere from her deceased father. Kathy has become a victim of a bureaucratic snafushe has been erroneously charged with delinquency on taxes for a nonexistent businessbut due to her textbook depressive refusal to open and answer her mail she wakes up one morning to find that the county has evicted her and put her property up for auction.Enter Colonel Behrani a regal man of aristocratic bearing whose ruthless determination to maintain the standard of living his family has always been accustomed to is simultaneously honorable and pathetic. Behrani is the story's tragic hero in the classical sense. Behrani has been saving and shrewdly watching the classified ads waiting for a chance to snap up a foreclosure at a cut rate price make modest renovations and then resell the property at peak market value in order to acquire a sixfigure nestegg to fund his son's education and improve his family's future prospects in the US. Fortuitously the house he buys at auctionKathy's houseis a coastal property bearing some resemblance to his former home on the Caspian Sea back before his family fled Iran. The house is seen in an early flashback an eerie montage wherein a younger Behrani in fulldress service uniform observes as a row of enormous trees are severed at the trunk so that the sea will be visible from the balcony where he stands.To elaborate the plot further would be too revealing so I'll simply say that the lead performances in this film are sublime. I didn't think at first that I'd be able to believe the stunningly beautiful Jennifer Connelly as Kathy a woman who redefines the term 'selfdestructive' and yet Connelly manages once again as she did in 'A Beautiful Mind' to prove that her talent and skill match or even exceed the looks. It really goes without saying that Ben Kingsley's Behrani is a stunning performanceKingsley is a mesmerizingly charismatic screen presence and a chameleonic character actor few actors in the history of film have been able to so convincingly disappear into their characters while projecting such a distinctive distinguished persona. Both actors master these demanding roles such that the audience feels a broad scope of contradictory and ambiguous emotions towards their characters neither is completely sympathetic nor despicable and though in the Aristotelian sense Behrani is the story's tragic hero it's resolution remains ambiguous as does the ultimate responsibility for the tragic denouement.The direction of the film has its occasional hitches but many of Vadim Perelman's shots are brilliantly captivating. The Northern California coastline is exploited to maximum effect and Perelman offers numerous shots and angles of seamless appealthey are original and engaging without feeling forced or consciously 'filmschoolish.' It's quite a beautiful movie to look at from the meticulous arrangement of the Behrani's luxurious furniture and decorations to the patience with which Perelman lets his actors' nuanced facial expressions and physical gestures unfold the depths of their characters.I have some slight reservation about recommending the film simply because its tragedy is so unmerciful. And there are moments where you may find yourself exasperated with the characters and unwilling to maintain your sympathy for them. Personally I think it's worth a look for the quality of the performances alone. It's also quite original and distinctive in style. It's devastatingly sad however and so should be reserved for appropriate moods.".

When Kathy loses her house due to county error Behrani buys it for the sake of money and selfpride. Their worlds clash when they realize there is no perfect solution to this mistake ending with a shockingly tragic twist. The acting put forth in this film was nothing less of amazing. Ben Kinglsey as always played his role as if he was really in it really showing us his point of view and displaying his need for the house. Jennifer Connely played her role beautifully as well showing the inward spiral she was facing and how her depression finally took her over. The story was nearly flawless with a few money and law errors. However the tragic themes of the film ring through nonetheless. With a little less than a superior performance from Ron Eldard the film still had wonderful acting and brilliant film technique. Based on the bestselling novel by Andre Dubus III director Vadim Perelman does an incredible job of staying true to the novel and using a few Russian film techniques to give a sense of emotion. This type of film truly will tug at your heart and bring tears yet will give a sense of appreciation for the human life.".

Set in a fogdrenched Southern California community Perelman sets two immoveable forces apart from each other  Cathy a recovering alcoholic burdened by the memory of her late father still trying to prove that she is a responsible person in his eyes and Behrani a colonel driven out of Iran with his family and desperately trying to maintain a life of stability and promise.  In these two roles Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give steely performances each presenting troubled souls trapped within stubborn facades.  Connelly once again gives a masterful performance balancing a reckless sensuality with the desire to find acceptance and love within anything even a house where the memories have become so painful that the mail becomes too much to take.Kingsley of course is perfect.  The subtleties of his facial expressions when presented with moments of joy and frustration are masterfully restrained.  This is his best performance of his illustrious career.When Kingsley and Connelly finally clash halfway through the movie the movie having until then been a paean to silence and unspoken loyalties becomes a terrifying thriller riveting everyone with whom I saw the picture.  Perelman moves from a mood piece to a suspenseful drama effortlessly.  A jawdropping conclusion completes a powerful unbelievably sad piece of work.After a couple years of not finding a movie that stirred me this is it what we all look for in movies  a harrowing story beautifully filmed cathartic and elegant.  Joy is very difficult to spot in the film but House of Sand and Fog provides the joy we get when being moved to powerful emotions by a wonderful symphony.My best film of 2003  unquestionably 1010.".

	schema:headline " Incredible Comment On Cultural Gap In America";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all anyone who says that she didn't get the point of this movie needs to go back to watching movies produced solely by Jerry Brukheimer because the point could not be more apparent to anyone of any intelligence. House of Sand and Fog is a commentary on the cultural gap between Americanborn citizens and immigrants from warridden countries such as Iran.  Unfortunately that gap is shown for what it is wider than ever.The character of Kathy is portrayed brilliantly by Jennifer Connelly as an emotionally unstable young woman caught up in the turmoil of losing both her husband and her family's home within eight months of each other.  Kathy ignorantly fails to realize that the house her dead father has left her brother and her is in jeopardy of being put up for auction due to unpaid taxes.  Kathy comprehends too late that the thirty years it took her father to pay off their home has been in vain when it is sold to an Iranian family shortly after auction.  Her character is pinned against Ben Kingsley's Colonel Behrani when Behrani buys Kathy's auctioned house in order to return his own family to a sense of stability.  The audience is conflicted by its empathy for both character's need to satisfy his and her own pride in family and the preservation of his and her heritage.The catalyst for the two characters' conflict with each other is drawn from the supporting character of Officer Lester Ron Eldard a representation of the ignorance and lack of empathy some Americans feel towards people whose lives have led them to seek better ones in the United States.  While Behrani's main motive is to protect his family and give it a sense of security Lester puts his own selfish pleasures before the wellbeing of his own family.  Behrani and Lester are complete opposites Behrani clearly the nobler. It is clear why Kingsley chose to do this role Kingsley's portrayal of an Iranian refugee is both superb and honest not to mention Oscarworthy. The film shows that there are greater sacrifices in this world than those materialistic in nature.  Ironically many Americans might find that point hard to absorb probably the reason why they are so quick to write off House of Sand and Fog as one of the worst movies they have ever seen.  House of Sand and Fog is a film not a movie.  Those who give this film a thumbs down need to get a dictionary and distinguish the difference between the two terms.  Andre Dubus III's novel has been done justice.  Thumbs up.".

Unfortunately that gap is shown for what it is wider than ever.The character of Kathy is portrayed brilliantly by Jennifer Connelly as an emotionally unstable young woman caught up in the turmoil of losing both her husband and her family's home within eight months of each other.  Kathy ignorantly fails to realize that the house her dead father has left her brother and her is in jeopardy of being put up for auction due to unpaid taxes.  Kathy comprehends too late that the thirty years it took her father to pay off their home has been in vain when it is sold to an Iranian family shortly after auction.  Her character is pinned against Ben Kingsley's Colonel Behrani when Behrani buys Kathy's auctioned house in order to return his own family to a sense of stability.  The audience is conflicted by its empathy for both character's need to satisfy his and her own pride in family and the preservation of his and her heritage.The catalyst for the two characters' conflict with each other is drawn from the supporting character of Officer Lester Ron Eldard a representation of the ignorance and lack of empathy some Americans feel towards people whose lives have led them to seek better ones in the United States.  While Behrani's main motive is to protect his family and give it a sense of security Lester puts his own selfish pleasures before the wellbeing of his own family.  Behrani and Lester are complete opposites Behrani clearly the nobler. It is clear why Kingsley chose to do this role Kingsley's portrayal of an Iranian refugee is both superb and honest not to mention Oscarworthy. The film shows that there are greater sacrifices in this world than those materialistic in nature.  Ironically many Americans might find that point hard to absorb probably the reason why they are so quick to write off House of Sand and Fog as one of the worst movies they have ever seen.  House of Sand and Fog is a film not a movie.  Those who give this film a thumbs down need to get a dictionary and distinguish the difference between the two terms.  Andre Dubus III's novel has been done justice.  Thumbs up.";

	schema:headline " Superb movie well directed and a stunning performance from Connelly. Shakespearean Tragedy in a modern setting.";
	schema:reviewBody "Movie It's a great movie without a doubt a strong and intelligent offering with some of the strongest and most heartfelt performances I've seen for a long time. Jennifer Connelly is stunning and I don't just mean in looks her acting is amazing and is picked up on the audio commentary again and again. One scene early on requires her to shed a single tear while talking quite normally on the phone as if on queue it drops. You can hardly believe someone could give such a heart wrenchingly emotional and confused performance as this and manage to retain a normal life watching her you believe that she is in a downward spiral of depression and self destruction. A totally believable and emotionally charged performance.Ben Kingsley also gives a great performance although not so outwardly recognisable in emotion it's only really until you watch the audio commentary and listen to the praise given by the Director and author that you realise how subtle and exacting his performance is. His character is defined by strength beliefs and pride and Kingsley gives an excellent performance Shakespearean in stature.The film itself is emotionally draining and you feel you're being taken on that rollercoaster drop along with Connelly's character but don't for a second think that you shouldn't see it for those reasons it's a journey that is superbly rewarding as a movie and an education in the miscommunication of people. Particularly people of different cultures.As the movie progresses and the events step further and further down towards their tragic conclusion the characters become more and more complex. Starting as simple pigeon holed characters that you've seen before they soon become more real and pull you into the movie wrapping you up in them. They become utterly engaging and you totally disengage from life around you.There's a strong supporting cast although the performance from Jonathan Ahdout is not too convincing those around them are I think a particular mention is required to Shohreh Aghdashloo who provides an emotional balance for the coldness of Kingsley's character and an emotional mirror to the devastation of Connelly's character.Two things are mentioned in the audio commentary that I didn't really pick up on until then but retrospectively you realise these contribute greatly to making it a great movie. The first is the subtlety there are many images and scenes without words that you don't truly appreciate until a second viewing or a very careful first one. The second is the way that Kinglsey praises the Director's style of never telling the audience what did happen and is going to happen events just occur. For instance the breaking of the marriage of Ron Eldard where there is no explanation given it's just happened. This has the effect of treating the audience with respect and realising that they have intelligence and it also makes for an excellent way of keeping the pace of the movie.Picture Presented The picture is crisp and sharp a superb use of lighting in the movie moving from the bright opening beginning of the story it darkens through time to the bleak and dismal closing scenes. The light is always warm and inviting with any artificial light looking sterile and the darker shots bleak and dismal. Some of the time lapse shots between scenes are beautiful.Audio Presented The audio is very good although there is nothing to really take advantage of a surrounding speaker system the sound is kept sparse and atmospheric with an extremely subtle and limited soundtrack it gives everything to the movie and never distracts.Extras Presented What strikes you about this DVD are the beautiful animated menus black and white shots from through the movie fill the background giving you the feeling of mystery and indeed sadness.The Deleted Scenes are good although alongside they have a dull and very annoying commentary. Rather than talking about the scene and giving some insights you are treated to noises of laughter snorting and approval interspersed with over the top bouts of backslapping. Awful before it's over you're dreading the onset of the audio commentary. The Behind the Scenes is good but nothing new.The Photo Gallery is very well done as it's not a gallery at all it's a featurette that is filled with stills between interviews with people talking about actors characters and key scenes. It's a very engaging way of creating a gallery. Another huge extra is the Shohreh Aghdashloo Audition it's truly amazing to see this actress work through some very emotionally harrowing scenes one after the other right in front of your eyes it gives you a superb grounding in what it really means to be an actor and auditioning. With this performance it's hardly surprising she gained the role.Finally there is the Audio Commentary and after the pathetic commentary on the deleted scenes I was really concerned. However the backslapping was slightly subdued for the full commentary still very evident but much more bearable due to the amount of information that was given about the story filming and the actors themselves. Combining Kingsley Vadim Perelman and Andre Dubus III you are treated to a really wide view from story conception through development filming acting and ultimately post production. I really enjoyed this insightful commentary although bordering on the crawling at parts it gave you a lot more about the movie and the story. It also provides an interesting look at the actors and their methods.Overall The movie is superb and firmly fixes itself in the realms of classic tragedy. The acting from both leads is stunning particularly Connelly and the supporting cast provide strong backing. Powerful emotional and at times quite harrowing this is superb entertainment and a movie deserving far more recognition than it did again particularly for Connelly.".

	schema:headline " A desperate masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is based on Andre Dubus III'S acclaimed novel House of Sand and Fog. Dubus created a story of immense power about cultures and the gap between them about human pain about hope and ultimately about humanity and sometimes its tragic loss. Colonel Behrani Sir Ben Kingsley and his family buy a house on the fictional area Pacific County intending to ameliorate their lifestyle as they have been banished from their home country Iran. However the previous owner of the house a depressed young woman and recovering alcoholic Kathy Lazaro Jennifer Connelly turns up and reclaims her property which was taken from her because of a bureaucratic error. And when Kathy's boyfriend Officer Lester Burdon very effectively performed by Ron Eldard a racist obsessed with the concept of justice decides to help her all hell breaks loose. I cannot speak of the plot any further without spoiling it so I will stop here. How can one tell a story and be more than a mere narrator? How can a book be adapted to film without merely repeating what the book itself says? Not only does newcomer director Vadim Perelman answer this question he gives us one of the best films of the past decade. Perelman doesn't waste a single detail. Everything is brought together to create an astonishing emotional impact. Like great directors such as Tarkovsky have done Perelman approaches his every character and pierces through herhis soul. Every scene takes you deeper and deeper into the soul of the characters without ever being slow moving or over descriptive. As for the performances what can I say? Rarely if ever has a single performance moved me as much as Kingsley's. This gigantic actor delivers one of his best performances to date he has immaculate control over every single aspect of his character physically and emotionally. Connelly one of the most talented actresses working today is also breathtaking creating a performance that is a quiet outburst of pain and regret. Shoreh Aghdashloo portraying the most tragic character of the film at least this is my view of her character is heartbreaking. This is acting in its supreme form I really don't think it gets better. She truly deserved an Oscar for this. Young Jonathan Ahdout is also excellent we will definitely be seeing more of him in the future. However I must warn you If you are going to see this movie prepare for an emotional breakdown. It is really one of the most devastating films of the past years and if you'd rather see a pleasant film this isn't for you.".

	schema:headline " Yes it's about a conflict over a house. No the house is not possessed.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a sadness to House of Sand and Fog made doubly so by characters that are neither good nor evil. They can do hateful things just as easily as they can noble and in that aspect they are all human. House of Sand and Fog is a magnificent effort I thought. It works as a reminder that there is good and bad in all of us and breaks your heart in the process.Behrani Sir Ben Kingsley has just bought a house on auction for him and his family wife Nadi played by Shohreh Aghdashloo and son Ismail played by Jonathan Ahdout. It is his intent to live there for a few months until he can sell it for a higher price and find a better home for his family. The only problem is that the house was taken from its previous owner Kathy Jennifer Connelly due to a bureaucratic error. Behrani refuses to give up the house and suspects Kathy of trying to cheat him out of what he sees as rightfully his. Kathy on the other hand is left to wander even resorting to sleeping in her car and getting dressed in euggh public restrooms. Both desperately need the house at the expense of the other's grievances.If anyone is to blame for what is to happen it is Officer Lester Burdon Ron Eldard. He is assigned to the task of helping Kathy move out of the house. He is affected by her story and acts a shoulder to cry on. The two soon become romantically involved. Unfortunately Lester has a very poor sense of justice which leads to him visiting Behrani and bullies him with threats with deportation. This visit helps to ignite an already unsteady dispute between Kathy and Behrani.What happens next is something so unexpected moving and most surprising of all fitting it reminds me of the simple power that film can have. The climax has been complained as a misstep about in an otherwise generally critically praised film. And yes while I agree what happens is senseless I think that that was the point the director was trying to get across. You have to realize that for Behrani and his family this house really IS all they have. Their financial woes are so troubling that Behrani changes into a suit on his way home from his job as a construction worker just so his son doesn't realize how thin the ice his family is on is.And then the performanceswow. The very pretty Jennifer Connelly probably isn't accustomed to playing this broken spirit kind of role but she's quite good. It makes you wonder why she doesn't get as much work as some other less dynamic Hollywood actresses. Secondly who is Shohreh Aghdashloo and why have I not heard of her? She's fantastic and layered and motherly and holds her own against Ben Kingsley. Speaking of Mr. Kingsley he's mesmerizing bringing nobility to his character. Of course this doesn't justify some of his actions but one gets the sense he really would do anything for his family.So I wholeheartedly recommend House of Sand and Fog with the disclaimer that it is a very sad film. Still it's better than 90 of say romantic comedies out right now. It's certainly not a fun experience but I would say it's a worthwhile one.".

	onyx:emotionText "There's a sadness to House of Sand and Fog made doubly so by characters that are neither good nor evil. They can do hateful things just as easily as they can noble and in that aspect they are all human. House of Sand and Fog is a magnificent effort I thought. It works as a reminder that there is good and bad in all of us and breaks your heart in the process.Behrani Sir Ben Kingsley has just bought a house on auction for him and his family wife Nadi played by Shohreh Aghdashloo and son Ismail played by Jonathan Ahdout. It is his intent to live there for a few months until he can sell it for a higher price and find a better home for his family. The only problem is that the house was taken from its previous owner Kathy Jennifer Connelly due to a bureaucratic error. Behrani refuses to give up the house and suspects Kathy of trying to cheat him out of what he sees as rightfully his. Kathy on the other hand is left to wander even resorting to sleeping in her car and getting dressed in euggh public restrooms. Both desperately need the house at the expense of the other's grievances.If anyone is to blame for what is to happen it is Officer Lester Burdon Ron Eldard. He is assigned to the task of helping Kathy move out of the house. He is affected by her story and acts a shoulder to cry on. The two soon become romantically involved. Unfortunately Lester has a very poor sense of justice which leads to him visiting Behrani and bullies him with threats with deportation. This visit helps to ignite an already unsteady dispute between Kathy and Behrani.What happens next is something so unexpected moving and most surprising of all fitting it reminds me of the simple power that film can have. The climax has been complained as a misstep about in an otherwise generally critically praised film. And yes while I agree what happens is senseless I think that that was the point the director was trying to get across. You have to realize that for Behrani and his family this house really IS all they have. Their financial woes are so troubling that Behrani changes into a suit on his way home from his job as a construction worker just so his son doesn't realize how thin the ice his family is on is.And then the performanceswow.

The struggle to maintain sanity while waiting on the slow legal system to do it's job really struck a chord.This movie does an excellent job of showing us what can happen when we allow our emotions to control us and when we take matters into our own hands and not wait for the legal process to complete. It also shows us how humans become emotionally attached to material things and can become both emotionally and mentally unstable when separated from them.The characters in this movie all were superb! The acting was the best I've seen in awhile and so I give this movie 9 out of 10. Definitely a good movie with a lesson embedded. One that each of us can benefit greatly from.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films that you start watching hopefully get through reluctantly hoping for a saving moment and a proper character or plot development at some point and then by the time it ends you find yourself cursing at the script writer and director and actors! for subjecting you to such a waste of time and hope. At least that's what it felt like for me. It's not the dreary depressive quality of it that bothered me good tragic stories can be the most beautiful stories to tell but tragedy does need some depth some grounding in the emotional character of the protagonists and this character has to come through powerfully to sustain the sadness otherwise it's just overindulgence in emotions for its own sake or just to show off how many crying heartbroken expressions the actors can display. Tragedy doesn't have to feel plausible or to 'make sense' rationally but it has to feel real the film has to build the premises for it in a honest manner. I felt cheated by this film because it pretends to be a sophisticated tale but ends up being no more than a melodramatic tearjerker. In fact because the tragic development feels so fake and so overblown this was probably the first film I watched that I thought would have benefited from a happier ending where I usually find myself having the opposite reaction. But the only thing worse than a soppy over the top happy ending is an equally soppy over the top miserable ending. We do get bits of information in way of 'explanation' of each protagonist' behaviour and emotions but they are just thrown there superficially like data in a police report. There's just no nuance in letting them come to the fore. Each new harrowing development seems to be there only to test our patience  it all escalates from a stupid bureaucratic error into outright war with the former Iranian colonel turning into a careless speculator and wife abuser the kind sheriff suddenly turning into a psycho kidnapper who threatens the newcomers with deportation the woman who lost her husband and her house turning suicidal in the most theatrical way and the teenage son of the colonel turning into an improvised and unsuccessful Bruce Willis in a moment that is probably the most outrageous injection of pointless distress. There are also individual elements that are particularly annoying especially the flatness and rigidity of the character played by Ben Kingsley more stereotype than really convincing and his awfully caricatured accent and choice of phrases no real Iranian would speak English like that especially not when talking to his own family or much less praying.... It was not just the presence of Jennifer Connelly that reminded me of Requiem for a Dream  I hated that film too for the same reason. Everything is relentlessly thrown into utter hopelessness and disaster but without enough psychological and narrative conviction to sustain that kind of development. It's such a pity because with a finer subtler treatment this could have indeed been a good film. You get a glimpse of that possibility at around the middle before the rollercoaster of despair and destruction begins so utterly unsubtle the paper thin structure of the film ends up buried under its weight. A classic case of aiming too high.".

So both are fresh and except for the first few minutes and the ending they are really in step very closely matched. An Iranian expatriate family now U.S. citizens near San Francisco get mixed up in a real estate bungle centering around a house near the seathe sand and the fog.This is a grim tale and the movie tips toward grimness more than the book so by the end of watching you will be miserable. But such beautifully wrought misery! Ben Kingsley as the former colonel from Iran now struggling to keep his family afloat is simply amazing. His wife and son are strong and believable and they form a true picture of so many families melding into the American landscape but still within the four walls of their house holding tight to their personal and cultural histories. This is important to the movie.And it is so American too that they are misunderstood. The crisis of this house caught between this family and the previous owner a young woman Kathy played with emotional intensity and coy seductiveness by Jennifer Connelly heightens everyone's misconceptions. She has an illicit but idealized affair with a cop strung through this something emphasized and more sexually explicit in the book which is actually helpful because it gets into Kathy's head and an increasingly desperate series of rash judgements by the cop makes for a horrifying crisis.If there is something limiting about this movie it's hard to put your finger on. The cop played by Ron Eldard seems convincing on the surface but there's something not quite as right about him as an other lead. There is also a slight improbability to the plot spiraling without anyone quite having the chance to check things even in some small way. Of course that's the whole point how little things build out of control but there are some flawsthe lawyer the relationship between the cop and the girl better in the book and even the excessive despair of the Iranian parents which is played out with almost gruesome detail here more than the book.But what makes the movie terrific is the larger theme about understanding and misunderstanding. It is even about recovering from substance abuse and how people the cop need to be sensitive to those around them who have weaknesses. To some extent the movie needs some of the details of the bookby being just two hours long it strips the inner voices away too much and unfortunately those are what make the story really work. Advice from someone who knows and likes both? Read the book. It's a fast read well done if imperfect but that's a different review. But if you don't do books any more the movie is really good.

Not in the slightest the mizeenscene of this movie is kept at a constant glum and depressing tone thanks to the visuals the music and the subject matter. This film hits a lot of heavy scenes that aren't for the faint of heart Manipulation financial debt racism domestic disputes police brutality and murdersuicide. When you get past that though you're greeted with a unique and unforgettable experience of a movie. The camera work is absolutely gorgeous in terms of the views we are given and the lighting used especially in the final scenes of the movie. The actors capture the emotions flying through the air perfectly and the music is used at the perfect points in order to compliment the imagery to it's fullest potential. The run time is rather long but there is not a wasted scene in this film as it grips you from start to finish. Just make sure you have something lighthearted to watch or do after you finish. You're going to need it.".

	schema:headline " An exercise in frustration. 510 SPOILER ALERT";
	schema:reviewBody "First the positives Connelly and Kingsley give excellent performances. The film is well shot and well directed. The glaring weakness is the story fault either to the writer of the novel or to the screenwriter which relies on very questionable plot points and reasonably bright people making dumb decision after dumb decision. First Kathy loses her house due to her own stupidity  she chooses not to open mail from the county after she clears up a 'business tax' error. Neglecting her mail leads to her eviction and subsequent auction of the house. Behrani steps in somehow buys the 174K house for 45K and stands to make a profit for his family redeeming himself for past failures. Apparently the county keeps the entire 45K when it turns out that Kathy only owes 500 in business tax. The county admits their mistake but keeps all the money from the sale of the house. ??? Please. Behrani understandably refuses to sell the house back to the county and tells Kathy that she should sue the county. Kathy refuses to go this route instead letting her newfound deputy boyfriend Lester who is married by the way go over to the house and attempt to threaten Behrani into selling. Behrani refuses. Lester has to go deal with his angry wife and Kathy assumes that he is gone for good. She has the bright idea to kill herself at the house but fails twice to do so. Behrani takes her in instead of just calling an ambulance and Lester shows up and takes the family hostage. Behrani offers to sell the house back to the county give the refunded 45K to Kathy and Lester. In exchange they will put the house back in Behrani's name. Lester agrees and goes with Behrani to the county office to do so. For some contrived reason Behrani's son Esmail goes with them. The three head towards the office but Esmail decides to steal the gun from Lester and point it at him. Two policemen come up of course and tell him to drop the gun. I know even Esmail has seen enough American TV to know better than to swing the gun and point it at the policemen but he does so anyway and is subsequently shot. He dies and Lester is sent to jail for threatening Behrani. With his son dead Behrani decides to deal with his grief by poisoning his wife and suffocating himself. The moron that started the whole thing Kathy shows up at the house to find the couple dead. She cries and the movie is over. I'm all for nonHollywood endings but this film was brutal. 510 for strong performances and good cinematography.".

The scenery and the lighting are superb.I selected spoiler because I prefer to err on the side of caution. I offer only very small insight regarding events portrayed in this amazing movie. None of my comments will ruin any surprises. I prefer to know only minimal details of a movie before I view it. If people start going into detail with a movie I have not seen I put my hands up and ask them to stop. I seldom rate a ten but this one is well deserved.The story line follows the life of a well to do and influential colonel from the Iranian army during the time when the shah ruled. He lived lavishly and had to leave when the ayatollahs took control. He came to America with a bit of money and attempted to continue that lavish lifestyle with not nearly enough money to go around.Early in the movie Behrani splendidly played by Ben Kingsley makes it clear he has no guilt regarding the misfortune of Kathy played by Jennifer Connelly over the loss of her house. He bought it cheap at an auction which should never have taken place and intends to resell it at a handsome profit. That sets the stage for a confrontation. It was made clear to him by Kathie's lawyer that the house was wrongfully taken by the county. But for him it is profit over conscience. His pride may prove to be his downfall. Pride has been the destruction of many people. It can be most difficult to downgrade ones' lifestyle. Behrani lamented spending more than 140000 to rent a lavish apartment. That money would have been better used to buy a house instead of wasting it on rent. But he wasn't willing to downgrade yet. Had he done so immediately after arriving in America none of the tragic events would have happened.Kathy is still reeling from a divorce and the loss of her father. A recovering alcoholic she is a basket case. She becomes obsessed over the loss of her fathers house which is valued at 140000. It seems in her depressed state of mind she was not checking the mail and missed warnings the county would seize her home over an unpaid business tax.There is considerable prejudice on the part of both the immigrants and the Americans. So it would appear Americans do not have a monopoly on that.Foolishness on the part of several people contributes to tragedy all around. Selfishly hanging onto those things which matter least causes the loss of that which is far more important.This movie does not have a happy ending so if that is what you prefer do NOT watch this movie. But there are many valuable lessons in this movie we would all do well to learn from. If we can still learn from other people's mistakes perhaps we can avoid some of the tragedies portrayed in this incredibly well executed film.".

Are we still living in the Wild West Era?The worst part of the movie was such an unrealistic character portraying of the Deputy Lester being logical and reasonable even in his own family struggle and yet turned into an obsessed psycho without any explanation. Talk about bad script!Obviously the author of the novel was trying to create a spiral conflict that the readers can sympathize with all three or at least two Kathy and Colonel Behrani but it never worked not even close. It is rather a couple of losers Kathy and Lester committing such heinous crimes against an innocent family and the nonsensical ending doesn't help either. I wonder whether there are any sane people who would feel for the Confederate army over Lieutenant Dunbar or American Natives in the movie Dances with wolves.Despite all the actors' brilliant performance and admirable directing job this movie falls short very short. I wish I could give no star rating. I didn't read the novel but the author said that the movie script was very loyal to the original story. It makes me puzzle how it made into the best seller lists in the first place. Did I just hear someone say Oprah?".

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost if you have read the Dumas book then you realize that this movie doesn't resemble the novel in the slightest.  The only thing that this movie got right was the names of the characters! However I am a big advocate in saying that you should never compare a movie back to its book and I use this movie as an example.  This story has been Disneyfied so that it can be called a family film.  If you read the book a true adaptation would not be family entertainment.  Disney changed everything that they do.  Read the Tarzan novel and compare to the cartoon. BIG changes there.  The Little Mermaid.  How convenient that Disney left out the fact that Ariel dies at the end of the story.But what we should judge is the end result.  This movie is still entertaining despite having nothing to do with its literary influence.  The characters are portrayed with the same attributes that they have in the book.  For instance D'Artagnan while very duty bound and honorable is young and headstrong and prone to impulsive decisions that will help him to prove his skill and worth.  Porthos is self serving and self praising very vain and cocky yet has a lust for the finer things in life.  Aramis is humble and religious but very skilled and intelligent making him a very formidable soldier yet he also loves the finer things in life.  And Athos loves his wine trying to bury himself in a alcoholic haze to hide the pain that he suffered in losing the love of his life.  All of these come through in the movie and all of the actors were great in performing them. As far as the story is concerned Disney likes things black and white good vs evil.  And so the story changes to make the Cardinal a power hungry man with his own interests in mind.  He wasn't like that in the book or in real life but he was underhanded and Tim Curry does another great job as the villain that he steals the show.Overall a great and enjoyable movie worth watching with the family.".

Dumas' plot while interesting in and of itself to many is probably not one that many folks who think of the Three Musketters could actually tell you.This movie sets out to more or less capture the feel of such films rather than the source material itself.  In that regard it's not too badly done. The characters are pretty broadly drawn but adequate for the younger audience they're aimed at.  Sutherland Platt and Sheen all seem way too young but at least the first two are entertaining.  Platt in particular manages to steal every scene he's in.By the same token Richelieu's character is simplified to generic bad guy. The King and Queen seem too young as well although they're represented age may be novelistically andor historically accurate  again could most folks really tell you or care?.Overall I'd recommend the movie for some light entertainment but don't take it too seriously.".

Film versions of classic novels should at least bear some resemblance to the plot of the novel from which they are adapted even if they are just potboilers intended for a family audience like this one and not meant to be taken too seriously. But this is a very loose adaptation indeed.The acting is just up to the level required and the dialogue is a mix of pseudo17th century and contemporary Americanisms which fail to convince the viewer that heshe is watching a picture set in 17th century France. Though the production is quite a handsome one with the sets locations and costumes all nice to look at the characters are not welldrawn in particular those of Cardinal Richlieu portrayed as an out and out villain admittedly enjoyably but with little depth and D'Artagnan who is played as naive arrogant and pompous and not as a particularly likable character.Other comments stress that this is a Disney picture made for the family but that should not save it from criticism. Compare it with Disney's Treasure Island or Kidnapped both much superior adaptations. Nor have they helped children understand the novel. Because it is so loosely based they would hardly recognise it as The Three Musketeers if the characters' names had been changed though I do agree that film adaptations don't have to follow the source novel absolutely faithfully.But is it entertaining? Yes and no. The villains are hissable Aramis Arthos and Porthos are sometimes entertaining despite the questionable dialogue they are given and Richlieu though often over the top has his moments. The action scenes are OK but not done with any great verve compared with the Richard Lester version. Milady does not feature as a really central character in the plot as she should and in fact many of the novels' characters do not appear in the film at all.Read the book and see the 1973 version and forget this one if you are over 16.".

The harsh character who hates everyone and then has a standoff against the enemy allowing the others to escape and think he's dead and then miraculously come back! Me and my bro were cackling as we pointed out this and similar stuff. Tim curry is funny as heck too. it seemed like he was thinking I'm stuck with this so why not have fun? and makes the main baddie Cardinal Richelou the biggest perv the world has ever known. This guy comes on to everyone in the movie who vaguely resembles a female that includes the young king who looks a woman disguised as a man disguised as Micheal Jackson. The dialog isn't anywhere near the correct time period and while the minor characters at least have accents though often not necessarily french as they should be the three musketeers remain pretty darn American.

Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen before he became a surly twitchy mess is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.".

Chris O'Donnell is impish if a bit callow in the lead but the real show is musketeers anyway and there is where the movie excels. Keifer is suitably brooding as Athos and Charlie Sheen before he became a surly twitchy mess is a charming Aramis. The standout however is Oliver Platt going full on ham as Porthos giving a delightfully over the top performance and walking off with the picture whenever he is on screen. Rebecca De Mornay also seems to be having a good time enacting the villainous Milady de Winter she's sexy and silky. Lastly there is Tim Curry positively consuming the scenery as Cardinal Richelieu in his flowing red robes he and Oliver Platt are in a dead heat for biggest scene stealer. The production is high class with vibrant with color and beautiful settings true it bears only a passing kinship with the source book but it is a fun time with lots of action and a carefree mood.";

The classic novel by Dumas pre is a fairly straightforward actionadventure tale so it's surprising they felt the need to dumb it down by ruining the character of Richelieu radically altering the story and adding an abominable final act  which features scenes such as Richelieu shooting Aramis with a hidden gun and ludicrous boss battles.Sutherland is not a bad choice as Athos and could have been acceptable in a serious adaptation. Sheen and Platt two capable performers are miscast  or better their characters have been rewritten to suit them. O'Donnell simply lacks the charisma and fire required by the part.It's not entirely Curry's fault albeit his Monty Pythonish performance is an embarrassment but Richelieu is the movie's worst blunder the Cardinal in the book is an intriguing textured character not a ghoullike sneering ubervillain.

His opponent is a blatant walking gay joke and is completely inappropriate for what pretends to be a family picture. Also out of place in a family picture were some of the violent images and the generous cleavage shots. Obviously the movie veers from the novel but it veers so far that the book becomes source material in name only. Aramis is no longer the pious gentleman of Dumas' novel but instead he is...well Charlie Sheen with a Bible and cross. The plot is almost completely thrown out and the exact opposite of virtually everything in the book happens. Worst of all Milady DeWinter is transformed from one of the most evil creatures ever into a sympathetic character who is not really bad and only dies because she chooses to sacrifice herself. The script if it can even be called a script is hopelessly corny. It feels like they were trying to do the kind of movie they ended up making with Pirates of the Caribbean but failed miserably. The screenwriter hacks it up showing no knowledge of ballistics for the last time cannonballs DO NOT EXPLODE! anatomy a wound to the gut may be fatal but it will not kill a man within a few seconds or military procedures the King's guards would be going into war with the King not disbanding! and certainly no knowledge of the Dumas novel. Some things were kept those things being the threeway duel and the fact that Athos used to be married to Milady. That's pretty much it. Really. That's it. I know we can't expect a page for page adaptation but this was just awful. Oliver Platt's performance as Porthos was the one good thing and even then I think it was more Platt being himself than playing the character.".

She went there to assassinate him!  This whole movie is a crock. The producers couldn't leave anything intact.  After the fight with the Cardinal's guards the four men went away delighted with having beatin the guards they didn't run off and leave D'Artagnan like that.  And what is with the gay little charactor fighting D'Artagnan at the beginning?  That's not at all how he left for Paris.  His father Rochefort never killed him gave him his sword some money and a letter for the Captain of the Musketeers.  D'Artagnan met Rochefort on the road and fought with him on his way to Paris that's why D'Artagnan really hated Rochefort.  I could go one all night like this but instead I'll give the readers one piece of advice. Stay away from this movie as you would a rabid dog rent the 1974 version with Michael York Richard Chamberlain Oliver Reed and Charlton Heston it's ten times better follows the book to perfection and is hilariously funny at the same time.  Don't even waste 50 cents to rent this flop.  Only watch this version if Mystery Science Theatre 2000 decides to bash it!".

But I do object to the plundering and complete destruction of a literary classic in order to create it. They've bowdlerized Dumas. What they've done is the equivalent of turning James Bond into a teetotaler who abhors violence and respects women for their personality.Just stick to the 1970s version starring Michael York as D'Artagnan or if you can find it the early silent French serialization.".

A lot it seems. far too often for my taste as the phrse becomes a sound bite rather than a declaration of loyalty. Performances worth checking out are by Michael Wincott and by Tim Currey who chews screen time with a desperation that doesn't seem necessary given Curry's genuine acting talent. Otherwise this is a total waste of time. In both cases I couldn't help remembering that Tim Currey and Michael Wincott were not Charleton Heston and Christopher Lee. Charlie Sheen Kiefer Sutherland and Chris O'Donnel are never convincing as 18thCentury Frenchmen and come across only as 20thCentury actors from the New World. Oliver Platt is amusing but in the end is also unable to make the audience suspend disbelief. The script is insipid and juvenile at best and is an insult to stupid people. I came out of the movie feeling cheated and talked down to. This movie lacks the grandeur and the wonder that a good period piece adventure must have.For a better handling of this material check out the Richard Lester films The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers both of which star Michael York and are much closer to the original Dumas.This version is awful don't waste your time.".

Tim Curry does a fantastic job actually simplicit still but he does his job at holding together the piece as well as the comedy from Oliver Platt very enjoyable.

And as I have made clear blahdeblahdeblah...this is one.The atmosphere is mad and more fun than a barrel of chimpanzees on LSD. The underground dungeons with flaming torches and people sticking their arms through the sardinelike grids and the eeeeeeeeeeevil villains who are shown as ruthless from the word go are textbook cheese and just what is needed in this film.Straight away we are thrown into the action with some very pleasant surprises. Chris O Donnell as the hotheaded D'Artagnian Keifer Sutherland as the fairly straightheaded Athos Oliver Platt as the bonkers but ingenious Porthos with tricks up his sleeve that come out of nowhere such as a triplebladed dagger Charlie Sheen as the religious Aramis the beautiful Julie Delpy as ladyinwaiting constance Tim Curry and Michael Wincott as the classic bad guy doubleact with evil villain and secondary baddie with eyepatch even Paul McGann in a hilarious doublerole sometimes playing a leader in the Cardinal's guard but mostly playing a wuss who has it in the neck about his sister's 'honour' with D'Artagnian and was clearly never breastfed by his mother. Not to mention the hilarious mullet that Hugh O Connor sports as the king of France!The entire film consists of swinging thin swords about jumping onto moving carts and up and down walls while swinging said swords meeting beautiful women and with an exciting climax at the end. If you've read the book good for you. I hope you enjoyed it. But if you're devoted to it then avoid any contact with this film. It's action all out romp where the brain does not have to work hard but just sits back relaxes and escapes. If you want deep 'reallife' and 'gritty' stuff then forget it. This film has none of that. Good vs bad simple as that.I'll be honest I deeply loathe despise and detest Disney Fairy stories though animations such as Toy Story and The Lion King get a thumbsup from me. Having said that though the mouse house do a damn fine line up in feelgood action romps such as this one and Pirates of the Caribbean and if you disagree then dive head first into a hospital surgery bin.".

I really should.But...I just can't let this movie go. It's a rollicking fastpaced swashbuckler with a decidedly oldfashioned feel. The use of vibrant color the grand and elaborate sets the simple yet energetic action sequences I'm reminded of a sweeping adventure film MGM might have made in the forties or fifties.The cast is particularly strong and all the actors seem to be having a ball in their roles. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect for the brooding Athos Charlie Sheen is wry as the pious Aramis and Oliver Platt chews the scenery as the arrogant eccentric Porthos. Chris O'Donnell as the ambitious D'Artagnan interjects himself quite ably into the group dynamic and the four leads develop great chemistry with one another throughout the film. Tim Curry and Michael Wincott soar to great heights in their cartoonish villainy and Rebecca De Mornay is alluring and tragic as Lady DeWinter.Michael Kamen's score is romantic and bombastic and triumphantperfect for the tone of the film. Heck I even like the Rod StewartBryan AdamsSting collaboration All For Love that plays over the creditsclearly calculated to help the soundtracks sell copies but dammit I still believe in their sincerity!

This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6 Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. I haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a 35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straighttovideo movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.Plot a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tailon accident and on purpose. I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex the worst movie of Whoopi's career.Don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didn't see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney. Utterly painful from start to finish.".

	schema:headline " Like the Dinosaurs the movie fails to evolve and got extinct. This movie commit dinoside.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hey Theodore Rex! If you're happy for this movie and you know it. Clap your... oh. Never mind because there is small amount of people that honestly like this movie. This movie wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. Still it was just a little too ridiculous. I have to give the movie some credit as it was trying to do something new with the Dinosaur concept. Too bad it didn't establish its world that way. In an alternate futuristic a dark and edgy cyberpunk society a tough female police detective Katie Coltrane Whoopi Goldberg is paired with a talking dinosaur Theodore Rex Voiced by George Newbern to find the killer of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals leading them to a mad scientist bent on creating a new Armageddon. Directed by Jonathan R. Betuel the movie is badly delivered. It was supposed to capitalize on the 1990s Dinosaur craze that films like 1993's Jurassic Park  TV Shows 1991's Dinosaurs help create. Sadly it's fails due to a plot that is hard to understand with a complicated text prologue and horrible dialogue. The plot drags down to a slow pace due to a lot of filler scenes like the undercover clothes scene. BTW he looks the same undercover. Things are never explain like why the Dinosaurs have psychic powers or how anthropomorphic dinosaurs even came to this world. The film gets even weirder when clones and cyborgs are also in the film. The movie plot remind me of a mix between 1982's Blade Runner and 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit with similarities. I really think the movie too many concepts in the film. The confusion and sheer randomness of the on screen action is actually kind of impressive It feels like a mess. A little more exposition would be great to have here. Even if the plot was clear the poor animatronics made it a hard watch. It uses the same technology as the Dinosaurs TV show had at the time. The only problem is that is a stepdown. For a movie that was 33.5 million dollars to make you would think that they would use their money well and give the actor that plays the title character a better Dinosaur suit to wear. The lip movements don't even sync with the costume's movement. Most of the actors signed on thinking the dinosaur would be computer enhanced. The fundamental problem with this movie is that Theodore doesn't act like a T. Rex. He's too anthropomorphized to be taken serious. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying hypocrite of a creature. One minute he's preaching the teachings of nonviolence and the next minute he's threating to bite people's head off. They really can't make up their mind. His running gag about being a recovering carnivore is just downright too preachy. Last is his bumbling behavior that remind me of Jars Jar Binks's level of hatred. It does wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him are just more misses than hits to the funny bone. For a buddy cop comedy this movie jokes are just unfunny for the most part. Whoopi Goldberg is no help. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Whoopi attempted to back out of the deal but legal entanglements kept her on the production. The supporting cast is just as forgettable in their performance. I nearly forgot that Richard Roundtree and Bud Cort are in this film. It's funny in a way that Molly Rex Voiced by Carol Kane is just Theodore Rex in drag. It's disturbing as hell that they look the same. The production crew look like they just reused the same costume. Carol Kane sings in her dinosaur persona but the songs are not that catchy. It's get weirder with the forced loveinterest subplot. The pacing ruins it. It's weird that she wants to get with Theodore on the same day of her murder exhusband funeral. Talk about moving on too quickly. The editing is just crappy as they intercut sequences that has little to do with each other. Many of the camera shots were unoriginal. It even has the nerves to steal epic shots from 1982's E.T like the flying in front of a full moon shot. There is a lot of shaky cam and oddly done Dutch angles that makes little to no sense to have. Though originally intended for theatrical release the film went directtovideo and consequently became the most expensive directtovideo film ever made at the time of its release. The film can be compare to 1986's Howard the Duck in how kid friendly it is. It has a lot of sexual innuendos and brutal action scenes. Sadly none of them really add much to the entertaining value of this film. I really doubt this movie was made for kids in the first place. Overall A lot of people might get confused with this to a notable biography of Theodore Roosevelt. It seem like the movie did influence a bit of 2004's Anonymous Rex which is a book series that coincidentally is about a dinosaur detective solving crimes amongst humans as well. Just better written. If you want to check out a film about crime solving dinosaurs Anonymous Rex might be the better film to watch over this. This movie sucks.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hey Theodore Rex! If you're happy for this movie and you know it. Clap your... oh. Never mind because there is small amount of people that honestly like this movie. This movie wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. Still it was just a little too ridiculous. I have to give the movie some credit as it was trying to do something new with the Dinosaur concept. Too bad it didn't establish its world that way. In an alternate futuristic a dark and edgy cyberpunk society a tough female police detective Katie Coltrane Whoopi Goldberg is paired with a talking dinosaur Theodore Rex Voiced by George Newbern to find the killer of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals leading them to a mad scientist bent on creating a new Armageddon. Directed by Jonathan R. Betuel the movie is badly delivered. It was supposed to capitalize on the 1990s Dinosaur craze that films like 1993's Jurassic Park  TV Shows 1991's Dinosaurs help create. Sadly it's fails due to a plot that is hard to understand with a complicated text prologue and horrible dialogue. The plot drags down to a slow pace due to a lot of filler scenes like the undercover clothes scene. BTW he looks the same undercover. Things are never explain like why the Dinosaurs have psychic powers or how anthropomorphic dinosaurs even came to this world. The film gets even weirder when clones and cyborgs are also in the film. The movie plot remind me of a mix between 1982's Blade Runner and 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit with similarities. I really think the movie too many concepts in the film. The confusion and sheer randomness of the on screen action is actually kind of impressive It feels like a mess. A little more exposition would be great to have here. Even if the plot was clear the poor animatronics made it a hard watch. It uses the same technology as the Dinosaurs TV show had at the time. The only problem is that is a stepdown. For a movie that was 33.5 million dollars to make you would think that they would use their money well and give the actor that plays the title character a better Dinosaur suit to wear. The lip movements don't even sync with the costume's movement. Most of the actors signed on thinking the dinosaur would be computer enhanced. The fundamental problem with this movie is that Theodore doesn't act like a T. Rex. He's too anthropomorphized to be taken serious. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying hypocrite of a creature. One minute he's preaching the teachings of nonviolence and the next minute he's threating to bite people's head off. They really can't make up their mind. His running gag about being a recovering carnivore is just downright too preachy. Last is his bumbling behavior that remind me of Jars Jar Binks's level of hatred. It does wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him are just more misses than hits to the funny bone. For a buddy cop comedy this movie jokes are just unfunny for the most part. Whoopi Goldberg is no help. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Whoopi attempted to back out of the deal but legal entanglements kept her on the production. The supporting cast is just as forgettable in their performance. I nearly forgot that Richard Roundtree and Bud Cort are in this film. It's funny in a way that Molly Rex Voiced by Carol Kane is just Theodore Rex in drag. It's disturbing as hell that they look the same. The production crew look like they just reused the same costume. Carol Kane sings in her dinosaur persona but the songs are not that catchy. It's get weirder with the forced loveinterest subplot. The pacing ruins it. It's weird that she wants to get with Theodore on the same day of her murder exhusband funeral. Talk about moving on too quickly. The editing is just crappy as they intercut sequences that has little to do with each other. Many of the camera shots were unoriginal. It even has the nerves to steal epic shots from 1982's E.T like the flying in front of a full moon shot. There is a lot of shaky cam and oddly done Dutch angles that makes little to no sense to have. Though originally intended for theatrical release the film went directtovideo and consequently became the most expensive directtovideo film ever made at the time of its release. The film can be compare to 1986's Howard the Duck in how kid friendly it is. It has a lot of sexual innuendos and brutal action scenes. Sadly none of them really add much to the entertaining value of this film. I really doubt this movie was made for kids in the first place. Overall A lot of people might get confused with this to a notable biography of Theodore Roosevelt.

	schema:reviewBody "From watching only the trailer to Theodore Rex you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. That is true but this is mostly a futuristic story which looks a lot like Batman Forever with it's direction style and weird character designs. It was mismarketed and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale instead of just a lame cop comedy. Whether or not this movie is mismarketed it's still a horrible movie.In the future dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology and they talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously but after a dinosaur is murdered he's given the case to work on but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all Katie Coltrane Whoopi Goldberg. It's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud.Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character but by the end he is unbearable to listen to. For some reason along with being a detective he's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. He does imitations of famous people and accents and has some truly awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says It's not my butt trumpet! Wow! What a puerile immature line even for a kid's movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film.This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When the futuristic scenes and action occur there is no comedy or humor. In any nonaction scenes the characters try to be as funny as they can which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome. The action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough and as stated earlier the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here.Having a dinosaurhuman detective duo seems like a pretty original movie if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge ripoff of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set it in the future and it's the exact same plot. A man is killed a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and detective solve the murder a toon and detective solve the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs. This is a huge ripoff of a much better movie!Overall this is a bad movie not even deserving of it's straight to VHS stature.My rating 12 out of . 90 mins.

While I would agree it was a bad and very misguided project I cannot understand why there is this much hatred for the film. Sure it's bad...but I've seen a lot worse!! At least it has interesting sets and dinosaur costumes...though little else. I'd consider putting it on the Bottom 1000 list if they ever come up with one. As for the costumes the look like they were literally recycled from the Dinosaurs TV series...though unlike the show the film has little in the way of cleverness comedy or fun.The film is set in some sort of weirdo alternate reality but the prologue trying to explain this was completely confusing and unnecessary. Suffice to say in this scifi film humanlike dinosaurs act just like people...and coexist in a human world. Or at least they try to coexist but the humans look down on their cold blooded friends. Because of this when a cop Whoopi Goldberg is assigned to work with the very first dinosaur police detective she is less than thrilled. And by this point her feeling is pretty much the audience's.The bottom line is that the story is dull and often stupid. But the film isn't the most boring film I've ever seennot that this is a glowing endorsement. I think that instead of making this super expensive directtovideo release the filmmakers would have been much better off just making a Dinosaurs movie...it couldn't help but be better and less annoying.".

While I would agree it was a bad and very misguided project I cannot understand why there is this much hatred for the film. Sure it's bad...but I've seen a lot worse!! At least it has interesting sets and dinosaur costumes...though little else. I'd consider putting it on the Bottom 1000 list if they ever come up with one. As for the costumes the look like they were literally recycled from the Dinosaurs TV series...though unlike the show the film has little in the way of cleverness comedy or fun.The film is set in some sort of weirdo alternate reality but the prologue trying to explain this was completely confusing and unnecessary. Suffice to say in this scifi film humanlike dinosaurs act just like people...and coexist in a human world. Or at least they try to coexist but the humans look down on their cold blooded friends. Because of this when a cop Whoopi Goldberg is assigned to work with the very first dinosaur police detective she is less than thrilled. And by this point her feeling is pretty much the audience's.The bottom line is that the story is dull and often stupid. But the film isn't the most boring film I've ever seennot that this is a glowing endorsement. I think that instead of making this super expensive directtovideo release the filmmakers would have been much better off just making a Dinosaurs movie...it couldn't help but be better and less annoying.";

In the future there will be dinosaurs cyborgs genetically new species and yet another ice age not the fault of global warming! What really blew my mind is the psychic link between dinosaurs. When Whoopi was in the dinosaur bar being hit on by a dinosaur it was at this point I realized this had to be originally a porn video. They ended up cutting out all the porn scenes so they could get the rating dropped to PG for the family market. Basically I am still seeking the original uncut version but I am having a hard time locating a copy. My doctor insists that the movie is uncut but I can read between the lines. Just look at some of the scenes how they cut away just before and it is like we missed important dialog. This movie gives me hope for the future.".

In Citizen Kane Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings much like Whoopi Goldberg in this movie. This movie is about finding love in everybody's differences. It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and selfabsorption.

Theodore Rex as a character looks grotesque and horrible as well and cinematography and editingwise the film looks cheap. The story is woefully predictable and misconceived the dialogue is sloppy with any sense of comedy being flushed down the toilet and the direction is wretched. Also Theodore Rex is too violent for kids and adults I agree will find it a chore to watch due to its own stupidity.The acting is also dire. Goldberg tries hard but Armin MuellenStahl overdoes it badly in a very clichd role as a mad scientist and lacks any menace. Overall a really bad movie that as far as I'm concerned deserves its dubious reputation. 110 Bethany Cox".

It is a fauxdocumentary in style of Kiarostami's CloseUp  Panahi's Offside about the underground music scene in Iran. It is really about the universal power of music and the passion of the youth which know no boundaries. We see that Iranian musicians go to any lengths to defy censorship and restrictions to play their music. They do not need concert halls. They play anywhere from metro stations to cow sheds and for anyone who wants to listen. Music and lyrics for the young Iranians has become a desperate but at the same time powerful means of expression and communication with the world at large. The music played in the film is very powerful and its range is quite remarkable. We see bands playing jazz pop heavy metal rap and singing in both Farsi and English. Ghobadi's film manages to convey all the passion energy anger and hope that is contained in these music. It is a brave and undoubtedly controversial film specially with the the two leads seeking asylum in the west and Kiarostami denouncing the film made with so much passion that the viewers can not remain unmoved. It is masterfully directed and photographed and brilliantly edited. A masterpiece which is certain to become another milestone in the history of Iranian and world cinema. Absolutely unmissable.".

We follow the main couple Negar  Ashkan as they hunt around to be able to get passports to enable them to get to London for a music gig and get away from Iran.Their band plays Indie Rock music and they take us through the underground landscape in Iran showing us a metal band and other alternative bands who have to play their music hidden from the authorities who otherwise would jail them and take away their instruments.The music is surprisingly quite brilliant and you will empathise with the musicians. One of the best parts of the films is a rap song done by a local artist which takes us on a journey through life in Tehran showing us life at street level for people there. It was worth it alone.As for acting and story it's very good and simple. You see the frustration of all as they fight to live a free life in an atmosphere of fear. You can just feel the tension at times. Our leads really never over do it as could have been the risk in such a movie but they are very ably assisted by a wonderful vast myriad of characters in the film which never seem to step on each others toes. It's like you have just met the whole family.It's a terrific film and very enlightening. It's also very humbling and one I would recommend you give a chance. Definitely more deserve to hear about the Persian Cats.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must begin my review that the film's title is absolutely appropriate to the entire story. It's sad to know how talented people in Iran are forced to shelter their love for music and film. Throughout the film Negar and her band make various efforts to embark overseas in order to showcase their musical genius. This film clearly shows how anyone and everyone who is Iranian are looking for freedom outside Iran even if they are blind. Iran not only restricts your talent but also your vision.What I liked the most about the entire filmmaking is that sad and negative characters such as police and Islamic police were covered away from the screen which was not visual. Hence this film is in a clear war with the negative energy that lurks in Iran which in all its free creative power pushes away the sinners in this case the police or the Islamic police.The film's soundtrack is excellent and worth listening to. The soundtrack covers all the genres from Rock to RB. If you are a lover of international independent art film production then you will appreciate all the hard work put in by the films cast and crew.PS. I watched this film in Dubai United Arab Emirates and I was all alone in the cinema.My score 9 out of 10Neeil Bhatia".

	schema:reviewBody "Music speaks a universal language and is one that cannot be chained by any form of oppression. It is this fact that is highlighted ever so poignantly by Bahman Ghobadi in this heart breaking story of the travails of the aspiring independent musicians of Iran. Effortlessly encompassing various genres like rock jazz metal and rap into its soundtrack neatly blended in with breathtakingly beautiful camerawork of the many worlds in Tehran it gives us a glimpse into the struggle of the youth seeking the freedom of expression. There is also a sense of frustration and anguish while watching the lengths to which the characters have to go to be able to pursue their passion and that is sensitively captured in a way that makes your heart go out for them. The performances are natural and unencumbered by the demands of formal acting and the songs and lyrics are delightfully fresh and evocative. The story which though narrated in the documentary style is never taxing at any point and would transport even the most cynical of viewers on a journey of hope and a quest for freedom and release. But in the end it is the elegant simplicity with which the director deals with a serious complex issue that really makes this film stand out. This is truly good cinema at many levels and is certainly worth every minute of the time you spend with it.".

As usual in such circumstances corruption thrives within local administration and the dictates of rigid ideology can be avoided by greasing the right palms or knowing the right people. The joke is that the musicians though passionate and brilliant are not extreme political militants they're more Bob Seger than Bob Dylan and their ambitions are not overthrowing the government but playing their own kind of music. This involves numerous complexities such as frightening cows and waiting around for the miserable chap next door to go out for work. Filmed under less than ideal circumstances the fact that the storyline dialogue and acting is occasionally reminiscent of an early Cliff Richard film can perhaps be brushed aside. The humour and levity underline very serious issues and the music is fantastic. In my view the best musical documentary film since Buena Vista Social Club.".

She really has to show some more feelings and energy in her acting she has a weaker singing voice than all the rest of musicians. She needs to work on her articulations and her voice. Ashcan was good Nader was off the hook amazing! All the bands are Great however 2 musical performances gave me goose bumps Mirza band's Emshab and Rana Farhan's Drunk with love. The movie is a success and is worth all the prizes it won. Iranian cinema is a school itself. Not only i have respect to the cinema in Iran after watching this movie I got captivated by the exotic and rich music they have. Censure and prohibition in their case helped their works and they were strong enough to rise above and come up with such exquisite art full of taste feelings and professionalism. Thumbs up Iran!".

	schema:reviewBody "An independent Iranian film about Tehran's underground forbidden poprock scene directed by Bahman Ghobadi. The movie follows young indierock artists Ashklan  Negar played by Ashkan Kooshanejad and Negar Saghaghi respectively in their quest to get passports visas and the band members necessary to travel overseas and perform in Nice and the work of their passionate cheeky agent Nader played by Hamed Behdad.The film showcases the musical talent and variety of styles of the poprock scene in Iran and their struggle to create practice and perform in a country that considers that sort of music an antiIslamic antiIranian activity. The movie is fresh and shows how Music has no boundaries has an international language serves to free the spirit and mind catalyzes discontent and express individualism  Music as a subversive peaceful movement. The bands and performers featured in the film beyond the leading couple are Take It Easy Hospital Rana Farhan Hichkas The Yellow Dogs Band Shervin Najafian Ash Koosha Mirza The Free Keys Mahdyar Aghajani Darkoob Hamed Seyed Javadi and Nik Aein Band.The performance of each song is accompanied by a selection of randomly filmed shots of the streets of Tehran which provide the viewer with a real view of the country  one that is not complacent or hedonistic but warm and hard at the same time. Four moments deserve a special mention. The first one is the performance of a heavymetal band in a cow shed with the cows attending the performance which I found very funny. The second moment is truly special and revolves about the lessons that a volunteer musician gives to a group of foreign immigrant children thy seem enthralled and moved by what they are hearing and their faces show that. The most daring and authentically revolutionary performance comes from rapper Rap Khon with offers a great performance with raw and heartfelt lyrics. Finally the performance of jazzblues soloist Rana Farhan who has an exquisite voice and worldclass talent.Among the acting moments I found Hamed's discussion with the police officer after his detention hilarious! The main problem with the movie is the poor acting abilities of the musicians playing actors which could have been excused if the script was less simplistic and the story had contextualized its characters. For example we don't know if they are posh rich kids or middle class kids we don't know if they are students workers live with their parents are married or engaged what are the feelings of their family and friends about their music. They are left to scattered comments that nevertheless don't show the reality of the musicians in Iran when they are not composing of playing. In fact the relationship between the leading couple is not even clearly established they seem to be engaged but we are not told. The musicians in the movie seem to live in a world where nothing but music matters which can be true for musicians but this type of music is forbidden in Iranand society is very oppressive so we just want to know more about their situation and real lives so we can understand the musicians better. Moreover the girls wear a head scarf all the time even in secret alternative concerts and parties where they drink and smoke. How does a woman fit in the underground musical scene in Iran is never explained. Nagar seems to be accessory to Ashkan and her relations with the other musicians are always through Ashkan never direct or even warm.The second problem to me is that the movie despite its freshness and charm feels more like a documentary but it is not. I would have preferred the latter as we would have seem mostly the same people and the same performances and avoid the weaknesses of the script. We love the characters since we meet them for what they are so why force them to act when they can't? By the way I couldn't see this movie without remembering the musicblack market in the animation movie Persepolis which puts into a context how things got so far in Iran regarding music. The context that was missing from this movie.A charming fresh and interesting film with great musical performances but with a poor script.".

I specifically liked one scene in which a band is playing in a barn and the music continues uninterrupted as we watch the ailing drummer abandon his drum kit and the others put down their instruments to help him.Overall the movie was very good and enjoyable.

	schema:headline " Typical Winner mish mash  Brando still in Last Tango mode";
	schema:reviewBody "Conceived as a prequel to The Turn Of The Screw Winner's film is a curious vehicle for Marlon Brando as well as a example of a failed attempt to film gothic period drama satisfactorily. Brando plays Peter Quint the sexually aggressive former valet now locum gardener at Bly House an English county estate. Bly is run jointly by housekeeper  Mrs Grose Thora Hird and a governess the repressed Miss Jessell Stephanie Beacham. The only other inhabitants of this curious domicile are two children Miles Christopher Ellis and Flora Verna Harvey nominally the wards of the absent Master of the House a splendid Harry Andrews obliged with their care after the death of their parents in an overseas automobile accident. The children regard Quint as something of a surrogate father and feel that they can ingratiate themselves by manipulating his private life notably his intense relationship with Miss Jessell. Jack Claytons The Innocents 1962 is the closest point of reference for Winner's effort as the earlier film is the definitive telling of the Henry James tale the events of which spring from this. Presumably the appointment and despatch to Bly of the unnamed new governess at the film's end is that of Miss Giddings the character played by Deborah Kerr. But where Clayton's film was completely successful in transmitting a feeling of supernatural unease and psychological dread Winner's hamfisted approach to his material comes across as almost entirely without atmosphere or charm. James' characters may act out their allotted parts in The Nightcomers but its presentation of situation and personality veers uncertainly between the childhood gormlessness of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the compulsions of Lady Chatterley's Lover as much as evoking any genuine  atmosphere of psychic foreboding. Perhaps such foreboding was the last thing the director had in mind. Brando of course regularly exudes magnetism even in his less successful films and the animal sexuality of the gardener towards the governess is one of the most dynamic things about Winner's film. UK TV viewers used to seeing Beacham as the staple of such programmes as Tenko and Dynasty will raise eyebrows as she gamely submits her buxom charms to Quint's hands  at one point hogtied and squirming in an impromptu Edwardian bondage session. Jessell despises herself and yet craves what Quint brings during his nocturnal visits. These scenes verging on the embarrassing for viewer and participants alike at least provide  vivid entertainment sadly missing elsewhere. Unfortunately such adult titillation also disrupts the progress of a film which required the screw turned of increasing tension and menace and proves a distraction from the growing relationship between Miles and Flora the children at the centre of the film.As rounded dramatic characters the youngsters have a hard job convincing the audience. Alternating between school children's pranks nascent sexuality nave heroworship and psychosis it is difficult to discover an internal consistency in their actions. The gauche imitations by Miles and Flora of Quint's sexual performance including a 'bondage' session of their own and Miles' announcement to the shocked interrogation of Mrs Grose afterwards I'll tell you exactly what we have been doing. We have been doing sex! are an amusing diversion. And this imitation of the adult affair they have witnessed serves as an ironic parody of their elders  if it hardly prepares the viewer for their final violent actions. Accordingly our interest is reduced and dramatic curiosity falls readily upon the relationship between Quint and Jessell rather than the peculiar wards they shepherd. Winner clearly thought so too for his camera dwells too much on those headline adult liaisons for the film's good. This 'false' emphasis no matter how good sex is for the box office means that when the children ultimately take matters into their own hands events seem rather lame their motivation too unconvincing and bald. The paramount influence of Quint of course goes some way to explaining the kids' increasingly odd behaviour notably his announcement taken on faith that if you love someone sometimes you really want to kill them. But there is a world of difference between his power games with Miss Jessell and the children's attempts to retain them both in their service as the dead have nowhere to go. A handful more scenes of the children talking through their convictions together would have gone a long way. Outside of problems with characterisation many of the film's faults can be place at the door of Winner.

	onyx:emotionText "Conceived as a prequel to The Turn Of The Screw Winner's film is a curious vehicle for Marlon Brando as well as a example of a failed attempt to film gothic period drama satisfactorily. Brando plays Peter Quint the sexually aggressive former valet now locum gardener at Bly House an English county estate. Bly is run jointly by housekeeper  Mrs Grose Thora Hird and a governess the repressed Miss Jessell Stephanie Beacham. The only other inhabitants of this curious domicile are two children Miles Christopher Ellis and Flora Verna Harvey nominally the wards of the absent Master of the House a splendid Harry Andrews obliged with their care after the death of their parents in an overseas automobile accident. The children regard Quint as something of a surrogate father and feel that they can ingratiate themselves by manipulating his private life notably his intense relationship with Miss Jessell. Jack Claytons The Innocents 1962 is the closest point of reference for Winner's effort as the earlier film is the definitive telling of the Henry James tale the events of which spring from this. Presumably the appointment and despatch to Bly of the unnamed new governess at the film's end is that of Miss Giddings the character played by Deborah Kerr. But where Clayton's film was completely successful in transmitting a feeling of supernatural unease and psychological dread Winner's hamfisted approach to his material comes across as almost entirely without atmosphere or charm. James' characters may act out their allotted parts in The Nightcomers but its presentation of situation and personality veers uncertainly between the childhood gormlessness of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the compulsions of Lady Chatterley's Lover as much as evoking any genuine  atmosphere of psychic foreboding. Perhaps such foreboding was the last thing the director had in mind. Brando of course regularly exudes magnetism even in his less successful films and the animal sexuality of the gardener towards the governess is one of the most dynamic things about Winner's film. UK TV viewers used to seeing Beacham as the staple of such programmes as Tenko and Dynasty will raise eyebrows as she gamely submits her buxom charms to Quint's hands  at one point hogtied and squirming in an impromptu Edwardian bondage session. Jessell despises herself and yet craves what Quint brings during his nocturnal visits. These scenes verging on the embarrassing for viewer and participants alike at least provide  vivid entertainment sadly missing elsewhere. Unfortunately such adult titillation also disrupts the progress of a film which required the screw turned of increasing tension and menace and proves a distraction from the growing relationship between Miles and Flora the children at the centre of the film.As rounded dramatic characters the youngsters have a hard job convincing the audience. Alternating between school children's pranks nascent sexuality nave heroworship and psychosis it is difficult to discover an internal consistency in their actions. The gauche imitations by Miles and Flora of Quint's sexual performance including a 'bondage' session of their own and Miles' announcement to the shocked interrogation of Mrs Grose afterwards I'll tell you exactly what we have been doing. We have been doing sex! are an amusing diversion. And this imitation of the adult affair they have witnessed serves as an ironic parody of their elders  if it hardly prepares the viewer for their final violent actions. Accordingly our interest is reduced and dramatic curiosity falls readily upon the relationship between Quint and Jessell rather than the peculiar wards they shepherd. Winner clearly thought so too for his camera dwells too much on those headline adult liaisons for the film's good. This 'false' emphasis no matter how good sex is for the box office means that when the children ultimately take matters into their own hands events seem rather lame their motivation too unconvincing and bald. The paramount influence of Quint of course goes some way to explaining the kids' increasingly odd behaviour notably his announcement taken on faith that if you love someone sometimes you really want to kill them. But there is a world of difference between his power games with Miss Jessell and the children's attempts to retain them both in their service as the dead have nowhere to go. A handful more scenes of the children talking through their convictions together would have gone a long way. Outside of problems with characterisation many of the film's faults can be place at the door of Winner. Never the subtlest of directors he was an odd choice to helm a project of this sort which required emotional tact and physical suggestion. Although the location filming at 'Bly' is effective enough Winner's weakness for jerky zooms for exploitation his stiff direction of actors only the methodtrained Brando seems at ease even with a faintly ludicrous Irish accent as well as an overinsistent score provided by the normally excellent Jerry Fielding are distracting.

Or will they develop into adults ever? Fascinating story. Brando was perfect for this story and I am sure his own psychology included such behaviors.Prick ones body to find ones soul? The levels of pain and pleasure become blurred as in real SM experiences....one does not know where one begins and the other ends. A valid depiction of the pain pleasure paradox is soundly explored. The audience is given a crash course to SM which enables the intelligent observer to taste and enmesh the aspects of this paradox. All feelings are permitted to be touched. I am sure it will be unsettling emotionally far after one leaves the theater or the click of your remote. Its excellent theater and well told with a master teacher in Brando as your spiritual guide.";

The director accidentally uses the zoom lens too much it must have been an accident there's no other explanation and the music is a bit broad too but it's worth it for Brando.

	schema:reviewBody "Marlon Brando's sole horror movie vehicle is a disturbing eerie and underrated affair that deserves more praise. Intended as a prequel of sorts to Henry James' The Turn of the Screw it is often said to be a followup film to Jack Clayton's mesmerizing adaptation of the latter The Innocents. Thus people wanting to see The Innocents all over again are bound to be disappointed. For starters The Nightcomers is not even a ghost story to begin with and can be described as being more of a dark drama with horror overtones with the underlying theme of sexualrepression being one of the few things the two films share. Although Miles and Flora kill the two so they can at least be together even if after death the matter is not dealt in a supernatural way at all. In fact considering how there are no ghostly manifestations of their dead parents leaves the audience to believe well at least those unfamiliar with either James' or Clayton's work that they were simply insane in a way more akin to Carlos Henrique Taboada's Veneno para las Hadas. The final scenes gives a sense of hoplesness rather than the creepybutmacabre tone some might expect. As it is often said Brando's performance as Peter Quint is brilliant and should be compared to his similar work in Last Tango in Paris the following year. In fact I wonder if Bertolucci ever saw this film before casting Brando as Paul in Last Tango.... In this one he manages to convey sympathy and melancholy for his rather brute and vicious character. Stephanie Beacham holds up extremely well against Brando and they a strangely effective chemistry between them. Thora Hird is delightfully annoying as intended and the younger actors who play Miles and Flora are quite convincing as well for their young age and come across as being quite creepy. Tame though they are the scenes where the two start imitating Quint and Jessell are quite disturbing to say the least. The film also benefits heavily from a bittersweet sense of humor and witty oneliners that thankfully does not ruin the omnipresent sense of dread and sexual frustration only enhance it. The Nightcomers has been often criticized for being dullishly directed which surprises me since the whole thing was anything but dull in my view. Surely some scenes go on for a bit too long but it's not like they ruin the film. Winner goes for a more naturalistic approach as opposed to Clayton's more nightmarish otherworldly take and us such the film is a real marvel to look at. Winner makes perfect use of the locations at the British countryside landing a lot to the thick brooding atmosphere. The musical score though not particularly memorable fits perfectly with it's beautiful imagery. Overall while not a perfect film The Nightcomers has plenty to offer to the openminded. Just do not expect anything close to The Innocents or Winner's later more hardcore horror entry The Sentinel. 910".

This was made before the Godfather.If you only saw On the Waterfront A Streetcar Named Desire or the Godfather you would think that he was a great actor. I saw those films first and wanted to see more of his movies. However each movie of his reveals more flaws than any perceived greatness.In this film the Nightcomers Brando is either overacting or not acting at all. He stands around and broods as the camera pans. I don't care about Quint who is a bum but stays employed because the new guardian of the children doesn't care. Guess what? Neither do I. The children and the rest of the supporting cast are plastic toys used poorly by Michael Winner the director. A great actor could have made something of this script and a great director could have made something of this pathetic actor. Neither showed up for the shoot. There is good material for a film but everyone handles their roles so poorly that the film rambles on without a point. It is extremely boring.Whether or not it was a prequel or not does not matter at all. Brando is saying I'm Brando doing Brando acting and you're going to like it because I'm Brando dit. I keep thinking of Eddie Murphy as Gumby when I watch Brando.My advice Watch a Bogart film. Bogart is enjoyable to watch even if the film is awful. Or watch the Godfather On the Waterfront or A Streetcar Named Desire. Every other film of Brando's irritated me to no end.".

This prequel to The Innocents the film version of the Gothic Henry James novel The Turn of the Screw brilliantly answers the question of how Flora and Miles came to be possessed by the spirits of the gardener and governess and it does so in a nonmystical way that sits side by side with the mystical notions of it which it cleverly dismisses. This act explains the underlying nature of Henry James's sideways attack on the conventions of his day and strips The Innocents of its realitysubstitute. Such substitutes will never be enough for us to live life in reality. Last Tango In Paris was a kind of bookend to this but Tango was far too literal.

Brando is excellent in this but in spite of his efforts the movie still fails to ignite.The story takes its inspiration if that's the right word from the Henry James classic The Turn of the Screw. It explores the reasons behind the childrens' disturbed behaviour in that literary masterpiece concluding that they were affected by witnessing sexual games and acts of aggression in their infancy. The action takes place at a Victorian mansion where the two children finds themselves drawn to the gardener Brando a strange philosophising peasant who casts an evil aura over the entire household. In one particularly distasteful scene Brando demonstrates his cruelty by showing the children how to explode a frog. In another he is seen performing sexual bondage upon the governess of the house Stephanie Beacham.There was probably a worthy film somewhere amidst this material. The central idea is interesting and the performances are interesting too. The key problem is Winner's fussiness as a director constantly distracting the audience with his zooms and closeups and bizarre camera angles. This is a film ripe for the remake factory. Just as long as Michael Winner doesn't get his hands on it again.".

If someone becomes aroused during SM activities those depicted in the movie are rather tame activities at that after all it is a movie it has nothing to do with mindless harming of animals which are innocent and helpless.

If you like me respect the still controversial Last Tango as a classic the movie will be even more painful. Brando handsome but already gaining girth was forced by Bertoluchi to drop twenty pounds we can see why.

I had to use subtitles to figure out what he was saying most of the time.The film is a prequel to the Henry James novel Turn of the Screw which I have not read. It is set in a remote country house occupied by a couple of orphaned kids their governess Stephanie Beacham a senior governess Thora Hird and the manor's caretaker Brando. The governess and the caretaker are locked in a sadistic love affair which soon begins to alter the behavior of the orphaned children who look up to them for guidance.I loved the setting and the characters. It is one of those films where the characters almost seem to be locked together in some place in this case a huge country house with large grounds and they soon begin to interact with each other in mysterious ways. It is a film of strange relationships. Not just between Brando and Beacham but also between the two orphaned kids whose awakening sexuality leads to incestuous behavior. Quinn the caretaker is witty and charming but also derives pleasure from beating up women. The governess is needy and lays in bed every night waiting for Quinn. The two orphans are confused and in the absence of proper role models begin to develop dangerous ideas about sex love and death. The senior governess is a broken moral compass to these strange creatures who find ways to trick her.The film would look great on BluRay as the country house and grounds are beautiful in the mild haze of the winter fog. Brando's body language is amazing. He has some of the best lines in the movie. Beacham is erotic even when she is dressed like a prude. The sweaty sex scenes between the two were overwhelming. The conservative senior governess is played by Thora Hird who fitted the role perfectly. The beautiful Verna Hervey plays the female of the orphaned children. Christopher Ellis is her brother. Both of them looked sweet and innocent.It is one of those relatively unknown British gems Michael. I would recommend it to fans of odd horror films with a lot of character development.Best Regards Pimpin.810".

A housekeeper takes care of the day to day operations leaving the nanny to tend to the kids. There is a groundskeeper as well played by Marlon Brando and yes he does use his Brand 'O style of acting. The master of the house wants nothing to do with anybody so he leaves to another dwelling telling the housekeeper only to contact him if someone dies basically. The film then shows the relationship of Brando and the nanny which involves sado masochistic things. The kids idolize Brando copying everything he does since he has been the only parent figure they have had but Brando has several issues.This was a good slow burning film as it develops all the characters and then the build up for Turn Of The Screw. Brando's a kinky bastard in this one probably still holding the butter from Last Tango In Paris. You even get to see a frog explode from smoking a cigar. It would have been a perfect stop smoking commercial.If you don't mind Brando talking like a wee leprechaun and the odd sex scene with ropes then you'll like this flick.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a loose prequel to the classic Henry James ghost story The Turn of the Screw which itself was successfully filmed in 1961. Of course with Michael Winner at the helm of this film it soon changes from a ghost story to something more exploitational as the director deals with a sadomasochistic relationship between the gardener and the governess that certainly WASN'T on the mind of Henry James when he wrote his story! In today's society where socalled documentaries on everything from sexual perversion to sex changes are ten a penny on every television channel these sexual scenes have lost their power to shock the sight of Stephanie Beacham hogtied in the bedroom isn't perhaps as outrageous as it would have been in the 1970s.Elsewhere the film plods along slowly with a lack of pace and lack of action. Much of the screen time is given to the rather unsavoury character Quint which is unsurprising considering that he's played by Marlon Brando. Brando gives one of those offbeat anythinggoes type performances that I personally hate Johnny Depp's turn in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is the most recent example of this type of acting. Adopting a surprisingly good Irish accent Brando boozes sleeps and acts odd throughout the film most memorable in the opening scenes where he causes a frog to explode after making it smoke a cigarette!The film has some good turns from the adult performers all of whom are to be seen in rather more genteel fare than what's on offer here. Stephanie Beacham who resolutely refused to disrobe in many of her other films shows that she's not camera shy here regularly stripping off for the torrid sex scenes. Harry Andrews pops up in a few scenes to lend some quiet dignity to the proceedings while the biggest surprise of all comes from the appearance of Thora Hird as the ghastly housekeeper with maggots in her hair. I'm somebody who knows Hird solely from her role in the longrunning sitcom LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE so her appearance here seems quite extraordinary! Sadly the film is let down by some diabolical acting from the 'child' actors  one of whom Verna Harvey was actually 20 when this was filmed! Christopher Ellis is particularly bad and his voice really grates on the viewer's nerves. Winner seems to be a somewhat slapdash director filming bland boring shots at one moment and overusing the zoom lens at another. He fails to insert any muchneeded energy or excitement into the proceedings even at the shocking climax which plays out as staidly as the rest of the film. Still the Cambridgeshire locations are nice to look at  almost as nice as Beacham's ample charms  which is something I suppose.".

The film is from the late fifties so there is no big special effects like saving private Ryan. Also the movie is not showing a major and historical battle with a lot of soldiers and tanks fighting between explosions. In factthe war scenes can be seen only in the last half hour.

I thought I was the only one. Other people also think that Spielberg has seen this movie Saving Private Ryan is compiled of some other war movies of which Die Brucke is one. Bernard Wicki succeeded in putting together many elements into one story and that on a low budget basis. Thats brilliant. The contrast between individual and collective personal relations and high commands young idealism and adult realism continuity the river and temporary life and death rationality and madness. I would especially point to a very important element. The use of the Hitler Jugend was not only a wellorganised last attempt to turn the tide but became also a myth in german society in 1945 and everybody in Germany interprets it in hisher own way. The young boys interpret this rumor in a very personal way defend their own bridge! But defending against who? The enemy the Americans have no myths in this movie. They are abstract. They have reconnaissance flights and small heavy armed patrols acting on their own rational thinking to secure bridges. These contrasting troops clash at the bridge. And what happens? On both sides roughly the same amount of men die. The heavy armed Americans got to withdraw !. But in the end the german boy kills the german soldier who has to blow up the bridge. Who is the enemy here? The withdrawing American patrol or the Wehrmacht? This is a brilliant moment in the movie. Due to the boys the bridge remains intact so the Americans have the advantage. Yes indeed the boys defended their bridge against the Wehrmacht. Wicki learns us that myths will contribute to your own defeat. One should act on personal judgment based on facts. When the American soldiers shouts 'Kintergarten!' he is just one of the adults then not a soldier.From a story tellers point of view switches like these makes the film really unique. And from a military point of view the film is right and telling. And one should speak  German. Translation is very difficult. Language is very important in this movie.I have also to say that Die Brucke and Das Boot are the best war movies. In both movies it is shown that rational decisions by individuals conflicted with the myths andor stupid commands from the leaders. Explaining defeat gives better movies than showing victory. Also a good lesson to know in these days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made in 1959 The Bridge is one of the few films from the former West Germany that squarely faces the theme of Nazi defeat.  It is a courageous work where content is all important so much so that it hardly matters that the direction is rather limp and pedestrian and the acting somewhat less than impressive.  It is an elegy to lost youth concluding with a caption that vents such anger through the irony of understatement that it earns without question a rightful place among the most seriously committed of antiwar films.  The setting is an unspecified small town in Germany where to begin with apart from a bomb dropped in the river and conversations about hardship and shortages the war seems far more than a distant rumble away.  We follow a group of seven 15 year old boys at school and play until the time when the rapidly approaching American front necessitates their call up and hasty military training.  As the military front creeps ever closer they are given the role of defending a bridge over a river the wisdom of which is seriously questioned by several of their superior offices but which they eagerly take on in the spirit of boyhood heroism combined with what one can well imagine to be the ideology instilled into them by past experience of the Hitler Youth.  The terrible last half hour in which their baptism by fire is recorded in graphic detail through the stages of excitement terror and death is gruelling to watch the more so because the youth of the sufferers generates so much anger at such waste and loss.  I would not for one moment claim the The Bridge is in the same league as Kubrick's Paths of Glory Helma SandersBrahms's Germany Pale Mother or Klimov's Come and See  Bernhard Wicki is a lesser director who never quite succeeds in making each of the seven protagonists a memorable character  but nevertheless he manages convincingly to flesh out in dramatic form the terrible reality behind that awesome newsreel footage of Hitler encouraging boy troops amid the rubble of Berlin.  The Bridge brings home more than most films the madness of it all.".

It actually took me quite some time to find it but I'm very glad I was finally able to see it.Since this movie is old and seemingly all but forgotten I have little knowledge about the making of it the writer and director's background or anything else besides the film itself and the comments on this page.With that in mind I can say that I was fascinated with this film and was moved and disturbed by its conclusion.  Yes I agree with someone's comments below that there is not much evidence in the movie that the war is humiliatingly flattening Germany.  However I do believe that there were some small town areas that escaped the bombs and were able to survive from the farmer's produce.  What is probably least authentic about the movie is the absence of refugees although they are mentioned and the boys' lack of serious HitlerYouth indoctrinationthey do believe in the third reich however they never wear HJ uniforms or go to meetings.  The Hitler Youth were fanatically loyal to the Nazis and became the main menace to the allies in the closing months of the war.The main theme of this movie is the pure waste of Germany's youth by the Nazis.  That is the main difference between the closing sequence in this movie and the one in Saving Private Ryan.  These boys died for nothing. The boys that died in this film were like thousands of others killed in this warbrainwashed youth fighting and dying to prolong the Third Reich and Hitler's worthless life for a few more weeks.  This is a very interesting movie for today's American viewers.  Although it was made about 15 years after the war it still has an aged foreign look and feel to it and the war has to have been recent in the filmmaker's minds.  It is also interesting to see the Americans portrayed as the enemy.  They are treated in the same fashion that American filmmakers usually depict their enemies.  The movie will still have everyone sad for these forgotten abandoned boys.  I felt particularly sad for the boy strafed by the plane.  Grade B".

	schema:headline " Coming of Age Playing War";
	schema:reviewBody "A couple of days before the end of World War II seven sixteen yearold German boys of a small village are recruited for military service. The idealistic Hans Scholten Folker Bohnet Albert Mutz Fritz Wepper Walter Forst Michael Hinz Jurgen Borchert Frank Glaubrecht Karl Horber Karl Michael Balzer Klaus Hager Volker Lechtenbrink and Sigi Bernhard Gnther Hoffmann join the army on 26 April 1945 with great expectations and enthusiasm to defend their motherland Germany in the front against the will of their parents. Their English teacher Stern Wolfgang Stumpf unsuccessfully tries to convince Commander Frhlich Heinz Spitzner to refuse the enlistment of the youngsters. After one day training the soldiers are summoned to the front but the Commander of the 463rd Battalion of the 3rd Company assigns Sergeant Heilmann Gnter Pfitzmann to stay with the rookies protecting a useless bridge in their village in order to spare the boys. However in the chaos of the imminent defeat with German soldiers fleeing from the American troops Heilmann is murdered and the boys defend the small bridge with their lives on 27 April 1945.Die Brcke is another powerful and impressive German film about coming of age in times or war. This antiwar movie probably reflects the thoughts of the brainwashed youngsters by the Nazi ideology and propaganda in the 40's and is heartbreaking to see sixteen yearold boys playing war like a game and without awareness of the seriousness of the situation. Being a father it is also very sad to see the powerless widows and mothers trying to protect their enthusiastic sons that want to fight to defend their country. The realism of this dramatic movie is awesome and totally different from the approach of Hollywood movies where Germans are usually evil soldiers and the situation of the civilian population is forgotten but unfortunately it has not been released in Brazil on VHS or DVD. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Not Available".

	onyx:emotionText "A couple of days before the end of World War II seven sixteen yearold German boys of a small village are recruited for military service. The idealistic Hans Scholten Folker Bohnet Albert Mutz Fritz Wepper Walter Forst Michael Hinz Jurgen Borchert Frank Glaubrecht Karl Horber Karl Michael Balzer Klaus Hager Volker Lechtenbrink and Sigi Bernhard Gnther Hoffmann join the army on 26 April 1945 with great expectations and enthusiasm to defend their motherland Germany in the front against the will of their parents. Their English teacher Stern Wolfgang Stumpf unsuccessfully tries to convince Commander Frhlich Heinz Spitzner to refuse the enlistment of the youngsters. After one day training the soldiers are summoned to the front but the Commander of the 463rd Battalion of the 3rd Company assigns Sergeant Heilmann Gnter Pfitzmann to stay with the rookies protecting a useless bridge in their village in order to spare the boys. However in the chaos of the imminent defeat with German soldiers fleeing from the American troops Heilmann is murdered and the boys defend the small bridge with their lives on 27 April 1945.Die Brcke is another powerful and impressive German film about coming of age in times or war. This antiwar movie probably reflects the thoughts of the brainwashed youngsters by the Nazi ideology and propaganda in the 40's and is heartbreaking to see sixteen yearold boys playing war like a game and without awareness of the seriousness of the situation.

	schema:reviewBody "Bernhard Wicki's 'The Bridge 1959' was a film that I'd never heard of before. Aside from an enthusiastic blurb on the VHS case I hardly knew what it was about nor whether or not it was any good having snatched it blindly from the library shelf. What I ended up watching was one of the most outstanding WWII films I'd ever seen a harrowing uncompromising tale of the futility of war and the tragic loss of childhood life and innocence. 'The Bridge' German title 'Die Brcke' was based on Manfred Gregor's novel inspired by his own experiences as a child at war and adapted by Michael Mansfeld KarlWilhelm Vivier and director Bernhard Wicki. It almost certainly drew a lot of inspiration from Lewis Milestone's Academy Awardwinning 'All Quiet on the Western Front 1930' with both films following the doomed fates of a group of young and idealistic German teenagers though the latter of course is set during the First World War.What impressed me most about 'The Bridge' is that it dedicated a lot of time towards the children's lives before being enlisted in the army. Though I did have a bit of trouble remembering which kid was which my memory for names especially foreign ones is horrid collectively the audience really grows affectionate towards them. The quiet trivialities of their smalltown existence English classes building boats girls are contrasted strongly against the images of death and destruction that they will later witness. There was one particular scene that I thought was beyond all others. For some time the seven boys have been working with their English teacher Wolfgang Stumpf to build a small boat. During the project one child suddenly arrives declaring ecstatically they they had all received their reportin orders from the military. As the children excitedly celebrate we witness the look of pure devastation upon the teacher's face he already knows that this is the last he'll see of his young and bright students.The film is set in the closing months of World War Two with Germany at its knees and waiting for defeat. Amid the boys' petty daytoday difficulties this doesn't seem to worry them at all and they greet the approaching front with great anticipation. Following their first day in the army the entire infantry force is ordered to march out and greet the forthcoming Allied army. It is an act of sheer desperation and in order to spare the newlyenlisted recruits the seven boys are posted at a small concrete bridge just on the outskirts of their own town. This particular crossing is strategically insignificant and the commanders plan to demolish it as soon as the Americans arrive but the boys are not privy to this information. When indeed the Americans do reach the bridge in a trio of tanks the seven young recruits launch a full offensive a tragedy of misguided courage that results in the death of all but one.Especially considering the year in which it was made the battle sequences of 'The Bridge' are really quite graphic and if you think that Stanley Kubrick pulled no punches in 'Paths of Glory 1957' you ain't seen nothing yet! One by one the innocent sixteenyearolds are cut down by the confused American soldiers. The young Germans put up an admirable fight considering the circumstances but it's such a bitter waste of life that you can only feel disgust and anger that such a thing could be allowed to happen. In one particularly brutal scene one of the inexperienced boys tries to fire a Panzerfaust an antitank weapon and the hapless elderly civilian behind him in struck in the face by the backblast. The story ends without any sense of resolution as the sole remaining recruit  after have shot his own officer in the back to prevent the allimportant bridge from being demolished  retreats from the carnage and the small insignificant structure diminishes into the mist.".

It is kind of a short retelling of All Quiet on Western Front retold under the conditions of the last days of WWII in a small German City where a understanding Commander puts the young boys that are given to him for reinforcement but are more of a burden untrained and unfit to 2nd line duty guarding a useless bridge that is supposed to be blown up anyway. After their corporal is killed by the military police and they are left to themselves they start a bloody battle against the advancing American Army blowing up a tank and killing GIs in the useless battle which is actually happening in their immediate neighborhood. And naturally they get killed as well leaving only 2 desperate survivors on their side. In a final blast of desperation they even shoot and drive away the pioneers arriving to blow up the symbol of the useless fight. Most impressive  The GI being killed with his guts wrapping out after he yells to the Kindergarten to go home and the mortal bravery of the smallest boy who will not hit the deck for an arriving Pursuit Fighter strafing him after he was laughed a coward for ducking needlessly the first time.

They are a mixture of real innocence and innocence trying to fill the role of men since everyman over 16 is at the front. Despite the efforts of their teacher and their company C.O. to spare them death on the front  they are finally crushed not only by American tanks but their own idealism and an uncaring military machine.

And he was absolutely right. This shows with the ferocity of few others how battle can destroy people lives families. The chaos of it is depicted perfectly. Plot and script in general is marvelous. The story doesn't span a long period of time but the impressions are strong nonetheless. There is an incredible level of detail and in 100 minutes this tells you an immense amount more than you would normally expect in such little time. The sheer authenticity is amazing and it is partially due to the fact that this was made about fifteen years after WWII ended by Germansyou do get the most out of this if you know a lot about them during the time it takes place and in their country and native tongue. Things remained relatively fresh in the memories and it's astounding that this could be made with the wounds still open. We follow a group of kids enrolling in Hitlerjugend. I won't reveal anything else. The production values leave nothing to be desired. Dialog is wellwritten and delivered with compelling sincerity. The acting is flawless every single performance is powerful. Characters are credible and consistent. This has extraordinarily high realism. On that I suppose one could complain about the early scenesand their lack of tension as at least one reviewer does however apart from that it's invariably spoton both physically and psychologically speaking. Also this has excellent suspense intensity and drama. Effects in this are almost exclusively convincing. There is bloody violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend it to any fan of antiwar films. Find it if you can. 1010".

	schema:headline " WELCOME EXCEPTION TO OTHER 50'S GERMAN WW2 FILMS";
	schema:reviewBody "Until recently I thought that the impact as antiwar film of  Die Brcke was far greater than that of any other antiwar film. This was from memory not having seen the film  for over 15 years. Recent reseeing of the film did not convince me entirely anymore though it is still to be preferred to films like Stalingrad or Saving Private Ryan.Situated within the German WW2 cinema of the 50's starting with 0815 to Hunde wollt ihr ewig leben of 1958 the film surely is an exception in its honesty and wellmeant premise. But as Wicki said in interviews and what clearly is stressed in the film not war itself is the subject the propagandist influence on youth and I say from any regimegovernment for that matter is the main subject. The influence of the older generation who believe in stupid ideals makes the youth stupid idealists. Wicki shows a number of precisely defined examples. The boy whose parents believe in Prussian military ideals he believes what his father says.All boys are military idealists even before they are drafted indeed they can not wait to be drafted. As the film starts they are 16 years of age but already they have undergone Vormilitrische Erziehung premilitary education in earlier years. Whether they have got this as member of the Hitler youth or otherwise is not clear and may not be important. The fact is that from early youth on they are educated to be a soldier and thus can be employed as soldier from day one they are drafted. They are educated in the believe that all is well when done in the name of Fhrer Volk Vaterland. Thus not the young soldiers are to blame but the parents the older generation the political system.To wind up this is the main message Wicki has to tell and he is good at it. War itself is never the main subject and only takes about 13 of the film. Oh yes he does show how horrible it can be in very impressive scenes. Wicki does show that war is not a game of cowboys and indians meant for boys of 16. But does he ever show that an offensive war is to be discarded at all? It seems to me that he only shows the ridiculousness of the last days of the war when German HQ refused to give up and employed male youth as soldiers. I also wonder whether the film should have included the war scenes at all would it not have been a stronger film if Wicki would have elaborated the 23 drama into a complete drama?Wicki's direction of this his first feature is very good and in general he made a tight drama and sad to say is still his only really good film. But the film is alas occasionally marred by some bad melodramatic acting by some of the young actors and also by some inappropriate visavis the realism melodramatic turns in the script. The reaction of Karl to the relationship of his father with Barbara is logic but executed in a banal way. And whether an American soldier would be so kind to plea seize fire without carrying a weapon is very questionable it probably should have been a dramatic turn but it does not work at all.Great cinematography by Gerd von Bonin who captures the right realistic atmosphere. Certainly the film is recommended viewing. One other unintended thing the film achieved was that after this one WW2 would not be a subject for the German cinema anymore for a long time. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning spoilers.This is one of those movies you find late at night just before you want to go to bed just idly zapping through the channels on your TVset and then just get gripped by it and stay up two hours longer than you wanted to because you'll regret not having seen the rest of it. It's the last days of WWII and Germany is being overrun by the allies from all sides. A group of boys they aren't even teenagers yet in a small german village are drafted for the Volkssturm a last resort german people's army composed mostly of elderly men and young boys and teenagers. The movie follows them in their preparations for a war which in their minds still remains vague and far away. Their innocence and childlike manners are in macabre contrast to the death that awaits them much sooner in fact than anyone of them expects. When their veteran Sergeant commands them to take up defensive positions at a bridge just outside their village it is supposed to be a practice run. But instead they are thrown into combat by the sudden advance of allied forces and without any help from experienced soldiers these children now face American tanks which will turn them either into men or put them in their graves...Perhaps one of the very best and clear examples of what happens when innocent people are thrown into the midst of total war. Also a rare example of a quality German warmovie. Gripping and honest no fancy heroism good action scenes that stand up to the test of time good acting all in all a very good film. Highly recommended.".

The whole film is to be highly recommended but there is one sequence that stands out SPOILERS AHEAD Trucks with hundreds of frightened wounded German soldiers pass the bridge. They desperately try to stay ahead of the American tanks who follow them. You can tell from their faces what they have experienced on the front. They just want the war to be over. Our seven teen soldiers  fanatic and faithful as they have learned it in the Hitler Youth  just can't understand what's going on. No one bothers about them so they are left for good on the bridge. And then they can hear the tanks. For some minutes the tanks can only be heard what creates an incredible suspense.One former comment criticized the quiet life in this town in the first half of the movie. I think this to be quite realistic. The town that is portrayed seems to have 10 maybe 20000 inhabitants. Towns like this were not necessarily destroyed by bombs even in 1945. In some rural areas life went on daybyday almost like in peace times.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard not to like Big Daddy though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of the comic actor.  For although this film has raised the hackles of a number of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive parenting the film is in reality far more softhearted than hardedged.  Actually this seems to be probably the wisest direction for Sandler to go in at the moment because as an actor he conveys an aura of genuine likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona.  Big Daddy might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift but Sandler's deadpan portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibilityladen fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.Sandler portrays a 30something loser living in South Manhattan who has been milking a minor foot injury to the tune of a 200000 court settlement and whose life consequently consists of miniscule employment a general lack of direction and a girlfriend who's ready to move on to an older man with a 5year plan.  When a little boy suddenly shows up on his doorstep the hitherto unknown son of a friend of his Sandler decides to temporarily take him under his wing in the hopes of winning his girlfriend back.  Thus a man with almost no resources of adult maturity attempts to instill skewed life lessons into a willing highly impressionable young mind.  This leads to Sandler's teaching the boy to indulge in predictable but surprisingly timid antisocial behavior such as urinating on public buildings staying up late tripping unsuspecting rollerbladers etc.  The film is not always at its peak of creative freshness at such times but Sandler's lowkey cynicism provides some humor.As Sandler grows to care for his tot and the inevitable forces array themselves against him to take the child away the film veers off in the direction of sappiness and maudlin tearjerking.  One may be moved at times but one also craves the satirical sharpness and bite that a more courageous screenplay might have provided.The movie does display an enlightened view of gays though Hollywood has yet to get past the point where gay characters can do more than merely twinkle at each other but it loses points for its rather nasty tone towards old people.  Still any film designed to send Dr. Laura into spasms of psychoanalytical outrage should be respected and honored.Overall Big Daddy is a movie that if it had taken more audacious pathways might have been a firstrate comedy.  As it is it provides numerous chuckles and a cuddly warm feeling  and that given the state of much of big screen comedy these days is about all we dare allow ourselves to expect.".

	schema:reviewBody "While all of the somphoric preteens will be giggling silly at the childish potty jokes shown in AUSTIN POWERS 2 the real adults will be laughing their heads off in a much funnier film called BIG DADDY.  This is Sandler's sixth starring role feature and it seems that the sixth time is a splending charm.  This is Sandler's best work yet! Now in case you are wondering I enjoyed both HAPPY GILMORE and THE WEDDING SINGER.  But there's something charming and wonderful on why I enjoyed BIG DADDY more.  Perhaps it's seeing a overgrown kid taking care of a little boy.  Or it's Sandler mixing his in your face attitude that he gave in HAPPY GILMORE with his softspot attiude from THE WEDDING SINGER.  Whatever it is it works and it works very well! The simple plot of BIG DADDY is a 5 year old child is left on the doorstep of Sandler's apartment.  It turns out to be the child of his roommate Jon Stewart who's on his way to China for a legal case.  So what is Sandler to do but to give him to the child protective service.  But it's a holiday and they are closed so Sandler keeps him for a day then another day and... well you get the picture. But the plot doesn't matter much with this film it's the laughs and you do get plenty of those.  But you also get a wonderful supporting cast. There's a good support from Jon Stewart the always wonderful and beautiful Joey Lauren Adams Leslie Mann and Kristy Swanson the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And what's a Sandler movie like if you don't have his usual character actor friends in small comic roles Rob Schrieder Steve Buscemi Josh Mostel Allen Covert the caddy from HAPPY GILMORE who was also the limo driver friend in THE WEDDING SINGER and Jonathan Loughran the lazyeyed football player in THE WATERBOY.  There's even a funny cameo role by director Dennis Dugan as the man who refuses to answer the door on Halloween while Sandler is taking his adopted son trick or treating. This film was a lot more funnier that THE WATERBOY it was also funnier than THE WEDDING SINGER and HAPPY GILMORE.  It was believe it or not more touching.  You can understand why Sandler doesn't want to let this boy go since he reminds him so much of himself.  And Sandler sees that being a father figure isn't only fun but it redeems himself from the lost of his girlfriend. I have to give both Sandler and director Dennis Dugan the same director of HAPPY GILMORE a round of applause.  They teamed up for a comedy that is not only successful but will make A LOT of money. Sandler and Dugan are the best comediandirector team since the late John Belushi and John Landis.  I'm just hoping that they will continue to do films together in the futrue.  Until then take your date your friends or heck just go alone and enjoy one of the funniest comedies next to ANALYZE THIS ELECTION and RUSHMORE of this year. This is a wonderful treat!  12 out of five".

	schema:reviewBody "Adam Sandler The Waterboy The Wedding Singer has pulled off another hit with Big Daddy.  Sandler stars as a lazy lawschool graduate who won't take the bar exam.  One day when his roommate goes on a business trip to China a child arrives at the day with a note claiming to be his roommate's son. Sandler takes the kid for a day and after having a good time decides to keep him to impress his girlfriend who doesn't think he's trying to grow up. His girlfriend dumps him and he's stuck with the kid.  Not surprisingly Sandler isn't a good father but soon he bonds with the kid and he learns how to be a good father.  This might sound like a cheesy feelgood film but with Sandler the humor is kind of lowbrow but often hilarious.  The film does also offer a few touching scenes between Sandler and the kid.  Sandler's performance was very funny but reminded me a little of Jim Carrey's performance in Liar Liar.  Liar Liar if you have seen it was a regular Carrey comedy but offered a couple of serious scenes which Carrey pulled off well.  Carrey then went on to do The Truman Show and win a Golden Globe. Sandler also has a couple of serious scenes which he nails well.  I'm not suggesting that Sandler is going to become a great actor like Carrey seems headed for but he may have the skill to do it if he wants.  Leslie Mann George of the Jungle The Cable Guy and Joey Lauren Adams Chasing Amy A Cool Dry Place are both good as sisters.  Jon Stewart The Faculty Playing by Heart is solid as Sandler's roommate.  Twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse are convincing as the kid.  Finally two favorites of mine have very funny supporting roles.  Steve Buscemi Reservoir Dogs Armageddon is good as a homeless friend of Sandler's.  And Rob Schneider Judge Dredd Knock Off is hilarious as an immigrant delivery man who is good friends with Sandler. Highly Recommended.".

Like at the very end at the court hearing when everyone grabbed their cell phones and called their dads while sobbing  that's just utter crap. Apart from that I don't like Adam Sandler which I concede is a personal bias. Nonetheless it HAD some witty sequences although most of them did not seem genuine and are unlikely to occur in reality. I mean the basic approach was generally fairly good but some scenes are simply too farfetched. There are much more substantial movies out so we definitely needn't praise this one too high. It would have been much better if the storyline had a stronger emphasis on the interpersonal burdens and struggles and less on the comedy aspect. Here again Adam Sandler was just the wrong actor to aim at such a transformation.".

But give Adam Sandler credit He took a decent budget backing from a historic studio and a couple of wellrespected costars and managed to come up with the most disgusting stupid and unwatchable piece of cinematic garbage this summer.Big Daddy is a profanitylaced bodilyfluidsoaked wasteland of a film with no redeeming value whatsoever. Instead of thoughtful amusing or touching scenes and dialogue the viewer is treated to an endless display of urine and vomit cascading forth from the confused little lad at the centre of the proceedings. Basically this film is a ruder There's Something About Mary only this time the butt of jokes is five years old. There's something more than a little disturbing about masses of adults and teenagers paying 8.50 to laugh at a little boy vomiting.The only reason this film got made of course is because it serves a higher purpose as 90 minute recruiting video for Hooters restaurants. The Hooter Girl and big bust jokes are funny for the first five minutes but quickly grow tiresome as Sandler uses them over and over.Sadly wasted in this film are the significant talents of Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi both of whom perform admirably in minor roles. Unfortunately the two are onscreen far too briefly to provide any sort of counterweight to the sorry mess created by Sandler and costars Joey Lauren Adams and Leslie Mann. Adams who possesses a voice reminiscent of a hysterical toddler tries desperately to be lovable but falls far short. Mann's Corrinewhom we are supposed to believe worked her way through medical school as a Hooter Girlprovided the greatest levity of the evening. Her character is far too malicious to have ever succeeded as a waitress and a Hooters job at that? I've seen a bigger bustline on a Bulgarian gymnast.Whatever creativity and humanity Adam Sandler had in films like The Wedding Singer has been completely lost.

After all Sandler's usual manchild character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend Kristy Swanson who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's Jon Stewart son Julian portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse. Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time. Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket.".

Suffice it to say that Sandler spends the movie showing the audience what a big star he is degrading women at every possible step of the way spouting his customary crude humor in shallow stupid remarks and basically maintains a macho attitude because being Adam Sandler he can get away with it.Fortunately it blows up in his face. Sandler's characters are usually strange but they have some redeeming qualities that generally make for a fun movie. Not this time.

	schema:reviewBody "Sonny Koufax Adam Sandler is an unemployed layabout who claims that he is unable to work due to an accident he had involving a cab from 2 years ago. Sonny is a selfabsorbed individual who generally thinks of noone but himself much to the annoyance of his girlfriend. However when a 5 year old boy named Julian Cole Sprouse ends up on his doorstep Sonny claims to have adopted Julian in order to try and win back his girlfriend and prove himself worthy of her affections. Whilst Julian is in Sonny's care Sonny does some growing up himself in the midst of some rather questionable antics as a caretaker parent.The marketing for this film was always questionable the film poster shows Sandler and the boy standing in front of a door and urinating against it. In this respect it does itself no real favours as there may be many people that decide not to watch it because it looks like it's going to be crude and juvenile from the poster. In fairness this isn't completely inaccurate as there are some aspects of the film that are a bit juvenile and crude but the actual bulk of the film is quite charming and sweet and fairly enjoyable and I'm just puzzled as to why a fairly sweetnatured film was marketed so poorly. Anyway I digress...Sandler's comedy films have sometimes proved problematic because some of the characters he has portrayed have been unlikeable or unsympathetic. In Big Daddy though as things progress it becomes fairly obvious that Sonny's actually an OK person that just needed a bit of a kick up the backside. Looking after Julian gave Sonny a purpose in life and as mentioned it gave him the kick up the backside that he'd needed for the last 2 years. The chemistry between Julian and Sonny was also really good and the two of them share both funny moments and tender moments  I thought that Sonny telling Julian that wearing sunglasses meant nobody could see him was a funny idea and quite sweet as well.There are some weaknesses to this film firstly a lot of the acting here is rather mediocre although Steve Buscemi was good fun in the limited screen time that he was given. The film was also a little too light on laughs for my liking  although the warmth and charm of the picture compensate slightly for the slight lack of humour. The film also gets very soppy towards the end and I also found some of the character shifts to be a bit dubious. The script offers few surprises and is fairly predictable but I always say it doesn't matter if you know outcome B at point A as long as you generally enjoy everything in between and that pretty much sums up my feelings about this film. It's hardly Oscarworthy but it has some funny moments it has some charm and it surprised me by being better than I expected it to be.".

In this respect it does itself no real favours as there may be many people that decide not to watch it because it looks like it's going to be crude and juvenile from the poster. In fairness this isn't completely inaccurate as there are some aspects of the film that are a bit juvenile and crude but the actual bulk of the film is quite charming and sweet and fairly enjoyable and I'm just puzzled as to why a fairly sweetnatured film was marketed so poorly. Anyway I digress...Sandler's comedy films have sometimes proved problematic because some of the characters he has portrayed have been unlikeable or unsympathetic. In Big Daddy though as things progress it becomes fairly obvious that Sonny's actually an OK person that just needed a bit of a kick up the backside. Looking after Julian gave Sonny a purpose in life and as mentioned it gave him the kick up the backside that he'd needed for the last 2 years. The chemistry between Julian and Sonny was also really good and the two of them share both funny moments and tender moments  I thought that Sonny telling Julian that wearing sunglasses meant nobody could see him was a funny idea and quite sweet as well.There are some weaknesses to this film firstly a lot of the acting here is rather mediocre although Steve Buscemi was good fun in the limited screen time that he was given. The film was also a little too light on laughs for my liking  although the warmth and charm of the picture compensate slightly for the slight lack of humour. The film also gets very soppy towards the end and I also found some of the character shifts to be a bit dubious. The script offers few surprises and is fairly predictable but I always say it doesn't matter if you know outcome B at point A as long as you generally enjoy everything in between and that pretty much sums up my feelings about this film. It's hardly Oscarworthy but it has some funny moments it has some charm and it surprised me by being better than I expected it to be.";

	schema:reviewBody "The films of Adam Sandler exist as the baffling proof that humour appealing to the lowest common denominator can indeed succeed in Hollywood. His ideas of how to elicit laughs are crude to say the least coming from both verbal and physical standpoints. He always plays the main attraction who by now audiences are familiar with like a scraggly long lost uncle. Sandler's characters are usually various renditions of an overgrown child in an adult man's body acting much like the one he is charged with taking care of in Big Daddy. They are shouty to the point of being verbally abusive physically aggressive impulsive shameless womanisers parttime misogynists and in some cases like this one going nowhere slackers. I suppose that somewhere within this figure lie some more endearing everyman traits but somehow they always seem to be pushed aside for more of Sandler's trademark hit moments. The worse disparity of the two ends of this spectrum came in Click which shifted between genuine heartbreaking regret and toilet humour of the lowest kind. There was also the apparent subversion of Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love hosting the same type of character but wrapping him up in sympathy and puppy love. Sandler's stories in whatever shape form or plot usually descend into the character finding and righting his path a sort of bildungsroman for the child trapped in the adult body. In going through some variation of a life altering trial or tribulation he inevitably finds a bit of common sense and tact and the film therefore rewards him for it usually in the form of a girl. But paradoxically they also demand that Sandler not lose any of his original 'charm' that makes his characters what they are  so much so that in the epilogues he still wont't hold back on his typical oneliners. The plots of his films therefore pull off the magical trick of being able to freeze Sandler's characterisation for choice tender moments  segments where the brash loudmouth is suddenly and inexplicably exchanged for the nervous little boy as he tries to woo Layla or the more responsible parent of Julian. Of course Layla as a character is little more than a carrot on a stick a prize to be dangled in front of Sonny to coax him into getting his life together. And Joey Lauren Adams is a goddamn angel with that smile  she would be taken with a serial killer if the plot required her to. But the crux of these plots is that these moments rarely ask Sandler to take up any actual responsibility other than a few of those giftwrapped moments of sentimentality and assigned 'growth' doled out in spirited montages. When the film then tries to fall back on its humour it predictably crashes and burns. Julian portrayed by the Sprouse twins is an aggressive bundle of cuteness designed to disarm Sandler's brand of cynicism and immaturity. He mispronounces every second syllable like a character from Looney Tunes and waddles and pouts his lips just the right way so that even Sonny cannot bear but try and act like an actual parent. But Sonny is a Sandler character through and through and hardly ready to be a father so along the way Julian picks up the valuable lessons of losing with humility manners personal hygiene altruism caring for animals and treating women with respect. After Big Daddy Sandler would also start his own production company to ensure these characters survived and provide Rob Schneider with a reason to live. Despite all of these pitfalls audiences seem to like repetition and Sandler's brand of humour perhaps if only to stick around for the rare films in which he is not only funny but also genuinely likable.An alternative summary of the film Hooters Hooters Hooters Hooters Hooters. It's ironic that Sonny would bag Corinne for her former college job because he fits the profile of someone who would frequent the same fastfood joint.".

	schema:reviewBody "Big Daddy was made around the time that Adam Sandler was evolving. Having just finished The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer Sandler is back to his old self. Luckily his material was new and fresh so he was not very hated.The character of Sonny Kofax early on in the film is pretty much Adam Sandler playing Adam Sandler. He is a 32yearold law school grad who works one day a week as a tollbooth ticket taker. The rest of the time he lazes out buying worthless junk and lives off a successful lawsuit filed two years earlier. This first little bit is typical Sandler. But there's no fart jokes which make it more of a cute kind of funny. When his roommate Stewart is out of town a child named Julian Sprouse drops by with a note claiming to be his. He lies to social services saying he is his roommate and adopts him hoping it will show responsibility and maturity. When his girlfriend Swanson dumps him for a much older man Sonny tries to take the kid back. When he grows to love him he tries to fight to keep him. So we get regular Sandler progressing to a more mature version of himself. Yes there is silly toilet humour but nothing that crosses the line of stupid and unfunny. When he adopts Julian it is funny to see someone irresponsible like Adam Sandler caring for a 5yearold. He has no idea what to do. This day in age young parents are the norm. Teens always get pregnant. Since they are still kids themselves and not fully mature they have tough times raising their own. Big Daddy kind of reflects that he is immature and adopts a child. But the responsibility that he takes on makes him wake up and smell the coffee. He must discipline him as well as give him freedom. Of course it is hard to get the hang of but that is all part of parenthood and Adam Sandler adds humour to that in all the right spots. Because he got a dose of reality his love life strengthens when he falls for Layla Maloney Adams and finally becomes a successful lawyer by the end. Big Daddy offers us truly funny and clever Adam Sandler humour along with a beautiful glimpse at fatherhood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Upon finishing Big Daddy I had a feeling of optimism and disappointment at the same time. This is one of the few perfect examples showing that Adam Sandler can effectively make a drama film with some mild comedy and create a relatively passable picture but he opts out for cruder more onedimensional projects that provide little wit. This among 50 First Dates Click and Funny People can be viewed as the delightfully surprising Sandler pictures. The rest you can feel free to discard.I'm too amazed at how tolerable some of the pictures where Sandler is out of the frame are. By now most are aware of the Happy Madison regulars Sandler Rob Schneider David Spade Allen Covert Peter Dante Kevin Nealon and newcomers Kevin James and Nick Swardson. I found Happy Madison's Dickie Roberts Former Child Star and Grandma's Boy to be entertaining works if marginally forgettable but also observed how when Sandler is working as producer the end result is more often than not better. We'll see if that formula continues to thrive. I have quite a few more Happy Madison pictures to dig through.Here Sandler is actually rather capable playing the doughy manchild Sonny who is 32 works one day a week at a tollbooth and somehow still managed to snag the beautiful girlfriend. He manages to remain in stable conditions living off restitution payments from a petty vehicle accident. While Sonny's recently engaged roommate Kevin played by yes that Jon Stewart is off on business in China Sonny is greeted with a five year old named Julian the Sprouse twins on his doorstep and a written note claims that Julian came from a night of partying on Kevin's part. Unable to return home Kevin puts Sonny under the care of Julian and Sonny winds up lying to Social Services saying he is Kevin.So when Sandler's character is the parent what do you think will happen? Insubordination? Mischief? Rambunctiousness and chaos galore? Well you're right but all in a muted form. What Sonny winds up doing with the kid is rather tame and not expected from the usual Sandler schtick. There's even a hint of nice sentimentality that comes in the form of pleasantness rather than conventional schmaltz. He allows the kid to utilize options rather than orders to hopefully round him out to be a better person rather than evolve into a miserable degenerate late on in life. Ultimately the focus is more on the slapstick and the crudeness of the picture and we go from some marginally sentimental scenes to jokes about Sonny's relationship with his gay friends Covert and Dante very quickly. But even then the film never truly becomes dismal or reprehensible.There's even a love story with the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Layla Kevin's fiance's sister. She keeps the story from truly going too far into the sea of despair and is even involved in some of the film's best scenes. The one I immediately think of is the bedtime story.What ultimately stops Big Daddy dead in its tracks is formula which truly isn't taken in a way sharp enough to wholeheartedly recommend. Its mixture of slapstick and charm is impressive the performances are nice and the delivery is rarely rocky but at times the film becomes a tad too contrived incorporating textbook pieces like the inevitable courtroom scene at the end and the cute kid says naughty thing clich. For Sandler it's a step up and he may want to consider more of the impressively sassy kids films with a nice heart.Starring Adam Sandler Cole Sprouse Dylan Sprouse Joey Lauren Adams Jon Stewart Rob Schneider Leslie Mann and Steve Buscemi.

An excellent character is all that matters especially compared to the archetypical Democrat played by the worrywart responsible father the real Big Daddy.In this case it is more than just the image that has been stolen on which Sandler has built a career. Here we have a whole movie stolen down to the fawning eyes of the kid. Wouldn't be much of a crime if they worked harder at it. But it is put together in such a slapdash way that it sputters all over the place.Ted's evaluation 1 of 3  you can find something better to do with this part of your life.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing to think that at the turn of the century Adam Sandler was hyped as being on the brink of mega stardom . Even more amazingly he was at one point the world's highest paid movie star ! No doubt his loyal fans  All three of them  can reconcile themselves with being first in line to see his next blockbuster performance since no one in 2005 queues to see a Sandler movie  especially if it's released direct to video It's easy to see where Sandler went wrong . BIG DADDY has Sandler play a bit of a loser just like every other movie that has  Starring Adam Sandler  in the credits or should that be  Starring Adam Sandler because Ben Stiller turned the role down  ? . Here his girlfriend dumps him and he finds out his ex wife has died and so his infant son who he's not seen is thrust on his doorstep  but if you're expecting a heart warming tale similar to THE KID you're going to be disappointed since it's  Starring Adam Sandler  so the story takes a turn for the worse as we're treated to some very infantile humour I do feel slightly guilty for writing an overly honest review of BIG DADDY and apologies too if it's rather brief but Adam Sandler is a comedy actor I've never warmed too . I find his performances very repetitive and formulaic and this movie is no different . I will say that it's not helped by he fact that I rewatched MEET THE PARENTS a comedy that improves on multiple reviewings and stars Ben Stiller a very similar but superior comedy actor to Mr Sandler".

	schema:reviewBody "It is only after a third viewing that I dare venture some comments on this awesome film. That I was fascinated from the start was beyond doubt but its funereal tempo caused me to nod to the extent that even on a second viewing there were whole sequences I had missed. By the third attempt I feel ready.Werckmeister Harmonies is one of the great artistic challenges of our age. I cannot begin to admit that I understand it fully but I do know that it carries those haunting resonances remaining long after the final shot that I recently found in the Japanese Eureka and nearly half a century ago in Antonioni's L'Avventura. As there is very little evidence that even the professionals have got to grips with the film's meaning  most are clearly as mesmerised as me but talk mainly about style in other words how the director looks at his world I will venture a few ideas even if they are erroneous. Bela Tarr's masterwork can only be understood as an allegory. In the 17th century the German musician Andreas Werckmeister conceived the idea of equal temperament thus enabling music to be written and played in any key. In doing so according to the philosopher musicologist of the film the purity of the natural cosmic language and inevitability of ordered sound became tainted. As a metaphor for this concept we are shown a small Hungarian town in midwinter under the threat of civil chaos The catalyst that brings this about is the arrival in the main square of a circus consisting of only one giant lorry containing a stuffed whale and a mysterious figure billed as the Prince who occasionally speaks but is never seen except as a shadow on a wall. The circus is a challenge to man's understanding of his safe familiar world and when as here there is a failure of comprehension the result is a crescendo into anarchy. A mob go on the rampage and in a sequence of extreme barbarity attack the local hospital beating up the defenceless patients. That the film works as an intensely human document is due to the fact that the director has given us a character with whom we can identify in the form of Janos a young postman whose odyssey throughout the wintry town we follow every step. As each scene takes place in real time generally in a single shot a walk down a street is the length it takes to achieve. Thus Tarr builds into his structure that element of reflective time for the audience that is a hallmark of the cinema of Angelopoulos and Aoyami. We assimilate Janos's impressions for the time it takes him to experience them. As much has already been written about Tarr's use of the long take I will just add that the attack on the hospital is every bit as powerful an action sequence as the massacre on the Odessa Steps in Battleship Potemkin. What however is so extraordinary about Tarr's great setpiece is the way it generates a similar power not by Eisensteinlike montage but by long tracking shots. Equally extraordinary is the use of silence. Not one of the victims cries out in distress there is just the sound of furniture and fixtures being smashed. Whereas Eisenstein homes in on characters and faces Tarr views his as a dark almost faceless collective. There is just one face recollected from a previous crowd scene to relate this terrible event to the casually familiar. The sequence reaches its climax when a curtain is pulled down from a bath to reveal in longshot the naked standing body of an old man just flesh devoid of personality. This has the astonishing effect of taming the mob so that they gradually slink away in shame. There is a strange parallel here with our final glimpse of Janos sitting on a hospital bed traumatised after his unsuccessful attempt at escape from the town. The only sounds he makes are quietly sung unrelated notes. His uncle the musicologist is with him. He admits to the by now uncomprehending Janos that he has finally compromised by tuning his piano to equal temperament as the only way of perhaps selling the instrument. For the rest all is silence. The musician visits the square by now deserted to see for himself the whale abandoned outside its wrecked carrier. It is Tarr's haunting resolution of a nightmare vision of a world gone mad.".

This mindblowing story is told in only 37 shots I counted it myself some of them lasts for 5 or 6 minutes. Despite the small number of the shots this film has one of the most effective editing of all time. Every edit is perfectly timed and has a meaning of its own. Kudos to the editor.The stark blackandwhite camerawork is by Medvigy Gbor and the melancholic music is composed by Vg Mihly. The most harrowing scene is the raid on the town hospital the longest scene of the film shot in complete silence. Frightening and sensesstaggering the picture of the naked old man burns into the soul. Highly recommended a mustsee for anyone who is interested in the recent history of CentralEastern Europe and wants to understand it.".

Okay so it's in black and white there's a lot of mud rubbish smoke and wetness there's not much dialogue between not very attractive people every take lasts between five and ten minutes and there are many scenes of people trudging through cold and bleak landscapes.

	schema:reviewBody "It is closing time in a bar somewhere in Eastern Europe. Someone says Show us Janos. A blank faced young man Janos Valuska Lars Rudolph begins to organize a ballet of inebriated patrons playing the Sun and the Moon turning in their orbits. Valuska pleads All I ask is that you step with me into the bottomlessness. As the dance continues the men are spun. They stop suddenly as the orchestrater tells us that in this awful incomprehensible dusk everything that lives is still Then with a push the dancers carry on until the Earth emerges from the Moon's shadow. The eternal conflict between darkness and light begins again. Containing shots that last up to fifteen minutes at a time Werckmeister Harmonies the latest film by Bela Tarr Satantango Damnation is a nightmarish vision of a society duped by political demagogues and distracted by circuses being led into a cycle of violence and despair. Based on a novel by Lszl Krasznahorkai it is a powerful and disturbing film that in its surreal depiction of growing madness in an unnamed town is reminiscent of Roy Andersson's Songs From the Second Floor. The film takes its name from the theories of Janos' uncle Gyorgy Eszter Peter Fitz a musicologist who tells him of his obsession with the legacy of Andreas Werckmeister a 17th century German musician who created the twelvetone scale. Eszter believes that perfect order does injustice to the holiness of music and says that the heavens move to their own music.As Janos leaves the bar and walks through the cold and halfdeserted streets streets that in T.S. Eliot's phrase follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent an enormous van drives up the main street and comes to rest in a great empty square in the town center. A circus is in town. The exhibit contains the world's largest whale dead and stuffed with tiny staring eyes and The Prince a shadowy figure that we never see. The town is full of rumors of impending violence. Janos sees the whale and watches a growing group of seemingly unemployed middle aged men gather silently around fires in the square. He seems to know everyone in the town. To further her political agenda of town cleansing read ethnic cleansing Eszter's estranged wife Tunde Hanna Schygulla sends the compliant Janos on errands. He is told to put the children of the police chief to bed but as if presaging the coming violence they stomp on their beds to a cacophony of noise while one shouts at Janos over and over again. It will be hard for you. It will be hard for you. He is also asked to listen to conversations in the square and report back to her but he only hears the Prince saying What they build and what they will build is illusion and lies. What they think and what they will think is ridiculous'. When the signal is given the men in the square come together and march towards us with growing anger in a hypnotic parade lasting five terrifying minutes. They go on a rampage setting fires and ransacking a hospital beating the sick in an unbroken orgy of violence. Patients huddle by their beds in silent fear. Suddenly a door is opened. Confronted by the menacing faces an emaciated old man stands naked in a shower bathed in an amorphous light. Transfixed by what they have seen the men abandon their task and retreat silently into the street. On the morning after order is restored. The van is broken down and the whale is exposed as little more than an overstuffed balloon. The Sun emerges from behind the Moon to the swell of ineffably beautiful music. We have reached the end of the cycle only to begin dancing again when the next Prince calls the tune.".

To further her political agenda of town cleansing read ethnic cleansing Eszter's estranged wife Tunde Hanna Schygulla sends the compliant Janos on errands. He is told to put the children of the police chief to bed but as if presaging the coming violence they stomp on their beds to a cacophony of noise while one shouts at Janos over and over again. It will be hard for you. It will be hard for you. He is also asked to listen to conversations in the square and report back to her but he only hears the Prince saying What they build and what they will build is illusion and lies. What they think and what they will think is ridiculous'. When the signal is given the men in the square come together and march towards us with growing anger in a hypnotic parade lasting five terrifying minutes. They go on a rampage setting fires and ransacking a hospital beating the sick in an unbroken orgy of violence. Patients huddle by their beds in silent fear. Suddenly a door is opened. Confronted by the menacing faces an emaciated old man stands naked in a shower bathed in an amorphous light. Transfixed by what they have seen the men abandon their task and retreat silently into the street. On the morning after order is restored. The van is broken down and the whale is exposed as little more than an overstuffed balloon. The Sun emerges from behind the Moon to the swell of ineffably beautiful music. We have reached the end of the cycle only to begin dancing again when the next Prince calls the tune.";

Who were the insiders and who were the outsiders? How could you tell?  Why the hospital? Why do humans always need a causation?  Why was the Prince's speech in a different language?  What did the Prince represent?  What did the Whale?  A viewer may not want to be taxed with these questions but given the way the world is these questions are worth thinking about.  I've only seen one other contemplative film which is Angelopoulos' Ulyssey's Gaze which I deeply cherish.  This didn't get to me as deeply as it's images weren't as evocative to me.  This is probably due to my being able access the cultural symbols of Angelopoulos more easily though that film isn't easy eitherit's just that I have more background in modern Greek poetry etc..

	schema:headline " The Weight of Black";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a man with a huge worldview surrounded by microbes.  Woody Allen Bela Tarr directs Werckmeister Harmonies. The plot? A circus act consisting of a giant whale and a special guest called The Prince arrives at a small Hungarian town. With the circus comes a palpable sense of impending doom. Pretty soon local townsfolk kickstart a violent uprising. They seem compelled by invisible magical forces. One man Janos Valuska observes these mysterious proceedings with fascination. A figure of innocence and perhaps naivety Janos watches as the circus causes violent gangs to form some taking advantage of the situation and seizing power others attempts to restore order and cleanliness.The film begins with a beautiful sequence. Janos enters a bar and persuades a group of drunks to create a model of the solar system. Dancing in circles the gang reenact a solar eclipse a ballet which is beautiful until one looks closely. The participants are all drunk and in a state of mental confusion readily believing Janos' apocalyptic description of a solar eclipse. To Janos an eclipse is not a scientific event but a quasireligious one which heralds the end of mankind. Instead of rational explanation Janos and his congregation thus cling to irrationality and superstition. Later when Janos sees the giant whale up close he attributes its presence to God surely only a powerful supernatural being could create such a funny creature.Tarr then uses the whale as a metaphor for a kind of irrational medieval superstition akin to blind fascist obedience. No one in the film even considers taking a closer look at the whale for if they had they would have noticed The Prince hidden behind it a shadowy leader who represents nothing but an image onto which anyone can project whatever ideals they wish.Midway in the film Janos overhears his uncle talking about Andreas Werckmeister a musician famous for dividing the octave into twelve halfstep tones. Werckmeister believed that maths music and astronomy were linked manifestations of the harmony of the universe a view held by Pythagoras who argued that most euphonious harmonies resulted from tones that reflected the proportions of simple integers 21 32 etc. But basing musical scales on simple ratios leads to contradictions and octaves that aren't true which led to people like Werckmeister and others seeking to find an equal temperament or some form of new musical system.By adopting this new system Janos' uncle believes that mankind has deprived musical instruments of their divine tuning replacing it with an artificial system which is nothing but an illusion an illusion which western music is based on. Werckmeister is thus a sort of Promethian figure taking the gift of knowledgemusic away from God and handing it down to men.Janos' uncle thus believes that music and by extension life itself was better when it belonged solely to God. He longs for a simpler universe ruled by a sovereign Master Figure and fails to acknowledge the vast achievements developed under the Werckmeister scale. As a musicologist he fails to appreciate the higher level of organisation and harmonies which man's creation has led to.The film's treatment of order chaos anarchy and civilization are thus reduced to musical terms a threeway battle between order and symmetry the unified worldview of classical Greece and the Middle Ages superstition and mysticism and a more nuanced blending of the two. Consider again the first scene in which Janos attempts to create heavenly order using the drunken bums. The bums fumble about irregular in their movements always falling out of position...and yet they are supremely beautiful spinning in circles whilst the camera pulls back and the music swells. For Tarr all quests for perfection must take into consideration humanity's imperfections harmony depends on imprecision and compromise.But Tarr makes a larger point. Late in the film we're introduced to a gun waving police chief his dictatorial children and his lover a woman who seeks to use the escalating chaos of the village to acquire more power. Using these characters and various symbolic sequences Tarr then sketches a political allegory about the fascist's quest for order and fascism's unstoppable tilt toward collapse.Hungary became a Communist or rather state capitalist state after World War 2 the Soviet Union maintaining a military presence and enforcing Stalinist principles. This led to a revolt in 1956 which helped to topple authoritarianism and give birth to a kind of mixed ideology Socialism a greatly liberalised approach to communism that lasted until 1989 upon which democratic government and capitalism became the norm. But the film is not a strict allegory of Hungarian history rather it aims to show how one political ideology can replace another when an aimless populace irrationally follows a charismatic demagogue. It is about how reactionary opportunists exploit superstition to gain power in the name of order how people obsessed with order have contributed to disturbing the harmonic disorder of things and how impotent members of the intelligentsia often sit on the sidelines whilst the world burns. Indeed it's no surprise that the first thing the violent gang does in the film is to raid a hospital destroying scientific equipment in a crazy rage. With science dead they become slaves to lies an irrational force an angry mob which is only halted by the sight of a naked old man. This man his body frail his bones protruding from his flesh forces them to confront a mass of paradoxes. Humbled and disgusted they retreat into the night. But the damage has already been done. The old order has been destroyed and a new era has begun Janos the boy who believed in apocalyptic whales and the mysterious beauty of god ending the film in a sterile hospital ward misdiagnosed by science and branded an insane criminal.8.910  Though comprised of only 39 shots this is perhaps Tarr's most accessible film.".

I don't think that all cinema should be 'easy' or well wrapped up. Indeed I often feel that I am simply not in the mood for seeing a particular film or experiencing a particular atmopshere. After all it is fairly easy to tell from even short descriptions or reviews the kind of thing that is in store. So I was somewhat surprised to see one previous reviewer here describe this film as dreary drek.

	schema:reviewBody "There's one film that sends shivers up my spine just with it's mere title and that's Bela Tarr's the Werckmeister Harmonies. It's one of those films that may infuriate some viewers meanwhile leaving others awestruck. The story concerns a very cold winter in a small Hungarian town. The camera follows a man Janos in his various everyday events. We know that this is no ordinary film during the poetic intro in the bar where the various customers act out different parts of the solar system in rotation. The peaceful order of the village is disturbed when a traveling circus comes to town. The circus has a stuffed whale carcass on display and abnormalities in jars. A man known as the prince who runs the circus remains in hiding. The stuffed whale seems to have a mystical power. These and other small events which are not fully explained lead the town's people to go crazy and eventually turn violent. This film is very slow at some times unbearable. Certain events are filmed in real time. Similar film's that come to mind are Antonioni's AvventuraL and Heneke's Code Unknown Although this film is super slow at times I loved it. There is something that is gripping about it. It is very surreal and emotional. The scene where the villagers go crazy and raid a nursing home almost brought me to tears. The films musical score is so haunting it will stay in your mind forever. Also director Gus Van Sant is highly influenced by the films of Bela Tarr and it's apparent in his more recent work like Gerry and Elephant. The Werckmeister Harmonies is a masterpiece that's not for everyone. I recommend it for viewers who are extremely patient and are looking for something different.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me say I'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies I love Tarkowsky movies for example Berghman is also a favorite.....but this? The positive points can be summed up easily the photography is splendid and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie? I used to think so but this one is a perfect example of one that for me doesn't make it.... maybe it's because I'm too dumb? possible but I don't think so.... Tarkwosky for example also used very long shots but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking and I mean just their heads because in this movie there are a lot of those shots but sometimes it IS effective the general result is plainly boring even with the intelligent undertones which are done in a way that while intelligent is above all very pedanticyou also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to spare on budget....I'm very disappointed in this film because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....While reading the very praising comments on this page I also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town which is quite interesting on itself but it does NOT make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it but then it's not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourself....an exercise that in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching Stalker or Solyaris than Werckmeister Harmonies that owes much to Tarkowsky but cab never equal it's level....".

	onyx:emotionText "First let me say I'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies I love Tarkowsky movies for example Berghman is also a favorite.....but this? The positive points can be summed up easily the photography is splendid and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie? I used to think so but this one is a perfect example of one that for me doesn't make it.... maybe it's because I'm too dumb? possible but I don't think so.... Tarkwosky for example also used very long shots but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking and I mean just their heads because in this movie there are a lot of those shots but sometimes it IS effective the general result is plainly boring even with the intelligent undertones which are done in a way that while intelligent is above all very pedanticyou also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic or symbolic effect but just to spare on budget....I'm very disappointed in this film because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....While reading the very praising comments on this page I also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town which is quite interesting on itself but it does NOT make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it but then it's not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourself....an exercise that in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching Stalker or Solyaris than Werckmeister Harmonies that owes much to Tarkowsky but cab never equal it's level....";

	schema:headline " 'The Melancholy of Resistance'";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is based on the novel The Melancholy of Resistance by Lszl Krasznahorkai. This story takes place in a small Hungarian provincial town in midwinter. The event that starts to build up the atmosphere of suspicion and unrest is the arrival to town of a circus consisting of only one giant lorry containing a huge maybe the largest in the world stuffed whale and a mysterious figure who is called the Prince is never seen except as a shadow on a wall and who possesses the sinister powers of making people act like a mob. The circus is a challenge to the citizens to understand what its place in their small and familiar universe is. They see the circus as the dark shadow of the moon during the total eclipse that grows bigger... and bigger. And as it covers more and more slowly only a narrow crescent of the sun remains a dazzling crescent. And at the next moment the next moment  say that it's around one in the afternoon  a most dramatic turn of event occurs. At that moment the air suddenly turns cold. Can you feel it? The sky darkens then goes all dark. The dogs howl rabbits hunch down the deer run in panic run stampede in fright. And in this awful incomprehensible dusk even the birds... the birds too are confused and go to roost. And then... Complete Silence. Everything that lives is still. Are the hills going to march off? Will heaven fall upon us? Will the Earth open under us? We don't know. We don't know for a total eclipse has come upon us... When there is a failure to understand the fear may cause the descent into cruel and senseless violence and turn the decent people in the merciless monsters.As a director Bela Tarr is extraordinary. A lot has been said about his camera work and long single take shots. His usage of only two colors  black and white is stunning his sound works perfectly with the images adding to the building of the unbearable tension. His three main characters are played by the German actors Lars Rudolph Peter Fitz and Hanna Schygulla  the Fassbinder favorite actress the star of his 23 films. Casting Lars Rudolf as a protagonist the young man whose journey throughout the winter night on the streets of the town we follow step by step contributes to the movie's success. Rudolph looks like a cross between Prince Myshkin and a Rock Star and he is actually Frontman of the group Stan Red Fox. Judging by the movie's ending the comparison with Myshkin will sadly make sense too. It will also bring to memory the final words of Anton Chekhov's Ward 6  The whole world is Ward 6. You know I would not say that everyone should run and find the film and watch it. I understand that it is not easy watching it does require an active participation but I found it extremity rewarding because it introduced me to the master with the unique style obvious talent and the interest to the eternal and difficult questions that may not have easy and immediate answers.I am skeptical when critics announce every new interesting Eastern European director New Tarkovsky but I should say Tarr is the closest to him I've seen so far. The plot and the story were a little too easy and too obvious for me to follow but Tarr's ability to create an unbearable tension and atmosphere without any special tricks is amazing.Werckmeister Harmonies is a masterpiece of melancholic resistance. I was resistant to it first but then its melancholy overwhelmed me.".

An interesting dimension which can heighten involvement in these long shots or annoy the hell out the unconvinced is rhythmical sound  be it cranky machinery reminiscent of Sergio Leonewalking or an amazing scene where two kids are jumping up and down and banging on drums on the eve before a riot ensues. There is a detachment to the camerawork which reminded me of Kubrick. Again this is a technique which will alienate many viewers. But it works disturbingly well in particular during the penultimate riot scene at the hospital. I watched this followed by The Damnation on the current doubledisc DVD edition available in the UK which is a superb issue and has an interview with the Director as a bonus feature.

	schema:headline " The whole is nothing";
	schema:reviewBody "How to engage emptiness visually? This is the most tasking difficulty that I know of in film for both the filmmaker and viewer. You cannot merely look  sitting still is not meditation  it needs to be a particularly sharpened but effortless way of looking. Seeing things without the person that sees obscuring the view.Only the Buddhist have adequately solved this to my mind by tying into an actual practice of purging the self so that we got a work a painting poem or flower arrangement that was itself an act of meditation. But they had centuries ahead of them to refine. In film I can always count on Bela Tarr for a vision of formative emptiness and ways to engage that emptiness as a space for contemplation. No doubt he has studied Mizoguchi for the 'mono no aware' of a transient sorrowful world itself derived from the Buddhist eye. And even more Tarkovsky in more explicitly adopting his omniscient camera for the reflections. The gloomy darkness he surrounds it with no doubt comes from Eastern Europe as churned from the broken machinery of decades old communism. It is implicit in everything he does always iron cast in punishing ways. At least this part doesn't require any more comments I feel. The impressions of abstract horror are from a life lived.So it is a dark world rolling into the night that we are given here from the memory of it a kind of nightbound universe. How to struggle from our end? Why most importantly why even admire the great whale if the whole is nothing?Of course it is nothing less than simple honesty on Tarr's part for presenting a world as he does as we know historically up to now. For the most it is the Prince that humanity has been the most eager to hear someone to incite change. There is no time to see the great whale whose body encompasses the world the wonder of that emptiness that can generate form of such awesome beauty. The only thing that has power to halt the rampaging mob then is a vision of their own mortality.So in several ways one is tempted to imagine a kinship between him and Trier an encounter with the void and human wretchedness in the face of that encounter. But I posit Tarr to be a wiser filmmaker especially here.Look how he opens the film for example a magnificent roundup even more pertinently addressing now our microcosmic cycle mirrored from above with humans dancing into position of the spheres. This is a filmmaker who understands. The only problem the Nietzchean dismay he seems to have resigned himself to. The last bit of news is that he has decided to stop making films altogether. His worldview is a bleak one no doubt.But it's an honest dismay a way of confessing that he knows there will be light again in principle but can't seem to see any. It's a profoundly human despair how he wearily examines the broken whale at the end. So the problem remains one of embodying a world where by simply existing we are negations of that primal void. Isn't that what we're taught? So how to embrace the great whale then?The film ends here. It falls on us to see beyond the dark and see if we can embrace the whale by seeing that the whole and nothing is the one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first is Hamlet's great formula 'The time is out of joint.' Time is out of joint time is unhinged. The hinges are the axis around which the door turns. Cardo in Latin designates the subordination of time to the cardinal points through which the periodical movements that it measures pass. As long as time remains on its hinges it is subordinate to movement it is the measure of movement interval or number. This was the view of ancient philosophy. But time out of joint signifies the reversal of the movementtime relationship. It is now movement which is subordinate to time. Everything changes including movement. We move from one labyrinth to another. The labyrinth is no longer a circle or a spiral which would translate its complications but a thread a straight line all the more mysterious for being simple inexorable as Borges says 'the labyrinth which is composed of a single straight line and which is indivisible incessant.' Time is no longer related to the movement which it measures but movement is related to the time which conditions it this is the first great Kantian reversal in the Critique of Pure Reason. Gilles Deleuze Preface On four poetic formulas which might summarize the Kantian philosophy Kant's Critical Philosophy vii. And might not the last sentence of this first paragraph in Deleuze's brilliant and brief study of Kant be a statement about film? Time is no longer related to the movement which it measures but movement is related to the time which conditions it this is the first great achievement of film... Ever since film began to unspool its own version of time at 24 frames per second synthesizing it through simple optical illusion and the narrative innovations of montage editing filmmakers have enjoyed the magic of imaginary time. And on occasion a film maker arrives who has an entirely different sense of time a different breath a gait out of step with the rhythms of time common to the moving picture. Bela Tarr is one of those filmmakers. And while he is often compared with the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky also a timemaker Bela Tarr's temporalities are material where Tarkovsky's are often symbolic and visual. Asked once why the scene of villagers marching towards the town square in Werckmeister Harmonies lasted as long as it did the director answered simply that's how long it took to get there. As simple as this is for an answer there is something else at work in Tarr's camera work. Werckmeister Harmonies at over 2 hours contains only 39 shots. It took the director a day to edit together. But the effect of storytelling in so few shots is not just a reduction to the straightforward and direct capture of time. He is I think making film think with the body and it is the body which set in motion resides in time. Werckmeister Harmonies opens with a shot of town drunks in a bar enacting the orbits of the planets. A lone bulb hangs from the ceiling as the men spin and tumble slowly about the room their bodies taking up heavenly relations. And this is what they do throughout the rest of the film bodies move and are moved they plod along empty roads by night they gather in tedious crowds they assemble for a march on the town square they pillage a hospital they walk adjacent to one another there is a two minute tracking shot for which the director laid down over 300m of rail. And as the villagers in Werckmeister Harmonies are set in motion so too is the viewer. Tarr makes the viewer think his film and live its time with him. I have watched as friends adjust their seats during many a shot their own physicality coming under the spell of Tarr's temporality. Can bodies think? Can minds think without bodies? Can we have social relations as heavenly as the relations among the heavenly bodies? Tarr's opening shot in which we found the drunks losing themselves to vertiginal rotations culminates with an eclipse. Tarr shows us an eclipse an eclipse in the heavens staged by village drunks. Light obscured is not darkness as time out of joint is not motion.".

But that slowness has no justification it is the exact mirror of the stupid American action movies Gladiator Transporter... that show you everything very very fast so you can have the feeling of frenetic action which is what it's really cool oh yeah! These slow movies are also done to make the director and the believers feel that same feeling we are slow we are really cool! oh yeah! amen!. Because in this movie there is no reason for slowness there are no details the story doesn't change the characters are uninteresting and are never seen in a different way during the film there is no sense of humour... I'm slow so I'm special that's all.It's in bw and some people say it has a dreamlike atmosphere. I think that in dreams the events don't happen so slowly we don't need to dream every second that we are eating in the dream or walking and there is a kind of brutal presence of the unexpected of elements that break the artistic direction of the dream something that Mr.Tarr will surely not find cool enough.I didn't like it very much.".

I don't believe Harmonies ever shows them in the same shot by the way.

To make it simpler than it is according to the story of Werckmeister harmonies the simple people of this small town are offered a choice of seeing one of God's perfect creatures  the giant whale  or to follow someone  a weird mystical little dwarf ? the Duke  who is spreading some rumours and agitating the people. So there is the problem of choice distinguishing what is ultimately important. Then there is the problem of communications between people. Which does not really exist. And then there is this desire for being led by strong aggressive men who Know the Truth...Well I hope I did not deter anyone from seeing the film with my narrow interpretation of it.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie when taken at face value is baffling and confusing.  There is imagery that seems nonsensical if not downright weird and there are scenes that seem to go on well past when they should have ended.  You basically have two choices when faced with these long intervals allowed by the director.  1.  Reject the movie and this is easy to do because its uncomfortable to sit there watching people walk with no talking for five minutes or 2. Engage with the movie.  By engaging with movie I mean force yourself to think about what different symbols of the movie mean and consider that everything in the movie is there for a reason.  The key is to contemplate the two central metaphors or images of the film  The idea of the The Werkmeister's Harmonies and the symbolism of the circus show and to extend these interpretations to political organization and philosophy of science.  The director himself has been elusive at explaining his imagery and I think in a way this is the point.  There are countless movies Hollywood and independent that simply tell you what to think leaving you the viewer as the passive receiver of information.  This movie really forces you to engage with the story and bring your own interpretations and thoughts to it in order to derive meaning.  If you don't do this the two and a half hours of the movie can be a miserable experience but if you put the effort in you will be amazed at how the movie continues to reward.  Put it this way my wife and I saw this movie and spent the next two hours in a coffee shop talking about nothing but the movie and the conversation was of the exciting And what do you think that meant . . . and how did this fit with that part . . . oh yeah that's great that works . . . or lets use this interpretation as a placeholder for now since we need to fill in some blanks.  A great stimulating conversation.  Name another movie of the past year that could inspire the same kind of conversation.

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't Bela Tarr's biggest fan after viewing The Turin Horse. A film which gathered rave reviews from the arthouse crowd about two of the most boring characters in the universe going about their boring daily business for a very boring week indeed. It made my life look like a thrill a minute! Although The Turin Horse was beautifully shot and magnificently directed it had absolutely nothing in the way of characters or plot which in my opinion are two of the most important things to engage an audience. However I was willing to give Bela another chance. Werckmeister Harmonies was gaining some unbelievable reviews. People were saying that it changed their lives it moved them to tears and that it was one of the most perfect films they'd ever seen. I put away my Turin Horse prejudices and was actually really looking forward to seeing it! Unfortunately what I got was more of the same thing.Read any rave review for Werckmeister Harmonies and you won't see anyone commenting on the narrative or plot they'll instead be commenting on the imagery and score both of which are admittedly fabulous. I was drawn in from the opening 15 minutes which showed off some incredible camerawork with a 10 minute cutfree sequence explaining the universe with various German drunks. It must've been painstakingly rehearsed and taken an unholy amount of takes with the camera and actors moving around with great precision. I couldn't help but really appreciate this stark opening. And then we had the nearperfect shot of Janos walking down the dark street with a beautifully haunting score playing over it. I was swept in buckled in and ready for the ride!However just like The Turin Horse things quickly began to get tedious. The main problem is the characters. They're not exactly infused with life are they? The only thing interesting about the protagonist is his amusing name Janos. None of the characters have any personality and they don't develop which makes it very difficult to engage with the story. I think it must be a Hungarian thing though because every Hungarian film I've seen has featured stupidly boring characters. Hungary definitely isn't a place I'd want to visit or make a film about.The other big problem with Werckmeister is that it's quite simply very boring. I love a long take as much as the next fat person but most of these long takes feel long for the sake of it. I don't need to see people walking for 5 minutes. You may say that it creates atmosphere and if you'd be right but I'm not particularly keen on an atmosphere of boredom. Werckmeister Harmonies has barely enough plot to fill an 80 minute film yet Bela decides to stretch it out to two and a half hours. Thank god he was never approached to adapt The Lord of the Rings!Much of the narrative is meandering around very dull characters. At one point Janos' aunty comes with her knickers in a twist about her exhusband. The whole sequence is very dull and uninteresting yet it takes up about 40 minutes of the film and adds nothing. At lot of people point towards a political allegory which personally doesn't interest me at all however Bela has even said in interviews that he had no political allegory in mind and was just shooting a story about a man meeting a whale. There could've been an interesting story if the most interesting characters weren't skimmed over. The Prince for example seemed like a fascinating fellow but only his shadow is shown once! Obviously Bela didn't want to give his viewers a heart attack with too much excitement.Werckmeister Harmonies isn't all bad though. Just like The Turin Horse it is beautifully made with some shots being nothing short of stunning. I must admit that the hospital sequence was also brilliant even if the reasons behind the characters doing it are a little bemusing. The two scores that feature in the film are also incredible and actually quite moving. I'm not one of these people who cry at Mozart or anything but I did find the music in this very powerful and it elevated some scenes especially the hospital scene wonderfully. For some strange reason I was almost moved to tears at the final scene! Now I don't know if that was because I was so happy that my ordeal was over or if the music was so haunting.I don't judge anyone for liking this film. It is undeniably beautiful to look at and directed with mesmerising precision and sometimes this is enough for people! Some of my favourite films put atmosphere first and charactersplot second such as Eraserhead and more recently Under the Skin. However these films are interesting enough to engage me. Nothing about Werckmeister Harmonies interested me so I was never engaged or felt involved with what I was watching. I watched it in complete darkness and on a proper screen too to try and soak up the atmosphere but I just couldn't feel it. Werckmeister Harmonies disappointed me massively and I've decided to give up on Bela Tarr. I almost fall asleep just thinking about his seven hour magnumopus Satantango!

But there is plenty more in there to be discovered.What is it about?  I guess its about the sadness and isolation that sensitive and artistic Eastern European men feel when they look at their less refined brethren and the political and social history in which they participate.  It is their disappointment that the universe does not reflect the beauty that they see in themselves and their relationship with the cosmos.  A very self indulgent lot...  But they put their time to good use for my moneyFor those who enjoy desiccation its all here.  The fall of the human soul the imperfection of emotional expression revolution as stasis fear as self projection and countless other ideas that might run through your head whilst watching the evening TV.Go and see this film.  I guarantee you will be moved to tears at least once and its a better film than you will give it credit for on leaving the cinema  like it or not. All in all 1010. Watch out for the echoes of the blue whale in the mental hospital.  Therein I am sure lies the answer...".

But there is plenty more in there to be discovered.What is it about?  I guess its about the sadness and isolation that sensitive and artistic Eastern European men feel when they look at their less refined brethren and the political and social history in which they participate.  It is their disappointment that the universe does not reflect the beauty that they see in themselves and their relationship with the cosmos.  A very self indulgent lot...  But they put their time to good use for my moneyFor those who enjoy desiccation its all here.  The fall of the human soul the imperfection of emotional expression revolution as stasis fear as self projection and countless other ideas that might run through your head whilst watching the evening TV.Go and see this film.  I guarantee you will be moved to tears at least once and its a better film than you will give it credit for on leaving the cinema  like it or not. All in all 1010. Watch out for the echoes of the blue whale in the mental hospital.  Therein I am sure lies the answer...";

	schema:reviewBody "Werckmeister Harmonies 2000  The film opens as the local pub is closing up. The barkeep orders the drunken townsfolk to leave but they inform him that they must was for Janos to arrive so that he can explain the forthcoming eclipse. He arrives and uses the drunks as his models for the planets and stars. He describes the eclipse in a vibrant story telling style  will the hills march off? The barkeeper has enough and orders them to leave before the end. Janos walks off the camera in front of him backing away. He is immersed in light surrounded by darkness as he makes his way down the street to Mihaly Vig's mesmerizing score. This is all done in two shots lasting around 11 minutes. As typical in a Tarr film many if not most shots will last near ten minutes.The director Bela Tarr is widely regarded as one of the greatest modern filmmakers though as noted by Roger Ebert is more talked about than seen. This was the first film of Tarr's that I saw and it caught me hook line and sinker. The beautiful black and white cinematography incredibly long takes and hauntingly sparse soundtrack creates a masterful atmosphere. The film revolves around Janos who is well liked in his small village. He goes to great lengths to care for his ailing uncle a music scholar who spends all his time trying to readjust the mistakes of Andreas Werckmeister. A carnival comes to town under the cover of night with the giant carcass of a whale and a mysterious character called the Prince who rumor has it has a devoted following of worshippers who follow his every word as he incites riots and stirs up violent sentiment. We overhear a conversation that describes how whole families are disappearing and that good honest people are fearful to leave their houses. Janos becomes mystified by the whale and the humor of the lord for creating such a bizarre and huge creature after seeing it for himself.He is visited by his Auntie Tunde the exwife of his uncle. She demands that he must get his uncle to persuade the town's citizens to sign up and donate to a fund so that she and the police chief may organize a group to restore order in the town. If his uncle fails to do so by 4pm that day she will move back in. They follow her orders as the camera follows them around town. Tarr thinks nothing of simply watching someone walk for minutes at a time. Later that night Janos will be asked to go down to the town square and see who was talking to whom and what is going on. He goes and finds that fires have been lit. He sneaks into the truck to see the whale again and overhears the circus manager arguing with the Prince and his translator. He demands that the Prince must not be allowed out to destroy another town but he is powerless to stop him. He tells them that they are free from his services and he will not take responsibility anymore. Janos runs off as the camera paces in front of him close up on his face as we still hear the voice of the Prince. We hear riots break out behind him. He stops running and heads back.Much has been made to attempt to place symbolism on the film. Tarr has claimed however that his films contain none. Nevertheless the film is filled with such metaphysical overtones and undertones that you don't have to look hard to suggest symbolism. The incredible balletic organization of the shots works to create a dense and atmospheric mood. In all of Tarr's films there are extended shots of people doing mundane things. The task of eating is particularly present in his films and long shots of people walking. There are many of these moments in Werckmeister Harmonies one of which does come across as slightly trying and overreaching. Most however are incredibly hypnotic. Take for example a shot of the mob as they make their way to a hospital through the streets. The camera hovers above them moving backwards for minutes no dialog or music just the sounds of footsteps in unison. The most complex shot of film comes as the mob ransacks the hospital beating patients. They come across a naked old man standing waiting to be attacked. The mob stops as Vig's score sad score kicks in and are brought back to reality as they leave in unison again this time somberly. We discover that Janos has been watching them or perhaps participating.Werckmeister Harmonies' beautiful compositions deliberate lack of story telling and existential themes blend to create a film that is outside of time. All of Tarr's films create a specific and empty sense of atmosphere. He looks to plunge us into the world of his characters. The final shot of the film lands us back in the town square as Janos's uncle finally goes to see the whale his nephew has been begging him to see the whale which lead to Janos's intrigue what got him caught up in the events of spawned by the Prince. The truck it was in has been turned to rubble the whale lies on the ground. He looks it in the eye and walks off in sadness rather than fascination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jackass the Movie defies just about every set law of filmmaking. It is rude it is crude and it is doggone hilarious. I can't really think of words to describe this film as none do so adequately. It is of course based upon the popular television show on MTV of the same name except there's no the Movie on the end of it. Basically it is Candid Camera meets the XGames meets drunkards. Its cast are a bunch of jackasses Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Chris Pontius Wee Man the Midget Ryan Dunn and SteveO. They go around pulling various pranks and sometimes  or most of the time  injuring themselves.The humor is very selective  some will hate it and others mainly stoned teens will love it. Take for instance a gag where one of the men walks into a plumbing store and relieves himself into a display toilet. Things such as this have been insinuated before on a commercial I remember for Best Buy but this movie shows everything  in detail  including the feces inside the toilet bowl.Sound disgusting? Well it is. But some of the gags  for I can think of no other word to describe them  are just downright hilarious. For example the cocreator of the TV series Johnny Knoxville borrows a car from a rental lot takes it to a garage has all the gears messed up and windows smashed spray paints it and then enters it into a car derby. He takes it back to the lot all smashed up and refuses to pay for the damage. He admits that he was drinking before it happened. He says they must help them pay for the damage to the vehicle. They point out that he signed a contract declaring that he would pay for all responsible damage and he says Yeah but I had a little to drink when I signed that too.The cast and crew seem to have not grown past the age of 13 in terms of maturity. One of the best gags involves about four men on a golf course blasting air horns during teeoffs. One golfer gets so angered that he throws a golf club at them and starts to actually tee off at the men who are hiding behind trees on the course.I've never quite witnessed something like Jackass the Movie before. It is like a giant unedited TV show stretched out to a full 80  minutes and let me say that this is the first time in history I have seen a TVshowbased film that I thought was too short. Movies like Night at the Roxbury seem to go on forever. Jackass the Movie is lots of fun  it isn't deep or intellectual but it's fun. This film is definitely going to grossout certain people and enthuse the more wacky crowds out there. But it is one of the most technically entertaining films of the year. It isn't a masterpiece but it is very fun to watch. Maybe I'm an immature sicko but I liked this movie.Before the film starts there is a warning which reads something like the stunts performed herein are executed by trained professionals. Let me ask How does one train to be a jackass? This film doesn't tell us but it sure does show us what trained jackasses are like. And you know what? Being a jackass looks fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "About the only thing that can be safely said about the grossout fest Jackass  The Movie' is that it is definitely an acquired taste.  You will be either delighted or appalled by the masochistic antics contained in this film and if you ever needed proof that there is a distinct cultural divide existing in this nation today Jackass' provides it in spades.For those who do not know Jackass' is the brainchild of Johnny Knoxville and his assorted buddies who have made a lucrative industry out of devising and performing death and injurydefying stunts so that likeminded individuals from the comfort and safety of their couches and theater seats can at least get a vicarious thrill by watching others act out what they themselves wish they had the nerve or stupidity to do. The film of course comes with a don't try this at home' proviso that is as transparently insincere as it is obviously ineffective.  Jackass' is like the ultimate boyswillbeboys extravaganza a fifth grade prankster's dream come true.  Not only do the men' perform the stunts but they spend most of their time in convulsive hysterics responding to them.  Onscreen vomiting defecating intentional bloodletting and the imbibing of urine are just a few of the goodies offered up for the audience's delectation by the makers of the film.  Think of this as the dark side of the Peter Pan Syndrome a tribute to adult men who have serious maturity issues and who clearly refuse to grow up.'Like most compilation films Jackass  The Movie' is a hitandmiss proposition.  Some of the stunts' are clever and amusing and there is a certain anarchic kick to be derived from seeing these guys pushing back the boundaries of conventional common sense and good taste.  But there's also a certain meanspirited tone to so much of what we see on screen that it interferes with our enjoyment of vast portions of the movie.  Personally I don't care if these guys want to injure maim or even kill themselves to get their kicks but why do they have to get so many of their laughs at the expense of other people?  A number of the bits' seem designed to do little more than humiliate hardworking business people innocent bystanders and even members of their own families.  In making a cruel version of Candid Camera' the filmmakers only heighten their own smugness and attitude of superiority helping to alienate all but the group's most fanatical followers.  What also surprises me  given the general nature of the film's target audience that is  is just how homoerotic in tone many of these stunts turn out to be.  I'm not saying that as a judgment against the film but I do find it to be an interesting observation.I don't want to belabor the issues too much here and I certainly don't believe that the success of this film and the TV show that spawned it in any way foretells the imminent collapse of Western Civilization as others have charged.  That is clearly an overreaction.  Jackass  The Movie' is obviously intended for a very specific niche audience and in those terms I guess it gets the job done.  Just make sure you're in that niche before spending your hardearned money to see it.  You've been forewarned.".

	onyx:emotionText "About the only thing that can be safely said about the grossout fest Jackass  The Movie' is that it is definitely an acquired taste.  You will be either delighted or appalled by the masochistic antics contained in this film and if you ever needed proof that there is a distinct cultural divide existing in this nation today Jackass' provides it in spades.For those who do not know Jackass' is the brainchild of Johnny Knoxville and his assorted buddies who have made a lucrative industry out of devising and performing death and injurydefying stunts so that likeminded individuals from the comfort and safety of their couches and theater seats can at least get a vicarious thrill by watching others act out what they themselves wish they had the nerve or stupidity to do. The film of course comes with a don't try this at home' proviso that is as transparently insincere as it is obviously ineffective.  Jackass' is like the ultimate boyswillbeboys extravaganza a fifth grade prankster's dream come true.  Not only do the men' perform the stunts but they spend most of their time in convulsive hysterics responding to them.  Onscreen vomiting defecating intentional bloodletting and the imbibing of urine are just a few of the goodies offered up for the audience's delectation by the makers of the film.

A film that takes place in the future as we see what our society has become due to the lack of intelligence in film television doctor's direction in finding a cure for baldness vs. the cure for cancer etc. I think Mike Judge had the show Jackass in mind when he wrote that film. Jackass was a show started on MTV that I don't know how just became very popular. Apparently men hitting their nuts with random objects is very entertaining. But the other day I wanted to watch a movie and my boyfriend brought up Jackass I decided to go for it what do I have to loose? Now I knew what I signed up for after all just look at the title. It starts with the opening credits as the guys are rolling into the set on a shopping cart with epic battle music playing which I have to admit I got a good kick out of so I thought how bad could this be? Then they start getting hit with cement and are hitting and kicking each other but I stood strong and held on tight for this movie and God help me I survived.Johnny Knoxville and his group of friends get together to pull a bunch of gags that will make you gag. Just imagine a bunch of drunk frat boys that have too much time on their hands and can only think of their gentiles and behinds as the only answer to any prank.I tried I really tried I'm one of the most liberal people you will ever meet. My opinion is as long as it's not hurting anyone let people do what they want. But I honestly just couldn't find this funny. The only thing I laughed at and felt so dirty laughing was when Johnny and his friends dressed up as the elderly and do random things like shoplift and go running down a hill in their wheel chair. Seeing the people's reactions was just priceless. Party Guy is kind of funny too even though I had a bad experience a few years ago with someone who dressed up as Party Guy at a Halloween party. One of those things where it's funny to see it happen to someone else as long as it's not you. With Johnny and his friends just laughing maniacally at everything bad that happens to their friends I just found it more annoying. I feel so bad and uptight saying this but I have to say that nothing about this movie was enjoyable or entertaining. When I was watching it with my boyfriend he wasn't laughing I thought it was because I wasn't but he said he couldn't laugh that he found it funny in high school but not so much now. I think maybe Jackass was just a trend that led up to those wonderful videos on youtube.People who harm animals or themselves for the sake of laughs is just stupid. I know this is the title but it worries me that people find this showmovie amusing. It shows that our intelligence is decreasing and our attention span is the length of a peanut. I guarantee you that in 10 to 15 years these guys are going to have a lot of problems and it's not going to be so funny then. I guess maybe either I'm not as liberal as I thought or I'm just too smart for this kind of humor.210".

After the ending credits we get to see old versions of them going thru the same type of thing in a fake trailer for the Sons of Jackass. These two scenes had some humor but most everything in betweenfor approximately 80 minutes was worthless garbage consisting of jackasses doing stunts to hurt themselves and their bodies with fat jokes thrown in every so often. When a character poops in a hardware store toilet and they show a closeup of the poop please enough is enough. And I can't remember how many times I got to see various characters barfing various colors of stuff right in front of me.wow was that funnot Why Johnny Knoxville and his gang would allow themselves to be the subjects of one paininducing torture after another is beyond me.I guess it's a macho thing.. As I watched I kept saying why? Why the premise? Why the show ?? Why the movie?? Why a following that produced a movie ?? Why did I rent this and pay money for it?? Why's and more why's.and guess what their's going to be a sequel but why??".

When Rebekah Perkins loses her husband in an accident turns to her abnormal sister Lucy Gwenyth Paltrow in an annoying role her best friend Sylvia Whoopi Goldburg is adorable! and her exstepmother Alberta Kathleen Turner has aged beautifully. The three try to help the vulnrable woman back on her feet. In a few scenes we see how vulnerable and sad Becky really is...And those scenes were the most touching. In other scenes we see how sisters interact and how one sister tries to hold off on Alberta for fear of losing another loved one. It's complicated but overall it's good. I didn't quite understand if abortion was a topic here...It seemed like it during the last segment. Does anybody have a clue? That's the only thing I hate When they don't make it all the way clear in the movie then you know they could've improved. If you want to see some good acting see this movie.

They did the best they could but I found it painful to watch not because I found the story touching but because it was so embarrassingly shallow. You can be sad and funny without being trivial.

You shouldn't actually have to lose a husband to see the absolute falseness of the script. But to cast these great actresses in that story and require that they say those lines was an appalling waste. It is a tribute to their skill that the movie was even possible to watch at all. They did the best they could but I found it painful to watch not because I found the story touching but because it was so embarrassingly shallow. You can be sad and funny without being trivial. There are plenty of movies out there to prove it.";

Well...I have mixed feelings about this movie.NOTE!!  SPOILERS!!!!I thought the acting overall was good...I was a bit dissapointed however in Perkin's character and how emotionless she was after he husband died.  I know that part of this was because she was partly shocked and in denial but still....I expected a STRONGER outburst of emotion from her.  This is your HUSBAND that has just died for goodness sakes!  Not only that but I felt like this movie tended to go on and on with not real point.  IT felt very boring at times and just plotless.  I liked how the movie focuses on each of the women's lives and the problems they are facing in them however if I were the director I would have had the movie continue on with a slightly FASTER pace.  The movie felt like 2 hours long when I had only watched an hour of it!Bottom line I didn't even finish this movie because it was just sooo slow and kind of boring. I was already tired to begin with...I didn't need this movie to put me even faster to sleep.  However if you want a good chick flick about women overcoming thier problems in life then this movie is for you.  The acting is great except that little part I mentioned above and the it's a touching story about enduring hardships and moving on with your life after a tragic death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rebecca Lott a thirtysomething. college lecturer is widowed when her husband Ben is killed by a car while jogging. The rest of the film is taken up with Rebecca endlessly talking over her emotional problems with her younger sister Lucy her best friend Sylvie and her former stepmother Alberta. There are subplots about Lucy's romance with Stephen one of Rebecca's students and Rebecca's brief romance with a handsome young man hired to paint her house. The film ends with the four women performing a bizarre quasipagan ritual designed to help Rebecca cope with her grief. And that's it.The film is what used to be called a woman's picture but with one major difference. The traditional woman's picture had as its primary character a strong female figure with the male characters as secondary ones defined in terms of their relationship to her. Here the primary character is the rather passive figure of Rebecca with Lucy Sylvie and Alberta as the secondary ones and the male characters insofar as we see them at all vague tertiary ones. The filmmakers are essentially trying to make a film about the romantic and emotional lives of a group of heterosexual women while airbrushing men out of the picture as far as possible. Ben never appears his death is announced right at the beginning of the film and Rebecca and Lucy's father Thomas only appears briefly. Their mother Joanna died from cancer fourteen years earlier. Stephen is a minor character and Sylvie's husband Paul an even more minor one although we learn that their marriage is an unhappy one. The nearest thing to a major male character is The Painter and it is noteworthy that we never learn his name and that he is played not by a professional actor but by a rock star with virtually no previous acting experience.The result is that the film ends up devoid of any dramatic conflict or tension. The nearest we get is the suggestion that the two sisters especially Lucy resent their stepmother for usurping their mother's role in their lives. Yet we do not sense from the film itself that Alberta who is supposed to be a hardbitten career woman has done anything that might provoke resentment indeed she treats the sisters with great kindness doing far more to console Rebecca who was only briefly her stepdaughter in her bereavement than does her father. Stephen Holden of the New York Times called the film a genteel buttonedup soap opera which strikes me as being unfair to soap operas much as I dislike that particular genre. Moonlight and Valentino is around four times the length of an episode of most British soaps and any scriptwriter for Coronation Street or East Enders would soon find themselves out of a job if they wasted four entire episodes with as little drama or action as is included in the 105 minutes of this film.I watched this film when it was recently shown on television largely because the cast included two actresses I had admired in other films Gwyneth Paltrow in Sylvia and Kathleen Turner in films like The Accidental Tourist and Serial Mom. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big disappointment to me which was not really the fault of Paltrow Turner and the two other leading actresses all of whom gave the impression that they could do much more with better material. Although if Whoopi Goldberg wants to be taken seriously as a serious actress as opposed to a comedienne she might consider getting rid of her childish stage name. Naming herself after a whoopee cushion was not perhaps her greatest career move.Instead the fault lies with the script based on a play by Ellen Simon who unfortunately does not seem to have inherited the dramatic talents of her more famous father Neil and with David Anspaugh's direction. Roger Ebert described it as very sincere very heartfelt and very bad a judgement from which I would not dissent although I would also add very tasteful very sensitive and incredibly boring. The whole thing is done with the sort of excruciatingly ghastly good taste that makes you long for someone to say or do something tasteless just to relieve the monotony of four people sitting round being nice to one another. 410".

It's just not real. Romantic fantasy.The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more overblown than Moonlight  Valentino especially the stepmother part. Sydelle Feller in In Her Shoes is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her in the first place. Kathleen Turner at least shows some emotional vulnerability as the stepmother in Moonlight  Valentino.If you liked Moonlight  Valentino you will probably like In Her Shoes as well. Enjoyable performances in both in fact the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts.".

Next door neighbor Whoopie is weird and devoid of fashionsense. Exstep mom Turner  who we are supposed to dislike seems to be the kindest and most helpful of the quartet. The men come and go and have very little part in the activities.If you care for talky girly gabfest films go for it. I watched it twice and apparently found it to be quite forgettable.";

The scene in the cemetery put me over the top in thinking the script was totally to blame for creating a cinematic disaster.

Both kids are living with their parents in rural Africa when their home is attacked by Ivory poachers. With their bushman friend Xhabbo as a guide the kids take off across the Kalahari desert to reach the safety of the coast and nearest town while the poachers plan to kill off their only witnesses.A Far Off Place opens with the massacre of a herd of elephants. The killers themselves are then mercilessly gunned down by supporting hero Col. Theron. Would Disney DARE allow a scene like this in the 21st Century? Look at the quality of Tim Allen's The Shaggy Dog and you'll find your answer. For any familyorientated movie it takes some nerve to open with killing such as this but even 16yearold Nonnie herself is at ease yielding a rifle and doesn't hesitate to blowup bad guys.The African desert scenery is gorgeous and director Mikael Salomon who also made the underrated Hard Rain fills the movie with lovely cinematography. The dunes the blue sky the night sky...it all makes you wish for a sunny holiday.A Far Off Place a combination of two novels A Story Like the Wind and A Far Off Place by Laurens Van der Post is not a well known movie and is quite hard to find but it's worth hunting down. A shame that such a good movie has fallen off the radar.".

I have the tape and it is one that I enjoy watching again and again. Several observers have indicated that A Far Off Place is a poor remake of the Australianset WalkAbout. If they had paid attention to the writing credits they would have found that WalkAbout was based on the novel of the same name by James Vance Marshall. A Far Off Place is based on two novels by Laurens van der Post A Story of the Wind and A Far Off Place. Van der Post was by far the more acclaimed author. Several reviewers of both movies have commented on the animal death scenes. In this movie in the Kalahari the unanswered question I have wondered about is what happened to Nonni's dog?".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie about the struggles of these young people in a hostile environment not knowing who to trust and learning to know and trust themselves and each other truly touched me. I have the tape and it is one that I enjoy watching again and again. Several observers have indicated that A Far Off Place is a poor remake of the Australianset WalkAbout. If they had paid attention to the writing credits they would have found that WalkAbout was based on the novel of the same name by James Vance Marshall. A Far Off Place is based on two novels by Laurens van der Post A Story of the Wind and A Far Off Place. Van der Post was by far the more acclaimed author. Several reviewers of both movies have commented on the animal death scenes. In this movie in the Kalahari the unanswered question I have wondered about is what happened to Nonni's dog?";

This is a good role in Reese Witherspoon's early years as an actress. There is not really much of a romance between the two actors as some critics have suggested there is just the obligatory kiss and later hug at the end of the movie is that a spoiler? but the chemistry and friendship between Nonnie Witherspoon and Harry Ethan Embry then known as Ethan Randall is surprisingly touching. The violence and language is slightly shocking for a PGrated Disney family movie and there are a few spiritualrelated issues one scene in particular had me saying Wow. That was weird and I can't even describe what was happening but the rest is engaging.".

I love Reese Witherspoon and her portrayal of the young girl was superb. The beginning of the movie draws you in as you see how a young boy from the US trys to cope without modern technology and how Nonnie despised him. I followed her emotions throughout the story as she slowly warms up to him and was deeply satisfied with the conclusion. Both children had lost their parents and the tragedy had drawn them together. The love birds were a nice touch. The poor things had a wild ride when the children were hugging at the end. I recommend this film to my friends and their children. Even though I have heard it is a copy of another story calledWalkabout or something like this having never seen that movie this one stands on it's own as a very adventurous tale. I like to watch it at least twice a year and have recently purchased it on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is unfair to judge a children's film by the same nontechnical standards you would judge a film made for a more mature audience. That said I had a difficult time figuring out the intended target audience for Disneys A Far Off Place an odd mix of Alaska Walkabout and Blue Lagoon. Since each of these films had a different target audience children for Alaska adults for Walkabout and teens for Blue Lagoon A Far Off Place suffers from a poorly matched and confused mix of story elements the attempt to appeal to multiple target audiences ultimately makes it unappealing to all audiences.Despite some positive comments on this database A Far Off Place did not impress audiences at the time of its 1993 release and has generated little interest since. Based on stories by South African writer Laurens van der Post A Far Off Place is the story of three teenagers Nonnie Reece Witherspoon as a girl raised on South African game preserve Harry Ethan Randall as a visiting American boy and Sorel Bok as their young Bushman guide Xhabbo who attempt to evade a gang of ivory poachers by fleeing into the Kalahari Desert. Ethan Randall is actually Ethan Embry from Can't Hardy Wait.Although recommended for ages eight and up younger viewers will be disturbed by the early scenes where the family's idyllic life is ended by a night attack on their home by the poachers. The house is burned and the parents are murdered. And more mature viewers will be deeply disturbed by the next scene where Nonnie turns into Rambo and kills most of gang in a sequence credible only to a horrified eightyear old. At this point it begins to look like Walkabout a story of an Australian girl her little brother and a young Aborigine on his ritual journey to manhood. In a significant deviation from the book Xhabbo's wife does not accompany the group into the desert. Walkabout's more adult theme of interracial sexual awakening is replaced by a Blue Lagoon romance between the two white teenagers a reflection of the film's narrower values and more modest ambitions.The scenes shot in the desert are almost the equal of Alaska for scenic beauty but Alaskas more realistic survival challenges are superior to the blend of survival skills and mystic powers that Xhabbo demonstrates to his two companions during their journey. There is an element of The Gods Must Be Crazy in this clash of cultures but the film does not go very far bad pun intended with the concept. Both Alaska and A Far Off Place insert the element of poacher violence into the journey to the detriment of the basic story. 'Walkabout did not need this and found sufficient story material in the enormity of the survival experience.Bok is excellent as the young Bushman and RandallEmbry's performance is solid if unexceptional. Those interested in Witherspoon's early work would be better served checking out her great debut performance in The Man In the Moon and avoiding this career misstep. Those looking for a childrenfamily story should stick with Alaska.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

The family is fighting the ever increasing murder of elephants and poaching their ivory.Harry Winslow Ethan Embry who is slightly older than Nonnie is visiting on vacation with his father at the time. The Mom and dad together with Harry's father and the staff are murdered by poachers and they have to trek across the Kalahari Desert in order to get to safety.Luckily they have the help of a bushman Xhabbo Sarel Bok. During the Trek they make use of the skills they already have together with developing many other lifesaving ones.The rest of the storyline is about catching those responsible for the murders and discovering who the ringleader is.One thing that surprised me was the extremely unusual violence in this 'Disney' film. The slaughter of elephants and the murder of several people.I am sure that if Walt Disney was still alive he would never have allowed a film with this violence to be made in his studios. But I supposed this is a sign of the times.SPOILER ENDS Even though there is violence in the movie I still feel it has been well made and I would certainly recommend it.".

The same year I read Forrest Gump which has plenty of sexual content in some parts and the movie which is toned down in that regard if I remember correctly is rated PG13. It's really all relative.

Also your kids should understand that people can die and never come back they went to Jesus would be a good thing to explain. Ultimately they should have chosen another book to do the film on but the film crew did a exceptionally good job at it.

The Nekromantik movies are Ok even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia even if they obviously are horroropera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind they are actually quite funny.TODESKING on the other hand is in my opinion one of the best films ever made. It consist of a  series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. Death as an enemy Death as a reliever Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body. The film is a metaphor over life. It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. It reduces its viewers to the childs they we actually are. The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of Death and hence neither the process of dying is the core message of the film. This is a most realistic film. Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever. No matter what moral standards you set up death is unevitable and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality. This applies to YOU Dear Reader like it applies to the viewers of the film. Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this which is fully excused since they of course will live forever...This is no exploitation movie. Why? Because death does not exploit us humans. It harvests us. We grow for seven days then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of prebirth that is Death. Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. Whether  you choose to regard it as optimistic or pessimistic is up to you. At first glance it may seem very dark. Consider though that in order for something to live something else must die. Who wants to live forever?I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body that are being consumed by maggots he shows not only decomposition but GENERATION of new life. Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre?When you realize this you see Der Todesking it its right context.Sieben Tage hat die Woche siebenmal letzte Stunden.

	schema:headline " Buttgereit is indeed the death king of moviemaking.";
	schema:reviewBody "Jorg Nekromantik Buttgereit continued his serious obsession with death on this harrowing suicidefest.  One suicide per week day.  Der Todesking however is far from being any sort of video nasty. Rather it is a brooding raw brutally frank arthouse hysteria punctuated by avantgarde delivery particularly the recurring interludes of a decomposing corpse.

In any case utterly depressing plodding atmosphere and unnerving lack of dialogue bring this work even further into the category of obscure cult classics not for the weak of heart or mind.

It's been 13 years since his last film Schramm but I live in hope.Der Todesking is one of Buttgereit's most accessible films. That could be the very reason why I was so disappointed with it when I first saw it. After the filth and carnage of Nekromantik Der Todesking seemed almost timid. The film is a collection of vignettes relating to suicide and death linked by footage of a rotting corpse. The gore is very mild in comparison to Joerg's other movies and the violence is largely implicit. Strangely enough the film has grown on me immensely over time and despite my initial misgivings I now consider it to be my favourite Buttgereit opus.This is a cerebral and beautifully constructed film. Buttgereit has always exceeded in making the most repulsive act having a threesome with a rotting corpse for example visually appealing. This film is no exception containing some truly brilliant imagery. The scene where a man shoots his wife and then puts an empty picture frame on the blood splattered wall is one example the man who screams and beats his head against a wall for literally five minutes is another. The film also benefits from a higher standard of acting than some of Buttgereit's other films. The director himself even has a nice cameo in the Ilsa inspired video.Hopefully Germany's most fabulous pervert will get off his butt and make another film in the near future. In the meantime Der Todesking is a great reminder of Joerg Buttgereit's skill and genius.".

In between these already very disturbing episodes Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes aren't all equally powerful but as a wholesome Der Todesking is ranked quite high on the list of alltime most depressing arthouse films. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park and the one of Sunday focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film or any other shockumenary like it is debatable and I'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. There's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically. Entirely unlike I expected Der Todesking isn't exploitative or repulsively graphic! On the contrary actually I never could have hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this as it stylishly shows different viewpoints of a famous German bridge while the names ages and occupations of persons who jumped off appear on the screen. The production values are inescapably poor and the editing often lacks professionalism but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema. The subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also indispensable  aspects of life. GREAT use of tragic music too!".

I had a difficult time understanding the premise to its maximum potential  but from what I've gathered for each day of the week a short tale is told with the theme of death or suicide present in each one. It makes reference to a religious chain letter in circulation from a group calling themselves The Brotherhood of the 7th Day. Also the reoccurring scene of a decomposing corpse against a black back drop is shown with the use of classical music in the background. Life is an illusion and becomes ridiculous and meaningless once we face it. The one security life has to offer is DEATH.This piece was constructed with an obvious existential nihilistic approach. Life is treated meaninglessly and the idea of suicide is likened to vengeance. Each person has control over their destiny and this enables them to become The King of Death. This concept is not without interest but Buttgereit's delivery was lackluster. Unlike his previous film Nekromantik the abstract elements present in this film are deep  I'm not sure I've fully grasped what the director was trying to convey. Certain scenes are splashed together and inconsistent. I partially blame the uncut copy I viewed for its poor use of subtitles  if I had a more coherent version it surely would have been easier for me to piece together the meaning of certain segments. If I was to accurately judge this movie I would say that it's mostly boring and unprovocative. Buttgereit doesn't spell the message of his film out to the audience and whatever feeling you're left with after watching Der Todesking is the right one. There are no definitive answers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Buttgereit does a beautiful film about suicide? Who would have thought that the same director of the filthy Nekromantik would be capable of bringing us such a moving portrait about suicide. Well it is also a film about violent death not just suicide. This is subject matter that most writers and directors would shy away from because it is too dark. It took someone like Buttgereit with enough audacity to give this disturbing topic its humanity. The film itself is actually seven short films each one dealing with violent deathsuicide from different aspects. There are indeed some parts that will move you to tears such as a bridge somewhere in Germany we don't know where but that's not important and on film captions of the occupations no real names given and ages of the people who have used the bridge to meet their end. At the very end of the film you are shown photos of smiling children obviously during more happier times. This scene got me emotionally more than any other. I have to spoil one thing but as a cautionary statement there is one scene unfortunately that has become almost a trademark for Buttgereit the obligatory castration scene. But get past that and this film is a wonderful emotional experience. This one certainly has earned it's place on my all time top ten movie favorites. I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to see such a marvelous film. Now if only it would be made available on DVD?".

	schema:reviewBody "I am initially underwhelmed by Der Todesking The Death King. So we are presented with 7 stories one for each day of the week. Every story is depicting suicide with cuts of a slowly decaying corpsemade from pigs guts and strawberry pudding in between. So what we basically get is an antisuicide movie made on a shoe string budget it does work quite well for what its trying to achieve with the budget they had. However Its a bit of a hit and miss with some of the stories some of the scenes tend to drag on and one day which was Thursday was just shots of the bridge in Germany called the suicide bridge. The director himself said that its very hard to capture what he had in his head due to the budget restraints. We also have a sneaky homage to the Ilsa films which are banned in Germany and a nice shootout at a cinema. The decomposition of the corpse looks great and its nice to watch you'd almost think it was real. The same skeleton was used from necromantic and the scene was shot at 1 frame per hour. As for sound they repeat a rather depressing song over and over but it doesn't really get annoying. check it out if you're a film student or interested in the themes presented here but i can't recommend it personally.".

With that said not too many filmmakers would make an entire movie based around suicide since obviously the story isn't going to go over well with the masses but it probably wouldn't go over too well even inside the horror community.I must say that I was really letdown by this film. I had heard and read so many great things about it but I must say that I didn't find there to be anything overly great here. The film does manage to have a certain dark atmosphere that really works to its favor and the director also throws in some gore. The problem I had with the film is that none of the seven stories really struck me as being anything overly interesting. The direction was great and the atmosphere was there but there just wasn't anything great about the stories.".

The guys girlfriend then comes home nagging him about something so he shoots her in the head and puts a picture frame around the blood stain on the wall he then hangs himself. Day three a guy sits on a bench in the rain telling a girl about his relationship problems she gives him a gun he shoots himself. Then we see a decomposing body looking like it's made from wax. Yawn.Next there's some random scenes of a bridge for day four. Flashing up are names and occupations of those I guess that either jumped or fell from it then it's back to Mr Waxy corpse again. Ooh he's looking a bit smelly now with bubbly bits coming out. Still not very exciting though.Day five Friday has an old woman snooping about an apartment block and finding a chain letter telling her she should kill herself she's envious of a young couple she can see from her window. She goes to sleep and when she wakes up we see a shot of the couple dead and bloody in their bed. Then it's another clip of Mr rotty corpse.Day six involves a girl reading some pseudophilosophical rant about those killing with a gun who then attaches a steadycam to herself and shoots a few folks at a rock gig finally getting shot herself. Then back again to the corpse which has almost been reduced to a skeleton.Day seven...a guy writhes about on a bed for no apparent reason and the film ends with a little girl drawing a skeleton labelled The Death King the name of the film.

Der Todesking is pointless in the same way as Nekromantik but it's a worse film because it's boring in a way that few movies have ever managed it's not far off The Blair Witch Project seriously. Some people say that this film is 'sick' and 'shocking' but it really isn't. The director may have been making a point about death but only he knows what it is. How anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me. The film revolves around the theme of suicide and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week. Yes that means we have a pointless and boring episode for Monday a pointless and boring episode for Tuesday a pointless and boring episode for Wednesday etc etc. This film manages to be even more boring than my average week! Der Todesking is apparently an 'art' film although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to 'art'. Each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story  but it doesn't! We just get a quick little sketch on suicide and it only makes you wonder what the point is. The film feels like it should be deep but there's a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it. Buttgereit uses a few evocative images but I'm unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isn't that memorable. There's a shot involving a decomposing man's body that features fairly often but that gets old pretty quick and all you're left with is the rest of the film which is unfortunate. If I were to struggle for good things to say about this crap all I can think of is this the title sounds cool. As I mentioned Nekromantik is the only other film I've seen from this amateur director I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2 and now I'm really in no rush to watch either. Der Todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it 'art' is very much mistaken. Give it a miss.".

Those looking for a gorefest or exploitation in the style of the NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an arthouse style film so those that need linear explainable narratives need not apply...The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an episode for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse...There are some very well done and thought provoking scenes including the man talking about the problems with his wife and the concert massacre which unfortunately lost some of it's power on me because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS lookalike band on stage.... But seriously  this is a sometimes beautiful the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective  especially if you understand the significance of the scene and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge... sometimes confusing sometimes silly the SHE WOLF OF THE SS ripoff is pretty amusing sometimes harrowing I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective film that is more of an experience then just entertainment as many of these art films are meant to be. Still I didn't find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM and would probably put it on relatively even footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personally enjoyment level. Definitely worth a look to any Buttgereit or art film fan. If you dig this type of film  check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY  in my opinion the BEST arthousehorror film that I've seen. 710 for DER TODESKING".

As much as I enjoy finding the hidden gems it always makes me a little bit sad to see a film so great passed over. Filmed primarily in 2004 and released last year Shotgun Stories has gotten a nice word of mouth and critical following. Roger Ebert announced it would play at his Overlooked Film Festival and recently published a 4 star review. The film centers on Son Hayes and his brothers Boy and Kid. They were given their names by their alcoholic deadbeat father who birthed them left them as if they were never born then reformed his ways stopped drinking became a born again Christian and fathered a new family. The boys were left as Son says to be raised by a hateful woman who taught them to hate their fathers new family and they do. When their father dies the brothers show up at his funeral make an impromptu speech which the new sons with proper names do not take kindly to. Writerdirector Nichols handles his film with the greatest of care. Not a word of dialogue is uttered that seems implausible. Nothing is wasted on exposition. For instance what we know about the Father we learn only through the brief speech made by Son at the funeral. It feels real it feels to the point and best of all in a few short words it never feels like exposition. Nichols takes his time never rushing but wasting nothing. The end result is a visceral experience. The actors all deliver excellent performances especially Michael Shannon who seems to be off and on in a lot of roles. Here he is definitely on. This film gets under your skin takes you into the world of these characters and never lets you go. There are deaths in the film and when it happens midway through a sense of loss of sadness and of rage is felt by the audience for the remainder. It never boils down into a standard revenge film but simply muddles in the mundane and sad lives of its characters. Although this film exudes a sense of sadness that few other films could aspire to its not depressing. I would not dare reveal the films resolution only to say that it comes sensibly after a moment of great realization. Nichols shows himself to be a serious filmmaker to watch in the future. This is a profound and wise film. And a great one too".

	schema:reviewBody "Shotgun Stories is a moody melodrama of Southern rural life smartly observed. Jeff Nichols shoots his first feature film trusting the scenery the faces of his actors creating the atmosphere while he relies on small town everyday life circumstances for character building. Shotgun Stories is a tragedy that unfolds beautifully as an intimate family drama. It serves as a passionate cry to end senseless violence as well as a stark reminder that we possess the power to determine our own destinies. Set against the backdrop of rural Arkansas Shotgun Stories follows an escalating feud between two sets of halfbrothers who differ in every way except for one side of their parental heritage. We are first introduced to Son Michael Shannon Boy Dougls Ligon and Kid Hayes Barlow Jacobs born to a drunken father who didn't have the decency to give his offspring names and rejected by a mother who was too bitter to care for them. The father decides to abandon his first family to find sobriety God and to begin a new life with another family. He fathers four more sons who were given the real names and the upbringing they deserved. The second Hayes family owns a cotton and soybean farm and is comfortably middle class. Son in contrast works at a fish hatchery and loses all his money trying to perfect a system he thinks can beat the local casino. Kid sleeps in a tent in Son's yard and Boy lives in a van by the river. When their father dies the sets of brothers are brought together at his funeral and their previously harbored hostilities erupt and further escalate.Nichols makes a point not to show us the actual violence on screen. He often cuts away at the critical moments of a confrontation and it is Nichols' approach to film making that strips away any glamour associated with the violence while being consistent with his message.It should be noted that the pacing here is pretty slow  albeit realistically so. Thankfully the performances alone are sufficient to keep this counterrevenge tragedy on track. The performances are uniformly excellent with veteran character actor Michael Shannon as the film's emotional anchor. There is plenty to enjoy in Shotgun Stories just don't anticipate all the fireworks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever want to know how those supposed family feuds happen when two groups end up killing each other on site? Stories of these ageold battles have been curiously explored in literature such as Huckleberry Fin which tackles the subject with daring accuracy. This is the first film to show us not only a convincing portrayal of one of these family feuds but showing us how they start often by human beings who are hotheaded and overly defensive potential badseeds which can take the whole family down with them and in a poor society that allows such aggression to ferment and be propelled forward onto another family. I think it is important to note that there are no real villains in this film only people offended and wanting satisfaction for their own grief.Now to judge it more as a physical film the lead actor is terrific and captivates us throughout the entire film. The other actors give solid performances but not standout ones. The sound design is masterful and much needed for there is a lot of silence and not a lot of dialogue yet the sound design keeps us on edge whenever we need to be. Direction is fine and the writerdirector obviously knows where to pull his punches without overdoing it so he doesn't labour his points and thus overall message of the film.I don't agree with the soundtrack and I think it takes away from the film a little. A few too many sequences of beautiful cinematography with music goes a little longer than necessary but this is nitpicking and overall an excellent and original film.".

In too many scenes the dialogue is just too ordinary and the antagonism between the characters is too plateaued. The basic plot is a blood feud between two sets of halfbrothers. Outside of the feud their lives seem to center on tapedecks burgers and boozing. You get the parched quality of smalltown Ozarks life but that doesn't necessarily lend to dramatic form. The scars on lead character Son's back could have been a recurring motif and meant more in the director's commentary you learn why that plan was abandoned. A good film which lacks the extra fire that makes you want to return to it.".

Set in a town in Arkansas the film picks up the story of three brothers all young men named Son Kid and Boy. The father of this unfortunate trio abandoned them when they were at a young age and they grew up in the home of a bitter vindictive mother. Of the three Son is the least hopeless case in a truly dysfunctional trio but his relationship with his girlfriend and preteenage son is decidedly rocky due to his gambling addiction. The shared rapport between the brothers is one of the few comforts in a bleak situation and it makes the subsequent tragedies all the more painful to watch.The tragedy begins to unfold when the three brothers learn of the death of their father. When they turn up to the funeral they confront the four brothers that their father raised after he left his first family behind. The unpleasant encounter at the funeral stokes up the resentments on each side and initiates an escalating blood feud. The reprisals become increasingly violent as new weapons are used to settle the scores words fists knives and lastly inexorably guns. The violent clashes are filmed only fleetingly rather than in voyeuristic closeup detail but the tragic consequences are felt with sickening force on both sides of the family. It is telling that the police intervene only once during a fight and do so without leaving their car  vigilantism is left unchecked. A further tragedy in all of this is that the young child fathered by Son is witness to so much of the violence.The landscape of the American South is beautifully observed in Shotgun Stories the fecundity of the cotton fields and the warm glow of golden sun on the fields are contrasted with images of sewage flowing into rivers and lily pads decaying in muddy ponds. The bittersweet soundtrack complements the mixed imagery using a simple palate of acoustic guitar and cello to considerable effect and playing again and again in your ears long after the credits roll. In the final scenes the desperately sad and tragic events wind up in a curious ending neither happy nor sad but about as heartening a cinematic experience as I have had this year.".

It is clear that he is one to watch.If you are a fan of Terrence Malick David Gordon Green or Andrew Dominik's The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford this should be on your list to see.Shotgun Stories";

The very vacuousness of these films is reassuring for they ratify for the viewer the presence of a repressive mechanism and offer momentary reprieve from anxiety with this thought 'Enough money spent can cure anything. You are a member of a country a part of a system capable of wasting two hundred million dollars on an hour and a half of garbage. You must be somebody.'   David Mamet And it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against his brother Abel and slew him.  Genesis 48Shotgun Stories was the debut of director Jeff Nichols. The film merges Greek Tragedy specifically King Lear with the Southern Gothic genre but is most interesting for the way it knowingly opposes or subverts traditional Hollywood actionmovie mechanics.The plot? A feud erupts between Son Boy and Kid those are their names in the film  the plot functions on a purely stripped down archetypal level and their four halfbrothers. Why they're fighting is not important. Nichols is more interested in chartering both the irrational escalation of violence between the two groups of men and his audience's predisposition to expecting or desiring violence as a form of conflict resolution.Like a tale torn from the pages of the Old Testament the film makes references to serpents blind men Cain and Abel divided bloodlines warring sons kins familial bonds and masculine heartache. There's therefore an almost Biblical portentousness to the film. It stars Michael Shannon as Son the tragic moral centre of the picture. Shannon's body riddled with shotgun wounds suggests learnt rationality and an almost preternatural wisdom borne of past pain. But though he possesses an intelligence and foresight which allows him to see where the film's cycle of violence will end he is ultimately unable to escape the film's bloody vortex.An eye for an eye leaves us all blind and violence begets violence are common sentiments found in revenge movies and westerns which the film resembles but Nichols goes several steps further. He shows the film's violence to be selfperpetuating short circuits his audience's expectations by constantly cutting away from cathartic violence forces his audience to question its own programmed behaviour and constructs his tale such that both audience and cast must outgrow their basest instincts if they are to mature. Bizarrely while Nichols constantly undermines audience expectations Shotgun feels more violent than your typical action movie.Interesting scenes abound one brother comments that their ghost town feels like it belongs to them whilst another points out that if he owned it he would sell this worthless place. The brother's are at once kings and rats royalty and the forgotten. But the emotional and psychological heft that Nichols injects into these supposedly smaller moments is remarkable. From grabbing cards to dismantling a tent the film's narrative gradually tightens. Rather than build toward violence though Nichols structures the film as a series of increasingly contemplative scenes. What you respond to what you're shocked by is the sheer weight of each violent contemplation. As in classic Greek tragedy a Jester or Fool character exists to relate information to the principals. Here the film's unwitting provocateur is a one eyed guy called Shampoo through whom the film's events spiral out of control catastrophe literally organically sprouting from a kind of blindness or myopia.Films typically highlight acts of violence whilst underplaying the consequences of violence. Nichols inverts this. Just as it appears as though a character is about to suffer a traumatic injury Nichols deprives the viewer of the actual image the certain act. In one climactic moment just as the viewer has been offered enough visual information to ascertain precisely what is about to occur Nichols sagely cuts to black. Of course revenge and action tales even films which purport to be anti violence Unforgiven for example a late western secretly relish violence. Such violence is always treated as an antidote purgative underlined and served up as a form of catharsis. But Nichols seems repulsed by the concept of violence being cinematically fetishized preferring instead to linger on the toll with a sad heart.Truffaut once said that no film which featured war could ever be considered truly antiwar. Cinema has a way of making everything about life particularly violence exhilaratingly delirious even sexual violence and sex occupy the same space. But time and time again Nichols denies his audience the catharsis that his on screen characters actively seek. In other words what the audience is denied and called to meditate upon is precisely which the characters are unable to deny and objectively meditate upon. What we are denied is the very cause of the film's violence.Beyond this the film is almost sublime in the way it conveys an air of total waste and senselessness. Conversely it seems as though the prospect of violence is all that can lift these perpetually morose and spiritually exhausted characters out of their squalor andor apathy. Watch too how Nichol's writes his female characters. They exist firmly outside of the boy's story  in another genre and another world itself  unable to fathom the roiling testosterone. And of course you can extrapolate much more. One can look for example at one of the son's actions his desire to fight as an attempt to escape the futility of his abysmal life by choosing a pathway to glorified suicide. Likewise the film's interfamilial war is akin to certain recent global conflicts unrepairable damage always escalating from a certain point which when viewed in hindsight is usually very petty. Incidentally the film was produced by David Gordon Green a friend of Nichols. Green is heavily inspired by Terrance Malick who would produce one of Green's own films. All three directors started off in the Southern Gothic genre. 910  Worth two viewings.".

	schema:headline " Naturalism A at its Finest";
	schema:reviewBody "Shotgun Stories is a very raw and gritty approach to naturalistic type A storytelling. It reminded me of a contemporary redneck version of the MontagueCapulet rivalry. In general the story focuses on the hostility and ugliness of human nature yet without being obnoxious or judgmental. It is simply an attempt to portray as objectively as possible the impacts that certain social issues have on society including poverty child abuse divorce addiction spousal infidelity anger revenge and unforgiveness. However it is not motivated by any political agenda to entice social reform. Instead it allows viewers to decide what the core issues at stake are as well as provide solutions for the world's most troubling social epidemics. Succinctly put this film shows how life is for many people who live under less than fortunate circumstances.I never found any of the characters to be morally repulsive. Rather I felt compassion for them. It was sad to see how most were earnestly trying to live as best they could yet were constantly swept away by the incessant waves of human frailty. An example of this is when Son throws away his gambling addiction in order to salvage his broken relationship with his girlfriend. After solving this problem another charges against him when he realizes his brother was murdered by the opposite side of his stepfamily. The battle then becomes if whether he'll be able to bridle his feelings of revenge. One frailty after the next Son like many of the other characters is tested on how resilient he really is.In this sense the film merely illuminates the weakness of the human condition given all of its vulnerabilities rather than stereotype a given group of people as morally depraved. In other words I do not believe the filmmakers were trying to point fingers at any group let alone personality type as being evil. I don't believe many people will walk away from this film saying Gee that one guy was so awful because of suchandsuch. I think people will recognize that these characters were simply victims of poor social circumstances. The film was showing that there are reasons for people behaving in less than tolerable ways and often times understandable reasons. Therefore unless people have the full story of these characters and more importantly the lives of real everyday people they would be wise to withhold unrighteous judgment.The characters in this story are highly dysfunctional victims of destitution due to a lack of strong parental care when they were younger. Consequently there wasn't really one person to blame for each character flaw yet ironically each character shifted responsibility to avoid being blamed for the stepfamily's eventual downfall. Abusive parents spawned abusive children which eventually sparked the civil war within the stepfamily. A memorable yet haunting monologue given by Son is when he blames his coldhearted mother for the violent rivalry within the family You taught us to hate those kidsand now look what's happened. This line demonstrates the seriousness of causality and its potentially detrimental effects when children are raised to hate others because of an unforgiving heart. The film's moral purpose then was to show the precarious consequences of what happens when the family is destroyed. Since families are the moral fabric of societies all societal plagues can be traced back to the destruction of the family.".

I can still appreciate it for what it is and hopefully writerdirector Nichols whose debut this is will come up with something as good in the future and do better by it. Michael Shannon Douglas Ligon and Barlow Jacobs play three men named Son Boy and Kid. Their father left them when they were kids which led to their mother abandoning them emotionally. Son the oldest basically raised them and their lives are pretty lousy though seemingly normal for the setting rural Arkansas. When they hear their father has died the three men attend his funeral and speak badly of the man who couldn't have cared less about them. This deeply offends the old man's second family consisting of four brothers and a war begins between them. What the film really has going for it is the great characterizations very well performed by mostly amateurs. I pegged Michael Shannon last year with his performances in Bug and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead as being one of this generation's finest actors and he does well by that promise here. Nichols almost undoes it all with awkward pacing and way too much wallowing in the town's redneckiness. The film is mostly pitched as a serious indie with copious comic moments all involving how trashy everyone is. The movie probably does not play well in the South. I think maybe the script's biggest problem is that it really contains only one idea and Nichols doesn't want to spend it all in one place.".

This indie shot in the State I spent a lot of my growing up years in is an excellent performance for him. Most of the others in this movie about family tension and revenge are new to acting.Wars between families and clans are nothing new. There are the famous Hatfields and McCoys and I just watched L' Hritage The Legacy that had the same subject. Here a daddy left three sons and went off to start a new family. They come together at the funeral but the abandoned clan set off a feud when they dissed the old man.It was a slow movie with a few fights and it verged on exploding but family wins out and bloodshed is minimal.".

	schema:headline " Michael Shannon Should Have His Own TV Show";
	schema:reviewBody "Shotgun Stories is a film that should be better than it is. The material provides any number of story lines to emerge that would be more convincing than what is actually shot. The movie does have one thing going for it Michael Shannon. Too long has this great actor sat in the background of American film. Seen most recently in the William Friedkin adaptation of Tracy Letts' Bug Mr. Shannon has the ability to hide his intentions better than any other actor around. The only reason to keep watching this movie at all is because you're not exactly sure what he's up to. While watching this film one can't help but notice that it looks an awful lot like a David Gordon Greene movie. That's a nice touch except when the end credits finally...finally go up it shows that this much better filmmaker is a coproducer. Had Mr. Greene taken the helm of this family tragedy it's possible the end result would be a far better affair. One fine scene exits in the movie and it centers around a monologue delivered believably by Mr. Shannon. The scene is early on in the film and occurs at a funeral and the tension between the families and the setting alone prepare you for more well written well acted scenes that involve the same amount of truth as this one. Unfortunately those scenes never come. Jeff Nichols structures the film into an old fashioned Greek tragedy that pits brother against brother. The grudge between them comes from a deep seeded hatred for one another stemming from none other than their father. Family bonds and morality are tested and the film does a decent job of showing rural American life. Nichols himself hails from Arkansas and one would think that his interpretation of this lifestyle is accurate. I won't argue that. The homes in which these people live seem believable enough and the environment seems like a real place but when anyone other than Shannon opens their mouth the film borders on parody making us laugh at these men's schemes rather than making us understand them. It is a story in which these men are trapped by their environment and unreconciled hatred. The funeral scene in the beginning was supposed to solve this but only fueled the fire. When the guns start blazing and the bodies start dropping the movie falls into ordinary melodramatic garbage that we've been reading since the beginning of time. Michael Shannon deserves better and perhaps in the upcoming Revolutionary Road he'll finally be recognized. Shotgun Stories should have done this but instead leaves the actor desperately trying to carry everyone else on his back which he does for a while. Someone better get him some icy hot and put him in a good film right away.".

You see the monk die but oddly instead of being happy she is rather gloomy and petulant towards her rescuersstill making demands like she is STILL the marquise. Unfortunately for our heroine the leader of the band of criminals Nicolas with which she lives is killed and she is without a protector.Now the film takes an odd turn. She is able to get her two young sons back but instead of going back to the underworld life she goes into business with a local inn keeperand they are very very successful. However apparently Anglique isn't excessively bright as she takes a trip to the palace using her new aliaseven though in the last film the King's brother tried to have her murdered. This doesn't seem like the best place to go huh? Anglique also meets up along with way with an odd man who is a wanted man for producing pamphlets that the King does not like. This part is played by the famous French actor JeanLouis Trintignant and like most French women in the 1960s she fell in love with him. Later with JeanLouis' help she comes up with a plan for killing off 12 men including the very wicked brother of the king for the senseless murder of a boy and the burning of her business. However almost as soon as this plot was created she decides to call off her vendetta because the king made amendseven though her new lover has been killed and there wasn't a whole lot they could do to bring him back! Now she takes a new loverthe same cousin who she hated in the first film. Oddly they have little chemistry between them and he seems like a jerk. And when he should treat her well for being so good to him he treats her like dirt.At this point in the film I really felt lost. Again and again the film seemed to have a plot and again and again the people involved died and the movie took an entirely different direction. Three different lovers three different plotsand none of them seemed satisfying or consistent. In fact although Anglique seemed smart at times at others she was enigmatic and confusing. As a result much of what I loved in the first film was no where to be found. It is definitely a step below the other film and hopefully I will enjoy the next one much more.".

Anglique falls in and out of love every day with a different guy it seems and her two children are treated a bit careless as well by the writers.

The dialog is so random and unnatural. But I like it. As matter a fact Marie and Bruce is one of my all time favorite film. Marie and Bruce seem to have been in long marriage and they spend most of the days by nagging on each other and at the same time they both don't listen the other. It's kind of sadistic relationship. Like Marie says to Bruce Don't you get it you're not even a living thing! It's easy to leave you because you're not real. It kind of works both ways. They are both zombies totally numb. Marie mocks Bruce all the time but Bruce doesn't even react to those insults. Like he doesn't hear what Marie says. And every time Bruce starts conversation with Marie she just rolls her eyes and seems to be away like dreaming. Marie despises Bruce and at the same time she loves him. Like she says herself Bruce is like a god. Bruce on the other hand doesn't feel any kind of sexual attraction against Marie. He tries to make a hit on a girl in a restaurant. He goes to the dirty hotel room just to watch the naked woman in a house across the street. He makes conversations with every woman on the party except Marie. Marie really enjoys mocking Bruce and she somehow enjoys the coldness of Bruce. Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick were both adorable and their performances are very enjoyable. Marie and Bruce is surreal love story between two tired people who are seriously tired from each other but they can't live without each other. I highly recommend this film but I have to warn it's not easy peace to watch. There is lot of symbols and scenes that might not make any sense. Marie and Bruce is movie for a thinking person.10 out of 10".

Well it is based on Shawn's own play and portrays a day in the life of two couples about to end their dysfunctional marriage. Now I did find the movie somewhat enjoyable mostly because of the comedic parts and the performances. However in a conversational movie dialogue is of primary importance and here it just fails to have that effect on the viewer. The lines are too ordinary and appear to lack the salt that makes meat tasty and this is where 'Bruce and Marie' lags behind. It needed more punchlines. Yet Matthew Broderick and Julianne Moore make this an entertaining banter. Many have failed to see that Moore's Marie was supposed to be annoying. It's what years of bad marriage does. It makes someone more irritable and crankier while on the other end Bruce is more relaxed and at the same time seeking comfort elsewhere. So in a bad marriage one is either bitter and lonely or one is lonely and seeking comfort somewhere outside. The interaction between the characters are fun to watch. The dream sequences are well shot as Shawn manages to express that dreamy feel of the scene. The director does make his point clear and the film ends beautifully.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a young man I first saw Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf? and was aghast at such vituperative enmity shared by a married couple. As years passed I understood that this shocking portrayal by Taylor and Burton George  Martha of a dysfunctional couple was just one way some couples manifest their undeniable love for each other. There is much drama and intentional pain to be inflicted upon each other to assuage their sadomasochistic tendencies. In the end after bringing others down to their level of marital martial arts they survive because they truly love each other. To outsiders they express in in such an unpalatable way. On the other hand Marie  Bruce while similar to George  Martha with Marie's hateful and vituperative harangues especially in public against Bruce who responds to her with indelicate personal thoughts about other women's tighter vaginasetc. demonstrates a marital bond more consistent with the Generation X'ers propensity to see everything from ones own selfish and hedonistic point of view that leaves little room for even a flicker of true love within their marital foundation. Perhaps MB reflects another casualty of our society as our moralethical boundaries have degenerated since post WWII changes in our society. This marriage is definitely worse that George and Martha's as there is no love residing anywhere behind their dysfunctional behavior. Even worse Bruce takes the milquetoast approach as he receives his wife's spewings and calls her darling a million times in a demonstration of appeasement while he seeks the love he is missing from his wife through sexual fantasies with strange women and almost latent homosexual fulfillment with his lunch buddy Frank. Marie and Bruce may represent the decline of dysfunctional marriages to an even lower point today than the Baby Boomer's era. There is no redeeming basis for this marriage to have ever occurred. The lack of intellectual capacity in MB as evidenced by the banal conversations at Frank's party compared to George and Martha and friends is pertinent to today's minds as they proceed through trials and tribulations of marriage. The utter lack of any fundamental basis of love throughout MB's marriage in today's arena may indeed reflect the lack of intellectual development hedonism amorality and many other missing elements of our former culture that seems more prevalent in today's society. Marriage even if practiced dysfunctionally seems to be far more absurd and disgusting when there is no development of any basic love concept all while selfishnonintellectual mundane banal and all other dark forces have become so influential in shaping personality. I'll take George and Martha any day because I know they at the very core loved each other very deeply. Chazz".

	schema:reviewBody "With a repertoire of almost 190 films Jess Franco is probably the most prolific Exploitation director of alltime. I've personally been a great fan of the Spanish Exploitation deity for years and it has to be said that his films differ in quality immensely. While Franco was doubtlessly responsible for a vast amount of stinkers his filmography also includes several downright brilliant films such as Miss Muerte The Awful Dr. Orloff Venus In Furs or The Nights Of Dracula. And what could be a bigger treat for a cultcinema fan than a Franco flick inspired by none other than the great Edgar Allan Poe? While La Noche De Los Asesinos aka. Night Of The SkullNight Of The AssassinsSuspiri 1976 is not one of the absolute greatest films in Franco's repertoire it is definitely one of his better ones and a mustsee for his fans. Night Of The Skull is a creepy and competent Gothic chiller that begins delightfully cheesy and turns out to much more convoluted and intelligent than one might think. A family has gathered in a Louisiana Castle to accept the inheritance of the British Lord Archibald Marian who has been murdered in a horrible manner. While the family members are anxiously waiting for their inheritance the killer who has a weakness for bizarre murder methods is still on the loose...Franco accomplishes to create a creepy Gothic atmosphere and he also borrows a lot from the Italian Giallo. This is not the only Franco film that bears many resemblances to 70s Gialli his ultranasty 1981 slasher Bloody Moon also has many Giallo aspects but the inspiration has never been as obvious as in this one. Night Of The Skull is also probably Franco's least sleaziest film. Uncommonly for Franco the film features hardly any nudity only Evelyne Scott shows some skin and very little sleaze. Even Franco's future wife Lina Romay who is known for being naked for about 90 per cent of her film career keeps her clothes on in this one. Apart from young Miss Romay the film features a bunch of other Franco regulars such as Alberto Dalbs the creepylooking Luis Barboo and Antonio Mayans as well as the great William Berger. There have been greater Poe adaptations than this one of course. Poe's work has been most brilliantly brought to screen by Roger Corman with his magnificent Poefilms starring Vincent Price some of which Pit And The Pendulum The Haunted Palace The Masque Of The Red Death rank among the greatest Horror films ever made. Sergio Martino tied in with the tradition of brilliant PoeInspired films with his Giallo masterpiece Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The Key 1974. In case you want to see a true masterpiece inspired by Poe's writing check out Martino's film or any of Corman's 7 films before this one. Overall however Night Of The Skull is a more than worthwhile film that features creepiness and delightful cheese in equal measures and provides several compelling twists that cultcinema fans should enjoy. Highly recommended especially to Jess Franco fans!".

	schema:headline " Gothic and atmospheric periodset Giallo from the master of exploitation";
	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Assassins 1976 is my second dip into the murky pool of Jess Franco a filmmaker noted for his lurid sleaze vulgar exploitation and incredibly lowbudget style. Unfortunately for me the two films of Franco's that I have experienced thus far have been largely devoid of the sex and depravity that his work is so often noted for instead finding the director attempting more worthy subject matter with restraint and integrity. My first experience of Franco was with the film Devil's Island Lovers 1973 a lowkey and ultimately unremarkable treatise on political corruption dictatorship and the horrors of the death penalty. Although it is worth noting that that particular film exists under several alternative titles such as The Lover's of Devils Island and Female Quarters  with each version featuring more gore sex and sleaze to the extent that Female Quarters is essentially a lesbianthemed women in prison film  the version that I saw was tastefully done devoid of sex and placed the emphasis entirely on the characters and the narrative.Night of the Assassins follows a similar ideology to the film aforementioned creating the odd notion of an exploitation film without the exploitation but regardless presenting Franco as a more competent and intelligent filmmaker than his reputation for morelurid and sleazy pictures like Vampyros Lesbos 1970 Female Vampire 1973 and Barbed Wire Dolls 1975 would suggest. With this in mind Franco presents us with a number of interesting characters an appealing and linear story some tasteful though heavily overdubbed performances and an overall approach to the direction that is stylish without becoming entirely laboured. As with Devil's Island Lovers the budget was obviously at a bare minimum but despite this Franco and his crew are still able to inject some impressive style and unforgettable atmosphere into the film as well as conveying a mostly authentic sense of period detail that is germane to the plot. In keeping with many other Euro exploitation films of this era the story at hand has literary pretensions with the initial set up of Night of the Assassins being based partially on the Edgar Wallace novel The Cat and the Canary though in true exploitation style the credits cite Edgar Allan Poe as the actual source no doubt in an attempt to pull in audiences with the obvious macabre connotations that Poe's work would suggest.Despite the opportunities presented by the story for Franco to wreak bloody mayhem the presentation of the violence here seems entirely restrained. Whether or not there are other versions out there of this particular film  ala Devil's Island Lovers  is unknown however based on the version that I did see the combination of subtle direction intelligent plotting and that lowkey atmosphere works incredibly well at drawing us deeper into the story and into this hotchpotch of idiosyncratic characters. The emphasis of the narrative is built largely upon the whodunit characteristics of detective fiction with a large cast of characters gathering at a single location only to be subsequently picked off one by one in a manner that recalls the ten little Indians as the detective tries desperately to solve the central mystery before the last body is found. With this narrative device at work the shadow of the Italian Giallo genre is also present with Night of the Assassins recalling elements of Mario Bava's The Evil Eye 1963 and Blood and Black Lace 1964 and most prominently Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970 and Four Flies on Grey Velvet 1971.Although the film won't be to all tastes I found it memorable and entertaining despite the obvious technical limitations and budgetary restraints. There are some solid performances particularly from Alberto Dalbs as the enigmatic Major Brooks Vincente Roca as the beleaguered Inspector Bore and a reserved turn from Franco's number one girl Lina Romay as the sort of heroine Rita Derian a woman who may or may not be a suspect herself! Night of the Assassins certainly isn't a masterpiece and I can understand how some viewers would find it lacking or without interest but for me it slips nicely into the subgenre of the stalk and slash literary thriller with Franco creating some fine setpieces a great atmosphere memorable images and that iconic skull mask.".

In keeping with many other Euro exploitation films of this era the story at hand has literary pretensions with the initial set up of Night of the Assassins being based partially on the Edgar Wallace novel The Cat and the Canary though in true exploitation style the credits cite Edgar Allan Poe as the actual source no doubt in an attempt to pull in audiences with the obvious macabre connotations that Poe's work would suggest.Despite the opportunities presented by the story for Franco to wreak bloody mayhem the presentation of the violence here seems entirely restrained. Whether or not there are other versions out there of this particular film  ala Devil's Island Lovers  is unknown however based on the version that I did see the combination of subtle direction intelligent plotting and that lowkey atmosphere works incredibly well at drawing us deeper into the story and into this hotchpotch of idiosyncratic characters. The emphasis of the narrative is built largely upon the whodunit characteristics of detective fiction with a large cast of characters gathering at a single location only to be subsequently picked off one by one in a manner that recalls the ten little Indians as the detective tries desperately to solve the central mystery before the last body is found. With this narrative device at work the shadow of the Italian Giallo genre is also present with Night of the Assassins recalling elements of Mario Bava's The Evil Eye 1963 and Blood and Black Lace 1964 and most prominently Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage 1970 and Four Flies on Grey Velvet 1971.Although the film won't be to all tastes I found it memorable and entertaining despite the obvious technical limitations and budgetary restraints. There are some solid performances particularly from Alberto Dalbs as the enigmatic Major Brooks Vincente Roca as the beleaguered Inspector Bore and a reserved turn from Franco's number one girl Lina Romay as the sort of heroine Rita Derian a woman who may or may not be a suspect herself! Night of the Assassins certainly isn't a masterpiece and I can understand how some viewers would find it lacking or without interest but for me it slips nicely into the subgenre of the stalk and slash literary thriller with Franco creating some fine setpieces a great atmosphere memorable images and that iconic skull mask.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jess Franco made a lot of films that are liable to make you want to claw your eyes out but then he also made a lot of films that made you wish he took more care of his overall filmography as the man clearly had talent. Night of the Skull is firmly in the latter category as while the plot is not particularly original and has been done many times before and since Franco makes good of it and Night of the Skull is a very successful thriller overall. The basis for the plot takes influence from the often used idea of a will reading causing trouble within a family. The film takes place in England and we focus on the residents of an old castle. The Lord of the manor Lord Archibald Marian has been murdered. As the family gather for the will reading they are shocked to learn of two wills one to be read in the case that the Lord was murdered the other in the case that he died of natural causes. The family are shocked further when all of his assets are left to his illegitimate daughter but there are twists in store before the will can be executed.The film gives a writing credit to the great Edgar Allen Poe for his story The Cat and the Canary although clear influence is taken from crime writer Edgar Wallace and indeed his novel The Terror which was adapted in 1965 as The Sinister Monk features basically the same story. The film has some similarities with the Giallo genre also and Giallo fans will no doubt enjoy this one too genre entries such as The Weekend Murders and Deadly Inheritance also use the same base for a plot. The film is set in England and Franco takes care with his setting and the film does actually have an English feel despite the fact that all the characters speak Spanish. Franco also creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that benefits the film immensely. The film is of a higher quality than a lot of Franco's stuff also  with the acting from the ensemble cast being well above par. The storyline is interesting for the duration despite the fact that it will be familiar to most genre fans and the ending does deliver something of a surprise. It's an unlikely way for the tale to end but at least it sort of makes some sense. Overall Night of the Skull is a very decent thriller and comes recommended.".

The casting is effective though I wasn't familiar with too many of the actors from Lina Romay and Antonio Mayans as the young couple to the various conniving members of the family including William Berger and various other interlopers like the Police Chief who always forgets to pick up his sombrero when he leaves and Franco himself as a drunken 'lawyer'. This is my first Lina Romay film frankly she seems so young it's hard to believe she would soon be appearing in films that would border on the hardcore this film's only perverse erotic charge is delivered by the scene where the sleeping Romay nude of course is beaten up by her tipsy and jealous stepmother with a belt! The concept of a series of murder methods lifted from a passage in the Apocalypse is an interesting one though the deathbyfire itself is pretty unconvincingly staged.

The least you can say about this movie is that it's a likable effort. If you compare the oeuvres of exploitation master Jess Franco and early 19th century author Edgar Allen Poe an amalgamation of their works seems nearly impossible and ridiculous. And yet Night of the Skull is a very compelling and atmospheric Gothic horror film worthy of Poe's good reputation and a class above the majority of Franco's other movies. The screenplay is based on Poe's The Cat and the Canary and revolves on the despicable Marion family as they gather around to hear the will of the murdered patriarch Archibald Percival. Since his death was unnatural the inheritors all of a sudden get to hear a completely unexpected testament that divides the family fortune differently. Then at night comes a skullmasked killer to eliminate all the family members in gruesome ways referring to the four basic elements water wind earth and fire. Our good old pal Jess manages to create a wondrously sinister Goth atmosphere complete with dark mansions near the seaside and loud thunderstorms. There's always a certain level of suspense to enjoy and the murders are impressively barbaric. Especially the first murder that of the family patriarch is quite creepy. This movie probably contains the smallest amount of sleaze in a Jess Franco movie ever even Lina Romay keeps her clothes on at all times which is truly odd but there's constant hinting at perverted themes such as incest voyeurism and adultery. The decors are great the acting is more than adequate for once and the recent DVD release looks very nice. This film isn't dubbed which is a real pleasure. Definitely top 3 Franco material alongside Faceless and The Awful Dr. Orloff.".

Indeed Edgar Allen Poe is credited as an inspiration in the opening moments although there is nothing specifically similar that I can see.A darkly shot project  occasionally too dark  this drips with atmosphere with Franco making the most of his splendidly intimidating location.";

And when you consider that this is only one of ten films Franco is credited with directing in 1976 it's amazing that Night of the Skull is at all comprehensible.I haven't read this anywhere so I have no real basis for knowing this but Night of the Skull seems to be Franco's attempt to make a GialloKrimi type film. A hooded cloaked skullmasked killer is offing the members of a wealthy family gathered together for the reading of a will. Almost everyone in the family is a suspect that is until they're killed. Some of the scenes are almost expertly handled like the first murder where the elderly patriarch of the family is buried alive with only his hands which have been tied behind his back sticking out of the ground. There are also very few scenes where Franco appears to lose his and the camera's focus and stays pretty much on course throughout. On the downside the killer's identity is unfortunately too easy to guess and leaves little in the way of a surprise once heshe is finally unmasked. And while the acting is never as bad as in something like Franco's Oasis of the Zombies no one was going to win an award for their performance either.In the end Night of the Skull is something of a treat for fans of Franco.

With no deviation.By the time Gervais comes across the knowledge that an alternate way of communication exists in saying what wasn't we embark on a tale of a man who essentially won the lying Lottery.The humour is subtle the contrast of religious themes are not so and that may have been the weakest of elements in the film. Sadly those who think there is a single element of disrespect towards religion from within the world of the film are I believe incorrect. While religious digs may have been the impetus for the films creation from within the film Mark's character seems to make a clear delineation between an evil lie and a white lie. And his character never seems comfortable for too long with a lie that affects the lives of many.The film does have a one of the more sweet and quietly powerful scenes where Mark creates an alternate afterlife for his mother. Because I don't view this film through a filter of religious expectation I found this scene to be simply powerful and poignant.I enjoyed it as did my partner.

But once he realizes the import of what he's done he keeps doing it trying to use his powers for good with some hilarious and some disastrous results.I wondered about the premise before seeing the movie. What would the ban on lying include? As it turns out the authors went whole hog. When they say no one's ever lied in this world they mean in any way. No fictional stories no lies by omission no intentional deceit and no religion. Basically the rule on this imaginary world has always been you can't say anything that isn't. No one's ever thought of doing such a thing. So if two people tell you two different things then one of them is mistaken.The story starts of hilariously with Gervais' and Jennifer Garner's characters meeting for a date. She's hot and he's dumpy. They waste no time telling each other this in all honesty including their doubts and worries about the date. Flattery doesn't exist because it's a form of lying. Keeping silent to spare someone's feelings is also lying and so has never been done.Think of all the things that wouldn't exist if no one had ever said anything that wasn't true... For instance words like true untrue belief unbelievable fiction lying etc.  none of those words can exist. There are no churches no novels. All movies are historical or documentary. All news shows only tell the truth.When Bellison suddenly realizes he can say things that don't agree with reality he quickly learns what power that holds both for good and evil. He can walk into a bank and tell them he has quite a bit of money in his bank account  they'll assume their computers have made a mistake.In the course of the story Bellison learns how to make people feel better about themselves by telling little white lies. He invents fictional movies and later religion. Religion came naturally because everyone was scared of the nothingness that comes after death. He assured them that good things would follow death at least for good people.Religious people are unlikely to enjoy the movie since it gets to the heart of why most early religions were started  to cure that fear of life and fear of the unknown after death besides the ability to control large groups of people.But it's wellthought out and wellexecuted in this movie. The funny parts are really funny and the sad parts are really sad. There's really no great cinematography though no reason to see it on the big screen. Wait for it on DVD.".

I disagree but understand there is an element of truth to this argument. Gervais explores this aspect more directly than any mainstream treatment I've seen if not in great depth.To me the strength of the philosophical treatment is the questions it poses not the answers it provides. The movie doesn't really provide a lot of answers. When Bellison Gervais lies to his mother to give her comfort when she is dying he has the best of intentions and ends up having to tell huge lies to cover his initial small lie. He attempts to use the utmost care in telling these new lies  spending so much time concentrating on the exact wording that he grows a beard while doing so. Even so when he reveals the ten revelations he receives from the invisible man in the sky the masses immediately start scrutinizing the rules and reveal weaknesses in them.Having thought about these issues quite a bit there was nothing groundbreaking here for me but it tickles me pink to think this movie might be watched by those who have yet to journey down that path.

Wonderful casting.Ricky Gervais and Jennifer Garner are absolutely believable throughout their respective characters' evolution and they play off each other very well. In fact everyone's performance is spot on. And the cinematography beautifully plays up or down rather the fictional world which is the story's setting.If you're hoping for nonstop oneliners and ridiculousness throughout this is not your film. While this film's cheeky pointed story is loaded with wit  including some sidesplitting scenes I cried with laughter watching Ricky Gervais' character face questions from a credulous crowd  it has a real and rather serious plot. There is a point to this fiction indeed.".

The casting was great on this film. I'm glad Hill took on a serious role and did it well. I really liked Garner in this film. She was fantastic and played off of Gervais very well.

Seeing a world with nothing but the truth means no fiction and no little white lies. Quite boring and brutal really. The part that's poking fun at religion may not be some people's cup of tea but I suspect that these are those not secure enough in their beliefs to allow them to be challenged no matter how humorously. To see what Gervais does with a pizza box is nearly worth the price of a ticket.All in all not a classic movie but a much better way to spend one's day than many of the other movies out there today.".

It starts with the brilliant premise What if nobody had ever told a lie and did not even understand that a lie was possible? It is an interesting question. The movie first draws laughs by setting up this type of world. It then draws laughs by showing us how lying can turn the world upset down.A great comedy entertains and this one does that but it also raises some highly provocative questions about religion and people's susceptibility to it. To put icing on the cake the movie has some startlingly beautiful scenes for example where the lead character soothes his mother over her coming death and the scene where Mark Ricky Gervais refuses to lie to Anna Jennifer Garner.Gervais reminds one of Lou Costello with a sweetness and gentleness unique for a comedian unique for this age. Jennifer Garner at age 37 here seems a little too old for the workinggirl looking to get married part but she has never looked more beautiful than in this movie.There are some nice short scenes with Tina Fey Jeffrey Tambor and others. One wishes that their characters could have been more developed and had more to do.On the DVD there's a great 7 minute prequel which apparently was supposed to be the beginning of the movie. It is terrific and I think they made a mistake in editing it out. Be sure to watch it.I plan on showing scenes from this movie to my Philosophy class next semester.One warning thoughtless evangelicals will probably see it as an attack on their holiness fantasy so don't invite your bornagain Christian friends over to see it.".

	schema:headline " The Wonderful Discovery In A Romantic Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Ricky Gervais is one of my favourite comedy actors. His films are very funny and 'The Invention Of Lying' is no exception. Here he dons the director's cap as well. Here we have a pg13 romantic comedy that is actually very funny unlike others of its genre. It stars Ricky Gervais Jennifer Garner Tina Fey Jason Bateman Jonah Hill Philip Seymour Hoffman Edward Norton and plenty of others. Mark Bellison Ricky Gervais is a loser about to lose his job as a screenwriter at a very successful production company Lecture Films. He also has a lifelong crush over the perfect girl beautiful Anna McDoogles Jennifer Garner but she doesn't want a fat snubnosed loser as her husband. That would ruin her chances to have perfect genetically beautiful pretty babies. The setting for the story is somewhat odd. Nobody can actually lie about anything they don't even know about the word as its not invented yet. Mark is about to get thrown out of his apartment for his inability to pay the rent. So he goes to the bank to withdraw all his cash. But there's a technical glitch in the computers and they ask the amount he has to withdraw from his account. He asks for 800 instead of 300 and the systems are back on. But the lady says there must be a mistake as the system shows 300 and she gives him 800 thinking the system is corrupt..! Here inadvertently Mark invents the art of lying. He is the first person ever to lie and its as easy as drinking water to him and everybody believes whatever he says. Using his new found power he sways his old company and becomes rich and famous. Will he get the perfect girl and will he really be happy? This is a romantic comedy so the ending is pretty much guaranteed to go in one direction. How the director takes us through this journey is the key point in every film of this genre. Many are plain bad or very stupid. But this film has a lot of hilarious moments not the slapstick comedy sprinkled with deep emotional drama. I felt sad when Mark's mother dies and also when Anna is getting ready to marry Brad who is a perfect genetic match to her. But Brad is the guy who always hates losers and he is pretty much a bully and Mark tries to make Anna understand this but she goes ahead to marry him anyway. Jennifer Garner's portrayal of Anna is spot on. At first she is very short sighted when it comes to judging people and after her friendship with Mark all that changes and she has a whole new perspective. Ricky Gervais's portrayal of Mark as a sweet smart and kindhearted man who will always love Anna no matter how old she becomes is very well done.The whole town full of virgins i.e no liars concept is awesome. The film gets a few points for the concept itself. The performances by Tina Fey Jonah Hill Jason Bateman and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the cameos are very good. Edward Norton is barely recognizable as the cop and is downright hilarious. Look out for the DVD extras and you'll be wondering why they didn't put it into the film. The evolution part was good. This is a very good movie and I can't recommend this enough. Please try and see this and you'll not be disappointed. This is a little gem of a movie. 810".

The whole religion theism atheism thing comes to the fore and it's time to start questioning your own thoughts about belief and the proper place for religion if any.

	schema:headline " Oh dear! A classic case of a good concept in search of a good story";
	schema:reviewBody "Oh dear! I had high hopes for this Ricky Gervais comedy. He's never proved himself on film but here he was writing directing producing. He had come up with a great funny concept. This was his chance to shine.Unfortunately the light at the end of this tunnel is the train coming to run us down.Like so many high concept comedies this is a concept in desperate futile search of a plot... and some funnier lines.It's no disaster. There are some funny bits. It starts well or at least does after a hideously misguided voiceover explanation of the basic plot setup but the joke that everyone not only can't lie lying doesn't exist you see hence the title  obvious right? So why the voice over explanation Ricky why oh why! but volunteers the truth no matter how harsh at every occasion quickly wears thin. He gets about 20 minutes out of it and some people handle it better than others. Curiously it is often the straight actors like Jennifer Garner that play it better and the comedians like Tina Fey who sound too much like they are delivering calculated lines to get a laugh  and therefore don't. I love Fey but every line of hers fell flat for me here while Garner sold the hell out of it. Perhaps it's the less comedic actors lose themselves more in the character and world and aren't trying for the gag the laugh just trusting in the script etc. I don't know but it's noticeable time and again here.A risky for some American audiences plot element involving his inadvertent creation of religion and the spiralling outcome of this is also amusing but again it's funnier as an idea than in execution. Outstaying its welcome.There are also some dynamite cameos including two that had my laughing simply by their presence. A bar tender that joins Gervais and the excellent Louis C.K. in a scene is both funny by presence and in his dynamite delivery. I'm not going to say who plays it because if you're going to watch the film it was one of the highlights for me.As was another cameo by a usually fairly serious actor although he has shown a comedic side on occasion as a traffic cop. Again just his presence is funny from the moment he walks on screen and the voice cause you won't instantly recognise him gives him away.A scene with two Extras regulars is fun but feels out of place in the film almost playing like an afterthought put in for faithful fans.Amongst the other leads Garner triumphs giving it her all and Louis C.K. is very funny but Jonah Hill is underused and never hits the high notes he achieved in Funny People while Tina Fey doesn't bring it and i so wanted her to and Rob Lowe really fails in an update of his Wayne's World character.But ultimately this descends into sentiment and lacks resolve or real drama. It often feels like a string of standup oneliners extended into plot devices as there is no lying movies are a guy nice touch cameo from Christopher Guest as one such  reading a book on camera that work once but then are repeated over and over beating the gag into submission. Ideas like the use of lying to make people feel better are similarly used once to affecting and comedic effect but then overplayed.And before you know it you're bogged down in a film about perception of others and looking beyond the surface that could have been reached by any number of devices making the lying thing irrelevant!Like Bruce Almighty the concept can only get the film so far before you notice you have almost no interest in the characters there is no discernible plot and we're going to descend into sentimentality without passing through palpable drama or achieving any resolve.Disappointing is the only appropriate word.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a world where people can only tell the truth Ricky Gervais creates the lie. What follows this simple concept with great potential is a series of quick fire jokes made funny by the sheer bluntness of the absolute truth. The screenplay is lightly comical but rarely laughoutloud funny and continually relies on the same concept.As the plot progresses it veers from quickfire jokes to a parody of religion. On the one hand this offers an interesting and thoughtprovoking reflection however I found the developing plot to become mildly preachy and irritating to watch. The humour level drops and the religious overtones and romantic subplot overshadow the interesting idea.Visually I found the film to be rather drab and dreary. Similarly I didn't care for the dowdy and monotonous score and soundtrack choices. I understand that these are probably intended to represent a world without fiction but they make the film a little tedious to watch and don't add anything to the movie. I enjoyed Jenifer Garner's performance as Gervais' love interest which she's plays with harsh yet likable realism but Gervais' lead performance left me a little cold. In combination with lacklustre screenplay I was left unimpressed with the utilisation of a potentially hilarious and fascinating concept.The Invention of Lying is a quiet simple movie on the surface but underneath lies a more complex thoughtprovoking moral allegory albeit one that fails to deliver anything truly remarkable. It tries to be clever but fails to deliver.510.".

This humour actually has a fair number of levels to it. On one level humanity is very base but the great thing about lying is that we actually get to a level where we can find the good in people. This movie is for everybody who has ever been called short fat or ugly and for all those people who see that it's always the good looking people who get everything they want in the world. But Gervais is now here to stand up for us and just let us laugh.The Invention of Lying is filled with oneliners intelligent wit and the ultimate truth to our world.

	schema:reviewBody "ReviewI like comedies like this. They don't rely on big budgets or snide lowbrow humor. They get by on wit alone. The Invention of Lying 2009 is about just what the title says its about. It takes place in a universe where lying simply does not exist. Everybody says what is exactly on their minds all the time. For instance when Mark Bellison Ricky Gervais picks up Anna Jennifer Garner for a first date she promptly tells Mark that he's short unattractive and she's not looking forward to this date.This is a universe peopled with trusting citizens. Skepticism does not exist. Nor does navet because in a world where no one lies there is nothing to be nave about. If you are fat and dumb you are called fat and dumb by whoever is thinking about you.And so we follow Mark Bellison throughout his sad daily routine. He is fired from his job as a screen writer for a movie company that produces feature length films of people reciting history because fiction is a lie of course. His secretary Tina Fey admits she has loathed every day she works for him. He visits his mother at a nursing home otherwise known as A Sad Place Where Homeless Old People Come to Die. And finally his landlord evicts him.When Mark goes to the bank to take out the last 300 in his account sparks fly in his brain. He lies to the bank teller saying he actually has 800 in his account. She gives him the money and Mark wakes up to the power of his new discovery. He has invented lying.In one hilarious scene Mark tests out his new powers on his barfly friend and a bartender claiming he invented the bicycle and a slew of other outrageous assertions. The bartender and barfly believe his every word.The most interesting aspect of this movie is its implications for religion. When Mark's mother is dying at the Sad place she confides to her son that she fears the nothingness of death. Now capable of lying Mark tells his mother that when she dies she will be in a good place with her own mansion and everyone she ever loved. In effect Mark creates the notion of heaven. A doctor and nurse overhear this description and believing him they spread the word of Mark's revelation and soon he becomes an international prophet. This whole premise is hysterical and actually somewhat subversive.But eventually the film changes gears and becomes more of a rudimentary romantic comedy with Mark trying to win the heart of Anna without having to manipulate her with lies. She of course doesn't want Mark because he wouldn't be a good genetic fit for her children. Anna prefers the handsome and narcissistic Brad Kessler Rob Lowe. While this story line is still funny I preferred the religion plot more and wish they had followed it deeper.The Invention of Lying is getting at something though it doesn't state it explicitly. Instead of an analysis of the negative or positive effects of lying it is really a study of the various layers of truth embedded in all things. Admittedly I didn't like the romantic story but I did appreciate Anna's realization that truth cuts deeper than superficial initial reactions. Anna never discovers what lying is but she does find that truth is not immutable. The truth changes as we change. RatingOn a scale of one to Casablanca this film is a Oh God! 1977.RationalizationThis film is more like a comedic episode of the Twilight Zone than a typical comedy. I always find it impressive when a film digs deeper than it has to no matter how slight that extra digging may be. The Invention of Lying is well done enjoyable and funny. By the end of the film you know why there are so many notable cameo parts for so many big name actors. Everyone wants to help a comedy like this. Ricky Gervais has proved his staying power as actor writer director in England and now he seems to be working on America. To him I say 'Godspeed.'".

Now this man has the world at his feet.It is a clever concept a clever and more massive spin on Liar Liar yet that might not be such a good thing. The premise of this film is funny but it becomes too much of itself and is tiresome after a while. The joke goes on and on he tells lies people believe him. In one scene a lie gets him in too deep to dig himself back up and that's where the conflict in this film comes in. Yet one can ask themselves a simple question why not just lie his way out of it instead of digging deeper holes.Gervais is at the lead again after his feel good comedy Ghost Town which people decided to skip. This time around he's also behind the camera yet nothing technical about this film pops out it plays out like an average comedy relying on it's one concept. The one concept gets some laughs here and there but there are never any really laugh out loud moments.The film has some emotional scenes that influence the rest of the film. The comedy kind of takes a second step to the theme of religion. Some people may find this irritating. Jennifer Garner plays the romantic lead who finds Gervais fat and with a stubby nose not a good match genetically for a marriage and children. Yet they form a friendship one in which Gervais hopes will blossom into something more. Does it? Well how do romantic comedies usually work out? Here the outcome doesn't seem too believable. Things happens and people react without really knowing why this leaves little for character arc.How do people live in a world with no lies? Well when you want to watch a film you go to the theatre. In that theatre you'll see a guy sitting in a chair reciting history. Since movies are mostly fiction no one can make one cause it would be a lie. See where this film goes? A retirement home becomes A place where old people go to die so on and so on.The film does have some really funny cameos. It's mostly the usual comedy round but there is at least one in which I was so caught off guard that I just couldn't help but laugh. Look out for a cop. Jonah Hill and Louis C.K. play two supporting character neither are funny.The film is funny but not enough to warrant a theatre viewing. This has rental written all over it. It simply cannot stand on it's concept for too long because it becomes a bit dull. If it were a short I could enjoy it more.".

But also all religion serves a few basic purposes it is social form of control with a system of rules it gives meaning and context to life it holds people in position to be content with being held down as this will mean rewards in a afterlife  so you can see in such a world without lies why religion isn't needed.The film also shows that most creativity doesn't exist in such a word film being reduced to an academic monologue of an historic account as to dress up actors and embellish a story like Gladiator would be a complete lie and Superman a bigger lie but you don't hear film buffs or comic book fans saying it is antifilm or anticreative.But the fact is why can't a film offend you if they want to make a film to offend any subgroup then I think they have that right you have that right and I have that right. I find the whole concept of cultist religion like Christianity completely offensive to myself it is pure depraved self worship  if nothing existed before God then he must have made the universe and us out of himself therefore to worship God is just a worship of ones own makeup. So surely reasoned people need a release and response to such depravity in a mordern informed world and this film fills that hole just right.The good thing is that as we move forward in a technology society and create more magic ourselves in a world underpinned by fact and reason then the less of an impact religious plays each decade sees less accounts of fictitious magic I can't remember the last time a true religious miracle was taken serious by anyone  which is progress.Come on people we are trying to evolve here get with the programme you are holding us back... but if you do intend on holding us back then surely we deserve to have a good laugh at you while you do so.Overall a good film not the best by a good HONEST laugh if you find the 'invention of religion' offensive then you will love this more if you take religion seriously then you may want to skip this film but you will find a few base jokes to suit take unreasoning intellect.".

The Office Extras Ghost Town everything that Gervais has had a direct hand in has been successful and carries a great deal of intelligent humour. Until now.This is made even more surprising given that the concept of the film is original and has the potential to ensue laughter around a cinema throughout the film. In a world where people can only tell the truth Mark Bellison Gervais suddenly discovers that he can lie and uses this now found gift to turn his loser life around to become rich famous and try to receive the love of his childhood sweetheart Anna Garner. Because of the nature of the plot there are some parts of the film that are inevitably funny for example the pathetic coca cola advert and through the first half an hour this carries the comedy throughout the film.However it's when the script tries to get move on from the main concept that it starts to fall down. After lying to his dying mother about life after death Bellison discovers that he has inadvertently created religion causing all the world to hang on his every world as he is the only one who can say what the man in the sky is saying. Yet this doesn't really develop and should be the main focus of the film but instead it deals with Bellison trying to capture the heart of his beloved Anna made all the more difficult because he can't bring himself to lie to her. Because of the undeveloped aspect of the religious side of the story one wonders what it's actually doing there as it doesn't seem to have changed the world as much as it should have done.Even though Gervais has potentially missed the main plot of the movie it still could have been salvaged. However due to the final parts of the film being repetitive and more predictable then Gordon Ramsey swearing in a restaurant the originality that brought the laughs earlier in the film dry up and the whole film remains undeveloped and empty. On the plus side the acting in the film is good with Gervais and Garner performing their lead roles well and there is also good back up from Louis C.K and Rob Lowe but they are doing the best they can with a poor script and ultimately this costs the film deer.This had massive potential to be the best comedy of 2009 but missed opportunities and bad execution coupled with clichd conclusions and dilemmas about romance means that Gervais' film falls way below expectations.".

The story was set in the mid1950s accurately looks the part and is actually three tales involving the three males in a middle class family. Yes there is the treatment of racism and the selfconsciousness that it spawns on both sides and yes the death throes of antisemitism at least among decent people. A middleaged man finds he has outlived the world in which he came to prosper and does not know what to do. There is something else the grass is always greener hypothesis in ethnicsocial class mixing.

This film is about the Jewish Kurtzman family but we follow the father and his two sons as three separate stories.  Each one of them having their own struggle and challenges to face.  What struck me as the most amazing part of the story was the easiness of it how it flowed and gently tackled serious issues in the community of that time.  It portrait itself in a realistic manner where there were no real baddies or large showdown just people going through life.  The performance of the actors was brilliant with Joe Mantegna the father showing once more what a talent he is.  This film won't leave anyone untouched.  810".

Ben Foster steals the show from the first scene and Adrien Brody is in close second place. And because they had such screen persona or power if you will I found if distracting and a bit out of place when at the end the story shifted too much to Joe Mantegna their movie father. I have much respect for the man he's an immense and always funtowatch actor but in this movie it was him that was overshadowed which is ironic since HE was the one who usually did this.

Although unexceptional in terms of it's standard coming of age plotline as the film progresses it becomes increasingly thoughtful and observant.  It is the small details that make LIBERTY HEIGHTS seem so richand I wouldn't dream of giving any of them awaybut needless to say by the end of the film anyone who remembers their childhood fondly is bound to leave the theatre with a smile on their face.  In a quiet and unassuming way the movie manages to throw out many messages to its audience.  Every single subplot in the film relates back to the family.  Joe Mantegna plays the racketeering patriarch of a nice upppermiddle class Jewish family that resembles a lighter version of the Corleone's in THE GODFATHER.  One of the sons falls for a Catholic girl while the other pursues the black daughter of a prominent city doctor.  They all live with their grandmother who is blinded to the gentiles by the Holocaust.  The relationships between the youngsters naturally conflict with the views of their parents and they are forced to form their own opinions on racial boundaries. What is so refreshing about LIBERTY HEIGHTS is that it doesn't pull obvious punches or go for the cheap thrills that more sensationalized Hollywood films normally would.  Not even in a subplot with an eccentric drug dealer do the characters resort to violence as might be expected with this sort of material.  The characters in LIBERTY HEIGHTS are just ordinary people in relatively ordinary situations.  It is not a fast paced film some may find the midsection to be a little overinflated.  Personally I enjoyed the film a great deal.  It grew on me to the point that by the end I was drawn to tears.  Even fully aware of its old fashioned Hollywood corniness the movie touched a nerve with me.  I found the performances very movingin particular that of young Ben Foster who we should exepect to see again in the near future.  Adrien Brody is appealing and sympathetic as the eldest son.  Bebe Neuwirth manages to create some interesting moments in her role as matriarch of the Kurtzman familyparticularly in the final scene. LIBERTY HEIGHTS is not a perfect film to be sure but in a season with a shortage of intelligent family oriented films LIBERTY HEIGHTS is a solid bet.".

Nate owns a burlesque house long after burlesque has gone out of fashion and runs a numbers game on the side constantly risking charges. Meanwhile Van and Ben deal with antiSemitic feelings swimming pools with signs that read NO JEWS DOGS OR COLOREDS ALLOWED but at the same time also deal with the changes brought about by integration making friends and making tentative steps toward romances with those of other ethnic groups. We get a sense throughout of the difficulty that people must have felt in being asked to give up longstanding social conditioning and we see perhaps unrealistically that the young people are far more willing to break out of these restrictions than their parents.The movie isn't all that exciting but does provide an interesting sliceoflife perspective that makes it worth watching.

It was the most real most heartfelt and most memorable. I put on LH thinking it would be okay and was shocked to see it just about right up there with Diner for all the same reasons. If you've seen Scorsese's The Bronx Tale with DeNiro you might notice a resemblance down to the forbidden teen interracial love plot. In Bronx Tale the mob has a part but with nothing terribly eventful. In both the family and everyday storyline take precedence as if the mob aspects were afterthoughts. I can't say that the Jewish Mob background did LH justice as Montagna just seemed too wishywashy to be a frontline mobster. Montagna is a great actor but I think he should have brought a little harder edge to the moborientated moments. He did fine as a father though he could have had any occupation and the movie would not have been any the less for it. I strongly feel that if the movie did not have the mob element in it and Montagna had a conventional occupation the movie would have been perfect and even more realistic than it was. The burlesque scenes again were a drag on what otherwise would have been a perfect coming of age film.This movie comes very close to Diner quality if not for the somewhat flawed mob subplots....well worth seeing though!".

	schema:headline " Nicely understated drama";
	schema:reviewBody "It is rare these days to find a film that contains original characters and stories. Liberty Heights while not perfect fills the void for at least 2 hours.The film tells three interconnected stories involving the Kurtzman family Nate Joe Mantegna Ada a criminally underused Bebe Neuwirth Van Adrien Brody and Ben Ben Foster. Ben runs an illegal numbers racket from behind the scenes of his burlesque show. Van is trying to woo a rich girl Carolyn Murphy. Ben is romancing an AfricanAmerican student Sylvia Rebekah Johnson to the horror of both their families the film takes place in 19541955.All the actors do terrific work. None of them are in their comfort zone and there isn't a single off performance. Joe Mantegna is solid as Nate. He's a good guy and a family man despite his unsavory activities. Adrien Brody is also good as Van. It's a very understated performance but we still feel for the guy. Of special note is Ben Foster. Foster has been churning out outstanding performances left and right in varied types of roles and this is another great performance. He is so real and the voice he uses is so different from the one he usually has. He's also immensely likable which is especially noteworthy coming from a guy who would later play creepy psychos in Alpha Dog where I first noticed him and 310 to Yuma. Rebekah Johnson and Carolyn Murphy are solid as well as the pursued girls and Orlando Jones is suitably loopy in an offthewall performance Levinson keeps him like the film a little too muzzled however. Justin Chambers is very good as the nearalcoholic rich kid who isn't as bad as he seems. This is clearly a personal film for director Barry Levinson. It's another film in his Baltimore saga but it's the first one of those movies that I've seen. After this I'm going to check them out but not immediately. The film is a little too understated films that go this route have an added level of verisimilitude but a little of this goes a long way and especially in Adrien Brody's case it's a little too understated to be believable. Some of the crosscutting montages don't quite work either although that's nitpicking the worst example of this is in the end credits which cuts from jazz to pop and back again with rather startling ineptitude but this is the point where you're supposed to be turning off the TV anyway.I'd recommend the film but only if you're really into this kind of a movie especially since it's a little on the long side.My rating PG13 for language and thematic material.".

Ben is romancing an AfricanAmerican student Sylvia Rebekah Johnson to the horror of both their families the film takes place in 19541955.All the actors do terrific work. None of them are in their comfort zone and there isn't a single off performance. Joe Mantegna is solid as Nate. He's a good guy and a family man despite his unsavory activities. Adrien Brody is also good as Van. It's a very understated performance but we still feel for the guy. Of special note is Ben Foster. Foster has been churning out outstanding performances left and right in varied types of roles and this is another great performance. He is so real and the voice he uses is so different from the one he usually has. He's also immensely likable which is especially noteworthy coming from a guy who would later play creepy psychos in Alpha Dog where I first noticed him and 310 to Yuma. Rebekah Johnson and Carolyn Murphy are solid as well as the pursued girls and Orlando Jones is suitably loopy in an offthewall performance Levinson keeps him like the film a little too muzzled however. Justin Chambers is very good as the nearalcoholic rich kid who isn't as bad as he seems. This is clearly a personal film for director Barry Levinson. It's another film in his Baltimore saga but it's the first one of those movies that I've seen. After this I'm going to check them out but not immediately. The film is a little too understated films that go this route have an added level of verisimilitude but a little of this goes a long way and especially in Adrien Brody's case it's a little too understated to be believable. Some of the crosscutting montages don't quite work either although that's nitpicking the worst example of this is in the end credits which cuts from jazz to pop and back again with rather startling ineptitude but this is the point where you're supposed to be turning off the TV anyway.I'd recommend the film but only if you're really into this kind of a movie especially since it's a little on the long side.My rating PG13 for language and thematic material.";

The Baltimore setting the diner scenes the closeups on car hood ornaments and other touches serve as identification markers of its author.  It is interesting to see Levinson put Baltimore in quite a different light than he did in the TV series Homicide. Liberty Heights follows the predictable plotline of many comingofage movies where things happen and then people talk about them.  I kept waiting for something really bad to happen someone to be killed or dragged before the HUAC but nothing terrible happens at all. But far from spoiling the film it allows the viewer to concentrate on the characters' experience and the changing direction of their lives. This is a film about Baltimore's distinct ethnic groups in the 1950's but there is no sharp edge to it.  Rather Liberty Heights shows hope for tolerance and the breakdown of sharp socioeconomic boundaries.  The message is not hammered home it's just there for the grasping if you wish to see it this way.  Otherwise it's a pleasantly diverting soap opera with typically Levinsonian cinematography editing and use of music.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der 20. Juli or The Plot to Assassinate Hitler is a West German movie from 1955 that is mostly in the German language. It is of course a blackandwhite sound film and one of the more known works by writer and director Falk Harnack. His film here that runs for slightly over 90 minutes resulted in some solid awards recognition especially for lead actor Wolfgang Preiss who won a German Film Award here for his portrayal of Oberst Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg a character that was played by many other actors as well in the decades after this one such as Tom Cruise of course or Sebastian Koch. Most people with an interest in German history know that he and some of his buddies tried to assassinate Hitler in 1944 but did not manage the unthinkable eventually and they had to pay for their lives with it.I must say I did not enjoy this film as much as I hoped I would. Tough to say what the reason for that is but I prefer the latter versions I think. Maybe history needed a couple more years or decades to really elaborate convincingly on this subject. However I actually like the 1955 movie with a similar title about the exact same subject the one starring Bernhard Wicki so my assumption is probably incorrect. Anyway I think I'd recommend the one I just mentioned much more than this one we have here. I am quite a bit disappointed here by the quality and maybe it would have been better with more focus and a smaller runtime like the Wicki film. Anyway even the final quote scene with Stauffenberg here was pretty underwhelming and not as touching memorable and maybe even emotional as it usually is. After all pretty much every Stauffenberg film does not only include it but end with it. So yeah I just cannot give this one a thumbsup not even recommend it to people with huge interest in the years of Nazi Germany as I do so myself and wasn't impressed. Go for something else.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the depression era kicks in Americans were grasping for any sort of inspiration they could get enter equine supreme Seabiscuit. Considered broken down too small and untrainable Seabiscuit went on to become a bastion of great racehorse's and in the process bringing solace to those closest to it.Back in 2003 upon its initial release critics were very divided as to the merits of Seabiscuit as a picture. Some were concerned that this adaptation from Laura Hillenbrand's highly thought of novel missed too many crucial elements others were merely touting the tired old charge of the film purely baiting Oscar something that is levelled at every film in history about hope and second chances the more astute critics of the time however lauded it as the delightful and inspiring piece it is.It would be churlish of me to not agree that Seabiscuit is laced with sentiment rookie director Gary Ross barely wastes a chance to tug the heart strings and paint an evocative sequence but if you have got it in you to accept this true story for its base emotional point then it is one hell of a wonderful experience. Seabiscuit is not just about the equine beauty of the picture it's also a fusion of three mens personal wavering who for one reason or another need the horse for far more important crutches than those provided by financial gain make no bones about it Seabiscuit is a very human drama. Knowing how the picture will end never once becomes a problem because the historical accuracy in the story makes one yearn for that grandiose ending one to gladden the heart in the way it must have done to thousands upon thousands of Americans back in the day.Ross wisely chooses to filter in as much realism as he possibly can archive stills and narration serve as exceptional points of worth to the narrative structure. Then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that Seabiscuit provides. Jeff Bridges Tobey Maguire waif like Chris Cooper Elizabeth Banks top American jockey Gary Stevens and a splendidly jaunty William H Macy all can rightly feel proud of their respective work on this picture. But it's with the thundering race sequences that Seabiscuit really triumphs best magnificent beasts hurtling around the race track is excellently handled by Ross and his cinematographer John Schwartzman whilst a nod of approval must go to the sound departments efforts it's definitely one to give your subwoofer a work out.Seabiscuit was nominated for seven Academy Awards winning none perhaps the Academy also felt like those critics who thought it was trying too hard for a Golden Statue? But now after the dust has settled some years later it pays to revisit Seabiscuit and judge it on its own emotional terms for it's a tremendously well crafted picture that is of course as inspirational as it most assuredly is tender a fine fine picture indeed. 910".

Considered broken down too small and untrainable Seabiscuit went on to become a bastion of great racehorse's and in the process bringing solace to those closest to it.Back in 2003 upon its initial release critics were very divided as to the merits of Seabiscuit as a picture. Some were concerned that this adaptation from Laura Hillenbrand's highly thought of novel missed too many crucial elements others were merely touting the tired old charge of the film purely baiting Oscar something that is levelled at every film in history about hope and second chances the more astute critics of the time however lauded it as the delightful and inspiring piece it is.It would be churlish of me to not agree that Seabiscuit is laced with sentiment rookie director Gary Ross barely wastes a chance to tug the heart strings and paint an evocative sequence but if you have got it in you to accept this true story for its base emotional point then it is one hell of a wonderful experience. Seabiscuit is not just about the equine beauty of the picture it's also a fusion of three mens personal wavering who for one reason or another need the horse for far more important crutches than those provided by financial gain make no bones about it Seabiscuit is a very human drama. Knowing how the picture will end never once becomes a problem because the historical accuracy in the story makes one yearn for that grandiose ending one to gladden the heart in the way it must have done to thousands upon thousands of Americans back in the day.Ross wisely chooses to filter in as much realism as he possibly can archive stills and narration serve as exceptional points of worth to the narrative structure. Then there is the first rate cast to fully form the emotional complexities that Seabiscuit provides. Jeff Bridges Tobey Maguire waif like Chris Cooper Elizabeth Banks top American jockey Gary Stevens and a splendidly jaunty William H Macy all can rightly feel proud of their respective work on this picture. But it's with the thundering race sequences that Seabiscuit really triumphs best magnificent beasts hurtling around the race track is excellently handled by Ross and his cinematographer John Schwartzman whilst a nod of approval must go to the sound departments efforts it's definitely one to give your subwoofer a work out.Seabiscuit was nominated for seven Academy Awards winning none perhaps the Academy also felt like those critics who thought it was trying too hard for a Golden Statue? But now after the dust has settled some years later it pays to revisit Seabiscuit and judge it on its own emotional terms for it's a tremendously well crafted picture that is of course as inspirational as it most assuredly is tender a fine fine picture indeed. 910";

	schema:reviewBody "It's fitting that a film about underdogs giving it all they've got has been released among the standard summer action fare. No other movie this summer has capitalized upon the David vs. Goliath theme so thoroughly and effectively as Seabiscuit' has.The story of Seabiscuit' is actually the tale of four long shots Charles Howard Jeff Bridges a wealthy selfmade man and natural salesmen who's suffered both personal and financial loss through the Depression Tom Smith Chris Cooper an aging horse trainer unsure of his place in the world with the ending of the frontier Red Pollard Tobey Maguire a shorttempered jockey with various handicaps against him and Seabiscuit an undersized mustang whose been mistreated his whole life.It's the Depression and times are hard on everyone. The assembly line philosophy of business is starting to squelch independent spirit and people are looking for anything to help escape the dreary daytoday of life. During this maelstrom of hopelessness horse racing quickly gathers favoritism among those wishing to witness a spectacle in otherwise bleak times. It's under these circumstances that the film's four main parties come together. Howard seeking a new business venture in horse racing hires Smith as his horse trainer and Pollard as his jockey and upon Smith's insistence purchases the illtempered Seabiscuit.It's not long before Seabiscuit becomes the little horse who could' gaining favor among the sporting fans on the West Coast. But despite the popularity the mustang and his team gains they are seen as just a cheap novelty by the East Coast horse racing elite led by Samuel Riddle owner of the 1937 Triple Crown Winner War Admiral. This mushrooms into a media circus as Howard tries to gain public favor in order to force Riddle to put his money where his mouth is.The story should have felt cliched and bythenumbers but a funny thing happened the film makers took a nearly forgotten moment in time and managed to invest it with immediacy and suspense. The near mythic meeting of Seabiscuit and War Admiral on November 1 1938 at Pimlico is an extension of the movie's overall theme Seabiscuit the representative of underdog hopes and pioneering dreams and War Admiral the recipient of champion breeding and training a product of assembly line thinking.Bridges and Maguire give spirited performances with their characters forming a father and son bond that both men desperately needed. Cooper who won this year's Best Supporter Actor Oscar can give this kind of performance in his sleep bringing a quiet stoic depth to the Smith character. The supporting cast is top drawer as well especially William H. Macy as Tick Tock' McGlaughlin the initially skeptical radio sports commentor who becomes a full blown Seabiscuit supporter.Director Gary Ross captures the time period marvelously with broken human beings slowly recapturing their dignity and pride against a landscape of barren ruin. The conflicts are fought not on traditional battlefields but atop magnificent beasts along a circular track and Ross wisely utilizes this metaphor to full effect.Many film goers this season will most certainly pass on Seabiscuit' choosing instead to see standard fare like American Wedding' and Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life.' Others will undoubtedly avoid it because it looks to artsy to be entertaining. For whatever reason it will be a shame that this film will not do well financially the horse race scenes are some of the most intense I've ever seen and the animals are pure poetry in motion.9 out of 10 stars. A nearly flawless motion picture.".

Acting was very good but I thought the most believable scene was when Red's parents gave up their son because they couldn't afford to keep him anymore.That scene was very sad and based on fact where parents were placed in the terrible position to give up their children like that during the depression.What struck me funny is that Red Pollard never reunited with his family after he became one of the most famous jockeys in the country but I guess thats the way it was back in those days.Wonderful cast and exciting horse racing scenes that brought the viewer into the race and projected the energy and danger involved. It is interesting to note that horse racing was a bigger sport in its heyday than football or baseball.

	schema:headline " Triumphant conventionality";
	schema:reviewBody "Roger Ebert says he has a theory that people more readily cry at movies not because of sadness but because of goodness and courage.'This is certainly a reason why Gary Ross's Seabiscuit tugs so effectively at the heartstrings. But the main one is the way the movie shows the triumph of the underdog spread fourfold among three men and a horse. And again the timing is right in the American release. Just as Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later was delightful because it was a low budget movie that could compete with a lot of loud and dubious blockbusters Seabiscuit earns our gratitude by being a blockbuster without explosions or exhibitionism an epic of restraint modesty and  yes  goodness and courage.' The loudest sound you hear is the starting bell for the races. There are those of us mainstream folk who've been starving for such fare. I saw people in the audience in the early matinee who plainly were alive in 1929 and 1938 and they wept and applauded throughout with awe and gratitude. We shall see how the younger generations respond.An enthusiastic response is justified. There is nothing in Seabiscuit that's very original it awakens involuntary flashbacks to many traditional Rockyesque sports biopics as one watches. But Gray and his chief collaborators the talented author Lauren Hillenbrand and the splendid cast headed by Jeff Bridges Chris Cooper and coproducer Tobey McGuire have nonetheless provided us with a quite wonderful movie as much for its surefire writing and brilliant editing as for any of the acting.Everyone must agree that the three men behind the most famous horse of his time are played by three of the best actors Hollywood now has to offer. Critics are in accord in saying Cooper's performance is the subtlest and the most real he models the principle that Less is More. Tobey McGuire isn't given quite enough to do his greatest accomplishment may be his lean look he's barely recognizable and as a former redhead myself I don't think the dye job is as bad as some have claimed. Bridges is in his way magnificent but glossily iconic and therefore somewhat opaque. His resemblance to Franklin D. Roosevelt is pushed a bit too hard as is the whole uplifting populist message  the we didn't fix the horse. He fixed us  and we fixed each other' and sometimes all somebody needs is a second chance' stuff. It's pretty corny. But within the context of this beautifully made movie that believes in itself we buy it.It's important anyway  if young people do come to see Seabiscuit  for them to get the simplified but nonetheless just portrait of the times provided with authentic stills and footage and the voiceover narration by iconic historian David The Civil War McCullough. The travelogue of the Depression and Prohibition years includes a quiet but heartfelt plug for FDR and that too is moving especially in today's postYuppie mood of numbingly exploitive jingoism.Indeed each of the three actors gives a powerfully understated performance  they're like thoroughbreds who're never given their head  whose litotes a word schoolboys learned back then enhances the movie's epic quality by never letting us forget that their triumphs were snatched from deprivation and adversity.The long time devoted to the three men's backgrounds early in the movie isn't ill spent. It establishes the leisurely pace that is the essence of epic. But these backstories aren't as necessary as the filmmakers may have thought. And despite the slow movement there isn't deep detail. There's barely one scene to establish Red Pollard's McGuire's literate closeknit family before he's cast heartbreakingly out of it. Charles Howard's Bridge's loss of his son is too telegraphic though it's a fine touch to show him wailing with the boy's body but with his voice barely audible it's one more example of the movie's sense of the period and of its restraint.Right from the first the horse races are astonishing in the camera's closeness and vividness the way we feel the danger and physicality of the jockeys' brutal competition with one another. Since we know Pollard is a failed prizefighter and general scrapper we take in stride that fact that he's physically fighting with other jockeys during the early races. This is a movie about horse racing and the races had better be terrific and they are. It's when we see the power of those sequences that we realize Seabiscuit has the makings of a popular classic.Jeff Bridges' performance in particular seems etched in stone. There are touches of Jimmy Stewart Joseph Cotton even Orson Welles in his role and his looks. The chameleon Bridges comes carrying traces of Coppola's Tucker but he has entered into the period and the tradition with utter conviction. Cooper's austere minimalism because it is the essential spirit of the movie its understatement litotes is the central performance. He is a man who communicates better with horses than with men. McGuire's performance is the noisiest but he too reflects the social restraints of the period and his wings are clipped before the final triumph can take place. This was a time when people had superiors and recognized it by calling them Sir and Mister. Everyone male wore a suit and tie even jockeys off duty.Seabiscuit's ability to tug at the heartstrings first appears when Red Pollard is let go by his destitute father so he can be a jockey. The moment is deeply sad because what seems an act of heroic renunciation by a loving parent is in fact abandonment and it feeds the young man's rage thenceforth. And it's more complex than that because it grows out of the enormous pressures of the Depression a time when millions in America wandered westward deprived of everything but their cars and a few possessions.Not only Bridges' performance but whole sequences of Seabiscuit seem etched in stone and contain examples of textbookperfect editing that possesses sweep and complexity and advances the story while keeping our focus on the prevailing mood.This is of course the classic American story of triumph out of defeat and resolution out of conflict. As is a little too clearly pointed out all three men Charles Howard Tom Smith and Red Pollard have had great devastation and loss in their lives echoed by the whole country's economic devastation failure and loss of nerve and it's implied  with some failure of restraint  that Seabiscuit's underdog triumphs were as needed as the New Deal. Their horse was rescued by Smith Chris Cooper when it was going to be shot because it seemed unruly and untrainable. Out of all this failure and tragedy the men forge their victories Seabiscuit the horse that lacked breeding was untrainable and was too small' Pollard abandoned by his parents beaten in many prize fights secretly blind in one eye and too big' to be a top jockey Smith a gifted horse tamer and trainer reduced to riding the rails and hoboing Bridges the selfmade millionaire devastated by the destruction of all his hopes in a ruined economy and the sudden death of his young only son. They bond together to make Seabiscuit into one of the greatest racehorses in history. Who wouldn't be moved by this? Only the conventional fat man who's War Admiral's snobbish Maryland owner. It's all about heart and Seabiscuit's got it.William H. Macy's caricatured portrait of an alcoholic radio announcer is a highlight in the sense of a bright spot on a painting. It's a shrill and brittle performace that we tolerate because of the moments of relief Macy's little comic vignettes provide. Subtlety is sacrificed to provide an effect and to brush in a bit of humor amid all the earnestness. One only wishes there were more of a progression that the character didn't sip from the same bottle in every scene but got drunker or soberer as things went along.We have to allow for the exigencies of filmmaking that required ten horses to be used for Seabiscuit leading to the irony that this unique horse is a composite.If you accept its conventionality Seabiscuit is not just a good movie but a great one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sea Biscuit is a story about a long shot horse and a man who discover each other on the road to equestrian glory. An extremely rewarding journey though the lives of man and beast. Every aspect of human emotion bonding and courage is explored with an equine tinge. Set in a time when horse racing is more passion than business Seabiscuit glorifies the positive appeal of horse racing. Every derby event is an emotional doorway which lifts your spirits. Be it the Santa Anita or the Pimilco you are just just hanging on the edge of your seat praying vying and hoping for a Seabiscuit win. Such is the emotional grasp and visual brilliance of Gary Ross's direction and Scwartzman's cinematography. Being a thoroughbred race horse by birth Seabiscuit treads the race track under the watchful eyes of trainer Tom Smith played by Chris Cooper and jockey Red Poddard played by Tobey Mcguire. What follows is a sequence of predictable vicissitudes. Why! This movie wasn't advertised in the mystery genre either! A frail looking really Tobey manages to deeply bond with the horse at least on screen kudos indeed. Nobody else could have possibly fit into his role as well as he did physically too. Chris Cooper is the silent marvel. There is a completely subtle tinge to his acting which lays low yet beautifully exuberates class. Seabiscuit is simply one of those silent' movies which just hurtles you beyond imaginable frontiers. Sit back and relax and let the long shot consume you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have not read the book or anything about the story this movie was based on  I might have to now since I enjoyed the movie so much. The point of my writing this is to say if you haven't read the book you will probably like this movie. I'm sure the book portrayed so much more but I don't think you can directly compare movies and books. In most cases I have never loved a movie as much as a book  but that doesn't mean the movie should be disregarded. In some cases emotion can be better portrayed on film. please note that all my quotes are paraphrased from what i remember and only set aside in   to distinguish it from my writing. That said I completely disagree with the first reviewer above who did read the book first. I really DID get the message about what Seabiscuit represented at that time a second chance rising above expectations against all odds and most of all  HOPE. When I told someone I just saw Seabiscuit they said oh that's about the horse right? and I said no it's really a story of hope and rising above tough circumstances  but there is a horse in it. I was surprised at how much history and how many images of the depression were gracefully woven into Seabiscuit. I thought it worked very well and added to the realism of the film. I also definitely understood that Red Pollard's family was wealthy and that they lost everything in the depression. It's pretty obvious  the whole family is shown around a great big dinner table in a very nice house his father even buys him his own horse. Next time you see them they are basically living out of their car with a whole bunch of other folks doing the same  a kind of depression era makeshift camp.It's also made clear later on in the movie that he never saw his family again  there are auditory flashbacks to his parents saying they will call him how he almost dumps all his books into the water the fact that next time we see him he's a young man and there's no mention of his family ever again in the movie. Seems like they just disappeared  and they did. Red also displays anger and frustration that is noticed by other characters. To me this points to a sense of abandonment by his family. Also unlike the other reviewer I DID care a lot about the race with War Admiral  in fact i almost had to just skip to the end first because I was so nervous about it! This was NOT just a story of profit. In fact it never seemed like that was Howard's goal at all  his goal was to prove that the underdog can and will win  to prove that heart and spirit mattered as much as or even more than wealth and breeding. That seemed to be the point of the match race with War Admiral. This is a story of rising above profit to reach an even greater goal. It's an uplifting story as you can see in the crowd's faces as Howard tells them just because he's beaten down by a nose doesn't mean he's out. and When the little guy doesn't know he's the little guy he can do great big things. You can picture the men and women unemployed and hungry telling themselves these same words. Things will get better we may be down but we're not out. In the words of Tom Smith You can't throw a whole life away just because it's banged up a bit. Red's words at the end are touching as well seabiscuit fixed us and in a sense we fixed each other.' Red overcame his anger his fear his sense of hopelessness. So did Seabiscuit. And if they can so can you.".

It's a great reminder that there had been people  of yesteryears  who had been brave and courageous to accept the underdogs with heartfelt benevolence.As a film revolving around the inspiring story of Seabiscuit it works well. It connects the cultural icon with the life paths of three men of different social standings leading me through a mixed journey of tragedies and jubilation risks disappointments and exuberance. It shows how these men and beast overcome incredible odds to achieve their goals. The bonding of the quartet is wonderfully captured in this film. Watching the horse transformed into a winner is as aesthetically beautiful as seeing 'Cinderella' transformed into a beauty by her three 'fairy godmothers.' This film has a compelling story that salutes the American dream.This adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's book unfortunately does omit a great deal of the interesting biographical accounts of the trio's lives and the historical impressions of the nation's era between 19031940. But Director Gary Ross watch out for his cameo appearance does provide sufficient background to the lives of Charles Howard Jim Smith and Red Pollard to justify how the trio becomes ultimately involved with the life of Seabiscuit. The small spirited bay is first introduced as a colt and Red as a young kid both ultimately separated from their parents and both subjecting the viewers never to forget their crooked legs and their predisposition for indolence!  Strangely the film does show many similarities in traits and circumstances between Seabiscuit and Red. Jeff Bridges Chris Cooper and Toby Maguire are impressive in their roles. They are convincing sources to what is meant by perseverance and triumph. William H. Macy does 'ticktock' through several scenes to provide the comic relief.The film is filled with dramatically charming appeal and beauty yet it has not failed to expose the brutality of horseracing.  even if Seabiscuit's glory had distracted millions away from the political social and economic woes of their times. The visuals for the story's historical era are wonderfully detailed creating a sense of realism to the period the characters and events.  The choice of Randy Newman's music scores helps build up the viewers' emotions especially in the race scenes.Seabiscuit is a winner!A".

While the movie describes War Admiral as being a huge horse close to eighteen hands tall the reallife War Admiral was well known for being one of the smallest sons of Man o' War .

If Seabiscuit wasn't based on true events this movie would have looked like another classic Disneymovie. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with these kinds of movies but what usually disturbs me is the fact that they are so unbelievable and predictable.Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance as Red Pollard the young but very talented jockey. Many other great performances in this movie by the always enjoyable Jeff Bridges the outstanding Chris Cooper Adaptation. and the beautiful Elizabeth Banks Spiderman who plays Bridges' second wife.Although this second Gary Rossmovie is less my kind of movie than Pleasentville was I truly enjoyed watching it. He is an excellent director and outstanding screenwriter. I certainly would like seeing more of his work. Recommendable and enjoyable sports movie. Not exactly an intense and gripping drama but worth a watch! 7510".

	schema:reviewBody "Though I enjoyed this film I have to agree that it doesn't quite make it  it feels a bit too much like a documentary with some rather familiar melodramatic moments thrown in.  Having just read the book and watched the movie backtoback I especially noticed where they oversimplified the story I know  it can't be helped when transferring a story from page to screen where they changed the facts and where they oversimplified the message too.  I know it's nitpicking but I just want to mention the following points1 Red Pollard's parents did NOT in any way abandon him despite losing their money.  He was the one who wanted to try to make his way in the world.  It was the family friend who was supposed to be looking out for him who abandoned him.2 Charles Howard's son was 16 not 12 when he died in a car accident going fishing and not because his father pressured him in any way.3 As I understand it Red Pollard never told anyone except his wife that he was blind in his right eye and Charles Howard and Tom Smith both went to their graves without realizing that their former jockey could only see out of one eye.4The movie turns Tom Smith into a kind of clichd horse whisperer which was true but it left out his very marked ornery side  the mind games he was always playing with reporters the fact that he cared more about horses than people to the point of not even noticing when one of his underlings was very sick.5 The movie does not show the extent of Red Pollard's injuries  he had not one but three serious riding accidents before winning the Santa Anita including the one where he lost his sight.  Yes his leg was shattered but that was only part of it.  He paid for his success with his health and suffered chronic pain for the rest of his life from the injuries he sustained.  Of course that doesn't play very well in a You can do anything if only you believe and work hard kind of movie but IMO sometimes the price of achieving a particular dream is too high.6 The movie also mostly leaves out the class struggle that Laura Hillenbrand depicts so clearly in her book.  One of the reasons Pollard suffered so much was because nobody especially the horseowners cared about the safety or welfare of the jockeys Howard being an honourable exception.  This might have been harder to show on film but I think it would have made a more complex and more interesting movie.7 Just my opinion but I didn't much like the actress who played Marcella Howard.  MH seems to have been a unique and interesting person and this actress seems rather generic to me.  Plus I gather that MH was Mexican or at least Hispanic.  I don't know whether she did or not but I pictured her speaking with a slight Mexican accent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember a Three Stooges short where whenever Curley would see cheese he would freak out and the only way to calm him down was to rub a tassel under his chin. Never mind the fact that I enjoyed that more than Seabiscuit I was struck that in much the same way it seems writerdirectorproducerClinton speech writer Gary Ross thinks he can keep his audience from revolting by using slick cinematography and Irish penny whistles in the movie Seabiscuit. This movie is cheese but it's tricky little tassels did not fool me or calm me down. I use the term 'movie' loosely as one would in regards to a two hour political commercial. Their candidate wants to kill your pets with a giant knife! Our candidate wants to give everybody a hug and free money. I was eager to see this film going in I thought the trailer looked fantastic I enjoy sentimental feel good films if done well the cast was great wonderful story etc... But halfway through Seabiscuit mind you not knowing who made the film I leaned over to the person with me and said was this directed by Bill Clinton? When I got home I looked it up. I was close one of his speech writers. That Seabiscuit is not panned across the board is a tragic sign at how effective the media has become at lulling people especially it's own into a false sense of superiority. I mean that. Many a demagogue has taken advantage of such weaknesses.This is NOT a good movie. It is hardly even a movie. It is a set of images and messages most unrelated and pointless meant to stimulate your feel good senses like a political speech. The true story of Seabiscuit is one of the most inspiring movie ideas in decades. It is almost a guaranteed hit. Almost. Leave it to Spielberg's buddies producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall to drop the ball. Can you say Congo? I know this sounds snobby and I hate snobs but this film can only be enjoyed by the very simple. I'm not talking about Capracorn like simple my favorite film is It's a Wonderful Life I'm talking about Rambo III like simple. Independence Day simple. Propaganda simple. I present the following to make my caseExhibit A The screenplay it stunk. Ross wrote it. In lieu of possible elements like oh say  character development? he uses a narrator. On a side note Ross foolishly employs David McCullough from Ken Burns epic civil war series. This made the film feel like it couldn't make up its mind whether it was a documentary or a feature film. Back to the horrible writing Using a narrator was nothing more than a diversion to cover up the fact that Ross couldn't convert the information in the best selling book to dialog. Every time the narrator spoke it took you out of the movie and made you think of the documentary. It did not fit with this format. Here's a thought Gary have the characters or action explain the story.. Imagine if a similar film say Rocky had a narrator.Exhibit B Pacing most of the scenes especially in the beginning were choppy and too fast. As mentioned the narration also ruins the pace. Is this the editors fault? I don't know but it drove me crazy. Not that good pacing will fix a story that isn't making sense.Exhibit C Directing many of the characters show confusing emotions for unexplained reasons except perhaps to manipulate gullible audience members. At any rate much of the emotions make no sense. A good example of this is the poetry at the dinner table scene. It is downright laughable. Red's mother told his father Red needed to earn a horse not just be given one. So the father makes young Red earn his horse by reciting a poem from memory which he cannot do. The father finishes the poem for Red and suddenly everyone at the table is cheering and Red gets his horse. What? Did I miss something here? If you don't think about it however it doesn't matter.Exhibit D Story line It had too many a problem that seems to plague modern film making. Pick a storyline and stick with it. It's like the clowns that make Dumbo jump from the elephants If 40 feet was funny 80 feet will be twice as funny! So far as I can tell there were no less than five story lines in Seabiscuit.Exhibit E Cinematography Stunning like in one of those fancy orange juice commercials. In fact too good. Too perfect too contrived too Pepperidge Farms fancy commercial in the US. It was obvious it was there for me to admire not to communicate the story. Exhibit FSoundtrack I found the soundtrack to be inappropriate to the action. From the beginning it felt like I was watching the ending of the movie. Obvious sappy manipulative and annoying. I expected a slowmotion pan of an Indian crying while trash is thrown from cars.Closing arguments This film's failure can be summed up by it's 'chockfullo' style imagery. There were too many pointless close ups of cool looking props. I felt like I was watching a gay rodeo. Certain shots seemed to be included for no other reason than that they looked cool. Never mind the fact that it creates a red herring for the viewer. But apparently if peoples positive comments on the IMDb can be trusted making sense is not high on anyone's priority list. I therefore ask the jury to find the defendant Gary Ross guilty of crappy film making and that Seabiscuit be given the maximum punishment of a 1 awful rating.".

Never mind the fact that I enjoyed that more than Seabiscuit I was struck that in much the same way it seems writerdirectorproducerClinton speech writer Gary Ross thinks he can keep his audience from revolting by using slick cinematography and Irish penny whistles in the movie Seabiscuit. This movie is cheese but it's tricky little tassels did not fool me or calm me down. I use the term 'movie' loosely as one would in regards to a two hour political commercial. Their candidate wants to kill your pets with a giant knife! Our candidate wants to give everybody a hug and free money. I was eager to see this film going in I thought the trailer looked fantastic I enjoy sentimental feel good films if done well the cast was great wonderful story etc... But halfway through Seabiscuit mind you not knowing who made the film I leaned over to the person with me and said was this directed by Bill Clinton? When I got home I looked it up. I was close one of his speech writers. That Seabiscuit is not panned across the board is a tragic sign at how effective the media has become at lulling people especially it's own into a false sense of superiority. I mean that. Many a demagogue has taken advantage of such weaknesses.This is NOT a good movie. It is hardly even a movie. It is a set of images and messages most unrelated and pointless meant to stimulate your feel good senses like a political speech. The true story of Seabiscuit is one of the most inspiring movie ideas in decades. It is almost a guaranteed hit. Almost. Leave it to Spielberg's buddies producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall to drop the ball. Can you say Congo? I know this sounds snobby and I hate snobs but this film can only be enjoyed by the very simple. I'm not talking about Capracorn like simple my favorite film is It's a Wonderful Life I'm talking about Rambo III like simple. Independence Day simple. Propaganda simple. I present the following to make my caseExhibit A The screenplay it stunk. Ross wrote it. In lieu of possible elements like oh say  character development? he uses a narrator. On a side note Ross foolishly employs David McCullough from Ken Burns epic civil war series. This made the film feel like it couldn't make up its mind whether it was a documentary or a feature film. Back to the horrible writing Using a narrator was nothing more than a diversion to cover up the fact that Ross couldn't convert the information in the best selling book to dialog. Every time the narrator spoke it took you out of the movie and made you think of the documentary. It did not fit with this format. Here's a thought Gary have the characters or action explain the story.. Imagine if a similar film say Rocky had a narrator.Exhibit B Pacing most of the scenes especially in the beginning were choppy and too fast. As mentioned the narration also ruins the pace. Is this the editors fault? I don't know but it drove me crazy. Not that good pacing will fix a story that isn't making sense.Exhibit C Directing many of the characters show confusing emotions for unexplained reasons except perhaps to manipulate gullible audience members. At any rate much of the emotions make no sense. A good example of this is the poetry at the dinner table scene. It is downright laughable. Red's mother told his father Red needed to earn a horse not just be given one. So the father makes young Red earn his horse by reciting a poem from memory which he cannot do. The father finishes the poem for Red and suddenly everyone at the table is cheering and Red gets his horse. What? Did I miss something here? If you don't think about it however it doesn't matter.Exhibit D Story line It had too many a problem that seems to plague modern film making. Pick a storyline and stick with it. It's like the clowns that make Dumbo jump from the elephants If 40 feet was funny 80 feet will be twice as funny! So far as I can tell there were no less than five story lines in Seabiscuit.Exhibit E Cinematography Stunning like in one of those fancy orange juice commercials. In fact too good. Too perfect too contrived too Pepperidge Farms fancy commercial in the US. It was obvious it was there for me to admire not to communicate the story. Exhibit FSoundtrack I found the soundtrack to be inappropriate to the action. From the beginning it felt like I was watching the ending of the movie. Obvious sappy manipulative and annoying. I expected a slowmotion pan of an Indian crying while trash is thrown from cars.Closing arguments This film's failure can be summed up by it's 'chockfullo' style imagery. There were too many pointless close ups of cool looking props. I felt like I was watching a gay rodeo. Certain shots seemed to be included for no other reason than that they looked cool. Never mind the fact that it creates a red herring for the viewer. But apparently if peoples positive comments on the IMDb can be trusted making sense is not high on anyone's priority list. I therefore ask the jury to find the defendant Gary Ross guilty of crappy film making and that Seabiscuit be given the maximum punishment of a 1 awful rating.";

Because The Count of Monte Cristo has swordplay does that make it a ripoff of all of the Zorro movies or the Robin Hood movies?  Does the fact that Spiderman is a Marvel Superhero make it a ripoff of The XMen?  Of course not. And only the very basic storylines make Enough and Sleeping... similar at all. Let me illustrate...In Sleeping with the Enemy Julia Roberts plays a weak willed woman who stays with her mentally abusive husband until she finally has enough and leaves when she gets the chance to fake her death. Julia never changes...always the weak willed scared out of her gourd hiding wife.In Enough Jennifer Lopez plays a strong minded woman who decides to leave her abusive husband as soon as she finds out what he is really like. Jennifer never changes either...but in this case she maintains her strength and although scared out of her gourd also she sets out to confront him in a physical battle...his forte usually. This movie was great entertainment. Anyone who says they felt this was a total yawner with no tension at all is too critical. This is what entertainment is about. This was a great way to spend 2 hours as far as I am concerned.Ms Lopez is becoming a better actress with each film. But as far as the female actresses go in this flick...the little girl who portrayed Jennifer's daughter outacted everyone else...male or female. Two thumbs UP for this little lady!!".

Jennifer never changes either...but in this case she maintains her strength and although scared out of her gourd also she sets out to confront him in a physical battle...his forte usually. This movie was great entertainment. Anyone who says they felt this was a total yawner with no tension at all is too critical. This is what entertainment is about. This was a great way to spend 2 hours as far as I am concerned.Ms Lopez is becoming a better actress with each film. But as far as the female actresses go in this flick...the little girl who portrayed Jennifer's daughter outacted everyone else...male or female. Two thumbs UP for this little lady!!";

To say this finale is morally ambiguous and simplistic is being very very kind but then again so is referring to this thing a film and I've already done that so who cares.The style could accurately be described as softcorepornwithoutthesex and someone should tell Michael Apted that nobody's interested in that.  As for the cast J. is her usual blank self Billy Campbell sleepwalks through his cartoonvillain role Potato Face is among the more irritating movie children in recent memory Juliette Lewis continues her career degeneration and man does Fred Ward look old.

The real paradox about this film despite being disorganized and random it somehow manages to be totally predictable.For those who haven't seen it the basic plot is that a WONDERFUL guy marries jlo and gives her everything she wants. 5 years into the marriage his pager goes off and she looks at the number instantly comes to the conclusion that he's cheating on her. She decides to leave in the middle of the night while he's asleep in the room rather than during the hours and hours he's away during the daytime. So he decides to kick jlo in the face a bunch of times which doesn't leave a scratch on her. The rest of the movie is basically him pursuing her.So she runs away and he chases after her trying VERY visibly and publicly to kill her. By publicly i mean doing things like... knocking down total strangers to run up to a bus she's on then pounding on the side of the bus while screaming something to the effect of I AM GOING TO KILL YOU AS SOON AS I CATCH YOU BITCH... or kicking in hotel room doors... or sending goons to vandalize the place she's living at who delight us by delivering gripping and thrilling lines like Hey Bitch do you know what it feels like to die because you are so stupid?. In fact i think the word bitch occurs once for every 3 spoken lines.The characters fail to achieve even a meager 2 dimensions even cartoon villains are more conflicted than these characters. The bad guys i.e. men are 100 evil and unremorseful and the good guys i.e. girls are perfect and pure in their motivations.If you enjoyed this movie be sure to also catch Troll 2 and Panic Room and Road Rage.

This technique of segmenting Jennifer Lopez's body sends a message to the female audience that it is Slim's physical appearance that develops her as a strong woman and gives her the power to fight' back not her intellect.  Even though Slim breaks away from the abusive relationship with her husband she is still dependent on a male character throughout the film.  First it is her fairytalelike father who supports her financially.  Next her new lover Joe supports her emotionally.  The scene in which Joe and Slim lie in bed together suggest that Slim is finally settled into her new life because she has a man at her side.

I'm not laughing at the theme it pretends to deal with marital abuse but rather at the way it was made that includes the horrendous acting the insipid writing and the 'amateurness' of it. Even TV movies have better portrayed the theme of marital abuse. 'Enough' is as clichd as they get. The writing is just so bad and predictable and the whole theme is dealt with in such a filmy and pretentious way that 'Enough' qualifies as a Bgrade film. There is no character development. Jennifer Lopez seems to have been losing the little acting talent that was apparent in films like 'Selena' and 'Out of Sight'. Thankfully she's back in form in the later released 'An Unfinished Life'. To be a little fair to Lopez the camera seems more concerned about her hot physique. Billy Campbell plays the clichd abusive dad. Juliette Lewis does well in an insignificant role. Her choice of films reflects why her career is fading. Noah Wyle does well as a scumbag cop. Then there's that child actress who's one of the many annoying young actors. A fellow user rightfully labelled her 'potatoface'. Her overdone cuteness is cringeworthy e.g. the 'taint' is 'paint' reference some obvious weak symbolism thrown into it. It is after all director Apted's fault to not be able to make a worthy film that deals with marital abuse in a mature way rather than insult the viewer's intelligence.".

Now I wasn't offended by the film's depiction of men.  It was just laughable.  In Thelma and Louise some of the male characters were portrayed negatively but in a believable fashion.  And that film was actually written by a feminist!  In this case we have a onedimensional abusive husband who slaps his wife and spouts out such cliched dialogue as I make the money in this house!  We go by my rules!  His wife catches him cheating one night and suddenly he loses his conscience?  Come on she did marry the guy!  He can't be that coldblooded.  That proves that this is no more than a propaganda film that preaches its message like a minister at his morning sermon.  Yes millions of women in this world get abused.  But usually there's some sort of motive behind itwhether or not it makes sense.  And if not it's due to alcoholism or drugs.  The husband's anger in this story is merely a setup for a final kickboxing match between him and JLo.  So if you've seen the trailers you've seen it all.  No surprises here.  And can someone please explain why her exboyfriend is the nicest guy you can possibly meet?  This gent travels to the ends of the earth for her providing shelter for her and her daughter covering up for her when the FBI comes to search the place.  Yet she dumped HIM?  That's one mystery I have yet to find out  Why is that in movies the exlovers are always so much more likable than their current lovers?    Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress but she doesn't have much to work with here.  Her job is to cry and scream like a hammy soap opera actress until she finally transforms into Rambo in the third act.  There are no thrills or chills.  All the suspense is pure cliche.  We have the ringing telephone and even one scene in which JLo's daughter is playing with a basketball it rolls away and the ball is stopped by...take a guess!  The dialogue becomes more and more horrible by the nanosecond.  Juliette Lewis seems totally misplaced in a thankless role written for a fourthrate actress.   Domestic abuse is a serious subject but in this film it's totally trivialized to conventional thriller.  If you want to see a more believable film about domestic violence watch the John Travolta film Domestic Disturbance.  This would've made a good PSA but why waste time and resources making this into a bigbudget Hollywood movie?  I can't say this is simply a JLo vehicle especially since she's far from glamourized in this role sporting a short hairdo and having her face bruised through half of the movie.  Her past films like The Wedding Planner and Angel Eyes were JLo vehicles but I liked those two movies.  It's films like this that will help end her career.  The only thing a movie like this is worth is a barrell of unintentional laughs.  If you treat this as a comedy you might be somewhat entertained. 'Cause every aspect of this film is funny  the dialogue the countless cliches the cardboard characters.  Hell I probably got more laughs out of Enough than Corky Romano.  Women will probably cheer when JLo gives her husband the 12 punch.  But if you're not a woman or the average woman you will find this pseudothriller completely laughable.  My score  3 out of 10".

Poor J Lo although the guy might have been mad at her because she was so awful to do a scene with? Well she eventually breaks away from this really bad guy and learns karate. Uhhh yeah really that is what she does. Uhhh everything is going to be alright in the end. You know on a related subject. People are all saying what a really bad movie Gigli was another JLo vehicle. However this rancid piece of garbage was worse. Heck it even took Noah Wylie who was riding high off of his performance in Donnie Darko and placed him in the role of a complete joke. Putrid movie! I am sickened just talking about this.".

Either catch you favorite classic or any modern Western you like or just sit on the porch with a beer and enjoy in yourself. It is better than watching this garbage that will only put you in upset state.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Asylum have made the odd halfway decent movie though their best don't rise beyond that. Most of their resume is either very bad or bottomofthebarrel stuff. Luckily for 6 Guns it is one of their more tolerable outings. It is less than perfect though. There are stretches throughout the movie where it is too slowly paced and unfortunately in those moments there is not much happening to disguise that problem. When the action it was good and brutal there was just too little of it and when it wasn't there that was when the film started to drag. Sage Mears has a sort of sweet and sour role that requires many emotions but while she is beautiful she doesn't convince as a vengeful woman she is rather emotionless with no fire behind the eyes and even when she is raped people who have lost any kind of sporting round have shown much more emotion. It is not without its anachronismsthe use of the term crackpot really jarred with the period and outside of the heroes and villains the characters are onedimensional with not that much development to them. On the plus side 6 Guns is one of The Asylum's better looking movies the photography is not choppy and the sets look great with a much cleaner look. The soundtrack I really liked too the criticisms that it is too modern is valid but whether it's memorable and gives the sense of adventure and danger matters even more the score for 6 Guns does fit those qualities. The script is certainly tighter and less cheesy than usual and it also deserves credit for sticking true to the western theme. It isn't best screenplay quality but for The Asylum it is a step up. The story is not particularly original but there is some strong tension and the first 20 minutes is harrowing unnerving and actually very difficult to look away. Aside from Mears the acting is quite good. Barry Van Dyke does grizzled and stoic quite well Geoff Meed is ruthlessly snarky and menacing and Greg Evigan plays admirable and stern endearingly. Even Shane Van Dyke is tolerable and I don't rate him highly as an actor at all and directingwise this is far more assured and competent than Titanic II and Paranormal Entity. All in all not that bad for The Asylum it is one of their better efforts definitely. 610 Bethany Cox".

Antiques yes  rare no!6 Guns is actually a pretty typical western movie. The plot is predictable the scenery including the old western town is prototypical. Some idiot reviewer has written as criticism that the wood in the jail is modern lumber painted to look old and stuff like that. Why didn't he or she simply sit back and enjoy the movie for crying out loud? That same person probably makes notes of all the spelling mistakes he finds on road signs and in restaurant menus rather than enjoying the scenery or the food!Someone else has written that Barry van Dyke Frank Allison is the image of his dad Dick but I found it uncanny that every time he appeared on screen wearing his hat all I could think of was the late great Jack Pallance when he was that age! Sage Mears as Selina Stevens in her first full length movie role was believably good enough to carry the part off. She wasn't overconfident and really came across as a young mother who had watched her two little boys and husband murdered in front of her before herself being gangraped and her desire for revenge was totally understandable. Yes I figured out very early that it would be Selina who would end up getting even with totally evil badguy Lee Horn ex stuntman Geoff Mead and to be honest I would have been disappointed if that had not been the case.I wonder how many sons have directed their dads in lead roles as well as a brother and themselves in movies. Pity Shane couldn't have fitted granddad other brother Wes and sister Taryn in somewhere too. Then it would have been a real family affair!Anyway I enjoyed 6 Guns for what it was and I believe what it was intended to be  a movie that arouses the viewers' anger and desire to see justice whatever that might be done. So I give it 7 and will look forward to and watch any sequel's Shane decides to make after all Frank did ride off into the sunset and Selina did offer to help him if he needed help!

But I decided to stick it out though to be quite honest I wish I hadn't. I will admit the production values are a notch better than most other Asylum movies and the movie is a bit less stupid. But what a long and painful slog the movie is all the same. The problem isn't that the core store is overly familiar  any plot can be made to be engaging with the right treatment  but that its execution is painful. The movie is unbelievably slow with a great amount of padding and scenes go by at a snail's pace. The characters are either cliched or poorly developed. The bad guys only have two scenes in the first half of the movie! And there is not only very little action what action there is happens to be really sluggish and not the least bit exciting. A better western with the same basic premise is the 1971 movie Hannie Caulder  watch that instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know that there are a lot of haters when it comes to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom it has it's flaws and is by no means the strongest movie of the Indiana Jones series but I just have so many good memories about this film and still to this day when I watch it it gives me chills and excitement. The characters are memorable the script is great and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction editing even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy the two new side kicks to Indiana's new adventure. Now I agree Willy can get a little annoying here and there but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series Okey dokey Dr. Jones hold on to your potato! cheesy but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee this was the role that was meant for him.In this prequel we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl Willie. They escape together with Indiana's little side kick Short Round and accidentally without knowing they've escaped onto Lao Che's air plane. They wind up in India where they find out about these rocks that can restore the village they're in also the children have been kidnapped by Mola Ram and Indiana must free the kids and restore the rocks so the village can be safe again.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fun sequel I don't know why people complain so much about it. I can understand if people say it's the weakest of the series but on it's own this is a fantastic movie. It's one of my biggest recommendations to my friends as well as other film viewers. It just has everything you could want action romance alligators and heart sacrifices lol OK that sounded gross just trust me this that this is such a fun movie. It's one of my favorite films I know that sounds bad but I just love this film. It's a lot of fun and Indiana and Short Round are just the best buddies to watch argue on screen. This is an awesome sequel definitely a must see.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone complains about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One of my friends and I used to argue for months on end about which Indian Jones film was the superior. Almost anyone we ask say that Temple of Doom is their least favorite and the worst in the Jones trilogy. I believe the only reason people say this is because it's the middle film sandwiched between an all time classic and a Hollywood blockbuster. To me there is NO question that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the far superior Indiana Jones film. To anyone who says Last Crusade is the best I can do nothing but disagree let me point out that all THREE films are nothing short of phenomenal. Temple of Doom had so much to live up to after the first film and instead of trying to recreate Raiders something I feel Crusade did Lucas and Spielberg decided to take the franchise in a new direction. In my opinion this was a great idea. Crusade and Raiders are too similar both of them take place in desert terrain both have Indy going after a very famous biblical artifact and both have Indy fighting off the Nazi's from attaining this object for global domination. Without Temple of Doom Last Crusade would be an obvious copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A different style of Indy film is needed to expand the trilogy making Indiana Jones a truly global character and Temple of Doom did just that.The film itself is a nonstop action adventure ride. Harrison Ford is once again AMAZING as the dashing professorarchaeologist thrill seeker. Short Round is a loveable character who adds a humorous touch and reveals the more compassionate side of Indy's character. The ceremony scenes are truly breathtaking and tense. During these scenes the film contains some very graphic images but are used justifiably to convey the real dark feel of this film i.e. the removing of the man's heart while he's still alive and lowering him into a fiery pit. The mine cart chase scenes are the most amazing fast moving action sequence in any of the Indy films and you feel like you're on a roller coaster each time you watch it. All these events lead to the film's spectacular and memorable climax.I know with three films as amazing as the Indiana Jones trilogy it's hard to pick a best and worst film in fact it's nearly impossible. I'm just going to say that each film is great on it's own and really shouldn't be compared to the other two.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's funny to call Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom a followup to Raiders of the Lost Ark. This film is a prequel to the 1981 smash hit a movie where the events that take place actually took place before the events in Raiders. Notice at the beginning of Raiders that the year is 1936. In Temple of Doom the year is 1935. See what I mean? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is another rollercoaster ride of a movie brought to life by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Harrison Ford is back as archaeologist Indiana Jones who this time searches for a sacred stone that was stolen from an Indian village. Along for the ride is American singerentertainer Willie Scott Kate Capshaw aka Mrs. Steven Spielberg and little Chinese sidekick Short Round Ke Huy Quan. On their way to finding the stone they stumble across a palace that leads to the gateway of the Temple of Doom run by an evil Thugee cult. The action and special effects are firstrate as you would expect though the story is a tad weaker than it was in Raiders. Plus Capshaw's performance leaves something to be desired. She goes so far overthetop in some scenes that you'd wish Karen Allen would show up as Marion. Nevertheless Capshaw isn't all that bad. She does make an impression during the times when she's not screaming. But Ke Huy Quan now known as Jonathan Ke Quan comes off better as Indy's young sidekick. The following year he starred in the Spielberg produced Richard Donner directed The Goonies but then didn't appear in much after that. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is great fun only if you can get by Kate Capshaw's simpering wimpering character or the overthetop violence. I found it to be exciting from beginning to end.12 out of fourPOINT OF INTEREST this was the film that lead to the creation of the PG13 rating in 1984 along with Spielberg's other 1984 movie Gremlins. Both Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins feature violence that most people felt was too strong for a PG rating though the MPAA felt that it wasn't strong enough to merit an R rating other Spielberg movies that got PG ratings that were quite intense were Jaws Poltergeist and the original Raiders of the Lost Ark. So after Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins opened in theaters at the beginning of the summer movie season of 1984 and became two of that year's biggest hits the MPAA realized a new rating had to be created. The PG13 rating was born. In August 1984 the first movies were released with the new PG13 rating Red Dawn and The Woman in Red. It's not a new rating anymore. The PG13 rating has held up very well these last 18 years and it'll still go strong in the years to come. But I'll always remember Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as the leading factor to the creation of the PG13 rating.".

Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott Kate Capshaw and teenaged pickpocket Short Round Ke Huy Quan he escapes to the airport. However Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies from which they have to make an audacious midair escape when the real pilots bail out midflight! Soon the intrepid trio find themselves in India where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine digging for the sacred Sankara Stones and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels the Temple of Doom.Ford is great as Jones bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part as originally planned? There are some great moments along the way too including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai a particularly funny and exciting runaway minetrain sequence and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the alwayssquealing heroine and the plot seems to overstretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The huntforthemissingchildren plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.".

We get kids on screen for 95 percent of its running time and a Spielbergian kiddie exodus provides the limp hokey finale.To wash it all down we get a forgettable conventional death for a seriously uninteresting villain.

A forgettable arena for the climax etc. This movie is only good for inducing groans. It's a lousy movie that delivers none of the quality of the previous or next entries best for pitching into your own fiery hellpit.";

If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody.John Williams' brilliant music is also at it's best.

The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters which when viewed today at least might seem a little bit dated but still hold up quite well.Or course there's nothing really important about the film.

It also has dumb dialog in a number of spots paying homage to voodooism spells and other nonsense.Yet despite these criticisms it's entertaining starttofinish and has some fantastic visuals.

I also never watched it as much as I can remember Raiders or even Last Crusade the latter I feel like was more of a TV thing like on the USA network. I think the two main things that bog this down are a I don't really care all that much about the quest for the stones  as far as MacGuffins go these are some flimsy MacGuffins which I almost forgot about midway through the movie and b Willie Scott is just a terribly written character.Kate Capshaw it should be said isn't exactly BAD persay but her character is so onedimensional that she's not really given all that much interesting stuff to do except be the uberquintessential DamselinDistress to the point perhaps it was the idea? of parody or as some kind of ditzy sexual object. Her best scene is when she is going back and forth across the room intercut with Jones talking to himself about whether or not to leave the room or wait for the other to come to have 'mating rituals'. Oh she CAN be annoying in her screaming and perpetual HELP MEness and yet it's interesting that some people  not all but some  are more annoyed by Short Round.To put it into Star Wars terms imagine easily enough that Jones is Han Solo and of course both are Ford. Short Round is basically one of the droids doing whatever to help the hero in his quest. Willie on the other hand is no Leia or even a goddamn Padme. It's a flatly written onedimensional object to follow along Dr. Jones on this mission that in the grand scheme of things with this series is a bit superfluous.Some backstory on the production can sometimes help it was a dark time for Lucas as he was going through a divorce and he poured I imagine a lot of that darkness into the depiction of these tribespeople doing their insane rituals involving tornhearts and fires burned and so on underground. Certainly those moments where Jones is in 'evil' mode are scary  though how he just snaps out of it due to fire is just one of those 'things' you really have to suspendtodisbelieve here. And on Spielberg's part he's always there to work and make some craftsmanstuff but his heart is really in a couple of the set pieces like the descending spikes from the ceiling in the trapped room and of course the cartchase.That cartchase is a piece of icon action cinema and for good reason it makes the movie into a literal interpretation of what it's trying to be as a ROLLER COASTER ride. And like roller coasters they're fun they're diverting they may be scary and once they're over you... don't get much substance from them. So Spielberg is there to work but not fully with his heart in it one wonders what he thought of the script on first read from future Howard the Duck scribes Hyuck and Katz and Lucas in a mood that is bizarre and tonally strange. What to make of a movie that has such very dark turns and the ends with the goofiest set piece of Jones chopping a bridge so that the nameless Indians fall to their deaths as hords of crocodiles are just there already waiting.In other words this is the most outlandish CARTOONISH of the bunch. I'd almost like this more if it was an animated movie ironically years later Spielberg would make The Adventures of Tintin a kind of Indiana Jones with a kid as the hero and that somehow is LESS cartoony than this movie with its scenes where everything is over the top. Again it makes for a good ride and Ford is always great as Indiana Jones  yes even in Crystal Skull which I don't think is as bad as has been made out to be  but it's memorable only for the ride aspect not for its particular shall we say pathos.".

From the second Star Wars film in 1980 through to the final Indiana Jones film in 1989 Ford was rarely away from the picture screen. This was not always a good thing however as this middle of the road second adventure about Dr Jones from 1984 proved.In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom we find Dr Jones in Shanghai in 1935. After a violent confrontation with a Chinese villain Jones eventually finds himself in India. Taken to a small village he encounters a badly treated people in need of help. To do this Jones will have to travel to an ancient palace and combat the forces of evil.The key problem with this film is it's problems in the plot department. Whilst a fun film to doze off to on a Sunday afternoon it is by a long distance the worst of the three Indiana Jones films. With a story involving an evil cult underneath an ancient palace the story just doesn't have the special feeling which Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade thrive on. Whether because of a considerable lack of Nazi's this film actually being a prequel to Raiders or because Amrish Puri's Mola Ram just isn't that interesting a character Temple of Doom simply feels lacking.At the same time another problem with this film is the below par standard of acting. With characters like Short Round Jonathan Ke Quan and Willie Scott future Mrs Spielberg Kate Capshaw we should never have expected much but both performances are to say the least dreadful. Add to this some awful performances by the villagefolk who Indy is helping and you know there's problems.It feels a shame that so much of this film is wrong when the other two films of the trilogy are so good. With bad choices in plot and characters Denholm Elliot's Marcus is a necessity for any Indiana Jones film the story never really takes off and feels awkward. At just under two hours long this film seems to drag and makes you feel like your watching all three parts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Still for something to put on television and doze off to it does work wonders. The question though is whether this is actually a good thing.".

The high energy and joy seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark has been replaced with a darker more serious adventure as Indiana is charged with recovering a magic stone for a village in India who has seen drought and all of the children have gone missing. The beginning of the movie is the high point of the film with an extravagant musical number in club Obi Wan oh that George Lucas and his inside Star Wars jokes a Shanghai night club where Indiana is closing a deal over artifacts from the Chinese dynasty. Kate Capshaw is the featured singer and the latest Indiana girl in this film a movie that curiously enough occurs BEFORE Raiders of the Lost Ark so the suspense of Jones' fate if there really was any is removed and so any potential love affairs that fail to carry over between movies. Also missing is John RhysDavies' Sallah and Deholm Elliot's Brody instead we get to see Indy's child helper Short Round who's job is to go into tight quarters and say Doctor Jones about 300 times. The plot is complicated as I had to watch the movie a couple of times to get an idea of was actually happening and unlike the previous film most of the movie happens in one place. The famous scene in this movie is the dinner at the palace where the visitors are treated to chilled monkey brains and other appealing meals. The movie does feature a fantastic scene with an underground rail system that turns into a chase sequence that is filmed well and is enjoyable to watch. This film does not have the whimsy or innocence seen in the other two Indiana movies and suffers because of it. While still an enjoyable film it is the least of the three Indiana movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of 2005 I have never seen any of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Yes I have been living under a rock however I decided I was going to watch them all and soon. I watched Raiders a few weeks ago and now I have finished viewing Temple Of Doom as well. I have to say that I enjoyed Temple Of Doom a tad more than Raiders Of The Lost Ark. I can not compare Last Crusade yet but will shortly.There are many reasons I like this movie better than the first. This seemed like more of a cohesive story to me. By that I mean Indiana does not have to cross into all kinds of different countries for all kinds of different adventures seemingly to just fit as much in the movie as possible. Other than the opening which is meant to introduce Willie Scott Kate Capshaw and Shorty Jonathan Ke Quan and bring them together with Indiana Jones Harrison Ford. Once they are in India they stay in India. There was plenty of trouble in the one country for them to get into.The main plot is that once Indiana and friends are stranded after a plane wreck in India they need to get some special stones for the village. Once they find the Temple Of Doom that is where the story really takes off and gets fun. They discover that the children of the village are slaves to the Indian Chiefs and warriors and make it a point to save them as well. Mola Ram Amrish Puri was a great intimidating character. This was by far his most prominent role in the U.S.For the most part the special effects in this movie were great with a few minor discrepancies not bad at all for 1984. In fact the only reason I can really see for making the 4th installment of Indiana Jones is to use todays technology on this great series. It is bound to have some awesome looking displays. The only thing that truly annoyed me in this film was the constant screaming by Kate Capshaw's character Willie. Man did that ever get tiresome. Overall a great movie which does not need my recommendation but receives it highly. 9.510".

	onyx:emotionText "At the beginning of 2005 I have never seen any of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Yes I have been living under a rock however I decided I was going to watch them all and soon. I watched Raiders a few weeks ago and now I have finished viewing Temple Of Doom as well. I have to say that I enjoyed Temple Of Doom a tad more than Raiders Of The Lost Ark. I can not compare Last Crusade yet but will shortly.There are many reasons I like this movie better than the first. This seemed like more of a cohesive story to me. By that I mean Indiana does not have to cross into all kinds of different countries for all kinds of different adventures seemingly to just fit as much in the movie as possible. Other than the opening which is meant to introduce Willie Scott Kate Capshaw and Shorty Jonathan Ke Quan and bring them together with Indiana Jones Harrison Ford. Once they are in India they stay in India. There was plenty of trouble in the one country for them to get into.The main plot is that once Indiana and friends are stranded after a plane wreck in India they need to get some special stones for the village. Once they find the Temple Of Doom that is where the story really takes off and gets fun. They discover that the children of the village are slaves to the Indian Chiefs and warriors and make it a point to save them as well. Mola Ram Amrish Puri was a great intimidating character. This was by far his most prominent role in the U.S.For the most part the special effects in this movie were great with a few minor discrepancies not bad at all for 1984.

I enjoy Raiders of the Lost Ark even though I find it to be a little politically incorrect and overrated. The Temple of Doom on the other hand is downright atrocious mightily racist and even a tad sexist. Apparently the movie was banned in India and I can understand why since it depicts Indians as miserably poor superstitious knifewaving monkeybraineating lunatics.The really sad part is that the movie stinks even if you manage to ignore the racism. It's chock full of disgusting moments like the beetleeating scene and the part where about a hundred bugs crawl all over Kate Capshaw. It simply pushes the gross envelope too far.Even the neverending action scenes are lacking. They're okay I guess but there's quite a lot of unconvincing blue screen work and the big flood segment doesn't work because water doesn't miniaturize well. As if the special effects weren't bad enough in themselves they're complimented by an obnoxious soundtrack including some unusually bombastic John Williams music and Capshaw's relentless screaming.You know she really is a terrible heroine  annoying and painfully unfunny. A beautiful woman sure but irksome as all getout. It's very surprising in a bad way to see such a lame female character in Indiana Jones after the series started off with Karen Allen's excellent performance as the relatively tough Marion Ravenwood.Capshaw would be quite bad enough by herself but compounding the casting problem there's Ke Huy Quan as Short Round Indy's pointless kid sidekick. Whenever there's a stupid bit of slapstick comedy in the movie Short Round helpfully cries Very funny! Very funny! Which is code for painfully unfunny of course.Weirdly enough Capshaw whose character is called Willie for goodness' sake! and Short Round are really the only characters  the villains are completely faceless. There's a very bizarre segment when Indy puts on his scholarly glasses and has dinner with some people who I guess might qualify as characters but the scene just doesn't fit with the rest of the movie and never for a moment does the dialogue feel real. So in the absence of strong characters the movie just sort of drunkenly reels from fight to fight.I have one last observation. At one moment Indy is waiting in his bedroom expecting Capshaw to come in and have sex with him he's too proud to go to her bedroom. The strange part about this setup is that Short Round is in Indy's bedroom. Soooo...I guess Indy is expecting to have sex in front of Short Round? Isn't that a little strange? Well maybe not I guess the kid has to learn sometime. But maybe Indy should just go to her room huh? Sloppy scenes like that are a sure indication that Spielburg Lucas and co. were really having an off day when they made this. Terrible terrible terrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wouldn't it be really cool to make a James Bond movie? A proper one with Sean Connery.  Steven Spielberg.In a prophetic article on Raiders of the Lost Ark Jonathan Rosenbaum predicted the rise of set piece cinema. He called the directors of these films disciples of Hitchcockian storyboards in which The Sequence becomes the raison d'etre of filmmaking. These sequences would themselves increasingly demand more time and money as the only way to satiated audience would be to offer bigger and more outrageous setpieces.The James Bond franchise was arguably the first big budget series to exploit setpiece cinema. To minimise financial risks each Bond script is virtually identical. The stunts differ the exotic locales are alternated but beyond these superficial changes the Bond plot is always the same. By the time George Lucas started working on Raiders there'd already been 12 Bond flicks. The Bond formula had been set in stone and proven successful. All that was needed were a few minor cosmetic changes and Lucas would have a franchise of his own.As such all four Indiana Jones movies follow the Bond formula precisely. First we have the prestory action sequence a selfcontained action sequence in which Indy searches for an artifact. In Raiders it's a Golden Idol in Temple of Doom it's a flask of Ashes and in The Last Crusade it's the Cross of Coronado. In each film Indy finds the artifact and then promptly loses it to the villains.After this prefilm action sequence we then get the exposition. In the Bond films this is where Bond learns of his mission. In Indiana Jones this is where Indy learns of some religious myth. Bond and Indy then travel to an exotic location Indy typically meets an attractive woman who is always later captured the audience is introduced to the subvillain and we're treated to two action sequences. At the end of the second act Indy and Bond are then always captured by the central villain.Of course our heroes then escape there's a final big action sequence always in Indy's case involving a vehicle and an ending in which the bad guys are killed by the very artifact they sought. There are repeated plot beats like Indy making a deal with the enemy runins with henchmen repeated scenes dealing with Indy's phobias but basically the film follows the standard Bond formula. As Spielberg remarked after first reading the Raiders script It's Bond without the hardware.As all Indiana Jones films are essentially the same the only way to judge them are to pit their action sequences against one another. Each film has 5 action sequences. Raiders has one sequence involving a giant boulder one involving an indoor gunfight one involving a running battle with henchmen in Egypt one involving a fistfight underneath a plane and one involving a moving truck. As what what constitutes action continuously gets faster and harder most of these sequences are deemed tame by modern audiences.Temple also has five showcase sequences. One involving a song and dance routine one involving a chase from henchmen one involving an extended fist fight one involving mine carts and a final showdown on a rope bridge. Most of these sequences have aged well the rope sequence the most tense moment in the trilogy the others striking a tone that alternates between ultra sadistic and goofily overthetop. More than other Indy films Temple still feels audacious part vaudeville movie part musical part quasiracist B movie in the mould of 1930 serials. Opening with a rendition of Anything Goes it's totally ridiculous. Spielberg fans hate it.Crusade likewise has five action sequences. One involving young Indy one involving a Venice chase one involving a showdown with airplanes one involving a motorcycle chase and a final battle in which Indy faces a tank. While the opening and closing sequences are very strong you sense Spielberg bored with everything in between.In contrast Temple is the Indy film which holds up best today its cinematography richer its camera work better its pace faster its tone unashamedly goofy shades of Verhoeven and with a hero who's simultaneously more muscular and more vulnerable than usual. Spielberg would go on to condemn and all but disown the film  he thinks its sadistic and in poor taste he would say the same of Jaws  but it's the fact that Temple embraces the baseness that lurks in all his films that makes this Indy outing less hypocritical. Elsewhere Doom goes beyond emulating its influences Stagecoach Sierra Madre King Soloman's Mines Zorro Valley of the Kings Lawrence of Arabia The Naked Jungle the same plot as Gunga Din often misread as a procolonalist film to replicate wholesale the ColonialistOrientalistracistsexist tone of 1930s serials characters exoticized and demonized the Other base or thoroughly in need of white salvation and the script falling back on various racist binaries. This repeats the treatment of Arabs and Nazis in the other two films the way SpielbergLucas yearn for 1930s popular culture goes hand in hand with the decade's rise in Reaganism.Nowadays of course popcorn films are moving away from what Rosenbaum called set piece cinema. With spectacle dead the majority of modern popcorn flicks abandon elaborate setpieces and instead seek to bombard their audiences with information. This is the postcinema cyber age blockbusters now overwhelming audiences with plot. Thirty years ago we marvelled at Indy outrunning a giant boulder. Today we salivate over narrative gymnastics popcorn plots seeking to excite us with the sheer density of their tales. You know like checking email watching Youtube wheeling through an Ipod ebooking and cybersurfing all at once. Indy would weep.Raiders of the Lost Ark  810 Temple of Doom  8.510 Last Crusade  7.910".

As what what constitutes action continuously gets faster and harder most of these sequences are deemed tame by modern audiences.Temple also has five showcase sequences. One involving a song and dance routine one involving a chase from henchmen one involving an extended fist fight one involving mine carts and a final showdown on a rope bridge. Most of these sequences have aged well the rope sequence the most tense moment in the trilogy the others striking a tone that alternates between ultra sadistic and goofily overthetop. More than other Indy films Temple still feels audacious part vaudeville movie part musical part quasiracist B movie in the mould of 1930 serials. Opening with a rendition of Anything Goes it's totally ridiculous. Spielberg fans hate it.Crusade likewise has five action sequences. One involving young Indy one involving a Venice chase one involving a showdown with airplanes one involving a motorcycle chase and a final battle in which Indy faces a tank. While the opening and closing sequences are very strong you sense Spielberg bored with everything in between.In contrast Temple is the Indy film which holds up best today its cinematography richer its camera work better its pace faster its tone unashamedly goofy shades of Verhoeven and with a hero who's simultaneously more muscular and more vulnerable than usual. Spielberg would go on to condemn and all but disown the film  he thinks its sadistic and in poor taste he would say the same of Jaws  but it's the fact that Temple embraces the baseness that lurks in all his films that makes this Indy outing less hypocritical. Elsewhere Doom goes beyond emulating its influences Stagecoach Sierra Madre King Soloman's Mines Zorro Valley of the Kings Lawrence of Arabia The Naked Jungle the same plot as Gunga Din often misread as a procolonalist film to replicate wholesale the ColonialistOrientalistracistsexist tone of 1930s serials characters exoticized and demonized the Other base or thoroughly in need of white salvation and the script falling back on various racist binaries. This repeats the treatment of Arabs and Nazis in the other two films the way SpielbergLucas yearn for 1930s popular culture goes hand in hand with the decade's rise in Reaganism.Nowadays of course popcorn films are moving away from what Rosenbaum called set piece cinema. With spectacle dead the majority of modern popcorn flicks abandon elaborate setpieces and instead seek to bombard their audiences with information. This is the postcinema cyber age blockbusters now overwhelming audiences with plot. Thirty years ago we marvelled at Indy outrunning a giant boulder. Today we salivate over narrative gymnastics popcorn plots seeking to excite us with the sheer density of their tales. You know like checking email watching Youtube wheeling through an Ipod ebooking and cybersurfing all at once. Indy would weep.Raiders of the Lost Ark  810 Temple of Doom  8.510 Last Crusade  7.910";

What now came was the tritest and offensive truly offensive pile of neverending clichs about India I could ever have imagined. Not even clichs but downright idiotic fantasies such as Indian's eating monkey brains performing voodoo etc etc. And then the depiction of Kali the protecting mother goddess in her ferocious aspect as a king of subAztec monster took the biscuit. Sure her cult has been abused was indeed so by the historical Thugees but Dr Jones should have shown a little more comprehension on these matters. Add to that the invocation of Sita and Ram  anything but nasty deities in the Hindu pantheon  in the demonic gibberish chanted by the Thugees and one wonders how Hollywood wasn't nuked. Sure this kind of film doesn't live from method acting and stereotypes can be amusing but if Spielberg wants to teach us respect to our neighbours he would do well not to go trampling about on other people's beliefs just to produce a blockbuster. Apart from which I found the action sequences interminably boring lacking the kind of build up and choreography which by You only live twice should have been standard. Maybe the underground trolley ride had its moments and the bridge sequence could have been worse but most of it was cluttered and strangely unmotivated. All in all I found this a really dismal bit of Hollywood propaganda for Western colonialism note there were only nasty fanatical Indians who we should despise or the poor and helpless who need Western help  a very familiar Hollywood scheme.".

I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and unlike most fans consider Temple of Doom to be my favourite of the series and one of my favourite films.Set one year before RaidersIn 1935 Temple of Doom's plot doesn't revolve around the Nazis and takes a darker root. This time Indiana teams up with a club singer named Willie and ten year old Asian boy named Short Round. After a treasure deal goes wrong the three escape in a plane which turns out to be a trap causing them to do a death defying escape which ends up in India. When the village people their warn them of the mysterious temple and the horrible loss of their children the three set off to discover the temple. The plot just gets darker and more action packed from there.Harrison Ford returns in his signature role as Indina Jones and is still the tough as nails archaeologist he was in Raiders. Short Round is a lovable and has great chemistry with Indy and during the film he becomes one of the most memorable sidekicks ever. Willie is a typical damsel in distress who spends the movie screaming and moaning but this is just a throwback to the 'B' movies the Indiana Jones films are inspired by.From start to finish the film is filled with tons of memorable moments classic setpieces and amazing stunt and camera work. With a snow ball pacing that gradually gets bigger and better as it goes along the movie is pretty much impossible not to enjoy. The score is one of the best I've heard in a film a mixed with the creative and memorable camera work just makes the film even better and gives me chills every time.I can't stress this enough but Temple of Doom is a must see for any fan of film. Some say it's too dark Heart Sceneand the sillier moments ruined itDinner Scene but the experience for me was never spoilt and the dark moments just made it better. With a bigger 'B' movie feel great action amazing setpieces and effects and timeless feel the film gets my highest recommendation. Not to be missed!".

With nowhere to stay he is followed by a small dog whom he first resents they end up in the desert where the dog saves his life.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film only twice on television in the late 1960s and I have not seen it listed too frequently. The plot is from a Graham Greene short story and like so many of his works Greene questions what we regard as good and evil in the world.Steiger is a crooked financier on the lam. He boards a train and exchanges identities with another passenger who died on board. He reaches a Latin American country and crosses the boarder. But the authorities at home are still after him. He did not realize the person whose identity he stole was sought by the U.S. authorities for murder.Steiger has plenty of money in a suitcase but he soon discovers that the local authorities see him as something to bleed dry. Everyone jacks up prices for his normal living expenses from the police on down. And the money is slowly running out. The only creature who befriends him is a dog. It remains his only real friend in this town of vultures. He consistently refuses to return to the U.S. where police officer Bernard Lee tries to get him to return. But he realizes that they think he is the murderer not an embezzler and he can't return. Moreover he resents the pressures that are being put on the local authorities to push him back. They are using these to squeeze more cash out of him.The character Steiger begins as is a selfish crook but as the film progresses as is typical of Greene's work the defects of those around the antihero are such as to make us increasingly sympathetic to that figure. As he is stripped step  by  step of everything Steiger gains our reluctant pity and his relationship with the simple dog makes him ... in the end... tragically heroic.Definitely a wonderful film  hopefully they will show it again soon.".

But it was when the end credits came up that I was utterly taken aback and mortified by the way it said Carl Schraffner...........Rod Steiger! It was indeed the man with the funny accent and the simply blended performance that was one of my personal favorites. This is indeed a hidden cinematic masterpiece and is highly underrated and deserves a lot more credit than it got. I can't believe this didn't even get nominated for an Oscar. I thought the overall production was fantastic all of the actors especially Rod Steiger and the direction were fantastic!

A rare example I think of the film version's being just vastly superior to its orginal source a slight if taut short story by Graham Greene.The plot is brilliantly simple a la Hitchock. Carl Schaffner is travelling on a train. He's trying to escape from something dreadful and threatening not specified and is terrified. In desperation he decides to bump off a fellow passenger assume his identity and take his documents. He intends to leave the train at the other end get through the official formalities and disappear safely from whatever is chasing him. He goes to a lot of trouble to darken his moustache get the clothes right etc. The train reaches its destination. Passengers alight. He gets off strolls down the plaform. It all seems to be going like clockwork.Then the guard shouts at him Hey! Don't forget your dog!It seems his victim had a dog and boarded it in the guard's van. The rest of the film fascinatingly details the developing relationship between Carl and his newfound canine companion while he continues to attempt to survive and escape detection. It is highly original and gripping throughout. It has thrills and pathos. Superb acting by Rod Steiger as Carl and a really professional actor as Gloria the dog. Very evocative black and white photography and rich sympathetic direction. I saw this as a student in 1957 and never forgot it. I have seen it once on TV. It MUST come out on DVD!".

The symbolism used is also impressive with the use of the dog representing what he traditionally does loyalty fidelity. With the extensive use of symbolism and vivid personal capturing of the downfall of a business tycoon we have our emotions beautifully twisted and find ourselves with one of the better endings that one can have to a film.

What starts off as a relatively simple story suddenly transforms into an extremely complex tale of state borders identity confusion and a whole host of other stuff that would normally be pretty tough to follow however this film's excellent screenplay delivers all of that in such a way that it's still a simple enough watch to be pretty entertaining.However there's nothing more exciting in this film than the way that it pulls your mind from one side to the other on a constant basis due to its numerous twists because it eventually makes you realise that it's just too unpredictable to predict and that sense of anticipation that you get before each twist comes is hugely exhilarating.Also this film manages to be very heavy and bleak at points whilst still maintaining its excitement. The identity theft element to it is very sad however what becomes most bleak is the final act which is more a question of survival rather than anything else and it really requires a lot to get to grips with.Finally the most interesting thing about this film was its central character the Germanborn British billionaire played fantastically by Rod Steiger. On the face of things he's a terrible person but the strangest thing about this film is that this villain really grows on you as it develops and he turns into some sort of an anti hero who you end supporting towards the end rather than hope for his arrest as you do earlier on which I found really fascinating.".

This is Rod Steiger's greatest performance and he won an Academy Award for The Pawnbroker which was excellent but not as good as this performance. This film is not to be missed.

He flees for Mexico on a train with a suitcase full of money.His disregard for others is confirmed when he casually murders a fellow train passenger in order to assume his identity and pass across the border.Once in Mexico the authorities under pressure from U.S. officials put pressure on him to return across the bridge to the United States so that he can be arrested. Most of the film is concerned with the slow stripping away of this oncepowerful man's options to where he is left sleeping on the streets befriended only by a dog. The ending of the film is emotionally powerful and probably the main reason why so many of us have never forgotten this movie.Since I wrote this review I've seen the film again on DVD in 2005. It does not hold up that well. There's a subplot I had completely forgotten about. I realize now what I remembered about the film was highly selective. In truth the movie has some interesting parts but it's not the classic I remembered it being. By all means see it but it's rather dated.".

He flees for Mexico on a train with a suitcase full of money.His disregard for others is confirmed when he casually murders a fellow train passenger in order to assume his identity and pass across the border.Once in Mexico the authorities under pressure from U.S. officials put pressure on him to return across the bridge to the United States so that he can be arrested. Most of the film is concerned with the slow stripping away of this oncepowerful man's options to where he is left sleeping on the streets befriended only by a dog. The ending of the film is emotionally powerful and probably the main reason why so many of us have never forgotten this movie.Since I wrote this review I've seen the film again on DVD in 2005. It does not hold up that well. There's a subplot I had completely forgotten about. I realize now what I remembered about the film was highly selective. In truth the movie has some interesting parts but it's not the classic I remembered it being. By all means see it but it's rather dated.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting little film which as someone else mentioned shows its 1950s British studio film production pedigree. Although Stieger carries the film with his usual intensity the rest of the cast are pretty mediocre as is Annakin's direction. He really doesn't offer anything remarkable cinematically the photography and lighting are both pretty dull but it is the script that really lets the film down. It rarely rises above setting up the next sequence of events. The film also jumps about with things happening with little or no explanation. When Schaffner arrives at Sam's Motel he realises that Scarff is in another chalet with little or no explanation even though he's earlier thrown him from a train. Other parts like the disposal of Scarff from the train are so badly filmed it is difficult to believe.I think for me it is this lack of credibility in the actions of the characters that undermines any tension that the narrative may be trying to createAt one point Johnny hands in Schaffner for the reward then remarkably crosses the border to then offer him a lift!and the ending is a real damp squid. The character of Delores a rather pathetic dog is used to show how the rather nasty Schaffer a clichd German financier who had escaped from Nazi Germany rather suspiciouslyeventually succumbs to the dog's touching sense of loyalty in a way he never managed with his employees.And there's the rub. The ending for me was not one of pathos it was reprehensibly Disney. I almost felt that Schaffer deserved to die because of his weakness for this emoting pooch  Delores...Delores. It is an interesting point that Annakin directed about four Disney movies in the 1950s and maybe this had an effect on the way he saw the story being played out.Allinall an unsatisfactory piece of cinema. Worth watching but not one I am likely to return to.".

You see my father has a penchant for Woody Allen and anybody who has a rather dry sense of humour this includes Nicholson.We sat down tonight and the first thing that hit me was the way that the film was shot. It is shot using rather blue and green hues so the film is rather subdued. Secondly the music stands out. Instead of using a typical 'boohoo' orchestra the film uses beautiful wandering piano and marimba sounds. The characters I could easily relate to. Helen the faithful wife who is excited about getting to spend a new chapter of her life with her husband. The husband who obeys his wife but secretly resents it. A sudden change which causes a rethink in everything he has done up until that point.At first this appeared to be a comedy but it was soon revealed to be a beautifully poignant film. Throughout it questions mortality what you can achieve in life and how to cope with loss or change. I don't think I have ever cried as much in 2 hours as I did during this film and yet at the same time laughed so hard that my sides were splitting.I would thoroughly recommend anybody to watch this film.

This is a funny movie but looking back its probably not quite the kind of jokes you appreciate laughing at.In the lead role as Warren Schmidt is none other then Jack Nicholson with an already astute rsum only further strengthens his long career with his subtle and charming performance. The charm never wears off with the audience as Schmidt's morals and interest for the most part stay in place in his heart and mind. Unfortunately in the tale of Schmidt in the film not only does his charm wear off but he is seen as a liability by those who he thought of as his loved ones. His life takes this crash when he retires from his career and an insurance agent. Soon after he realizes he may have wasted his entire life away. The downward spiral of his life and his sense of purpose hangs on the thread of a boy he has never even met.As subtle as Nicholson's performance is so is the writing. It is quietly very witty which almost inconspicuously gives off a whole lot of cynicism. Along with Alexander Payne writing the screenplay he directed the film as well. The movie is certainly not all style and why should it be when that could possibly be the only thing that could really hurt this film. The film is about humanity in a raw and complex way sometimes the best method of showing this is through simplicity to the point where you are almost certain there is something else that lies behind the curtain of it all.There is no doubt I would recommend this film but don't expect a pure comedy. Instead try and take a fresh and real look at the entire movie and the events that take place. Depending on who you are you may find certain points of this movie to be either sorrowful and dejected or slightly uplifting and optimistic. Just don't make a heartless joke of it because none of us want to think of our life as that a joke.".

	schema:headline " One of Jack Nicholson's best and certainly to be remembered as one of the best films of the first decade of the 21st century";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack Nicholson was robbed of another deserving Oscar for his portrayal of the lead character in this movie. This movie was very funny but in a very dry painfully realistic manner like hitting your funny bone.Nicholson plays a man who upon retiring loses his wife of many years. His daughter who lives in another state and who he isn't very close to informs him that she's about to marry. He goes out to meet the future soninlaw and his family who turn out to be basically one rung up the ladder above trailer trash. Dermot Mulroney turns in another excellent performance this time as the dim witted fianc. Why he's not more respected in the industry I'll never know. Hope Davis is perfect in this role as the daughter who somehow always gets the short stick in life. Kathy Bates as an abrasive obnoxious mother of the groom is something to see. She deserved her Oscar nomination as well. The movie is an extremely stark gray black humor piece that is frighteningly true to life. Pushed a few more degrees in another direction and it could have been just one long root canal but the director Alexander Payne walked just this side of that fine line between comedy and tragedy. Will most assuredly be one of the best movies of the fist decade of the new century.".

	schema:reviewBody "About Schmidt is the story of a man left with the curious task of trying to find meaning in his life at age 66. Most people by this age would have hopefully figured out how and why they make a difference on this Earth but Warren Schmidt suddenly realizes he is insignificant after all these years.Schmidt is played to perfection by Jack Nicholson. This is not the Jack Nicholson we have all grown up watching in films like Easy Rider and The Shining. This Jack Nicholson is subdued almost lifeless at times like the character he portrays. You keep waiting for him to explode or break out like Kevin Spacey in American Beauty but it just isn't right for the character. He's too old and weak by his own admission. He finds himself on a quest to make a difference in life before its over. And the film takes him for a leisurely ride.About Schmidt is directed by Alexander Payne. He's a man apparently on a quest of his own to put our great? state of Nebraska on the map of the filmmaking world. After some obligatory shots of downtown Omaha we see Schmidt sitting in his office on his last day of work before retirement from the Woodman insurance company. He sits alone and quietly waits until the last seconds of the work day tick off and he's then presumably a free man. However once the clock strikes five nothing special happens! In most films we might expect bells to go off or music to start playing as the character joyfully begins his new life. Not here. Schmidt has no grand plans for the rest of his life and that fact is punctuated by this dreary scene.We then see Schmidt at a hohum retirement dinner at Johnny's Cafe then he gets started on his hohum retirement. It appears the only thing he plans to do is go traveling with his wife in their giant camper which ends up as Schmidt's primary mode of transportation the rest of the film. Only there's one thing Schmidt didn't count on. His wife drops dead one day while he's out getting a Blizzard at the DQ. It appears they shot that scene at the one over in Millard. After his wife is in the ground Schmidt goes through some difficult days. He really misses his wife. She seemed to completely take care of his every need as well as run his life in the process. He appears on the brink of despair at her passing until he finds evidence of an adulterous relationship with his best friend!!! After throwing out all of her belongings he sets off on a sightseeing tour of our great? state before planning to attend his daughter's wedding in Denver.In one particularly touching scene he pronounces forgiveness for his wife's affair and resolves to do one important thing before he leaves this earth. And that thing will be to break up his daughter's wedding. She is planning to marry a simpleton who sells water beds for a living and comes from an odd newage family of losers. Schmidt drives out to Denver on a mission feeling as strong and focused as ever.Once in Dever however things don't go according to plans. His daughter really loves this loser and won't hear of leaving him. Her love for this guy is as impossible for Schmidt to imagine as his contempt for her new family is for her to imagine. Schmidt and his daughter couldn't be any further apart. Kathy Bates is typically outstanding as the overbearing mother of the man his daughter is marrying. Be forewarned though Bates DOES in fact get naked in a scene and it would be wise to cover your eyes lest you turn to stone! Her family is annoying and you can just tell their house smells like her feet which she has out in plain view once Schmidt first arrives there.Schmidt isn't having any luck stopping the wedding and it looks like he'll have one last chance to make his point. At the reception after a ghastly toast by the best man it's Schmidt's turn to make a speech. And once again you think Here it comes! Here's where he'll go off and tell everyone what he thinks about them in one big comic rant! But no it doesn't happen. That's just not something his character is capable of. He can merely swallow his pride and say the only good things he can think of. Most of the wedding party seems to buy it but you can tell by the look on his daughter's face that she knows it's all bs. Schmidt is in fact too weak to break up the wedding. Witness the despair on his face as he stands at the urinal after giving the speech. He missed what he feels was his last chance to make a difference in this world.Now Schmidt has nothing left to do but go home to die. Only in the film's last frame to we see any redemption to this tragic man's life. And a very touching moment it is. I was in tears and that doesn't happen too often when I watch a film.This film is worth all ten stars. This Alexander Payne appears to be for real. We already knew Jack was!! ps Did anyone else notice the symbolism with the cows? First at the retirement dinner with his picture up next to two prize cows. Then the cattle truck being washed off near his wife's funeral. Then as he's driving down the highway in a big truck just like they are. Then at the wedding reception as the beef is being sliced while he's in obvious pain about how things have gone.Food for thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to recommend About Schmidt to anyone without actually knowing that person. Not only does the story seem unconventionally uneventful to most of modern audiences but it also moves with an unhurried patience that will let many viewers shift in their seats. It really depends on whether one can develop an interest to the film and its subject matter which shows a retired man suddenly facing the void and meaninglessness of his existence. About Schmidt moves slowly but it moves with grace. The film's success is deeply in debt to Jack Nicholson subordinating his personality to the character of Warren Schmidt. It must have been difficult for somebody like Nicholson to display the role's required lack of passion without letting Schmidt lose his human touch. Yet his portrayal is excellent in its understatement and his numerable supporting actors do not disappoint either. Fans of Nicholson will be assured in their belief that their favourite is not only one of the best but also one of the most versatile actors still working today. Apart from the acting director Alexander Payne's film is also well crafted. The somewhat saddened mood is only enhanced by documentarylike shots constantly making us aware that what we witness is really an everydaytragedy. The script shows intelligence and although it contains many subtleties most of them will not go unnoticed with attentive viewers. Even though About Schmidt is billed as a comedy it really is a drama. Many of the humorous situations are more tragic than funny and truly hilarious moments are rare occurrences. I've often wondered whether the title of About Schmidt has been chosen with any clear intent. The German surname Schmidt equals Smith in English and is one of the most common. So about Schmidt could actually mean About Everybody. Everybody can wake up one day and discover that everything he or she has devoted himself to amounts to nothing. It's a frequent social phenomenon that people suddenly wise up that their lives are almost over without ever having fully lived them. Maybe that's how all the sea cruises and world tours of old pensioners can be accounted for. Like Schmidt they are all making a desperate effort to catch up on a time that's long done and over with.The film does not exactly give answers and like in reality does not end with any true revelations to escape all bleakness. But there is something it often likes to apply namely the self explanatory power of irony. Like one time during the film when Warren Schmidt decides to adopt a sixyear old African foster child by mail. A cheque of twentytwo dollars which he dutifully provides on a monthly basis assures that little Ndugu can go to school gets sheltered fed and clothed. Yet in one of his letters Warren writes to him What difference has my life made to anyone? None that I can think of. None...at all! Well think again Mr. Schmidt.".

In his case it leads to a life of complacency denial delusion and passiveaggressive behaviors... and eventually to a meaningless life of servitude devoid of passion or purpose.Since my wife and I are around the same age as the character and we ponder the same issues of our lives the film had more significance to us. I found the work to be a cinemagraphic piece of art laced with symbolism and dark humor at best. I likened it to previous movies like Death of a Salesman The Apartment The Swimmer Burt Lancaster or a short filmed called The Bridge.As a cautionary tale or social comment on the American Way of life the messages it conveys are slightly exaggerated but nevertheless there to be debated. We are talking about identity achievement interpersonal relationships and the average IQ.In the end I believe this film will become one that is studied in future classrooms and it was brave of Nicholson to participate in such a character study and a work intended primarily for writers actors and directors. If laughter is the sound we make when we are surprised or shocked by the truth then the amount of humor you find in this film may be directly related to your own level of naivety or denial. After all laughter can often be just another defense mechanism right?Some movies are straightforward some are magical some are mystical and then some are symbolic. This movie falls into the last category. The use of time space cognitive dissonance and Irony abound in this work and challenge us to look think and feel.Notes we would have cut or altered the Percodan scene at the rehearsal as overdone also note the cattle at the funeral who later appear on the freeway inside jokes about Des Moines and Denver Randall's Certificate of Attendance the look on Jeannie's face at the end of Warren's speech at the Wedding Reception the use of overstatement details of wall decorations and Warren's obvious attraction to the trite idealistic delusional and superficial.If you are a thinking feeling serious movielover you should SEE this film once and then STUDY it the 2nd time!".

	schema:headline " Great note on appreciating what you have while still have it";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an inspiring story. It teaches me so much about what is important in life. Jack Nicholson with a great performance as Warren R. Schmidt is an example of an American middle class after retiring. For many years he has worked as an actuary at a big insurance company. After retiring Jack at home while watching television he decides to sponsor a six years old boy Ndugu from Tanzania. Sending a check of US 2200 every month he is also required to write a letter to the boy. In the process of writing these letters he vents out to the boy about his life frustrations his lost dreams and the dilemma he is in. He is married for fortytwo years with his wife Helen June Squibb and he has a daughter living in Denver Jeannie Schmidt Hope Davis who will marry a looser pretty soon. He misses his daughter. A few days after his retirement his wife dies and Jack realizes how important the wife was in his life now even though he never appreciated her. The director of the movie Alexander Payne takes the audiences with Jack on a trip in a trailer to visit specific places in America. He mainly makes Jack visit the places where he has been before physically but at the same time Jack was revisiting his own life inside. In this trip he realizes what really matters in life  friendship family and sharing then why it is important to appreciate them whenever you have a chance.In 'Citizen Kane' 1941 the director Orson Welles portrays the same idea when creating Mr. Kane. The movie is more than the story of a tycoon's rise and fall it is an account of what is ultimately important in a person's life. Even though Kane attains riches and prestige he is far from happy. He ends with two failed marriages and few friends. At his dying bed all he has left is his reminiscences  and something called Rosebud. In 'About Schmidt' the director Alexander Payne uses voiceover to convey Jack's thoughts and memories throughout the movie. To be specific it is when Jack is writing a letter to the boy he sponsors  Ndugu at the same time Payne is informing the audience about Jack's regrets and pain concerning his wife and daughter while the movie is still rolling on. I think this is a great technique.I believe this has been a great adventure and wake up call to many Americans as to what is important in life and why we should cherish every moment of it.".

	schema:headline " Forrest Gump Meets the Conversation";
	schema:reviewBody "About Schmidt is Forrest Gump through the lens of Sartre or Camus. Warren Schmidt has a handicap but it's the same handicap most of the people standing on line at seven p.m. at your local Wendy's have. The real star or antistar of About Schmidt is the mediocre architectural landscape of America. Every room or box Warren Schmidt enters in this movie is as devoid of caring and vitality as he is the retirement banquet room Warren's house the tire store the hired wedding reception room. Schmidt's director and production designer take care to place us in the same lifedraining cheap structures we inhabit and deal with everyday. No prettifying. This is the drab landscape of Fargo revisited but without the irony. The steady doses of violence in Fargo allowed you an escape route. But there's nothing ironical about a wasted life and a 66 year old widower spinning his wheels in the same rut now partnerless and foundering. The combination of Jack this story and these settings is effective and compelling. The result would be I think inevitable. The tone and attitude is not consistently managed even by Nicholsen whose wornout mannered schtick pops up occasionally. Yet the final effect is impossible to fend off mundane American hell with droll comedic diversion. We experience a downfall as poignant as the smell of bacon cooking in Denny's at eight a.m.Like Forrest Gump the film depends on extensive voice over narration V.O'd by Nicholsen as letters to Schmidt's newly adopted six year old Tanzanian foster child. Through these ridiculous sharings of sextagenarian angst with an African boy we register Schmidt's internal grievances  thoughts we would never know about otherwise without his commentary.  The slow dragging score drains vitality from each transition as if cinematic momentum would be antithetical to the point of the tale. Back and forth we rock from a single minor chord to a second one getting nowhere. The mood the landscape the buildings the people say it all  Schmidt's on the road but he might as well be sitting home in his layzboy.  The cushy bucket seat of a 35 foot Winnebago makes a good substitute.Casting Jack Nicholson may have been the only way this story could have come to the screen. I've racked my brain to think of one other actor who could have pulled Schmidt off. Tony Hopkins? Not with the same comedic finesse. Gene Hackman reprising his role in Coppola's The Conversation or doing his Tennenbaum hamming? Don't think so. Only Jack has the mix. He does some hilarious bits in this but overall the mood is somber glum inert. Can this be how that other famous Warren from Nebransas  Mr. Buffet  lives?I was confused amused depressed and wierdly disoriented by About Schmidt as I left the theater. I commented that it wasn't a film I'd go see again. Thinking about it a day later I'd hold to that IF it meant returning to the theater and paying. BUT  were I to run across About Schmidt on cable I doubt I could tear myself away from it any more than I could from a crack up at the Indy 500. And I think that chance encounter might happen more than once maybe for years. After all this is the America I know and mark time in myself. A recommended film going experience.".

	onyx:emotionText "About Schmidt is Forrest Gump through the lens of Sartre or Camus. Warren Schmidt has a handicap but it's the same handicap most of the people standing on line at seven p.m. at your local Wendy's have. The real star or antistar of About Schmidt is the mediocre architectural landscape of America. Every room or box Warren Schmidt enters in this movie is as devoid of caring and vitality as he is the retirement banquet room Warren's house the tire store the hired wedding reception room. Schmidt's director and production designer take care to place us in the same lifedraining cheap structures we inhabit and deal with everyday. No prettifying. This is the drab landscape of Fargo revisited but without the irony. The steady doses of violence in Fargo allowed you an escape route. But there's nothing ironical about a wasted life and a 66 year old widower spinning his wheels in the same rut now partnerless and foundering. The combination of Jack this story and these settings is effective and compelling. The result would be I think inevitable. The tone and attitude is not consistently managed even by Nicholsen whose wornout mannered schtick pops up occasionally.

Basically I think a few subtleties flew over some peoples' heads and a lot of people have been too taken by Hollywood stories with needless plot twists every 5 minutes.I found that the best part of the movie was actually the fact that the character of Schmidt doesn't actually change and that despite a few major revelations about his life and decisions that he appears to be set on he still seems to weak to achieve what he wants in life. This is what i think pulled the storyline out of mediocritythere's too many stories about people who realize their life is going nowhere then make some huge change to it this one is about a realistic man for whom the furthest he can go to make a difference is a simple 22 check to an African orphan every month accompanied by a letter containing his most intimate thoughts that the kid can't even read. In essence the letter captures the complete insignificance of his thoughts and how little impact he can have on anyone's life.Overall there is some good dark comedy but If you want to laugh for a couple of hours this isn't for you. If you want fastpaced action and needless plot twists go and watch something else. This movie is just a simple and eloquently told tale of a man who's life has no significance to anyone.".

The story is touching and gave me the feeling of how wonderful live is live is a ride that is so beautiful that is a shame to start to live it just after retirement Schimdt loves his life his way of living but he is sad he knows that is a little bit late for living! and his forces are drawn totally through the movie until the film ends brilliant and touching way to shake us all and to push us to live our real lives not the working lives!. The companies go and go with or without ourselves but our live depends of what we do with it!.

His journey of self discovery and his concern over the marriage of his daughter to someone totally unsuitable. It shows that no matter how unremarkable life can be at times this itself is remarkable.

After you loose all you used to like or used to take as something usual you are going to see the world in other color. You see that one man means a lot for himself but not a damn for the others  including your family. You start to understand what the life is about  what was wrong in your life and what was the biggest goal you achieved. You start to understand that small ordinary habits and everyday experience is all what left and you have. And finally after staying alone and thinking about the life you may find that the least important thing you have done is finally the most important and everything else doesn't matter.So in the end  good story with good acting of our star JAck and nice views of US people and life. 810".

Eventually his boredom find him watching a commercial about the poor unfortunate children in Africa on the Childreach program. He becomes a participant and becomes the donating foster parent of a kid in Africa named Ndugu. He has no one to talk to and not much to do with his life and Ndugu becomes his way of venting and getting it all out of his system. He opens up and talks about what he is feeling to the child.Warrens wife dies and he heads out to Colorado to try to talk his daughter Jennie out of getting married to her ninkempoop fianc. He hops in his RV and heads across country for a wild adventure before going to watch his only child be wed. He stays with the in laws and finds life is no better when you try to run from it.The story has many adventures and many truths and just when you think you're no longer of importance or no longer worth the life you hold you may find that you do matter of a great deal to someone and be very important to them.I LOVE THIS MOVIE! this makes maybe my 6th time watching it and it is pure perfection to me. The story is so sad and I cry almost all the way through it and the beautiful thing is when I am not crying I am laughing hysterically. From the subtle face Jack makes to the dinner table scene complete with a lazy Susan and a box of milk bones to Kathy Bates naked hot tub dip to the crazy vows and silly songs at the wedding this movie is perfect.Directing is great and has so many beautiful scenes the music is absolutely dead on with the moods and the little touches of brilliance that you see on camera throughout are superb. The sets were so real and appropriate as well especially with Roberta's house. Acting was perhaps the best I have seen in years Jack Nicholson did his best work right here and got many awards and much appreciation for it. Kathy Bates did her best here too I never thought she could top that of Misery but she did here such wonderful actors everyone on this film was just amazing.I can recommend it very proudly as one of my very favorite films its a tear jerker but it is extremely laugh out loud funny...10 perfect stars".

Well there are certain aspects that I found that made this film successful. Of course there's the superb performance of our dear old friend Jack Nicholson I think it's one of his greatest roles along One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shining. Secondly we have the good pace and rhythm that Alexander Payne gives to the movie. Then we have an extraordinary screenplay based on a great book. What else can yo ask from a film? I hope that when you grow up after having survived all those problems of the African nations you'll know how to appreciate movies like this and I hope this film maintains as a landmark on cinematic history.

	schema:reviewBody "About Schmidt is a quirky offbeat comedy about a man and his journey to find meaning to his life. Its name is true About Schmidt is about...well...a man named Schmidt.Warren Schmidt Jack Nicholson is your average Joe. Or in this case your average Warren. He lives a normal life. He has just retired at the age of sixtyseven and he now stays at home with his wife who Schmidt states he is growing tired of. He's tired of having to do everything his wife Helen tells him to do. He's tired of her cutting him off when he's talking. He's tired of the way she sits down. He's tired of the way she pulls out the keys to the car before they're even out the door. And he's tired of having to sit down when he goes to the bathroom.In a letter to Ntugu his new adopted sponsor child Warren spills his beans about life. That same day he comes home from mailing a letter to Ntugu to find his wife dead on the floor. We learn later that she died from a blood clot in her brain.Left on his own Warren realizes how good his wife was and how much he misses her. But then he finds out that twentyfive to thirty years ago she had an affair with an old friend of his and in one of the most subtley funny moments in the film dumps off her old belongings at a donation center.Warren still missing his wife but truly bitter at what she did eventually decides to go visit his daughter in the south and packs up the 35footlong Winnebago with everything he needs. His daughter who is about to be married to a complete loser has different ideas and tells Warren once he is on the road that it would be best if they stick to the plan and he comes down two days before the wedding. Left with about a week before the wedding Warren takes a road trip back down memory lane. He visits his old childhood home  which is now a tire store. This is where the bedroom would've been he tells a clerk who looks on in awe. After that Warren one way or another ends up eating dinner with a couple from the RV park he's staying in. When the husband goes out to get more beer the woman says that she sees a sad sad man in Warren. Afraid and angry. Once Warren arrives for the wedding he realizes that his daughter is happy with the man she is about to marry no matter how much of a loser he is. And in a scene that could have been played for laughs but wasn't which is good in this case making deep characters instead of flimsy ones Warren makes a toast to his daughter and her new husband.And then Warren goes home. It's the end of the movie already. Not much has happened and Warren tells Ntugu that his life has no point. His life has no meaning. Why go on? But then he gets a letter and in the sense of It's a Wonderful Life Warren sees the meaning in his life.About Schmidt isn't for everyone. People that cannot tolerate slowmoving films should not see this. Those that cannot appreciate characters that are deep but yet still funny should not see this movie. If people want a Jack Nicholson movie played just for laughs with your average characters I recommend Anger Management. But if you want a classic example of fine storytelling see About Schmidt.The characters are funny but not outrageous. They are not there to make us laugh. They are there to preach something much like in It's a Wonderful Life. But they do make us laugh in the little quirks of life. Things we all do. The first forty minutes of this movie is an absolute hoot and those forty minutes are probably funnier than any movie you'll see this year. But not outwardly funny like I said this isn't an Adam Sandler movie. This is a realistic movie with realistic characters doing real things that are funny. It's a selfparody for all the viewers. The little quirks all the different characters have will either a remind you of someone you know or b remind you of yourself. Jack Nicholson is an absolute standout in this movie. I can't see anyone else playing him quite as well as Nicholson. And I must admit that I've never been a real fan of Jack either. But when he is on screen in this film we see a sad lonely angry and afraid old man who is wondering through life living each day but not for any apparent reason.Alexander Payne has crafted a wonderful lifeparodydrama here. I didn't expect this much from About Schmidt but I sure did get more than I bargained for. And in this case what I didn't bargain for was better than what I did.4.55 stars John Ulmer".

However I am also a filmmaker myself therefore I know how hard it actually is to pull off a movie and how easy it is to simply sit there and criticize. But this time About Schmidt simply does not offer me that chance. Alexandra Payne did more than a wonderful job. Proof? From every perspective possible the plot the characters the pacing the convey of thematic message the storytelling techniques the direction the performances the cinematography etc. I cannot find something I did not enjoy. Sure you could say that the pacing is slow but it is certainly not boring you could say maybe the cinematography is ordinary which I admit is true but it certainly does not affect the theme. If you have not watched this yet go and see it right now. Take my words. Below will contain spoilers I would love to talk about the reasons why I love this film. I could go on for days maybe so here I will only discuss two points. The first thing is acting. Obviously for a characterdriven film the title character plays a major role in the film's success. Jack Nicholson nailed it. There is not one single moment when he is on screen that is not exemplary. Him as Schmidt might be the best lead character I have the chance to see. He just so carefully and masterfully grasps what makes Schmidt angry and yet without being at all overthetop. The other characters are pretty great. All are overshadowed by Johny though. The other thing is thematic message. If you want to know how powerful can a film get with a vague and clich theme this is the film to watch. Searching for the meaning of life and finding it to be the changes one makes around others cannot be more clich. The writing somehow adds something entirely new to it. The most significant one is despair. I hardly laugh at this movie because it is so depressingly intricate. This mood is hardly found in other movies with the similar message and a lot other discussions are also going on there worth noticing. There are of course other great things such as the visual storytelling and the sound effects. What a great movie! I feel greatly betrayed and started to doubt my life after viewing it. Partially because of the movie's content also partially because Star Wars A New Hope has a higher rating than this.".

I guess growing up in Britain these movies were the first real movies you get to see where they use words like 'bum' 'arse' and 'knickers' and you don't have to feel embarrased in front of your parents because you knew that whilst there was a lot of innuendo there's never be anything actually rude.This one was filmed in and around my home town and features loads of local landmarks. It is also a showcase for the cream of british comedy actors from the seventies such as Sid James Frankie Howard Kenneth Williams Charlie Hawtrey and the very undervalued Jim Dale. The plot is simple. Two doctors in a hospital. One is popular with staff and patients is good at his job and is loved from afar by the pretty nurse. The other doctor is resentful and enlists the help of the old battleaxe Matron to engineer his dismissal. Cue some saucy humour 'Oh youve got a nice pear!' and some slapstick to match keaton and you have the movie. You all know how it'll end but that's OK. Just watch and enjoy.".

And then believing he only has a week to live and the likes of Bernard Bresslaw and Sid James as rogue patients playing up. It's a marvellous set up that works a treat for visual comedy.

It's probably the cleverest line in Carry On Doctor. Like Carry On Nurse Carry On Doctor takes place in hospital and as the movie says is a bedpanorama of hospital life. The longrunning Carry On movies were bawdy lowcomedy goodnatured madhouses that featured a repertory company of comics we came to recognize instantly. Here the company is made up of Kenneth Williams Jim Dale Hattie Jacques Sid James Joan Sims Charles Hawtrey Barbara Windsor and Bernard Bresslaw among others. They play the patients the doctors and the nurses at Finisham Hospital. If you relish jokes about bedpans and hernias where any possible activity below the waist will wind up as corny corny jokes or wheezing double entendres Finisham is the place to be. Says Dr. Kilmore Jim Dale to Francis Bigger Just as I thought. You fell on your coccyx. I did not says Bigger I fell on my back. Your coccyx is at the base of the spine points out Dr. Kilmore. Says Bigger Well I've never heard it called that before. A Carry On hospital movie always has lots of nubile nurses assisting the longing denizens of the male ward. Nurse I dreamt about you last night says a hobbled Ken Biddle Bernard Bresslaw to the stacked Nurse Clarke Anita Harris. Did you? she asks? No Biddle says you wouldn't let me. And of course we have to deal with the Matron a large woman more indomitable than a battleship who knows how to keep any male quivering at the thought of one of her enemas or her ice baths. Has a matron ever been played as perfectly as Hattie Jacques? Her matrons always know what they want and in this movie Matron wants Dr. Kenneth Tinkle Kenneth Williams the hospital's chief physician. Matron Dr. Tinkle says you may not realize it but I was once a weak man! Doctor says Matron once a week is enough for any man! Who cares what the plot is when we have lines like these? We even have Charles Hawtrey who in film as well as in life raised mincing about to an art form playing a fathertobe suffering from false pregnancy symptoms. It's a small unlikely and vivid bit. The whole movie is a funny gently offcolor and totally innocent experience...such as the small boy who swallowed half a crown and was taken to hospital. Two days later the boy's mum asks the doctor How's he doing? Sorry missus the doctor says there's still no change.".

Some of the jokes are plainly obvious but there are a few laughoutloud moments to make up for the tamer and lamer gags. The acting is good but hardly the best that the team has displayed. It is however excess length that is the prime weakness here. The final fifteen minutes or so are very weak and could have been handled better. Otherwise this is simple amusing fun although 'Carry On Again Doctor' comes more highly recommend than this and despite the title the two films share as much in common as any of the Carry On films do.".

Dale his rooftop antics after misreading Windsor's intentions to sunbathe as a suicide attempt is one of the film's comic highlights and Bresslaw who keeps convincing his visiting friend to swap clothes with him so that he can go see an attractive but lonely patient in the women's ward. Even so the film is definitely unbalanced by having two ultracampy performers  Howerd and Williams  letting rip in it which perhaps explains why the equally effeminate Hawtrey is atypically restrained here.

	schema:reviewBody "Normally when I write reviews of films I have seen I open with a short plot summary  it helps me focus my thoughts on the film I have just seen and also provides a bit more information for any readers. However with Carry on Doctor the plot is little more than a series of antics involving the patients and the doctors. In fairness this may not be a bad thing since the plot in the film Carry On Matron was the worst part of it. Anyway here we have a collection of lovestruck patients flirting doctors pratfalls and women with ample breasts and giggles. So far so basic and to be honest none of any of these really work that well producing a film that isn't that funny and pretty much does what you expect it to do.However what makes it better than these aspects and better than Matron is the presence and material of Frankie Howerd. For those that like him he is great with a constant tongue in his cheek and material that stands head and shoulders above the rest of the script. Whether he is giving the nurses a hard time or dropping wonderful injokes he greets a daffodil with oh no you don't  I've seen that movie he is the best thing in the film and makes it much better than it should have been. The rest of the cast are OK without really doing much. Having seen them be good in Matron Williams and Jacques were a disappointment with not a great deal to do. Dale's clumsy doctor is obvious and easy while Windsor is all breasts and Butterworth and Bresslaw don't have much more to do. James is his usual self to good effect but I must admit that I liked the fact that Sims wasn't immediately recognisable as the sort of characters she usually plays.Overall this is an enjoyable film but not consistently instead it is the presence of Howerd that raises everything to a higher level  his delivery is classic and his material is head and shoulders above the rest of the script. I generally prefer the Carry On movies that have more of a setting and some narrative to them but Howerd makes this one work and it is an enjoyable entry in the series just as it started to go further down the road of crudity that would kill it late in the seventies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the second of the Carry On films set in a hospital and was released in 1967. It featured the first appearance in a Carry On film by the late great Frankie Howerd and he is excellent here. He went on to appear in Carry On Up The Jungle in 1970. Most of the Carry On regulars appear here though Charles Hawtrey is somewhat more subdued than normal. Kenneth Williams is also excellent as a smarmy doctor as is Hattie Jacques as the matron and Anita Harris also appears as a nurse. It was rumoured that Jim Dale did some of his own stunts and he has a great setpiece here on a rooftop as he hangs on for dear life. Sid James who suffered a heart attack just before the film was due to start shooting has less to do here though and spends most of the film in bed. I did not enjoy Barbara Windsor in this film though but I could never tolerate her as an actress she couldn't act for toffee and she only got parts in films because of her generous bosom. The film is funnier than some of the other Carry On films though and it has always remained one of my favourites of the series. I watched it again recently and I still found myself laughing even after all these years. I regard it as one of the best of the series and much better than most of their films to come during the 1970s. If you haven't already seen it then watch it on TV or DVD. You won't regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While there are few genuinely laughoutloud moments in this hospitalset film  and while it's a definite comedown from the 1950s CARRY ON NURSE  CARRY ON DOCTOR proves to be a worthwhile and effectively amusing entry from the middle of the series one that stands out perhaps because it proves a nice contrast to the number of periodset movies the team had been making previously.For me one of the best things about the production is that almost all of the team is present aside from the muchmissed Kenneth Connor still on his sixyear hiatus from the franchise. All that and you get Frankie Howerd too delivering a slightly more restrained performance than you'd expect from the actor.I enjoy the films that are set in single locations because they tend to work harder for the laughs and this is no exception. Although there's a noticeable emphasis on sex and titillation for laughs compared to earlier instalments this is still relatively tame compared to later efforts like CARRY ON DICK. Of the cast Jim Dale and Kenneth Williams are on top form and it's great to have Sid James and Barbara Windsor back in the fold even if both are in relatively minor parts. A fast pace and general feeling of hard work and physical performance on part of the cast make this a superior CARRY ON adventure.".

	schema:reviewBody "This entry in the 'Carry On' series doesn't really have a plot for the most part it is just a series of amusing incidents happening on a hospital ward. The film opens with Frankie Howerd giving a talk on how doctors aren't needed as good health is just a case of positive thinking... till he falls off the stage and sprains his back. Once he is in hospital we meet the other patients Sid James who is faking his illness to get away from his wife Charles Hawtrey who is suffering from a sympathetic pregnancy and Bernard Bresslaw who is recovering from an appendectomy and has a thing for one of the patients on the women's ward. Looking after them we have Hattie Jacques playing the matron as always and Jim Dale and Kenneth Williams as doctors Kilmore and Tinkle. There is a bit of plot towards the end when Dr. Kilmore sees trainee nurse Barbara Windsor on the roof and things she is about to jump when in reality she is just sunbathing... in his attempted rescue she thinks he is a peeping tom he slips on the roof and pulls off another nurse's dress and falls through a window and lands in another nurse's bath... this leads to his dismissal but the patients will do what it takes to get him reinstated.There are a decent number of amusing scenes I particularly liked it when Frankie Howerd overheard a conversation about how he would only be around for another week and assumed they meant that was how long he had to live... this gets even funnier when somebody comes round to measure the bed for new sheets and he thinks he is being measured for a coffin! I'm sure fans of the series will enjoy this as most of the regulars are to be seen even if some do have fairly small roles. Anybody familiar with the series will know what to expect of course plenty of slightly risqu jokes a modicum of slapstick and some wonderfully groanworthy puns but nothing really offensive.".

The world has changed a great deal since I heard that pun about tents and it must have had its effect on my sense of humor. This is almost unbearable silly. Performers make feeble jokes then turn to stare at the camera and cackle maniacally. It isn't the lowbrow farcical quality of the gags that are depressing. It's that they're not funny.The actors do their best and there are some familiar faces among them  Kenneth Williams Sid James Hattie Jacques  but what can they do with such shoddy material? It's like a television situation comedy that has defied its natural death and meanly continues to run long after it's begun to decompose.Benny Hill was more inventive and funnier. Monty Python compared to this is elegant wit.I might have picked a bad example to start with. Maybe other episodes are better. I hope so. I don't look forward to slitting my wrists.

	schema:reviewBody "The Clockmaker is a minor classic... so great in fact that nobody seems to know what to do with it.  Why?  Perhaps it doesn't fit neatly enough into the crime genre.  The first shots are provocative A child looks out from a train at a burning car.  As the opening titles hit the screen the music crescendoes.  We know something bad has just happened we brace ourselves for the violence to come.  The cinematography here has the hardhitting feel of expos cinema e.g. CostaGavras' Z'.  As if leaving its promise unfulfilled however this is the film's most dramatic moment.  The only violence as it were has occurred before the action director Bertrand Tavernier shows us.  Much like its principal characters we are left to contemplate what happened and WHY it took place.The story is simple enough.  Monsieur Decombes a clockmaker is interrupted at work by the local police.  They inform him that his abandoned car was found by the side of the road left there by Bernard his son.  Would he accompany them to go see it?  Under this pretext they bring him to the station where he meets a mysteriously evasive Inspector Guilboud.  They return to the vehicle together.  Only then does the inspector confront him with the awful truth Bernard and his girlfriend have killed a man. Decombes is shocked.  How could his boy have done it?  Throughout the rest of the film he struggles to understand this hideous crime and his relationship with Bernard ultimately left with more questions than answers.Mainstream moviegoers find The Clockmaker boring and anticlimactic. They're used to seeing crime flicks with action and plot twists.  Here they know the identity of the murderer from the start they never see a dead body or an exciting arrest and 90 of the focus is on the criminal's father. What they're left with is an hour and a half of wayward wanderings... of character development.  What could be more pedestrian?  One almost gets the sense that this was the very reason that Tavernier chose to bring Georges Simenon's book to the screen It's structure is a full inversion of what audiences are used to.  This is a point that deserves to be revisited later as it has a great deal to do with the deeper meanings of this work.While it won the Prix Louis Delluc The Clockmaker' has never been taken seriously by arthouse snobs either.  They call its direction heavyhanded.' They note the overthetop performances of Philippe Noiret and Jacques Denis not to mention Yves Afonso. runnerup to Alain Delon in the toocoolforwords competition.  Oddly they call it commercial'... a conventional social melodrama.  And while it isn't Hollywood melodrama of the Douglas Sirk or Nicholas Ray varieties there is some validity in this assertion.  The definition of melodrama' describes the film well A composition. intended to exhibit a picture of human life or to depict a series of grave or humorous actions of more than ordinary interest tending toward some striking result.'  And the point of the film is alltooobvious Love isn't clockwork.I've heard The Clockmaker' compared to many films including those of the French New Wave that preceded it.  Is there any similarity though between Tavernier's work and such melodramas as. say. Godard's Vivre sa vie' or Truffaut's The Soft Skin'?  There isn't.  Some have suggested that the film was the model for The Sweet Hereafter' in that both deal with isolation and the loss of children.  Yet where Egoyan's film is politically neutral to the point of nihilism The Clockmaker' outlines a specific set of social conditions that made murder an inevitability.  The factory watchman is the avatar for all socialclimbing capitalists. abusing his authority toward lecherous ends.  Liliane Bernard's girlfriend is the powerless victim. Whether or not Bernard pulled the trigger is immaterial.  In effect society has handed him the gun cocked and loaded.Personally I find the film more similar to the work of the New German Cinema. particularly Fassbinder's Mother Ksters Goes to Heaven.'  Both films begin just after murders have been committed.  Both films spotlight those who are left behind to deal with loved ones' unspeakable acts.  Both films give us radicals and reactionaries each determined to use the protagonists' woes to political advantage.  Ultimately The Clockmaker' is the more profound work of the two.  It is a true slice of life' and not the stagy drama that Mtter Ksters' is.  Starting from a conservative stance in its opening scene in which Decombes and his friends discuss the merits of capital punishment it turns out to be a liberal piece.  Its point as I see it is not merely that 'violence begets violence.'  True love in Tavernier's paradigm comes not from hearing but from listening. not from validation but from understanding. not from making things run like clockwork but from accepting the bumps in the road as part of the journey.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Clockmaker is a technically wellcrafted precision endeavor in direction writing and acting. Director Bertrand Tavernier fashions a subtle conservative character study asserted into the framework of a crime story a study of an aging middleclass clockmaker with a downcast disposition played or rather inhabited by Philippe Noiret. This commonplace man is stunned out of his sluggishness when he finds out that his only son has been arrested for murder.What is poignant about this story and what improves the usually dormant drama of a crime film is that Noiret lives quietly alone with his son who is almost grown up. In other words his son is his whole tranquil life. Yet when a detective played by mulishly tenacious Jean Rochefort asks him for help with the case Noiret grasps how little he knows about his son and struggles with his feeling that he is unable to blame him.The film opens on Noiret having a night out when his friends crack wise on the elections the leftists a protest rally and the death penalty. He has fun this night. The next day two policemen come to his shop and rummage around his adjoining apartment. They particularly search his son's room before taking him to the police station where Rochefort tells him his son is wanted for murder of a security guard at the place where his girlfriend was fired and has not been apprehended. There was even an eyewitness.Tavernier puts Noiret's character through a motley crew of odd dramatic angles aside from just the press who are of course just interested in ratings but also tangents to the main thread of the film like rightwing hooligans who vandalize his window and two girls who confirm how vile the murdered guard was to women. The skillful essence of the film is in the abstractness of it giving us impressions of how much his relationship with his son means to him and how bewildered he is that he has no idea what to do to help his son such as in his transit back home from the precinct and can't stand without feeling ill and has to ask a passenger for his seat.The film is not hardhitting enough to be great but it serves its locale with an authentic atmosphere. The story itself no matter how well it poignantly portrays a world in miniature is nevertheless very slight. On the whole The Clockmaker is a dramatic exercise. As many other French films from the 1960s and '70s were it is less about telling the story and more about technique. It doesn't compare to the boisterousness and selfconsciousness of most of the New Wave films of that time and in fact is a particularly subtle film. It is essentially a film that says of filmmaking Yes less is more.".

However this does not reduce  the total film quality. Tavernier's camera focuses on an ordinary widow clockmaker surrounding with the high tension political turmoil in Lyon early 1970s. Noiret's son is accused of a factory boss murder and runaway. Between police and his son Noiret tries to find the real reason that led the murder. But this is a neither action nor criminal movie. Pure relationship between father and son is the core theme of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "The star of this film is the city of Lyons which looks absolutely magnificent. The problem with the film is that it rambles along until the son is finally captured and tried and is reconciled with his father. The father doesn't seem to know what's going on at the start or how he feels about his son before eventually deciding that he wants him to escape. But the film just seems to drift from one encounter to another with the policeman with his friend with the press with his son's girlfriend's workmates with the woman who helped bring his son up. Perhaps the director is trying to show what it's like to be waiting for news in such a situation and the sense of not being able to do anything about it. Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort are both excellent in portraying sympathetic characters. The son and girlfriend are also portrayed as sympathetic  although we are never explicitly told why they committed the murder their victim is shown to have been a nasty piece of work. The almost documentary style is in contrast to the cinematic style of other Simenon adaptations such as Monsieur Hire and The Hatter's Ghost. No intrusive music as in Monsieur Hire for example.".

	schema:headline " The combination of Philippe Noiret and Bertrand Tavernier this time with Jean Rochefort make for a movie worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "Your son killed a man...We don't know why. The cause of the movie is the murder. The purpose of the movie is to look closely at Michel Descombes the father. The Clockmaker l'Horloger de SaintPaul is not a murder mystery. Were it not for the skills of Bertrand Tavernier and his frequent lead actor Philippe Noiret we might be in for a long introspective slog full of what it means to be a solitary human being. With these two and with Jean Rochefort as Inspector Guilboud we have a movie that explores loneliness friendship and eventually understanding with a good deal of depth and style. Descombes is a selfcontained man friendly enough probably what he thought of as a reasonably good parent but not an especially happy man. You're a widower? a policeman asks. No not exactly he says. We were already separated. I guess I am a widower. I was just as miserable as one. Descombes struggles to understand his young son. Inspector Guilboud struggles to understand the son's motive and then to understand the father. The more they learn however the more the fact of the matter stays the same the son murdered a man. I killed him because he was filth Bernard Descombes eventually declares. Guilboud finds some empathy with Descombes. Even so Descombes' son will be caught. France is a funny country Guilboud says. Fiftymillion inhabitants twenty million informants. Descombes' son seems to represent more than just another murderer to Guilboud a man with his own issues. He may see something of himself in Descombes. It is Descombes however who has to make the hardest journey to try to understand who is son is. The Clockmaker turns out to be one of the most interesting of the collaborations between Tavernier and Noiret even with the now dull political subtext of complacent and suffocating French society. Still the movie was made in 1974 an uneasy period. The movie finds itself however and the last twenty minutes are powerful minutes. I stand by my son...in complete solidarity. Without Noiret this movie would not have worked at all well in my opinion. With Noiret and Rochefort it works very well. Other films by Tavernier and starring Noiret that I recommend with enthusiasm include Coup de Torchon  Criterion Collection a marvelous black comedy Revenge of the Musketeers and Life and Nothing But.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bernard Tavernier once confessed that the greatest influence in his life had been the work of directors Akira Kurosawa and Michael Powell. This might explain his direction of the film based in the novel by Georges Simenon's.It shows a Tavernier more concerned with the character study of M. Descombes as he goes through the horror of understanding what had caused his son to commit the crime of which he is been accused of perpetrating. In doing so M. Tavernier embraces the old French cinema as he shuns away the New Wave methods of story telling.One can see clearly what's going on in Descombes' mind at all time. His son has grown up and is not a child anymore. We see this father come home and encounters newspaper reporters and he goes into his son's room and lays down in the bed that perhaps the younger man has not slept in for quite some time. We watch as Descombs descends into hell because he can't comprehend what has triggered his son into doing what seems repugnant to him and his dignity.Pilippe Noiret was born to play Descombes. This actor with such subtlety underplays the clockmaker and the father. What comes to the surface is the inner turmoil that Descombes is experiencing. This is another example of how good an actor M. Noiret is because with an economy of gestures he builds the character. Jean Rochefort as the inspector is also good. M. Rochefort is another actor that always surprises.This movie is a psychological portrait of a man at the crossroads of despair. Only at the end father and son seem reconciled with one another. The city of Lyons has been photographed lovingly in this film.This is a Tavernier for discriminating tastes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not love this movie but it was better than averageparticularly because of its originality. However to an American audience it may be difficult to relate to the French justice system circa 1974. At first the star of the movie Philippe Noiret is a rather apolitical man who seems quite ordinary. When the police inform them that his son has murdered someone he initially does pretty much what the police ask. When the investigating officer tries to get close to Philippe sort of buddy buddylike he allows him. However through the course of the film Philippe begins to see the police as the enemy and he rebuffs these attempts by the police to be friendly. The problem for me is WHO is right? Were the police at this point of time quick to violate human rights or manipulate the families of the accused? I really didn't know if Philippe was having his eyes opened to the truth or if he just learned to identify with and excuse evil. This would NOT pose a problem to a French audience but for those not familiar with the French legal system it seemed confusingwas Philippe a good man or a good man going bad? As far as the acting and pacing is concerned this is a good flick.".

He is equally excited about his imminent marriage to his assistant the officious Alice Swallow who is interested in him more for his work than for him as a person. David needs the 1 million endowment of wealthy dowager Mrs. Carleton Random to complete the project. Her lawyer Alexander Peabody will make the decision on her behalf so David needs to get in his favor. However whenever David tries to make a good impression on Peabody the same young woman always seems to do something to make him look bad. She is the flighty heiress Susan Vance. The more David wants Susan to go away the more Susan seems not to want or be able to. But David eventually learns that Alexander Peabody is her good friend who she calls Boopy and Susan's Aunt Elizabeth with whom David has also made a bad ...";

In Bringing Up Baby her Susan Vance is a very interesting diversion from her more usual type of character  the slightly superior incontrol ice maiden as shown in say The Philadelphia Story. She is phenomenal in that film yet here beguiling in a completely different fashion playing a slightly scatterbrained sprightly charmingly delinquent woman who seems to have no control over anything least of all her feelings for Grant. Her giddy breathless exuberance and anarchic helplessness are really endearing it's a wonderful film that stretches out the credulity of Grant's wonderfully straightlaced character's resistance to Miss Vance. The ending is a gorgeous satisfying payoff as he finally gives way as would we all! It's a charming suitable ending that rectifies the slight falloff of the preceding jail section of the film. That is very amusing but in a more predictable slightly laboured way. In stark contrast to the first 7080 minutes of the film which amounts to about the finest sustained American comedy I have seen of that length  Way Out West and Duck Soup being shorter in total. Cary Grant truly an institution of a comedic player is very different to his more remembered persona of later years. It's remarkable to see this absurd little man bespectacled unworldly and cutting an orthodox figure played so perfectly by the suave Grant. This is gleefully played on with the sublime scene where Hepburn and Grant are trying to catch the leopard  Kate butterfly net in hand! She accidentally happens to break his glasses and is even more taken with him without them... The tension between how we usually remember Grant and the character he is playing here does add an extra layer of amusement to the film.

But she's doing some serious poaching on a young version of the kind of roles Mary Boland or Billie Burke would play. Think of the parts these two women played and you can definitely see Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby if you imagine Boland and Burke years younger.Bringing Up Baby is one of those beautiful films that really doesn't have a plot. Try to tell someone verbally the plot of this it cannot be done. From the moment airheaded Kate gets into uptight Cary's car in that parking lot with him chasing her it's just one madcap situation after another. Howard Hawks directs this film with the appropriate light touch the material requires.Cary Grant is not the usual suave sophisticate you normally find him cast as either. He's an uptight paleontologist who's biggest thrill up to that point is the arrival of a brontosaurus vertebrae so that he can complete a skeleton. He's also getting married but the woman he's engaged gives him hints that married life will not be any bed of roses for him. Whether he knows it or not he's ready for the romp Kate has in store for him.Thirties audiences definitely loved seeing the rich at play. Bringing Up Baby is the definition of escapist entertainment. But one who hasn't the means shouldn't indulge it what Hepburn is doing. They've got a padded cell waiting for anyone who's not rich who indulges in this kind of behavior. Only the rich can afford to be eccentric.Baby by the way is a tame leopard who Kate's brother sends up from South America. That would be a jaguar by the way but that's just mere details. Anyway Baby escapes at the same time another leopard from the circus escapes and he's dangerous. I won't go into the confusion there I couldn't describe it in any event.May Robson and Charlie Ruggles lend good support. Ruggles who was normally cast against Mary Boland teams up well with May Robson. And my favorite in the supporting cast is Walter Catlett as the small town constable who doesn't know quite what he has on his hands but is determined to bluff the situation through.".

	schema:headline " Utter perfection. Howard Hawks Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant make the most exquisite comedy of the sound era";
	schema:reviewBody "In his glorious Bringing Up Baby Howard Hawks ratchets screwball comedy up to its tautest and springiest level. In clumsier hands screwball all too often gallops into the frenetic fraying the nerves Hawks maintains a presto pace but never lets the mixups and misunderstandings grow implausible  he just glides serenely to something else. And he makes it look easy which it isn't Peter Bogdanovich fumbled in his loose remake What's Up Doc making it labored and literalminded. Hawks could barely go wrong with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant as his leads but the rest of the cast he assembles human as well as animal can't be faulted either with the redoubtable May Robson earning extra credit. And while he draws on stock characters and stereotypes that probably date back to commedia dell'arte  the stuffy professor the blithe rich girl her crusty dowager aunt the bumbling sheriff  he freshens each one up making them distinctive memorable and endearing.Behind a pair of repressive spectacles Grant plays the singleminded paleontologist whose path crosses with that of madcap Hepburn never again to uncross. The plot revolves around a leopard named Baby a million dollars an intercostal clavicle bone a dog named George who buries it....well it all makes perfect sense while you're watching.Underneath all the antics Hawks never loses sight of the pastoral romance that Bringing Up Baby at its core really is at its most magical in the woods under a full moon and captured by Russell Metty's lovely photography. Grant's been rooting around in the dirt for so long looking for dinosaur bones that it takes him forever to 'get' Hepburn  an airborne sprite who never comes down to earth. Their alchemy here is rarefied not the commoner sort of reaction they kindled in the stagebound The Philadelphia Story. Last but not least the movie features the canine talents of Asta n Skippy who appeared as himself in the Thin Man series  Nick and Nora Charles' lovable cur. Here he plays George who barking his stubby tail off has no qualms about tangling with Baby the leopard. Is there any question that this highstrung wirehaired terrier is and will forever be pace RinTinTin and Lassie Hollywood's top dog? How fitting that he should lend his considerable talents to Bringing Up Baby the most exquisite comedy of the sound era.".

And while he draws on stock characters and stereotypes that probably date back to commedia dell'arte  the stuffy professor the blithe rich girl her crusty dowager aunt the bumbling sheriff  he freshens each one up making them distinctive memorable and endearing.Behind a pair of repressive spectacles Grant plays the singleminded paleontologist whose path crosses with that of madcap Hepburn never again to uncross. The plot revolves around a leopard named Baby a million dollars an intercostal clavicle bone a dog named George who buries it....well it all makes perfect sense while you're watching.Underneath all the antics Hawks never loses sight of the pastoral romance that Bringing Up Baby at its core really is at its most magical in the woods under a full moon and captured by Russell Metty's lovely photography. Grant's been rooting around in the dirt for so long looking for dinosaur bones that it takes him forever to 'get' Hepburn  an airborne sprite who never comes down to earth. Their alchemy here is rarefied not the commoner sort of reaction they kindled in the stagebound The Philadelphia Story. Last but not least the movie features the canine talents of Asta n Skippy who appeared as himself in the Thin Man series  Nick and Nora Charles' lovable cur. Here he plays George who barking his stubby tail off has no qualms about tangling with Baby the leopard. Is there any question that this highstrung wirehaired terrier is and will forever be pace RinTinTin and Lassie Hollywood's top dog? How fitting that he should lend his considerable talents to Bringing Up Baby the most exquisite comedy of the sound era.";

Most people would consider Hepburn a dramatic actress largely because of her later body of work e.g. The Lion In Winter. But BUB proves she is a dazzling charming comedienne well able to go toetotoe with the funniest men in the business. Grant is wonderfully generous in allowing her to dominate the movie by playing the straight man and he does so wonderfully as well.Watch this for Hepburn watch this for Grant watch this for Hepburn and Grant... and oh yes watch it for the leopard.

From this point on Huxley is subject to an almost continuous series of humiliations and misfortunes.Those who claim that Bringing up Baby isn't funny because of the cruel way that Hepburn's character treats Grant's are missing the point. If the film's events were taking place in the real world then many of Hepburn's actions would be inexcusable but the point is that these events are happening in a world without consequences where anything goes and this is the premise on which much of the film's humour is based.The presence of a tame leopard called Baby provides further evidence that the film is trying to distance itself as far as possible from the boring predictability of reality. Much humour is derived from the contrasting attitudes of Hepburn and Grant towards the leopard. Whereas she reacts as if it were a small kitten despite it's need for massive quantities of raw meat Grant seems genuinely terrified even though the animal shows no signs of aggression.One of the most remarkable things about Bringing up Baby is the extent to which it remains enjoyable today. While many films regarded as classics in the 30's seem somewhat dated now Bringing up Baby seems as fresh as it ever did thanks largely to the energetic central performances. Grant is terrific as the professor who gradually loses his inhibitions but Hepburn steals the show as a selfabsorbed young woman who wins the audience over through her lack of inhibitions.Films such as Bringing up Baby became far less common as America geared up for World War II and people began to lose interest in screwball comedy. This makes the film all the more significant as it is undoubtedly one of the defining examples of a genre which never reemerged in quite the same form again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sitting there watching this thinking So this is what people liked to watch back in 1938. Then when I get through and look at the trivia section of IMDb I find out actually they didn't. This movie almost destroyed several careers. So it appears given the rave reviews here that the movie audiences back then were actually more discerning than today. No wonder given the wonderful movies being produced back then especially 1938 and 1939. They had caviar to pick from and Howard Hawks was serving hot dogs.Why doesn't this work? For one thing there is hardly any change of pace and not enough grounding in reality to set off the comedy. Most of all I didn't like the Hepburn character and didn't care what happened to her. And I felt sorry for the poor schlemiel Cary Grant was playing. But the bottom line was there wasn't enough depth to the characters. The only characters I truly cared about were Baby played by Nissa and George played by Asta the star of the Thin Man series. Bringing Up Baby has its moments and is mostly bearable though you start looking at your watch after awhile. I suppose it would go down better after a few glasses of wine or tequila.From the reviews here I have to wonder what some people see in screwball comedies like this. Perhaps after being brought up on modern lame brain comedy this looks good. It is a lot better than most modern comedies.At the heart of the screwball formula appears to be a misunderstanding preferably one big central one and many little ones. This is definitely not the best old screwball comedy. I can think of several contenders but the winner I believe goes to Harvey. For a romantic comedy closer to this that works see My Man Godfrey which does right what this does wrong. For an example of a modern screwball comedy that works see The Russians are Coming! This is not the worst major screwball comedy a title that belongs to Twentieth Century. What a stinker! On the other hand if you like that one you're going to love Bringing Up Baby. When you boil this down you've got to wonder what were the studio executives thinking? They're sitting around the conference table executives enveloped in cigar smoke writers coughingLet's do a movie with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. OK. A comedy. Hmmmm .... Hepburn as a flighty socialite. Sounds good. Grant as a paleontologist. I can't see it. Just give him glasses. We need something more. We'll add in a pet leopard. Why? People love animals. And a dog. That Asta from Thin Man. Asta and the Leopard will chase each other around and fall in love. What about Grant and Hepburn?They'll chase each other around too. Or rather Hepburn will Chase Grant and Grant will keep trying to get away. They will of course fall in love but Grant won't know it. The audiences will love it! Can't lose!The writers deserve some credit for managing to build a movie on this thin foundation but it needed more than just a bunch of good lines it needed a plot. The performances by Hepburn and Grant were good enough although Hepburn seems out to win an Oscar for fastest talker it was the script and directing that failed. The real winner was the leopard.Bringing Up Baby turned out to be a warm up a practice run for Philadelphia Story two years later which has plenty of screwball elements but which slows it down a bit and which has a story where you actually care about the main characters and how it turns out for them. And it is actually funny. If you define a screwball comedy as a movie where the comedy gas pedal is stuck to the floor Bringing Up Baby qualifies. But there are few comedies that can keep up such a frenetic pace and make it work. I think it's generally better to vary the pace of comedy in a movie or the viewer is liable to fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion. Good night.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm sitting there watching this thinking So this is what people liked to watch back in 1938. Then when I get through and look at the trivia section of IMDb I find out actually they didn't. This movie almost destroyed several careers. So it appears given the rave reviews here that the movie audiences back then were actually more discerning than today. No wonder given the wonderful movies being produced back then especially 1938 and 1939. They had caviar to pick from and Howard Hawks was serving hot dogs.Why doesn't this work? For one thing there is hardly any change of pace and not enough grounding in reality to set off the comedy. Most of all I didn't like the Hepburn character and didn't care what happened to her.

	schema:reviewBody "I have sat through this screwball comedy two times and I never laughed. I remember watching one of those dreadful Police Academy movies which left me guffawless chortleless. In short when you make a comedy it's supposed to be funny.I understand that people find this film a screwball comedy classic. When the movie premiered in 1938 it was a flop. Now some seventy years later it is considered one of the best movies of the screwball genre. How much of this is revisionist Hollywood history is anybody's guess.Of course we all miss debonair Cary and the great Katharine Hepburn.But you can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse and this movie remains to me a sow's ear. Let's get right to it. Katharine Hepburn has no flair for this type of comedy. She is devastating perfect as Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story. Lovely vulnerable fully in command Hepburn was born to play the pompous socialite. There is much humor in the story's telling but it is all quite natural.Bringing Up Baby looks like a movie sounds like a movie. I seem to be constantly aware that Hepburn is trying to be funny. I don't believe her for a moment as a scatterbrained dunderhead.I don't even enjoy Cary Grant as Dr. Huxley. The whole movie seems forced. I do believe this is Hepburn's one attempt at screwball comedy and thank God for that. Grant is hilarious in Arsenic and Old Lace. The energy he generates seems genuine. Although the film is a bit stagey since it came from Broadway I do find the gallows humor of Arsenic a fine comic turn for Grant.One reviewer who loves this movie says that it's not supposed to make sense like I am not getting it. I could say that easily about Duck Soup with the Marx Brothers. That also was considered a flop at the time but is deservedly recognized now as probably their best film. The Marx Brothers were Jerry Seinfeld sixty years earlier. Duck Soup is truly about nothing makes no sense and is all out Marxian anarchy. And perhaps I am a bit too enamored of one Carole Lombard who was gorgeous and funny at the same time. That is no mean trick for a woman but Carole could do it. You want to see one of the best screwball comedies? I suggest Nothing Sacred with Fredric March and Lombard. Twentieth Century with Carole and John Barrymore.Of course art is so subjective. One man's meat is another man's poison. I do not find Bringing Up Baby funny. Not at all.".

Basically Hepburn's character has got a leopard the baby of the title which of course escapes and various predictable japes ensue. That's it folks!Unfortunately the studio decided to steamroller this movie out to 1h40 instead of keeping it more palatable at about 1h10.

Hawks and Grant considered it a disaster and for their next pairing His Girl Friday were careful to get an actress and script that really could carry the weight of a screwball comedy.

This is a disaster in all but one dimension.And yet there are people today who think this is hilarious. Enough even to place this on several best of lists. Its one of the great puzzles in life this. I mean its a mystery as big as the sun why people laugh in the first place. But why they laugh at different things just boggles.In my opinion Hepburn does a fine job in looking truly attractive in a sugared nutcase sort of way. Her incompetence in handling the character sort of works with her one strength how to manage what's dangled what's seductive. But her comic timing is all off and it throws Grant off too. No one can see what Grant and Russell did in Friday in how they established a rhythm that Hawks could extend into the container of the banter no one can see that and think this worked. But they do. The only explanation I have is that we now are used to intended incoherence and we as moviegoers accepted Kate in her reengineered state. So we project modern measures back on this.I didn't laugh.

	schema:headline " You either love it or hate it. I hated it";
	schema:reviewBody "What is it with comedy? It is impossible to be judicious about it. If you see a thriller that doesn't thrill you just shrug your shoulders. But if you see a comedy that doesn't make you laugh you feel insulted. You hate the movie and you hate the fact that other people think it is a riot.Actually it is not all comedies that polarise reactions in this way. If the comedy arises naturally from the characters or the situations then movies can be enjoyable even if they elicit no more than the occasional smile. The problems arise when the characters or situations have no rationale except to be funny. That is the problem here.I find this movie a hopeless exasperating experience because nothing in it exists except to get laughs and for me it doesn't.The characters are infuriating. Katherine Hepburn never looked better. She is so beautiful it could make you cry but within about ten minutes I was praying for Cary Grant to strangle this impossible selfcentred gibbering chatterbox. It probably took Hepburn years to live down the illwill this movie generated.Cary Grant fares nearly as badly. He was completely emasculated and playing against type. When the Hepburn character falls in love with him you feel she must have been watching his other movies because this ineffectual wimp couldn't possibly have attracted her.Charlie Ruggles is just pathetically begging for laughs. They don't come.Similarly all the 'comic' situations are painfully contrived. It is one of those movies where people are constantly being misunderstood and constantly doing things that baffle other people. But the comedy is not generated by the perplexing situations in which the characters find themselves. It derives from the fact that nobody can explain any of their actions intelligibly nobody listens to what anybody else says and nobody is allowed to finish a sentence. If they could or did it would instantly defuse the situations and kill the comedy. But comedy that relies on relentlessly improbable or unreasonable behaviour is the laziest kind of comedy.To make things worse the movie has no focus. There are three almost independent comic threads. Firstly Hepburn is trying to prevent Grant from marrying. This is problematic because for most of the movie she has no reason to suppose that Grant doesn't love his fianc that she doesn't love him that she is wrong for him or that Grant really loves her. If this plot element was isolated the Hepburn character would be left exposed as a highly unsympathetic manipulative bitch.Fortunately this dubious premise is diluted with the business of the dog and the loss of the 'intercostal clavicle' the best comic idea in the picture. Then on top of that we get the roaming Baby and the confusion with the second leopard. But rather than this being a rich comic mixture the picture seems overstuffed and directionless. To paper over the cracks the movie races along without any variation in pace or tone and seems much longer than it actually is. It might have some good lines in it but they are all lost in the machine gun delivery that everybody effects. All this frantic activity is trying to cover for a lack of real comic invention. It sweats desperation from every pore.Comedy probably dates more quickly than any other sort of entertainment. We cannot always judge the impact of a comedy film by our responses today. However this film cannot be excused in that way. It was given the thumbs down by audiences when it was first released.I have to applaud their good judgement.".

Even in incredibly silly scenes the movie is based in real and true emotions. John Waters' love for the fun parts of the 50's and hatred of the status quo that obviously made his teen years a living hell is all over this film.Yes scenes such as the orphanage are silly but the cynicism of the orphanage workers and the angst of the mother are as real as can be.  The silliness works because the John Waters BELIEVES in what he is saying and makes damn sure that his actors are with him!All of the actors from Johnny Depp who as with all of his roles becomes the character to Joe Dallesandro who barely can get his lines out believe in their characters.CryBaby parodies 50's Teen Rebel musicals such as Rock Around the Clock and Don't Knock the Rock but with obvious affection.Yes it's a musical.  If you're one of those cynics who says things like But people DON'T just start singing in real life don't see it.

They're not diaries they're not reality they're MOVIES!CryBaby is a lot of fun and the soundtrack is terrific and Hairspray's is even better!.If you liked CryBaby I recommend Hairspray not quite so silly just as sweet. and But I'm A Cheerleader which is definitely Watersinspired from its use of pink to its incredibly true emotions within very silly situations.If you didn't like CryBaby how sad.

	schema:headline " Snazzy and fun musicalcomedy with John Waters' style.";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't expect to watch a movie in the style of Grease when you watch CryBaby. This is a John Waters musicalcomedy and it's full of his style and humor. John Waters has his own style of directing and his own style for writing dialogue. The dialogue and acting are usually out of the mainstream norm and viewers who are not familiar with John Waters may not enjoy his films unless they open their minds to possibilities of silly ridiculous vulgar and campy humor. CryBaby is set in the 1950's and it's mainly about two groups of people who don't accept each other The drapes and the squares. The drapes don't have a lot of money are more accepting to different types of people and listen to the hep sounds of rhythm and blues and rockabilly. Some of them get involved with crime and are juvenile delinquents. The squares are very conservative have more money more attitude and listen to your hit parade music. The drapes will hang out with anyone as long as there's a good time to be had and the squares only socialize with other squares. There is friction and disgust whenever the two types meet. Within this is a love story concerning CryBaby and Allison. CryBaby is a drape and Allison is a square tired of being so conservative. CryBaby and Allison are attracted to each other and Allison decides to associate with the drapes. Conflicts emerge and drapes and squares clash. That sounds clichd but the movie has a lot of humor and atmosphere. It's also full of color spirit and fun music. The locations and sets create a 1950's atmosphere of small town and rural America. The cars clothing and hairstyles are also effective. Sometimes clothes hairstyles props and sets are exaggerated and outrageous but these are trademarks of John Waters' style and sense of humor. CryBaby has its charm and is effective as both a comedy and a musical. The musical numbers are fun and lively and a lot of care went into making the songs sound authentic to the period. They are also well choreographed. Some of the musical numbers were written for the movie and a few songs were originally 1950's hits newly recorded for CryBaby such as the song that opens the movie Allison singing Teenage Prayer etc. There are also original vintage recordings throughout the movie my favorite is Jungle Drums by Earl Bostic which really gives a summer feeling to the Turkey Point location. The background score is also well done and professionally orchestrated. This is a John Waters film and you have to expect unusual characters and unusual acting and dialogue delivery. The casting of the movie is an interesting mix of performers another Waters' trademark and very much a delight. The cast is terrific! Johnny Depp and Amy Locane are wonderful as the teenagers who are attracted to each other but live in different worlds. Their pairing brings out a believable chemistry and a sense of fun. Polly Bergen's performance is excellent as the extremely conservative matriarch who finally learns how to have a good time with people who are different. Susan Tyrrell is as offbeat as she can be see her in the bizarre musicalcomedy Forbidden Zone and Iggy Pop is interesting in his role. Ricki Lake returns in her second John Waters movie as CryBaby's pregnant sister. Kim McGuire Darren E. Burrows and Traci Lords create fun characters who are in CryBaby's gang and music group. Kim McGuire has a knack for creating a character who's kookie and bold and yet deserves sympathy at times. Traci Lords is very good at comedy and it would be nice to see her in more comedies. She does a great job with her mostlycranky toughgirl character. Stephen Mailer does a fine job of creating a character you really learn to loathe. CryBaby also features small parts played by noted stars such as Troy Donahue Joe Dallesandro Joey Heatherton David Nelson Willem Dafoe and John Waters regular Mink Stole.

CryBaby was a lot of fun to watch on the big screen and I'm again enjoying it since it's been released on DVD with added scenes that were cut for its theatrical release. CryBaby is a snazzy and fun musicalcomedy that seems to be pleasing people who are not regular John Waters fans!

	onyx:emotionText "Don't expect to watch a movie in the style of Grease when you watch CryBaby. This is a John Waters musicalcomedy and it's full of his style and humor. John Waters has his own style of directing and his own style for writing dialogue. The dialogue and acting are usually out of the mainstream norm and viewers who are not familiar with John Waters may not enjoy his films unless they open their minds to possibilities of silly ridiculous vulgar and campy humor. CryBaby is set in the 1950's and it's mainly about two groups of people who don't accept each other The drapes and the squares. The drapes don't have a lot of money are more accepting to different types of people and listen to the hep sounds of rhythm and blues and rockabilly. Some of them get involved with crime and are juvenile delinquents. The squares are very conservative have more money more attitude and listen to your hit parade music. The drapes will hang out with anyone as long as there's a good time to be had and the squares only socialize with other squares. There is friction and disgust whenever the two types meet. Within this is a love story concerning CryBaby and Allison. CryBaby is a drape and Allison is a square tired of being so conservative. CryBaby and Allison are attracted to each other and Allison decides to associate with the drapes. Conflicts emerge and drapes and squares clash. That sounds clichd but the movie has a lot of humor and atmosphere. It's also full of color spirit and fun music. The locations and sets create a 1950's atmosphere of small town and rural America. The cars clothing and hairstyles are also effective. Sometimes clothes hairstyles props and sets are exaggerated and outrageous but these are trademarks of John Waters' style and sense of humor. CryBaby has its charm and is effective as both a comedy and a musical. The musical numbers are fun and lively and a lot of care went into making the songs sound authentic to the period. They are also well choreographed. Some of the musical numbers were written for the movie and a few songs were originally 1950's hits newly recorded for CryBaby such as the song that opens the movie Allison singing Teenage Prayer etc. There are also original vintage recordings throughout the movie my favorite is Jungle Drums by Earl Bostic which really gives a summer feeling to the Turkey Point location. The background score is also well done and professionally orchestrated. This is a John Waters film and you have to expect unusual characters and unusual acting and dialogue delivery. The casting of the movie is an interesting mix of performers another Waters' trademark and very much a delight. The cast is terrific! Johnny Depp and Amy Locane are wonderful as the teenagers who are attracted to each other but live in different worlds. Their pairing brings out a believable chemistry and a sense of fun. Polly Bergen's performance is excellent as the extremely conservative matriarch who finally learns how to have a good time with people who are different. Susan Tyrrell is as offbeat as she can be see her in the bizarre musicalcomedy Forbidden Zone and Iggy Pop is interesting in his role. Ricki Lake returns in her second John Waters movie as CryBaby's pregnant sister. Kim McGuire Darren E. Burrows and Traci Lords create fun characters who are in CryBaby's gang and music group. Kim McGuire has a knack for creating a character who's kookie and bold and yet deserves sympathy at times. Traci Lords is very good at comedy and it would be nice to see her in more comedies. She does a great job with her mostlycranky toughgirl character. Stephen Mailer does a fine job of creating a character you really learn to loathe. CryBaby also features small parts played by noted stars such as Troy Donahue Joe Dallesandro Joey Heatherton David Nelson Willem Dafoe and John Waters regular Mink Stole. Patricia Hearst Makes her feature film debut and is very amusing as the naive mother of a drape daughter. CryBaby was a lot of fun to watch on the big screen and I'm again enjoying it since it's been released on DVD with added scenes that were cut for its theatrical release.

As a lover of old musicals from the 50s and 60s it's just amusing to watch a spoof of them especially one done so well as this. My fav scene don't worry..no spoilers.. is one where Crybaby JD performs a song in a comedic Elvis Presley fashion which shows how dynamic JD is as an actor. what else makes this movie great? The music. There's not one boring song where you feel like it'll never end because you don't want it to end. yes i own the soundtrack..i'm pathetic i know. It's just a great movie..well if you like a musical that spoofs other musicals.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of the rockabilly fashion of the 50's and of John Waters you will like this movie. Personally I was a big fan of it. It's one of my favorite movies.This movie involves two groups the squares and the greasers. While most teen movies set in the 50's involve typical preppy high school students this one was on the side of the greasers. This is what I found fun and interesting. The world in which the greasers live is fun and colorful. The characters are all social outcasts or delinquents as they call them in the movie. This is what is so particular. Maybe this isn't what life in the 50's was really about but it gives the illusions that you're seeing an aspect of life during that time that you normally don't see. It was a pleasant and fun to watch movie. It was also very cartoony which is something I like in a movie very much. The imagery is very pleasant. However it's not a movie for everyone. It can easily be seen as cheesy. And if you're expecting a typical 50's musical like Grease there's a good chance you won't like this one since it makes you root so much for the social outcasts. This movie doesn't show the typical clean 50's that people enjoy so much. This movie also makes fun of the typical bad boy image of the 50's. But doesn't it also poke fun at the image that Johnny Depp had at the time? In several interviews done after the release of this movie Depp mentioned that he enjoyed playing that role because it was a satire of the image he had and that he also disliked very much. I think this is the type of movie that can easily become someone's favorite but that can be hated by a lot of viewers. Maybe the dancing and the singing isn't as good as in Grease. But you have to remember that this is a light and fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. It can also be seen as a satire of typical musicals. I would definitely recommend it.".

In addition to having scenes added to the movie it also has deleted scenes available in the extras including some rather disturbing ones with Toe Joe and Wanda and most of which were better off out of the movie.

Depp the bad ass rebel greaser from the wrong side of the tracks finds he has a soft side for the goodygoody square Amy Locane. Locane is sick of being uptight and wants to be bad for once in her life.This movie gives you gangs fights like in West Side Story the goodgirl wants badboy like in Grease great songs and dancing like in both movies but with it's own great cheesy twist. You've got teen delinquents vs. goodygoodys gang rumbles jail time lies heartbreak and then of course a happy ending. All of the people that commented about how CryBaby was trying but failed to be like Grease or Elvis' movies blah blah blah need to see this movie again. It's not trying to be those movies it's making fun of them. So lighten up sit down munch on some popcorn and have a good time. Sing a long if you'd like too. I know I do!".

I like to watch them together. They have good chemistry. This movie is so funny and weird in a good way. I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes films about 1950s culture completely exaggerated. It is great though. My favorite part is when Allison sings Please Mr. Jailer it is a good song and a funny part. Traci Lords is great in the movie also Patty Hearst plays her mother. She is hilarious. They all are great actors and I think this movie really shows it. It may be a comedy but it is a love story and you will fall in love with Wade Crybaby Walker and Allison VernonWilliams. It is a great movie!".

	schema:headline " I wouldn't call him a crybaby if I were you";
	schema:reviewBody "When I see a film like John Waters' CryBaby it almost whispers to me that there should be no such thing as a parody movie. There should only be homages to clichs genres and eras. CryBaby is an homage to the era of the fifties where greasy hair tight jeans leather jackets and rock 'n' roll was the norm. While not being alive in the fifties but knowing a lot about the lifestyle culture and politics of the era I can say that from my own knowledge it seems like it knows what it's doing.John Waters is a provocative film director which makes him the perfect yet unexpected director for a film of this magnitude. It's an odd yet delightful film that would be misunderstood by a mainstream audience but a scrumptious bowl of delight to his cult following. For that reason is why it most likely didn't do well at the box office. Like all of Waters' films it developed a cult following years later but has always been unfairly compared to his more successful musical Hairspray.CryBaby and Hairspray are two different films. Hairspray follows a chubby teenage girl who wants to become a dancer in a town divided by racial segregation. It wasn't trying to pay homage to anything but was trying to be a fun and energetic musical with a message. CryBaby is the exact opposite. It's a film that follows the rebellious rocker Wade CryBaby Walker played fantastically by Johnny Depp who occupies a strange ability to cry one single tear from his left eye.This ability woos all the girls including Alison VernonWilliams Locane a good girl who finally wants to cut loose and shy away from her cutesy image. She wants to join CryBaby and his gang of Drapes a pun on the name greaser. She herself is a square taken in by her grandparents after her parents' death. The problem is that she can't totally rely on CryBaby because his rebellious lifestyle tends to get him in a lot of trouble.Like a lot of good campy films there is no real plot. Just very interesting characters. What CryBaby is too is a delightful social commentary on new generation trends and the old ones' response on them. Every decade comes with trends the sixties for their peace the seventies for their rebellion the eighties for their wackiness and the nineties for their laid back style. Each trend receives shocked looks from adults and natural ones from the teens involved in them. CryBaby shows how different lifestyles are taken by each generation and then bashed by people who went through that same rebellious state when they were younger. It's hypocritical sure but it's natural. After all we all want the best for our youngins. So we want them to stay away from the rebellious lifestyles. But we also want them to be unique. What a paradox.I'm making the film sound too serious when in fact it's subtle in its commentary. It's a highenergy film all around. The musical numbers are catchy and addicting and the actors do a great job with the material that has been handed to them. Especially Depp who basically tells us whatever I act in you'll have to accept. CryBaby floats in a sea of innocence and isn't at all cocky with its material like some films are in the same genre. It simply wants to show us the paradox of generations a well done character study on multiple different people a mixture of Elvis films Grease and others of the leather jacketgeneration and just a fun musical as well. Its campy style will be disliked by some questioned by many but loved by the true cultcravers.Starring Johnny Depp Amy Locane Susan Tyrrell Polly Bergen Iggy Pop Ricki Lake Traci Lords Kim McGuire Darren E. Burrows Stephen Mailer Troy Donahue Patricia Hearst and Joey Heatherton. Directed by John Waters.".

But if you're fan of Rebel Without a Cause The Wild One The Deliquents etc...well then you simply shouldn't miss this film.Wade 'Cry Baby' Walker is the bad boy who is in reality not so bad. He has a soft side and is in love with the squeaky clean good girl Allison. Their affair causes a rift between the two social factions of Baltimore the rich kid 'Squares' and the cool kid 'Drapes'. The characters are way over the top the dialog is oh so clichd....and that's what makes it fantastic! The soundtrack doesn't hurt either! Just like Waters' Hairspray the soundtrack is almost a lead character itself. Even the choreographed production numbers which is something I'd normally hate are extremely enjoyable because they're such obvious jabs at Elvis movie song sequences.The cast of this film is just amazing. Johnny Depp is supremo hot and Amy Locane is great considering she was only 19 and just starting her career. Iggy Pop is PERFECT and absolutely adorable as Uncle Belvedere. Ricky Lake Traci Lords and the rest of the 'gang' are a hoot! And of course there's Patty Hearst Willem Defoe and the legendary Polly Bergen and lovely Joey Heatherton you'll find her unrecognizable as Milton's sourpuss bible thumping mother! The best thing about the cast though was the inclusion of some of the actual old teen stars from the '50s in cameos David Nelson Troy Donahue. Fun script fun cast...just FUN all around! 910".

Johnny Depp is immense in this and is totally as sweet as sugar. You will his single lonely tear drop almost as much as his Elvis style dancing! Watch this film it's great really!";

	schema:headline " The Spaghetti Western in its Earliest Incarnation";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Mario Caiano's serious straightforward Continental western Bullets Don't Argue exemplifies the Spaghetti western in its earliest phrase. Basically anything that predates Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars qualifies as first phrase Spaghetti western when the genre still bore an amazing resemblance to American westerns. Bounty hunters weren't heroes while lawmen were. Rod Cameron stars here as a Randolph Scott type hero and Bullets Don't Argue resembles a lowbudget Budd Boetticher horse opera that mismanages two western legends. This mediocre shoot'em up lacks any surprises and the narrative unfolds along the course of a life and death journey. Rod Cameron seems personable enough as Sheriff Pat Garrett of Rivertown an American town on Rio Grande who has to recover thousands of dollars that two outlaws have stolen from the town bank. The outlaws gun down a couple of bar employees and hightail it for the border. They robbed the bank while the town lawman was getting married. Garrett and a posse follow the outlaws to the Rio Grande but only Garrett crosses over in Mexico. He has to capture Billy Clanton Horst Frank of The Grand Duel and George ngel Aranda of The Hellbenders. Mind you Billy Clanton is a far cry from Billy the Kid and the real Billy Clanton died in the infamous O.K. Corral showdown in Tombstone. Nevertheless Horst Frank seems perfectly cast as the triggerhappy Billy. Dick Palmer isn't flamboyant enough as the villain Santero. Later Spaghetti western Mexicans would rate diabolical but Palmer is just plain dull here. The only two distinctive things about Bullets Don't Argue is an anonymous Ennio Morricone orchestral score and Carlo Simi's striking art direction. Scenarists Gianni Castellano Pedro de Juan and Giuseppe Moccia keep the clichs intact in this thoroughly traditional law  order western that looks as saddle sore as Rod Cameron. Not only does Cameron have the equivalent of a bad Stetson day with a stupid looking hat but he also winds up in an oater that kills off its primary villain threequarters of the way through it. During his ride through Mexico Garrett struggles to avoid a confrontation with the Rurales the Mexican authorities because he fears that they won't recognize the legality of his actions. When Garrett pays 2000 for food and horses to a Mexican businessman the latter wastes no time informing Santero about the thousands in cash that Garrett has. The Mexicans try to take the money from Garrett and at one point things look pretty bleak for our protagonist when he has to hole up with a rancher to hold off Santero's gunmen. The ending is straight out of an American western. While there is little that is unique about this standardissue oater it never wears out its welcome.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Mario Caiano's serious straightforward Continental western Bullets Don't Argue exemplifies the Spaghetti western in its earliest phrase. Basically anything that predates Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars qualifies as first phrase Spaghetti western when the genre still bore an amazing resemblance to American westerns. Bounty hunters weren't heroes while lawmen were. Rod Cameron stars here as a Randolph Scott type hero and Bullets Don't Argue resembles a lowbudget Budd Boetticher horse opera that mismanages two western legends. This mediocre shoot'em up lacks any surprises and the narrative unfolds along the course of a life and death journey. Rod Cameron seems personable enough as Sheriff Pat Garrett of Rivertown an American town on Rio Grande who has to recover thousands of dollars that two outlaws have stolen from the town bank. The outlaws gun down a couple of bar employees and hightail it for the border. They robbed the bank while the town lawman was getting married. Garrett and a posse follow the outlaws to the Rio Grande but only Garrett crosses over in Mexico. He has to capture Billy Clanton Horst Frank of The Grand Duel and George ngel Aranda of The Hellbenders. Mind you Billy Clanton is a far cry from Billy the Kid and the real Billy Clanton died in the infamous O.K. Corral showdown in Tombstone. Nevertheless Horst Frank seems perfectly cast as the triggerhappy Billy. Dick Palmer isn't flamboyant enough as the villain Santero. Later Spaghetti western Mexicans would rate diabolical but Palmer is just plain dull here. The only two distinctive things about Bullets Don't Argue is an anonymous Ennio Morricone orchestral score and Carlo Simi's striking art direction. Scenarists Gianni Castellano Pedro de Juan and Giuseppe Moccia keep the clichs intact in this thoroughly traditional law  order western that looks as saddle sore as Rod Cameron. Not only does Cameron have the equivalent of a bad Stetson day with a stupid looking hat but he also winds up in an oater that kills off its primary villain threequarters of the way through it. During his ride through Mexico Garrett struggles to avoid a confrontation with the Rurales the Mexican authorities because he fears that they won't recognize the legality of his actions. When Garrett pays 2000 for food and horses to a Mexican businessman the latter wastes no time informing Santero about the thousands in cash that Garrett has. The Mexicans try to take the money from Garrett and at one point things look pretty bleak for our protagonist when he has to hole up with a rancher to hold off Santero's gunmen. The ending is straight out of an American western. While there is little that is unique about this standardissue oater it never wears out its welcome.";

The role of the characters is well defined and at the end of the story the good will triumph on bad. Many filmsloving people didn't understand why this film hadn't had success in Italy. First of all it was played by unknown actors at least in Italy. Moreover westerns were getting to be on the wane from 1965. But the main reason is that Italians were bored about classic westerns the stagecoach Rio Grande Cimarron saddle the wind etc they preferred action shootings and a bit of violence. So the film a fistful of dollars released a few weeks later was a great success because it started a new era of making westerns as Italians preferred.This was one of the first westerns to have false names of director and actors so as to make it seem like an American film. Probably it was shot without recording the audio even if many actors spoke English. It was released in Italian and in English both dubbed. Rod Cameron dubbed himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the same vein as Natural Born Killers another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act. Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first but shows the bad side by the end of the movie which is far worse than the good side is good. David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for I don't know where places where nudity passes for art. Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it. At any rate Brian and Carrie Duchovny and Michelle Forbes who fits the role flawlessly make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. Brian the writer will write the book Carrie can take the pictures.Being artistic types Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis. Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer sees the ad on a bulletin board and decides to leave the state for a while violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. Two birds with one stone you know.The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash without resorting to clichs or even ending up with caricatures of either type. Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele Brian is fascinated with Early's status as an outlaw as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early's gun. Never having fired a gun before he's as fascinated as a little kid. While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early broke her of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink Early doesn't think women should Early and Brian are out at the local bar. Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. Hit him Bri it's comin'. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie partly because it's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away bloodied and battered but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel we learn so much all at once about the two couples their differences and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. And besides that because Brian benefited from Early's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele.Clearly by now you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a crosscountry trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. While studying the actions of past murderers Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor. Consider for example his roles in movies like Kalifornia 12 Monkeys Fight Club and Ocean's 11 and 12. Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character and is completely believable. Incidentally I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year but just couldn't get the hair and beard right. I even got the hat right which initially I thought would be the hardest part.It's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter. A film that didn't glorify violence at least initially could never be as effective as Kalifornia but the movie structures it perfectly. The glorification is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened but their realization and ours is embodied in the real thing which they encounter with Early and Adele. The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.".

That's why I wanted to see it again and all I can say is that it still hasn't lost its power even though I'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that I was ten years ago.'Kalifornia' tells the tale of the writer Brian Kessler and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin a photographer who want to move to California. But instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains they choose to make a trip by car. He wants to write a book about America's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures. But because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol they decide to take another couple with them so they can spread the costs of the trip. Only one couple has answered the add so they will automatically be the lucky ones. But they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time when their trip has already started Carrie is shocked. Without wanting to be prejudiced she can only conclude that Early Grayce and Adele Corners are poor white trailer park trash. She definitely doesn't want them in her car but Brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway. At first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all but gradually Early Grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer...Not only is the story very impressive so is the acting from our four leads. Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Grayce. His performance in this movie may well be his best ever. The same for Juliette Lewis. She plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her Early and does that really very well. But David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are a surprise as well. They both did a very good job and I really wonder why we never heard anything from Forbes again since this movie because she really proves to have a lot of talent.Overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story but because of the graphic violence I can imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste although I don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way. Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out. I reward this movie with an 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kalifornia is one of my alltime favourite movies and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very stylish surface to it but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the films strongest aspects is its performances Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailertrash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend her innocence is almost heartbreaking. Kalifornia has a very simple plot to it that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes and it all mounts to a powerhouse climax that will haunt you for days. Kalifonia is a film that should really be watched for its intense look at how monstrous a human being can be and not only for its violence and gore.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me. Alas I have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'Kalifornia' upon watching again recently. I am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago.There are two things which really give this movie its power. The first is its cast. We have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Knowing Pitt as we all do as one of the most enduring heartthrobs Hollywood has ever had it is refreshing to see him play such a vile unattractive character. Pitt pulls the show off without resorting to whitetrash clich or parody and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie.Juliette Lewis is equally impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old's life experience. Lewis manages to evoke pity for her character's station in life as well as contempt for her naivety but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young. Personally I think it's a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here.David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is aptly geeky and naive and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and shutoff but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued repulsed and strangely attracted to Pitt.The fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing. At the time 'Kalifornia' was released Hollywood was releasing a slew of nicecharacterturnsouttobepsychotic movies 'Single White Female' 'Pacific Heights' 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' 'Deceived' 'Sleeping With The Enemy' etc. Most of these movies followed the same formula the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy. 'Kalifornia' doesn't really stray too far from this territory but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slowboil thriller and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn.When the penny does drop and Pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie. That said the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold. The fight is over but the scars will always be there.Much of the narration provided by a somewhat whiny pre Xfiles Duchovony is a tad contrived. Of course it's meant to be from the book the Duchovony's journalist character has written so one could argue that the selfconscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.The film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90 of the thrillers of the past twenty years. Highly recommended but not for the weak of stomach or mind. This film is disturbing on more than one level. But then it's meant to be.".

Lewis is the clueless girlfriend willingly abused by Pitt the kneejerk killer. The two have to leave the state and they get a ride in a big old convertible with another couple smart and styling and at first disdainful of this hick pair they are suddenly driving cross country with.This could have been a great movie a classic. Lewis and Pitt are so convincing and so original really playing with humor and without grandiose notions which inflate so many other films. Individually they carve out chilling and yet also warm pictures of who they are real people and unexpected ones. The mannerisms that Lewis pulls out in every scene her dumb looks her surprise this is all virtuosic. What drags them down is the other couple. David Duchovny is especially wooden. You can feel him wanting us to think he's a likable evenkeeled handsome hunk. But he's just plain dull and he is ostensibly the main character. It's his voice that comes in like a bad bad film noir narrator now and then giving some perspective to the events. It's unnecessary monologue to boot and straight out of screen writing 101. For some reason Duchovny's character a struggling writer working on a book about psycho killers is given the most mundane and overused lines. His girlfriend a slightly touch looking photographer played by Michelle Forbes has to work through her part at first but eventually comes into her own with knowing glances and a growing sense of fear.The other true star beyond Pitt and Lewis is the cameraman Bojan Bazelli working with some great sets and with a director who sets him free. In some scenes the arrangement of characters just talking is filled with such space and layer and light or with such audacious rain you want them to hold it longer so you can get it all. For all the ugly things that happen this is a beautiful movie. The director? Dominic Sena a music video shooter. That's probably why it looked so good and had some stumbles in the bigger vision.If you go into this expecting something profound forget about it. But the two performances are worth the admission alone and even though it gets increasingly violent which I'm not into it gets increasingly interesting and gripping as it goes. The set up in the first half hour is groaningly bad at times but once the four of them hit the road look out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got done watching Kalifornia on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it back in July of 2001.  You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films that Kalifornia would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn't.  Perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 19961999 maybe it might have been more successful.  In my opinion Kalifornia is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s.  It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer films like Seven or The Bone Collector.  Many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them.  Kalifornia is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind.  It tries to answer questions like why do they do the things they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past?  Does it make them feel superior or powerful?  Or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill?  These are some of the things that Kalifornia tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an everlasting impression as Early Grayce.  When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual.  When we first see him it's late at night.  Early is possibly drunk.  We then see him pick up a rock throw it off a bridge and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car.  Pitt is fierce in this film.  It is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people.  It's funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in 12 Monkeys and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher's Seven.".

I'm an XFiles fan and I had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie as I'd thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny but found his character a little twodimensional here except where he's doing voiceovers. That part was strong seemed in character good intonation etc. Otherwise I kept thinking Agent Mulder which is a pity.Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why haven't I noticed her before? I'll be looking up to see what other roles she's done and seeing those asap I am slightly concerned about stereotyping re Lewis this film and Natural Born Killers a firm favourite. Interesting though to see a contrast of characters  in NBK she's a willing accomplice whereas here she abhors the violence and tries very hard not to acknowledge Early's dark side until it's thrust in her face.I enjoyed this film almost unreservedly. Apart from Duchovny's character not seeming fullyformed and perhaps being washed out somewhat by Pitt's it was perfect. I was also pleased with the ending  glad that the innocent heroes did not die yet they had to suffer first. It was realistic tense disturbing.If you like NBK you may well like this movie and viceversa.".

Pitt despite the pretty boy image is good at playing that role see Snatch so the two of them are very believable in this film.Those two accompany two naive Liberals on a crosscountry trip and troubles quickly ensue. None of the four people are likable in this movie and the language is extremely rough in spots.

I never found Early and Adele to be interesting characters merely stereotypical members of the underclass this the film cheerfully admits with the characteristic dynamics of serial killer relationships grafted on rather crudely. One imagines that the producers thought they were being ohso ironic and incisive by covering events from a journalistic pretext. They weren't they were just doing what numerous movies have tried to do before or since the most notorious of them to approach from this angle being Natural Born Killers also starring Juliette Lewis. Oh how wonderfully intertextual... sighAs a useful method of creating instantly disturbing films exploring the serial killer subject seems to work well. The film might only leave a good and lasting impression however if the makers have something original to say instead of producing a composite of a hundred other such films and attempting to disguise the plagiarism with the aid of a talented and popular young cast.This film gave notice that Pitt can actually act but it's hardly one of his most polished or subtle performances. Lewis is good but as with most things in this movie many of her mannerisms are ones which we have seen her employ once before in Scorsese's barely better Cape Fear Of the other 'names' in the cast Duchovny is adequate but with nary a note of embellishment in his performance.The balance between the two relationships that the movie explored I also found uneasy. Forbes and Lewis play their scenes together perfectly providing the movie with one of its only plus points. Instead of intelligent dialogue used to dissect the relationship between Brian and Early what we get is them being thrown into a bar room brawl and suddenly appearing to 'bond'. Amateur psychology if ever I saw it...There were more instances like this where the film struggled to convince me it was 'genuine'. This flaw could perhaps be overlooked in a mindless action film the purpose of which was just to entertain but it ultimately becomes Kalifornia's biggest downfall. For if this was just an exercise in entertainment who in the world thought that such a dark treatment could be entertaining? If however as I suspect it was trying to compete with the 'big boys' of the genre it's left glaringly exposed by a lack of true feeling for its subject that transmits itself to the audience. I feel that the filmmaker's genuinely didn't want to provoke reflection or debate they just wanted to pore over the gory details much like Brian Kessler the main character does in the film.".

So they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way. To share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad.

All the leads Duchovny Pitt Lewis and Forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when  this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star. The photography is amazing with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie and the music suits the dark character of the film. On the whole this is a really good movie. Don't miss it.

I think the only reason I rented this movie was because Michelle Forbes was in it and she's usually not too bad.  She wasn't bad in this movie either but her performance couldn't save it.I found this movie to be extremely hideous.  This road trip came before Natural Born Killers otherwise I could try and say that it was riding NBK's coattails and that's why it was so terrible.  To explain I believe that movies which follow close behind other movies at the box office and have the same basic storyline are usually terrible.  But since that's not the case I can't come up with any other reason why this movie was even released in theaters.  It only made just over 2 million and it should have been a straighttovideo release.Juliette Lewis was SO annoying in this movie that I vowed never to see anything with her in it again.  While I have seen a couple of movies she was in since yes I'm a glutton for punishment she certainly isn't the reason why I rent any movie that might have her in the cast.  In her defense she was pretty good in The Other Sister but that role seems to be tailor made for her quirky style anyways.  But I digress...  In any event I'm sure that if I had to hear her say Earrrrlllyyy once more in this movie or listen to that annoying laugh I would have found the nearest bridge and dove off it.I have already mentioned that Michelle Forbes was pretty good in this movie and David Duchovny was not bad either.  But those two couldn't carry this film if they tried and I'm glad they didn't try too hard.  Brad Pitt can be excellent when he wants to ie. Se7en but he was simply awful in this waste. Don't bother unless you are a huge fan of David Duchovny or Michelle Forbes.  My Rating  210".

	schema:reviewBody "Dominic Sena's feature debut was this film Kalifornia from 1993. It tells the story of two couples which are very different together. David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a studying couple which decides to get out of their university for a while and start to build their common project to write a book about serial killers and thus try to study the minds of those killers and their motivations. He would do the writing and she would take important photographs. Their plan is to visit the most famous murder scenes in America and to end their trip to KCalifornia her long lasting dream place and take pictures make interviews etc. Only problem is that driving so much would cost too much money for them so they have to get some financial help by taking another couple going to KCalifornia Pitt and Lewis with them and thus share the costs. Soon something more than surprising and threatening is about to reveal about the identities of this mysterious PittLewis couple...No more about the plot. The film is about the psyche of serial killer a person who is capable of killing another man without feeling any guilt or pain. The film tries to find some answers for that important question what differs us from those serial killers and how someone is able to do such a horrible acts of violence. minor spoiler ahead The film ends in the Duchovny's character's conclusion that deep inside there is no huge difference between normal people's abilities to kill and serial killers' abilities to do that. no spoilers A human being is a beast deep inside we have instincts and things we don't like to talk about it's only about what side of our nature is primary and what side is kept somewhere hiding and unactive. The film ends as the main protagonist is about to finish his job and has found some very dark sides of his own soul too. The traumatic childhood is again one key reason for the birth of these disturbed minds and the film tells once again the importance of safe and peaceful childhood. The main theme of Kalifornia is the psyche of human being and many aspects of it. Whether we want it or not admit it or not what the film says about our many sides of nature are totally true and the main character learns that in the most violent and nightmarish way.Technically this film is brilliant! Kalifornia is shot by Bojan Bazelli a guy who has made many Ferrara films look as fantastic as they look and the beginning of Kalifornia is almost as fantastic as the rain scene in King of New York one of Abel Ferrara's most important films which are plenty!. The beginning of Kalifornia is very intense and gorgeous looking and proves that this film is something very special. The photography is throughout the film very professional and also the editing is as great as possible. Fantastic camera work once again Bojan! The actors do wonderful jobs too and there are only couple of flaws I found in this film and these flaws make me give the film not as high rating as I wanted.First of all I think that the characters are too shallow in some cases. For example I don't think Duchovny's and Forbes' relationship is presented too warmly even though they are meant to be in love and care about each other. There should've been more depth and love visible in their relationship. The one reviewer here Mr. Rogers said that the characters are very well built in this film but somehow I think they are occasionally too shallow and have no depth and interest they should have. But at least the piano escape ! scene at the end shows that there is caring between these two lovers..But still there should've been more between them and also between other characters in the film. The other thing about the characters is that occasionally they act very stupidly and like cliches that need not to be explained. The characters in Kalifornia are not as multi leveled and well built as they should have been. The other minor flaw in Kalifornia is that it runs slightly too long and there are scenes that are not too necessary and give nothing important to the film. But once the end scene comes and we learn what kind of a conclusion Duchovny comes the film is very rewarding and gives interesting philosophic thoughts and I think a film this difficult to understand and for mainstream audiences to like would not come out too easily from Hollywood these days and that is very sad. All Hollywood seems to be able to do nowadays is stupid entertainment for pop corn loving people. But fortunately there are many exceptions too.Usually these kind of films are not liked because of the content violence and sex for instance. But gladly I can say that even though the violence is pretty disturbing and the film had to be cut in order to get R rating the violence is never too excessive or gratuitously brutal and the scenes of violence are shown with taste and style. The one love making scene was of course too much for MPAA but nobody should be repelled for one sex scene in my opinion. What I'm trying to say is that even though the subject matter is serial killers the imagery is not too rough and the film proves that director Sena has a sense of style and never wants just to shock the audience with blood and splatter and thus try to make the film noticeable.Kalifornia is very interesting and also rewarding film and without those mentioned and pretty minor flaws this would've get even higher rating from me. After all this is one of the most interesting Hollywood movies of the 90's. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "While it had some flaws mostly in some incomplete development of themes and failing to make full use of the story's potential this is a brilliantly funny satire that mostly succeeds wonderfully on many levels.The idea to have the US pick on Canada internationally one of the world's least offensive and bellicose countries is itself brilliant. It wonderfully picks on the US and more generally on any rather belligerent nation that likes to throw its weight around and create excuses for doing so.It also picks on the use of propaganda and even on mass media and mass mob hysteria. This is especially true in the way the film portrays how the American media discusses Canada and how some members of the public react so that the whole idea spins out of control of those who began it for their own personal reasons. I was barely able to breath with laughter throughout the whole period when the US was flashing its propaganda about Canada and showing how threatening they are especially how they claimed the Canadians were infiltrating American society and were massing on the border. This is wonderful satire on sensationalist news stations and their willingness to use information in a wildly inaccurate and misleading manner in order to rile people up.The film picks on everyone involved Canadian and American alike. It attacks the stereotypes of both highlighting their differences yet also attacking the misconceptions about both peoples. To have a number of Canadians in the film is another flash of inspiration too since there are Canadians playing comically stereotypical i.e. polite white bread wellspoken Canadians and Canadians playing comically stereotypical i.e. redneck belligerent crude Americans. It adds to the irony since one of the American's propaganda tools is that there are Canadian actors everywhere in the US as such integral parts of the American entertainment industry that they are taken for Americans and lo and behold here some are playing various people in this film.Some parts of the film were simply silly with jokes that were more gags rather than actually furthering the satire and points of the movie and this is a weak spot. While some were funny and worked others were a bit inane and the film would have been more successful had they stuck to developing the real themes and satire of the film which are what make it great.Anyway despite some weak points this film is a brilliant satire that contains a number of parts that are utterly hilarious. It did not fulfill its full potential but it is not too far below perfect and the good parts are really really good.".

Funniest parts Jim Belushi announcing that Canada has massed 90 of its population along the border in obvious preparation for an attack. Boomer and Honey and everyone insulting Canadian beer at a hockey game and causing a riot. Stephen Wright as an RCMP officer in parade dress getting punched and stating That was totally unnecessary. argument about Toronto or Ottawa being the capital of Canada the deployment of Omega Force in spite of Rip Torn's mentioning of its strict prohibition against Caucasians according to the Helms Amendment the Summit Thingy between Alan Alda and the Russians and their obsession with MTV and what's that other one?

The film is filled with funny little political hints and satire of the typical Moore fashion that helped make his last film Bowling For Columbine the best selling documentary of all time. This movie is not a documentary but rather a witty story that brings forth the same concept of a president creating a fake conflict to boost poll ratings that Wagging The Dog was to later use more seriously.Some of the comments made in this film show eerie foreshadowing to what has happened in the world since it was produced.No matter what your motivation for watching this film you can expect to get the same formula of political commentary delivered with wit and humour that you get in all of Michael Moore's Films TV Shows and novels.".

I loved some of the jokes in this movie though at times some of them weren't funny and also were slow and scenes like the campfire the hockey game and the part where a cop pulls them over in Canadain which Dan Akyroyd did a cameo he also was in a film back in '88 with John Candy called 'The Great Outdoors'.

	schema:reviewBody "This is perhaps the funniest political satire ever and one of the most underrated movies.  Some will watch it expecting to bust a gut and there are plenty of sight gags to keep you laughing but the political elements are the funniest parts.  This is one of those smart comedies because most of the jokes are not going to go out and smack you in the face.  The plot has been duplicated and called original cough...South Park cough because the idea IS so unique.This film has a storied history itself.  Michael Moore wanted to make this movie solely a satire and the studio wanted it to be a straight comedy. This film had Eddie Murphy Roseanne and Tom Arnold and other names in the early '90's attached to it early but all of the stars had to do other films while two studios fought over the rights to the script and film.  All together it took Moore about 5 years from original concept to finished product and by the time it was nearly completed John Candy had died and reshoots were changed or cancelled.  The film of course bombed because neither studio really tried to promote the film Moore refused to promote it Candy couldn't promote it and so the film pretty much went directly to video.It's still a great flick.  Alan Alda's performance is great and Kevin Pollack does a remarkable job.  It's not a typical Candy performance but he still has fun with it.  Yes there are a couple plot holes but almost every single joke works if you understand where Moore is coming from.  This is not an antiCanadian movie because most of the cast is from Canada and they obviously did this film to spoof American views of Canadians American politics and because the film was totally different.This is an original movie with enough laughs and humor to hold it's own and I wish it wasn't blatantly ripped off by two stoners for their unfunny little cartoon movie.".

During his long career he has raised tons of controversy with his documentaries especially during this decade with the likes of the widely seen films Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 911. A few years after making his debut Moore made this fictional piece which is his only nondocumentary film to date. Canadian Bacon is a comedy film one which unfortunately didn't turn out so well.The U.S. President is currently doing very poorly in the opinion polls with the country's economy dropping very low. To raise his popularity the President is convinced that he must start a war something which he has never done before during his time in the White House. So he decides to conduct a cold war against Canada. He uses the media to lie and do everything else he can to make Canada look bad and manipulate the American public into believing that their northern neighbours are their enemies. Bud B. Boomer the Sheriff of Niagara Falls crosses the border with Deputy Honey Kabral Jabar and Roy Boy where they all intend to attack! As you would expect from Michael Moore this movie is very political and if you're familiar with his political views it shouldn't surprise you that this movie bashes the White House and the American military whether you like it or not. Neither Americans nor Canadians are portrayed in a positive manor in the film as neither are portrayed as very bright. Some Canadians have been offended by this movie due to all the stereotypes but personally I'm not. In fact I think one of the only remotely funny parts is the one where Sheriff Bud B. Boomer causes a riot at a hockey game in Canada when he says that Canadian beer sucks. I think the part where the RCMP Officer says I don't know what you're talking aboot eh? gave be a bit of a snicker as well. However most of the jokes whether they're jabs at Canadians OR Americans are simply not funny.Comedian John Candy a Canadian starred in Canadian Bacon as Bud Boomer. The movie was released after his tragic death in 1994 from a heart attack and his role in it was the last role he ever completed he died during the filming of Wagons East. I was only about 7 12 years old when he died and had never heard of him during his life. However I have since discovered how great a comedian he was by watching SCTV a classic sketch comedy show as well as the hilarious slapstick comedy Planes Trains  Automobiles. Canadian Bacon however is not a highlight of Candy's career though he might add something to the film. R.I.P.A comedy movie about a war between America and Canada sounds like a good idea but Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a MUCH MUCH better job with it when they made South Park Bigger Longer  Uncut! In Canadian Bacon the jokes are mostly mediocre and the movie may start out SLIGHTLY promising but just drags for most of its approximate ninetyminute run. It appears that many have enjoyed this movie much more than I have so I won't say avoid it like the plague but I wouldn't expect a classic piece of political satire and if you have high expectations don't be surprised if they are not met.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who could expect much in the way of comedy from Michael Moore who seemed a oneshot success with a documentary that oozed irony but was criticized for editorial chicanery?But this one pretty much works. It falls somewhere between the zaniness of Airplane and the black comedy of Doctor Strangelove. It's far funnier than other let'sgotowarforpoliticalreason movies like The Mouse That Roared or Wag the Dog even though it doesn't seem to have had much of a budget. Yes it's silly but what makes the jokes effective is that they follow a scenario that has become so familiar to us in real life. An adversary or nonadversary like Canada skewered here as much as the US is masses troops along its border. The media report Canadians are building a monstrous weapons system that they are filtering across the border in untold numbers and are walking among us that they plan to impose their way of life on us enforcing antilitter laws and pronouncing about as aboot.. They take a hostage. They put up the world's tallest freestanding structure as an inyourface insult. We try to provoke some incident that we can claim as an attack in order to build up tension. The idea is not to go to war because a war with Canada wouldn't last long enough. The idea is to return to the days of the cold war when we had a booming defense industry lots of solidarity a common enemy lived in constant fear of annihilation and everyone was happy. Moore must have carefully combed the archives for every runup to every war since Grenada. I don't want to get into it in any more detail because it would spoil the gags but I'll mention just one. John Candy and his gang there are lots of Canadians in the cast are driving near Toronto which they believe is the capital in a garbage truck decorated with sprayedon slogans like Canada Sucks and Eat my Drawers and USA All the Way. They are pulled over by a motorcycle cop Dan Aykroyd who politely asks Candy to step out of the vehicle leads him to the side of the truck points at the graffiti and asks What's wrong with this picture? Candy begins to stutter and blame the kids back in the garage but Aykroyd cuts off his explanation and says he's not concerned about who put it there but he IS concerned about Les Quebecoise. Every sign in Canada must be printed both in English and in French and he makes Candy spray a French version of the slogans on the truck. Oh well one more  just because it's short and offhand. The president and his advisors wonder how to get back the hostage the Canadians are holding. One aide suggests bringing in the Omega force. Everyone is awed by the suggestion. Even the rabid general asks Isn't that a little drastic? And another adviser adds Sir the Helmsley Law Part Two Sub B specifically forbids the use of the Omega force against Caucasians. Something like that.The acting is good especially Allan Alda as the nudnik president but little acting is required. As a director Moore gets the job done but doesn't add much. What made Doctor Strangelove exceptional was the realism between the comic moments the battle scenes for instance. Here Moore has the Omega force not just running across a field but high stepping which isn't really as funny as it is silly. The last man in line trips over a stone and sprains his ankle hollers out Save yourselves and another one runs back and shoots him on the spot. Moore as a writer turns out to be a more astute humorist than I'd expected him to be. One Canadian prisoner in a psycho biker's getup is serving his term for trying to use regular gas instead of unleaded. It has its funny moments.".

Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen  and by the time the heartstopping chariot race was over my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. Despite its 212 minutes running time this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain as we follow Judah BenHur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.It's hard to imagine anything more cinematic especially at the time if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory it's Ben Hur. And even now after I've seen the film many many times I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching and I don't mean that in a religious sense.My verdict this film was and is nothing like the many sandal and sword or bible films of that era it is at least to me the ultimate film epic.

But he has faith and keeps on going. The ultimate battle to beat all battles to settle the score...is at the Chariot race and that is a sight to behold.Films like BenHur will NEVER get greenlighted today and if it did too much CGI and not enough of what Director Wyler and old Hollywood was good at. The actors well they are to die for. Excellent acting. And let me share with you my favorite part...teehee when Pilate holds up his hankerchief to start the chariot race plays with the racers and audience  he's very smug ya know..then the WAY he finally drops it. Who couldn't tell how he'd eventually turn out hmmmmmmm? There is nothing more I can add that others have said. This film is near and dear to me and for my vote  is one of the top five films of all time. I never tire of watching this film I find something new in it every time its done that well.This is an epic remake something else that Hollywood has trouble doing  to remake a film on this scale that finds new audiences year after year after year.

	schema:reviewBody "In the ears and minds of any movie lover the word BenHur resonates like the quintessential Hollywood classic oozing respectability in every inch of celluloid but the same respect we owe to an old relic. In our cynical modern world who would enjoy a pompouslooking bigbudget swordsandsandals religious epic when you have Tarantino and Appatow?I saw BenHur for the first time in fourth grade it was part of our history course and being an Asterix buff I loved watching reallife legionaries galley slavery not to mention the chariot race the film also enlightened me on Christianity and on Judaism when my only religious reference was monotheism number three and scared the hell out of me with leper. It worked on a cinematic level as much as educational I guess even in its TVsized crappy 80's VHS look we kids enjoyed BenHur especially the rivalry between Judah Charlton Heston and Messala Stephen Boyd.I never watched BenHur after that but nor did I have any doubt over its status as a colossal masterpiece. Watching it again a few years ago and then a few days ago I was surprised by how engraved in my memory BenHur was and how the moments that stood out were still having the same effect. When BenHur and Messala meet after many years I'm always anticipating that first breech in the fortress of their friendship when the young Roman tribune will have one word too many about BenHur's people taking for granted their friendship and Judah's nobility as marks of submission. The second encounter is even more thrilling because it's like watching a shaking edifice waiting to collapse.It was a nice call from the director Wyler to mark the feud between the two exfriends at the second encounter hence putting more gravitas around their relationship that screenwriter Gore Vidal tried to impregnate with homoerotic subtext. The story is known by movie buffs Vidal wanted to make the interactions look as the two rivals were former lovers the subtext works even more when you look at Stephen Boyd's enamored eyes toward Charlton Heston. But 'Chuck' never knew the trick and was annoyed about it I guess I prefer the way their hatred epitomize the conflict between Romans and Jews sealing as one of the most memorable rivalries in history of cinema with the most heartpounding climactic facetoface or should I say wheeltowheel.I had positive feelings about Gladiator but BenHur is the masterpiece that dwarfs any contemporary masterpiece a sweeping revenge story that doesn't rely at all on fake CGI and special effects. It took William Wyler's expertise built up in three decades of experience to make BenHur equal the reference of the time that was Cecil B. De Mille's 1925 version. As a matter of fact BenHur has been blockbuster material from the start ever since Lewis Wallace's bestseller of the late century it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story with galley combats a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told with a hero going from idealism to anger from revenge to love all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion BenHur was an instant classic Hollywood couldn't ignore.If 1925 had the race and the thrills the 1959 one had a bigger scope bigger budget the colors the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50's audience that TV wasn't yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies like BenHur Spartacus Guns of Navarone or Taras Boulba you would think he went there inside the screen. And right now I can't imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element but as a real race and it never never suspends your disbelief it's like at any new viewing Messalah can finally win.There are so many classic moments that filled the threehourandhalf journey that you're never in a state of nonanticipation when the new inquisitor's parade starts you keep an eye on that loose roof tile the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert you wait for the 'greatest cameo ever made' in the galleys the big fight and BenHur rescuing Arrius Jack Hawkins and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race the film gets a tad too long but only because you can't just sweep off such a rich epic with a fiveminute resolution and Charlton Heston in his greatest role contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film I don't think he gets the credit he deserved he brings to his Judah BenHur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.Other cast members include Oscarwinning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah's mentor Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as Judah's mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast editing directing having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins only to be matched in 1997 with Titanic and The Return of the King and oddly enough these titles could somewhat apply to BenHur. I haven't seen the 'original' and I'm in no hurry for the remake but I don't get I'll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn't see it many times in my life but it's always present in my memories as if it wasn't about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let's not forget the name of the director William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece which is saying a lot given his previous streaks.BenHur A Christ Tale a tale of vengeance in fact a tale of all tales...".

As a matter of fact BenHur has been blockbuster material from the start ever since Lewis Wallace's bestseller of the late century it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story with galley combats a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told with a hero going from idealism to anger from revenge to love all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion BenHur was an instant classic Hollywood couldn't ignore.If 1925 had the race and the thrills the 1959 one had a bigger scope bigger budget the colors the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50's audience that TV wasn't yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies like BenHur Spartacus Guns of Navarone or Taras Boulba you would think he went there inside the screen. And right now I can't imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element but as a real race and it never never suspends your disbelief it's like at any new viewing Messalah can finally win.There are so many classic moments that filled the threehourandhalf journey that you're never in a state of nonanticipation when the new inquisitor's parade starts you keep an eye on that loose roof tile the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert you wait for the 'greatest cameo ever made' in the galleys the big fight and BenHur rescuing Arrius Jack Hawkins and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race the film gets a tad too long but only because you can't just sweep off such a rich epic with a fiveminute resolution and Charlton Heston in his greatest role contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film I don't think he gets the credit he deserved he brings to his Judah BenHur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.Other cast members include Oscarwinning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah's mentor Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as Judah's mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast editing directing having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins only to be matched in 1997 with Titanic and The Return of the King and oddly enough these titles could somewhat apply to BenHur. I haven't seen the 'original' and I'm in no hurry for the remake but I don't get I'll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn't see it many times in my life but it's always present in my memories as if it wasn't about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let's not forget the name of the director William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece which is saying a lot given his previous streaks.BenHur A Christ Tale a tale of vengeance in fact a tale of all tales...";

I mention this because through every film I have seen I still come back to a film from 1959 as the greatest achievement in cinematic history. I have seen great films like Return of the King Saving Private Ryan Braveheart and many more. While the modern films are wonderful and have a fantastic richness to them they still are a small notch below BenHur. Today's films use a lot of computer effects for their battles scenes their backgrounds and even computer images for the stunts of their actors. Yet BenHur did it all without computers. I am still fascinated by the chariot race. Never in film history has anything matched the depth and excitement of the chariot race. Remember folks this is 1959 nothing is computer generated. Some may say the naval battle scenes look a bit cheesy but again it was 1959 and the scenes still work today. What can you say about the acting? Every single actor is wonderful. Heston is in top form as BenHur. Steven Boyd is incredible playing the merciless Messala. Jack Hawkins Haya Harareet Martha Scottall fantastic in their roles. Each performing the role of a life time. The actors are fantastic but William Wyler brings more out of each actor than any director ever could in this day and age. Wyler had no computer animation to rely on he had no high tech special effects crew he had no computer program to fill in extras. Wyler had to find thousands of extras for many scenes and maintain control. Did you ever see Steven Boyd better? Probably not. Did you ever see any of the actors except Heston who is an acting marvel better in any other role? Wyler just pulled the greatest performance out of each actor. The story fantastic from beginning to end. While the film is over 3 hours long you do not feel that it is that long. Every scene is lovingly crafted the reunion between Messala and Judah the trek to the gallows the rowing scene the naval battle the chariot race the Messala death scene the reunion with Judah and his family etc. After seeing thousands and thousands of movies I always come back to BenHur. This is the mark of fantastic movie making. Today's film makers could learn a lot by watching this film and learning about acting directing and screen writing.".

Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race for instance perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects. This can be a very sad film as well.

The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heartwrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film. They can just tear you apart. The combination of drama action and romance along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack once again one of the best ever put on film. The more one hears this music the more was is moved by it. To fully appreciate the cinematography in this film I recommend you purchase the recentlyreleased 4disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story the silent movie BenHur A Tale Of The Christ. That was name of the book by the way the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films. However there is a reverence for Jesus Christ in this film which should be there since it's a key element of the storyline even though most folks forget that.In summary this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an epic movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen BenHur I also like the 1925 version very much I don't know how many times now. I think I have stopped counting seven years ago. I never tire to see this movie and needless to say I know all the scenes and dialogue by heart. This picture has everything in it. Almost all human sentiments are represented in the story joy sorrow despair pride jealousy hope revenge anger forgiveness compassion redemption love hate friendship humour etc etc. During the three and a half hours it takes for the story to unfold we see passing by our very eyes just about every example of what constitutes the human condition. What I find even more remarkable in this movie is the fact that Christ is present throughout the entire story but we don't really see him in the flesh at the exception of a few scenes where the Lord is in fact in the background and yet his spirit and message is ever present through the words and actions of the various characters. It's not for nothing that the complete title of this great story is BenHur a Tale of the Christ. The movie is wellacted especially Heston Griffith Hawkins and let's not forget the wonderful Finley Currie playing Balthazar the dialogue is always concise yet never short of meaning and substance the way dialogues in movies should be the decor and settings are just magnificent and the Miklos Rozsa score is simply superb. Besides Quo Vadis the 1951 version which incidentally I have recommended to those who have also enjoyed BenHur I cannot think of a better movie about the early days of Christianity than this one. There are others of course The Robe just to name one but none has the grandeur and the spectacular dimension of BenHur. It's the movie I would want to watch one last time on my death bed. I gladly and proudly give BenHur a score of 10 out of 10!".

The costumes were also incredible. The actors portrayed the best purest form of both ancient Roman and old Judean culture. This film also had quite an emotional effect. The way that Christ's face is never visible nor his voice audible to the audience creates a feeling of reverence to the actual person of Jesus. Lew Wallace also did an amazing job portraying the innocence kindness and mercy of Jesus and his effect on the main character Judah Ben Hur. Hur's ending quote I felt him take the sword out of my hand was a wonderful picture of his changing. I admit I am a Christian but even for those who are not this is still a great film. The message boards confirm that. I recognize that there are some people that require constant action to keep their attention. If this is your case than this movie is not for you as it has a lot of dialogue. But I recommend this movie 100.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to deny that William Wyler's lavish version of BenHur is sometimes a bit overdone but it nevertheless remains an entertaining and worthwhile classic. The material does justify the bigbudget approach since the story contains several interesting themes as well as plenty of action sequences. While some parts could have been streamlined with little loss in order to make the movie as a whole flow more smoothly in general the film as it is keeps a good balance between action and substance. There are some very good dramatic moments in addition to the action highlights.Charlton Heston is wellcast as BenHur a role that plays right to his strengths. The strained relations between BenHur and Messala provide one set of themes for the story as well as driving much of the action. Heston handles his end of it pretty well although Stephen Boyd could have been a little less static in his portrayal of Messala. Jack Hawkins works very well as Quintus Arrius and his scenes with Heston are used well in establishing some of the inner workings of Heston's character. Hugh Griffith also has a couple of good scenes as Sheik Ilderim.The chariot race and other action sequences usually get most of the attention but there are also some worthwhile ideas in the story which are really the focus of the original novel that are developed well enough. There is also a very good silent movie version of BenHur from 1925 which at times takes a different approach from this version and which is well worth seeing in itself for those who like the story.".

The story is based on a novel by Lew Wallace which I have read and I have at home and is so famous that it doesn't allow spoils the injustice committed against Judah BenHur and his path of revenge deeply linked to the life and death of Jesus a latent and ever palpable subplot even when it does not arise. Epic in every detail the film features scenarios and costumes carefully crafted in the style of Imperial Rome. Some sequences are truly anthological as is the case with the chariot race. The representation of the Roman legionaries influenced for decades the conception that we have individually on how they were and fought. The visual and special effects used in the film were the best there was at the time and even today more than half a century later they're able to surprise by the realism. The color is vivid and intense cinematography is truly imposing and accentuates the epic ambiance. As for the cast's work it's definitely the movie of Charlton Heston's life. He not only became famous with it but made here the most remarkable character of his career. Steven Boyd Jack Hawkins Haya Harareet Martha Scott and Hugh Griffith also shone. It's a long movie but the audience gets so caught up in it that they don't even feel the time go by. Wonderful!".

	schema:reviewBody "A perennial Xmas favourite on TV during my childhood spectacular biblical epic BenHur opens with the birth of Jesus manger star wise men shepherds... the whole nine yards. Those TV programmers knew what they were doing.The film then scoots to XXVI A.D.Jesus is now a grown man doing God's work meanwhile Jewish prince Judah BenHur played by distinctly nonJewish blueeyed hunk Charlton Heston is reunited with his Roman childhood friend Messala Stephen Boyd who has just been appointed tribune of Judea.

	schema:reviewBody "Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 1959 including Best Picture Best Director Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. 'BenHur' remains one of the most inspirational epic action spectacles ever made by a major Hollywood studio. It was a landmark achievement in grand peplumbiblical genre storytelling. Directed by William Wyler the film tells the story of a kind wealthy Jew Judah BenHur Charlton Heston whose life is thrown upside down when he is betrayed and falsely accused of crimes against the Roman Empire by his childhood friend turn tribune Messala Stephen Boyd. Spending three years as a galley slave Judah must find a way to restore himself to high standing and while also seeking revenge on his enemies. Without spoiling the movie too much while everybody thinks that this movie was the original it was in fact the third movie follow after 1907  1925 of the same name to be made from Lew Wallace's successful novel 1880's 'BenHur A Tale of The Christ'. It can be argued that a talking picture made from the same story as an earlier silent film is not a true remake since the storytelling techniques each employ are so radically different but that's up to debate but at least it's more original than the later films that came after it like the 2003's animation version  the 2016 remake. Anyways like the book the movie also has a substory running in parallel with Judah's main event narrative which was the unfolding story of Jesus. While Jesus does play a more important role in this story more than other films his cameo presence is still somewhat tangential. It's jarring to see a violent revenge plot mixed his story about love thy neighbor. Thank God the film cut the sequences of BenHur faking his death and raising a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans as it felt that Christ's message of forgiveness could be lost. Still 'BenHur' is the only Hollywood film to make the Vatican approved film list in the category of religion despite having scenes of him killing an innocent guard. However the film does have other problems than the mixed messages it was presenting. The book and the films have always been accuse of being too similar to the book 'The Count of Monte Cristo by author Alexandre Dumas to the point that some critics have stated out that the film is 'The Count of Monte Cristo meets Quo Vadis'. While me personal I don't see much of anything comparable some critics says the film is ripping off that premise way too much. Regardless I did like the changes by the many screenwriters did to couther being too similar to the novel like having Messala's vindictiveness be motivated by a sexual and romantic rejection as much as a political one. I'm one of the few people that kinda like the somewhat hidden homoerotic overtones between Judah and Messala. I also love how Heston didn't know about this adding an interesting uncomfortable dynamic to the tense dialogue scenes between the two actors. It adds some spice and realism that was really needed for this period film. I also like how the film add symbolism to the ocean scenes and also cut other things like the character of Ira from the novel. I always felt that the scenes with her was timewasting. On top of that the other changes like having Judah's sister being the one who dislodge the roof tile  how they treat Messala after the climatic chariot race were equally as important. However the movie still have pacing issues. 212 minutes running time is way too long. While I get why the soulstirring scenes of Christ's birth and crucifixion was needed as it provide biblical bookends for MGM's actionpacked epic. I think the outdated theatrical overture  intermission sequence should had been delete in future releases. If anything scenes like Judah declines the race at times even after he learns that Messala will also compete could had been delete as well as the famous chariot race sequence did happen later on the film regardless of Judah wanting to do it or not. It felt like filler. Despite that the climactic chariot race which includes collisions men dragged under chariots bloody injuries and intensely suspenseful competition was so impressive in the stunt work  make up that it set new standards for actionfilmmaking without modern cinematic razzledazzle. It was very surprising to hear that nobody got kill or seriously hurt. The colorful 1959 version was the most expensive film ever made up to its time and the most expensive film of the 50s decade. Shot on the grand scale of 15 million the film took six years to prepare and over a half year in production it was a tremendous makeorbreak risk for MGM Studios. Luckily for them the project ultimately saved the studio from bankruptcy as it became a box office hit earning three times more than it took to make. Does it hold up? Yes while it's slow at times and some of the acting feels now mannered stiff and awkward like Hugh Griffith in blackface. It still worth the praise and achievements it got when it first released. It still has great acting from all the cast including more physically than emotionally compelling Heston amazing color widescreen cinematography from Robert Surtees beautiful music from composter Mikls Rzsa  wonderful costumes from Elizabeth Haffenden and her crew. However this movie might be too intense to be rated G even at the time. After all this movie has a leper colony where two principles characters are shown with open rotting sores and a few men drowning in the ocean battle. If anything it could be rated PG or PG13 now. Regardless of that I have say BenHur is one of the ultimate epics movies of all time. A legendary movie that needs to be rewatch time after time again. Highly recommended.".

Wallace was a moderately religious man and attempted to debate Ingersoll. The story has it that Ingersoll whipped him to a frazzle and Wallace knew it. But he resolved to study the Bible and learn about his faith so that he would be better prepared.He never got to debate Ingersoll again but Wallace got so immersed in religion that he decided to put that knowledge to use. While he was Territorial Governor of New Mexico and while he wasn't dealing with the Lincoln County War and the hunting down of Billy the Kid he spent his spare time creating what became the widest selling work of fiction in his century BenHur A Tale of the Christ.He did his research well. Judah BenHur and his mother and sister are descended from a very ancient family of Hebrew nobility. The founder of this house was Hur who in the Bible was the husband of Miriam who was Moses's sister. Hur pops up as a peripheral character during the whole story of the Exodus. He invested the characters that Charlton Heston Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell play with a heroic lineage which makes their fall all the more tragic.So on the consciousness of the public were the Hur family that one often thinks of them as real people. Case in point many years ago a teacher of mine wanted to demonstrate how many true characters Charlton Heston played on the screen. I count 15 in his list of credits on IMDb some he's played in more than one film or television show. Inevitably more than just one person named BenHur as a real character. A tribute to the timelessness of the character and to Charlton Heston's abilities as actor.The story is that Heston and his family greet an old friend newly arrived back in Judea province Messala who is now a tribune. Messala played by Stephen Boyd is one ambitious fellow and he wants Heston to rat out potential leaders of rebellion in this most unruly of Roman provinces. Heston refuses.The next day Boyd frames an incident where a piece of old tile accidentally falls from the Hur family home while the new Judean governor is passing by into an assassination attempt. Scott and O'Donnell are thrown in prison and Heston is sentenced to the galleys. The story is then BenHur's adventures in trying to get back to Judea and set things right.BenHur meets a whole host of people who aid him in his endeavor. Jack Hawkins as a commander of the galley fleet he's serving on Finlay Currie as Balthazar one of the Three Wise Men now seeking the child whose birth he witnessed in the year Anno Domini Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim whose horses BenHur races.It's not often mentioned but among the Oscars collected for this most honored film besides the ones that the film itself Wyler and Heston won was Hugh Griffith's for Best Supporting Actor. His Arab sheik is a blustering but very wise and compassionate fellow. The events of this film are taking place some six centuries before the Prophet Mohammed arrived on the scene. The Arab people at that time were involved in a hedonistic animist kind of religion but it's left up in the air that they might turn Christian. Certainly some of them did and some are Christian to this day as the country of Lebanon attests.Griffith had the wildest pair of eyes in film history next to Jack Elam's and he used them to great effect. Watch his expressions during the film they're what got him the Oscar.Stephen Boyd also got rave notices for the evil Messala. When he's not stepping on people to move up in Roman politics Messala likes to race chariots. During his odyssey BenHur becomes a charioteer and the climax of the film is the thrilling chariot race that turns into a race for survival. You'll see in the film Messala doesn't exactly play by Marquis of Queensbury rules for charioteers. Boyd did some leads after BenHur but never really took as a hero. But he was one grand villain.While BenHur is a prisoner being led to the galleys the Roman prison convoy stops in a town called Nazareth and a carpenter faces down a Roman guard to give the thirsting BenHur a drink of water. The two men go their separate ways BenHur's is described in the book by Lew Wallace the carpenter's way in the first four books of the New Testament. Later on after BenHur discovers his mother and sister and what's become of them they hear about Jesus of Nazareth a rabbi with a message of hope and reputation for miracles. Of course when they seek Jesus it's when He's just been tried and condemned and on the way to the cross. It's now BenHur's turn to offer the carpenter a drink of water on the way to show his trust and faith. And as the sky darkens and Jesus breathes his last the film depicts what the New Testament describes as the blackest day in Earth's history. But even at that point Heston's new found faith is rewarded a miracle at the point of death. What was the miracle for that you buy the DVD or wait until BenHur is on television.BenHur should really be seen in a theater even a letter box version doesn't do justice to the chariot race or the sea battle with pirates.BenHur is the story of two paths one of vengeance and one of faith. Our protagonist tries his way and in the end realizes the path of faith is the more rewarding.".

Finally we are entertained by a dance flick where the leads Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum are both beautiful to watch have good chemistry enough to sustain the kilig factor and can really deliver the moves.Dewan is a superb dancer she has a fabulously fit body not the anorexic ballerina type and she dons her outfits exceptionally well for someone who's only 5'3. It was also amazing to watch such a tall gorgeous man like Tatum move the way he does it must help that the boy knows his Kung Fu!. His deadpan facial expression makes his line deliveries unexpectedly funny. The supporting cast also amply sustains the rest of the story.

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan did a great job. their dancing along with everyone else's was phenomenal. when i left the movie i was actually inspired to be a dancer even though i never will be. the main reason people are turning down this movie is because of the acting. sure the acting could have been better but this movie was focusing on the DANCING. obviously you have to be a good actor to be in a movie but the dancing was the main focus of this film. and i personally think the dancing was great. i couldn't ask for it to be better. this movie is definitely worth seeing whether you're into hiphop or not.".

The heartwarming romantic story shows a perfect chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan supported by a magnificent cast and awesome songs and choreographies of dance. There are also drama and tragedy funny moments and I recalled Alan Parker's Fame and Center Stage with the students following their dreams in an art school.

Step Up would not have been as good as it was without him. He made even some of the more awkward lines of the script sound original and I really enjoyed watching him bust a move. Several parts were genuinely amusing and heartwarming despite the wellworn story of a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks who falls in love with the uptight rich dancer.

Given the lame script top choreographer Anne Fletcher's first crack at directing didn't come off too badly partly because of the wise use of very short scenes.

The stimulating fusion of hip hop and ballet is well synchronized with fusion in the music.

The acting was fine but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard. This is a class B film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps.

THERE WERE ONLY 3 DANCE SEQUENCES IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE AND 2 OF THEM WERE TAKEN STRAIGHT FROM THE COMMERCIAL. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer but maybe thats what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT by any means a bboy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style technique or any wow factor all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. All of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls but nothing more. the grande finale left me thinking ... OK now they're gonna get serious all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen.i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Served with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect. Save the Last Dance was garbage and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years although i was impressed with Moulin Rouge... look to Center Stage for Ballet look to Beat Street for HipHop".

I'm a professional dancer of 20 years who can never pass up a dance movie however this one didn't deliver the goods. I was disappointed in the lack of a story that held no depth you can chew on. The story follows a similar theme Boy is a great b boy dancer who happens to be poor. Girl goes to prestigious art school and is a ballerina. Their worlds clash. They dance together. The end. The story line is very base and boring. The art school director's character is beyond unbelievable. I think her entire character consisted of frowning at b boy dancer as a punctuation to each scene that included him up until the end. The two leads hardly look young enough to be in high school. Jenna Dewan looks like a 25 year old chain smoker rather than a fit and healthy dancer. She tried her best to whine and produce teenage angst toward her mother who was just as boring to watch as she was. Jenna's friend in the movie gets cheated on by her boyfriend an aspiring singer. Predictable. The music was dull and uninspiring. Personally I couldn't wait to leave. I wanted to walk out on the film yet at the same time wanted to give it a chance. If you truly want to see this film wait until the last 15 minutes of it walk in and sit down to see the senior recital where girl and b boy boyfriend get on the stage and do a decent production number but then it's over. This was about the only interesting part of the entire 98 minutes.".

What's with all the hype for Channing Tatum? He wasn't very good in coach carter and he's downright terrible in this i'm looking for a deleted scene where he cuts his arm and you can see his robotic circuitry underneath. Jenna Dewam is not a good leading lady she makes no strides to prove she has any acting chops at all. I've seen scarface do better lines than her. A large portion of my problems rest with the cast they must've picked these guys up from the trash bin outside the set of Dawson's Creek or something because everything they say oozes of coy bipolar emotive overthetop yet completely nonsensical dialogue. seriously this movie is like a soundboard where random phrases are strewn together to make a somewhat coherent but awkward dialogue. the actors don't deliver but a lot of the blame also goes to the writers who wrote this crap? if someone tells me you don't know what you're getting yourself into... i think of more serious things associated with that phrase like joining the yakuza or Scientology but not a warning to the tribulations of learning how to friggin' dance! and speaking of dancing for those people who are solely seeing this movie for that very aspect you can find more exciting stuff elsewhere. the footwork is very mundane and not as thrilling as the ads play it out to be. i'd stick with MTV. All in all this movie was just plain bad. Not uwe boll so bad it's good kinda bad but tricking the teenspreteensdates into paying for a big steaming turd bad. I don't know if Hollywood is doing some kind of science experiment to see if they can get people to see their terrible movies by baiting it with popular music cool slang and fresh young talent but I implore you guys to not see this waste of celluloid. Things like this and John Tucker Must Die aren't even of the same pedigree of the stupid but semifun teen movies that were trouncing around 5 or 6 years ago... this movie needs to STEP DOWN.and to top it off my friend's scene didn't even make the cut.".

The dance was OK the acting was bad the plot was garbage and the whole movie was predictable. It was as if I had all ready saw it and walked out. I would say 70 of the people watching this movie with me walked out. I recommend bringing a pillow and a blanket to the movie in case you fall asleep like the majority of the people did. It did so bad in fact that the movie theaters as already stop playing it in under a week. I wouldn't want to see anyone else waist their money on this movie. This movie is nothing but for low self esteem teenagers and for geeks. No wonder none of the critics liked it. Be smart save your money.".

The inner city kids tend to get a bad wrap a lot of the time and it was good to see some of them come out on top. It was also AWESOME to see how the music and art program in the middle of a busy town can help redirect a youth's focus. We need more schools of the arts in our cities. I wish that congress would grab a hold of this concept and stop cutting our education budget for our children.

Well put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have. Not to mention if you've seen those movies well frankly you have seen Step Up. Because Channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? After all this is their chance to step up to the passion the mystery and the lust of the dance! OK that was a silly plot explanation but like I said as long as you've seen those movies I mentioned or even if you just saw the plot you get the movie. I don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating I bet it's those Channing lovers! LOL!

When artistic director Thomas Leroy Cassel decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre Ryder for the opening production of their new season Swan Lake Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition a new dancer Lily Kunis who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace and the Black Swan who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side  a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.";

	schema:headline " A beautiful and nightmarish masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival which I managed to snag a ticket for and for good reason  it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.Nina Sayers Natalie Portman has toiled for years within a New York ballet company always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times and director Thomas Leroy Vincent Cassel makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company's goto lead pushed into retirement Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily Mila Kunis and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica Barbara Hershey Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow but right after that first moment of offtherails insanity he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre.While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art. Black Swan is never a low budget character piece. It is a film that navigates between being thrilling and horrific at the same time. While the horror elements start to take more prominence in the second half specifically the rather squeamish elements of body horror done in a way that would make David Cronenberg proud the film never lets one completely overtake the other. It manages to maintain this sense of dread darkness and rather graphic woundinjury infliction throughout.The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Contrasting blacks and whites so frequently give the obvious hints of good and evil innocence and darkness. But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn changing the colours for each character depending on the scene and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection both in others and the self mostly through mirrors only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film's slow points are never dragged out merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.Portman who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother and the sexually depraved fallen angel inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not well in the beginning of the film and as the film progresses you can practically chart her 180degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions but Cassel makes every moment onscreen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better practically stealing the screen away from Portman's magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman's performance it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time  it just may steal the show.1010.".

But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn changing the colours for each character depending on the scene and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection both in others and the self mostly through mirrors only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film's slow points are never dragged out merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.Portman who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother and the sexually depraved fallen angel inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not well in the beginning of the film and as the film progresses you can practically chart her 180degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions but Cassel makes every moment onscreen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better practically stealing the screen away from Portman's magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman's performance it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time  it just may steal the show.1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan makes ballet cooland if that isn't a Herculean feat in itself I don't know what is. It also happens to be one of the best films of the year featuring one of the best performances of the year. Natalie Portman will be nominated for her devastating portrayal of petite perfectionist Nina the ballerina or I'll pull a Werner Herzog and eat my shoe.Black Swan is cut from the same cloth as Aronofsky's 2008 film The Wrestler if at the opposite end. Interestingly before either project was realized the director was reportedly mulling a drama about the relationship between a professional wrestler and a ballerina. Somewhere along the way however that concept was split down the middleand thank God. Black Swan is brilliant but it wouldn't necessarily play well with others.Like its predecessor the film examines a physically demanding and widely unappreciated art and though thematically similar the two complement each other via mutually exclusive cinematic vernaculars. The Wrestler is ultimately a safer film. Its emotional experience is directly conveyed via plot and dialogue. What Aronofsky attempts with Black Swan is riskier he plays genre Frankenstein taking established themes and transplanting them into that which feels initially least appropriatehorror.Yet despite certain unmistakable cues I'd hesitate to call Black Swan a horror film. Visually maybe but John Carpenter insists The Thing is a Western and likewise there is more to Black Swan than is aesthetically obvious. It probably best fits the psychological thriller mold but as Aronofsky suggests through his manipulation of mirrors it is not a film that ever casts a clear reflection. For me that dichotomy is what makes it so fascinating and rewarding.Black Swan strikes an immediate haunting note that seems to grow louder with reverberation rather than quieter. In the first half the director lays track work in the second he runs right off it. Nina begins her journey receiving the coveted role of the Swan Queen in a modernist production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Her practiced technique makes her ideal for the role of the goodly White Swan but her lascivious director Vincent Cassel has reservations about her ability to portray her evil twin the titular Black Swana character that embodies impulse and lust. Nina's process of unlearning takes her to increasingly dark surreal depths.The final act of the film comprises the most riveting 40 minutes I've seen on screen all year though Black Swan is never the mindfk some have improperly labeled it. Aronofsky deliberately builds atmosphere and anticipation toward a Kubrickian climax that is at once obvious and stunning. Tchaikovsky's score falls like an aerial assault and that inherent theatricality collides with Aronofsky's narrative as they come to a dual boil.Perhaps best of all however is that for all the audacity on display the director knows when to dial it back as well. The casting of Mila Kunis Forgetting Sarah Marshall That 70's Show was idyllic. She plays a comic relief of sorts with a comely downtoearth veneer but viperous eyes. Her performance is fantastically calculatedshe provides derisive but much needed perspective on Nina's deteriorating sense of reality.Black Swan is a wholly effective work born from the shadowy underside of the mind anchored by a careerdefining turn by Portman. It is a quick impulsive piece but it explains artistic devotion and the consuming nature of obsession as well or better than any film I've ever seen. In hindsight it feels more characteristic of the filmmaker responsible for Pi and Requiem for a Dream than The Wrestler though the parallels between it and Black Swan run deep.They may be cut from the same cloth but the difference between the two is as stark as black and white. Hail Aronofsky the Swan King.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the opportunity to see Black Swan in one of the 18 theaters that it opened up on this weekend although I generally do not do so I was compelled to write a review of the film.From top to bottom this film is at the height of what it means to be true art in cinema. The various elements of the film the miseenscene was so incredibly structured by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky that one need only sit back and admire at the fluidity of his camera movement or the marvelous hue of colors amidst a film which has it's color scheme largely dedicated to the symbolism of black and white.The performances where spot on Vincent Cassel was terrific as the suspicious teacher whose brilliance and lust for the dancers in his show are both quite reputable one often beating out the other. And Mila Kunis truly shines in this one bringing out a side of her many probably didn't know was possible. She is absolutely beautiful and aptly portrays the black contradiction to Natalie Portmans white a terrific contrast of good and evil. Kunis however as many may assume is not meant to be there to spark a general conflict of good vs evil but to emphasize the side of Portman that we have not yet seen. A side that will drive her to the brink of insanity to obtain.And therein lies the true theme of the film obsession and physical strain over all else. Much like The Wrestler we have the main character dedicated to an unappreciated form of physical art. Here it is Portman's obsession with becoming the lead of the ballet Swan Lake which drives her into madness. You enter her mind as her teacher pushes her to become perfect pushing her to let go of her fragile White Swan and become the loose and destructive Black Swan. As you follow her through the stages of her audition leading towards a booming finale she becomes less and less aware of what around her is distortion and what is reality. As she loses grip Aronofsky's ability to depict psychological deterioration shines through.And make no mistake this film belongs to Aronofsky and Portman. As stated Aronofsky captures everything beautifully in frame his movement of the camera is almost as fluent and beautiful as the very dancers on the screen. His use of behind the head vantage shots has been a bit of a trademark of his allowing as to see what the character is. And his use of lighting is nothing short of extraordinary. But now comes the true star Natalie Portman. She blew me away from start to finish she displayed her transformation for the sweet girl to the physically and psychologically obsessed all the way through attempting to embody the white and black swan when necessary literally trying to become them in her mind driving her towards insanity in the pursuit of perfection. Words cannot describe Portman's performance here to say it is Oscar worthy would be a vast understatement as the depth of her character goes so deep it would nearly be worthy of playing two separate roles. So fragile at time that you fear for her life and so corrupted at others that you hate her. Acting at it's finest Portman deserves an Oscar.All things considered the film is nearly perfect one of the best dramas I've ever seen and one that is as iconic and intense as it is horrifying at times. Just to mention a few other things Winona Ryder in the small amount of screen time she had was spectacular and truly terrifying during particular scenes. And as always when Aronofsky and Clint Mansell team up the score is both epic and eerie somehow simultaneously. The overcasting score of a distorted and intense version of Swan Lake itself brilliantly compliments the atmosphere throughout the film as these two artist have done before. It could nearly work as a silent film that's how brilliant it is. If you get the opportunity once this film undoubtedly expands to other theaters see it it's harrowing and at times difficult to watch but that combination of beauty and horror makes it impossible to turn away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the commercials for Black Swan I walked into the theater expecting to see a film about a career ballerina who is forced to access her repressed dark side in preparation for her role as the swan queen and cracks under the pressure. Instead the film I saw was about a meek young woman who's possibly schizophrenic and certainly on the verge of a nervous breakdown from the opening reel. There's no real drama because Nina is already broken. All that's left is for the viewer is to watch her become increasingly unhinged.Black Swan has a lot of flaws The conception of Nina Natalie Portman is a major problem. No woman this childish and meek would ever last in an elite dance company so it's highly improbable that the company director Vincent Cassel would single her out for the prima ballerina role. We keep hearing about how Nina is technically perfect but clinical and restrained but we never see any evidence of this fact because Portman is filmed mostly in tight facial closeups during these scenes probably to disguise the fact that her dancing isn't so spectacular.The film is utterly predictable in that Nina becomes increasingly unhinged to the point that we the viewer no longer know whether what we're watching is real of one of her hallucinations which greatly resemble horror movie clichs she's stalked by her doppelganger her reflection moves with a mind of its own she imagines mutilating herself etc. None of these images are particularly inspired and they spell out the theme of the story in the most obvious way.Black Swan was utterly derivative of other better movies. I haven't seen The Red Shoes but so much of Nina's relationship with her mother was cribbed directly from The Piano Teacher that Michael Haneke could probably sue Aronofsky for plagiarism. Likewise the whole angle of Nina's repressed sexuality leading to her breakdown was done better by Polanski in Repulsion and that was almost 50 years ago. Black Swan is mostly a hodgepodge of better films.Finally the film is every bit as Manichean as its title with only two poles for its characters perfectly pure and virginal white or the sensual black whore. Nina has a few drinks masturbates and tells her oppressive mother off and we're supposed to take this as some sort of exploration of her dark side. Her rival ballerina Lily Mila Kunis literally has black wings tattooed on her back. Could you get any more obvious? I'd suggest that Black Swan works best as high camp and there were some unintended laughs in my theater but the film is so selfserious and artistically restrained that it's not even gonzo enough to be funny. Mostly it's misery porn that wallows in Nina's suffering without giving the viewer a credible rationale for watching.Look the film is welldirected it looks great the actors generally deliver good performances despite underwritten roles. I've seen many worse films than Black Swan. But in this case the hype is so wildly overblown that I'm tempted to rate the movie even lower than it deserves. Truthfully this is a 6 out of 10 picture and only slightly better than average.".

	schema:reviewBody "Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is an examination of obsession. Obsession for beauty fame and above all perfection. We are shown glimpses of its splendor only to be consumed by the ugliness and harsh reality that is the world of professional ballet.Nina Sayers played by the talented Natalie Portman is placed in the precarious situation of replacing the company's former star Winona Ryder the shining pupil of director Thomas Leroy Vincent Cassel in the production of Swan Lake. The role is a dual role in which she must play both the sweet innocent White Swan as well as her evil twin sister the Black Swan. Though Nina is best suited for the White Swan she must find a way to evoke her inner Black Swan.Though all of the ballerinas in the company would kill for her role the least jealous one Lily played by Mila Kunis in a breakthrough performance has become Nina's biggest rival catching the eye of Thomas. Still Nina is set on perfecting the role.It is Nina's obsession for perfection a constant theme through the film that is the root of her troubles. This obsession is passed down from her mother played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey. She too was a ballerina but gave up her career to support Nina living vicariously through her daughter. Her obsession for dance is shared by all dancers really but Nina takes it a step further causing it to physically and mentally affect her.The pain and suffering that Nina's goes through takes its toll early on in the film. She sees herself on the faces of strangers the scratching and itching she inflicts on her back yet we never see and the scrapes and cuts that appear out of thin air as if something inside of her is ready to burst out. As the film goes on it becomes more clear that her thoughts and hallucinations are blending with her reality to the point where she can't distinguish the two from one another.Here's where Aronofsky's obsessionpassion for filmmaking takes over. He too seeks perfection in his work finding the right camera angles the right tempo and the right composition. This film has some of his best camera work to date thanks to the cinematography of Matthew Libatique whose fluid camera movements are the glue that hold the film together.Aronofsky is a director who tries to make his shots look as beautiful as they can be while not blowing you away with CGI and special effects. The Fountain though not a perfect movie by any means had some truly outstanding photography also partnered with Libatique that wasn't heavy on the artificial special effects. Here he makes a similar attempt to create an incredibly realistic picture. It helps that both Portman and Kunis dedicated months and months of training and dieting to get the appropriate look for the film. That hard work paid off for sure.Without those two ladies the film would be lost. Having seen the film I can't see another actress in either role. They were perfectly cast. Portman though not afraid to show some skin for the camera in a film like Closer and even Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones acts and appears so fragile and innocent in many of her roles. Kunis on the other hand hearkening back to her days on That 70s Show has always been the pretty girl with a bit of attitude. Her eyes are almost hypnotic. These two women play perfectly off of each other contrasting like the two swans in the ballet. I'm sure the talk of the movie will be the scene in Nina's bedroom see it for yourself but I enjoyed their night on the town leading up to the bedroom scene more. We see Lilly's influence and persuasiveness affect Nina tremendously.Their performances are backed by a tight story. It's takes us places that we least expect to go showing us beautiful and disturbing images that you would not expect from a movie about ballerinas making Black Swan one of the more original psychological thrillers in the past decade. Like every good thriller there needs to be good music too. Enter Clint Mansell whose score for Aronofsky's second film Requiem for a Dream has become one of the more beloved scores of all time. I am particularly fond of his work for Moon but Requiem is just as good if not better. Here we have a great blend of classical and original pieces.These pieces come together to create a portrait of a dancer whose demeanor gets in the way of her heart's yearning for success. When her dreams start slipping her mind does the same. Passion leads to obsession. Obsession leads to transformation. The White Swan becomes the Black Swan and she must pay the price.".

Portman though not afraid to show some skin for the camera in a film like Closer and even Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones acts and appears so fragile and innocent in many of her roles. Kunis on the other hand hearkening back to her days on That 70s Show has always been the pretty girl with a bit of attitude. Her eyes are almost hypnotic. These two women play perfectly off of each other contrasting like the two swans in the ballet. I'm sure the talk of the movie will be the scene in Nina's bedroom see it for yourself but I enjoyed their night on the town leading up to the bedroom scene more. We see Lilly's influence and persuasiveness affect Nina tremendously.Their performances are backed by a tight story. It's takes us places that we least expect to go showing us beautiful and disturbing images that you would not expect from a movie about ballerinas making Black Swan one of the more original psychological thrillers in the past decade. Like every good thriller there needs to be good music too. Enter Clint Mansell whose score for Aronofsky's second film Requiem for a Dream has become one of the more beloved scores of all time. I am particularly fond of his work for Moon but Requiem is just as good if not better. Here we have a great blend of classical and original pieces.These pieces come together to create a portrait of a dancer whose demeanor gets in the way of her heart's yearning for success. When her dreams start slipping her mind does the same. Passion leads to obsession. Obsession leads to transformation. The White Swan becomes the Black Swan and she must pay the price.";

	schema:reviewBody "Yeah it must be Darren Aronofsky at it again. I'm certain I've just seen a brilliant piece of filmmaking but at the same time I feel like I've just been run over by a convoy of trucks. It will be a while before I calm down enough to sleep so here I am.Not everyone is as big as of an Aronofsky's style as I am but one thing that can't be denied is that he is great at working with actors. Ellen Burstyn Mickey Rourke and now Natalie Portman are all very accomplished actors who have found a new level and delivered transcendent performances under Aronofsky. In Black Swan Natalie Portman's turn as Nina Sayers is hands down the best acting performance of 2010 male or female. If you'll forgive the clich I completely forgot Nina was Natalie Portman about five minutes into the movie. As Nina goes deeper and deeper into her role as the Swan Queen Portman only becomes more and more captivating. The entire cast is excellent but Portman alone makes this movie a mustsee.Darren Aronofsky is at his boldest heading up Black Swan. His depiction of Nina's struggles as she succumbs to growing pressures from her director her mother her rivals her physical ailments her personal need for a perfect performance.. it is intense thrilling exhausting and truly gripping throughout. Part of what makes it work is that we are completely along for the ride with Nina. We see what she sees we experience what she experiences and sometimes it is truly distressing stuff.As great as the first 6070 minutes are man oh man nothing can prepare you for the final 30. This finale takes you to places I can't even describe. I dare say it's on par with Requiem for a Dream's devastating third act. It's a masterfully crafted climax that only Aronofsky could deliver.I am glad Aronofsky is able to do what he does. His brutal and uncompromising style is definitely not for everyone and it's not box office gold but for those viewers who connect with what he's doing the experience is truly something special.".

	schema:headline " Absolutely amazing.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see this at the Austin Film Festival and was absolutely blow away.Aronofsky is in many ways like Nick Cave. You know going in that you are going to get something gritty raw and real. You know that even if it's good it's going to be hard to process. But when he gets a hold of something really gets a hold of it you won't be able to look away no matter how hard it is to watch. He is a singular filmmaker in the regard that he can create something that is both visceral and cerebral at the same time. Others can do this but few as well. What he does is never hollow shallow or empty it is always dense deep and rich with everything that makes film great.Black Swan is no exception. In many ways this is the most Aronofsky of his films. His style is spot on and works exquisitely with the world he is presenting. It's surprising because he normally shows the dirty gritty and ugly places where as everything in this film is clean and polished. But don't let that fool you he saved the dirt and grit for the characters. It's remarkable that the man who was able to show the sensitive and vulnerable side of a wrestler is also able to show the brutal and hard side of a ballerina? For starters this film looks amazing. The production design specifically the use of black and white in contrast don't spend time looking for this it's everywhere and you will miss something if you do does it's job without feeling invasive. The lighting is brilliant as is the staging of the dance scenes. I'm still stunned that the same eye that brought the grainy subway bathroom of Pi to life is the same eye that brings all this rich and beautiful color so clearly to the screen.He also does a brilliant job of creating the world that these characters inhabit. This film reminded me of all the terrible parts of my theater days. The backstabbing the trash talking and the two faced nature of that world is portrayed with a deft and brilliant touch. There is a constant fear that you are one mistake away from losing not only your part but your future parts as well. You feel like you are a part of this world that he pressure of it is part of your world.The camera work is great if a little typical of Aronofsky at times we see the backs of heads quite a bit it works but you see it a lot but it is very affective. The somewhat jittery close handheld shots are perfect and pull you deeper into this world than may be comfortable.Then there are the name performances. Of the name actors you mostly get what you expect. Portman Cassel Hershey and Rider are outstanding. The only real shock for me anyway is Mila Kunis. I know her as Jackie from That 70's Show and nothing else. She damned near steals the show. That's right in a move where she shares screen with Natalie Portman AND Vincent Cassel she is able to not only hold her own but walk away with some scenes. The interplay between her wild unrestrained Lilly and Portman's frightened tightly wound Nina creates a brilliant external tension to match and at times overpower the internal tension that lies at the very core of Nina.I have been a fan of Aronofsky's work since I saw Pi on it's original theatrical run  I think I was the only person in the theater for that midnight show and he has yet to disappoint. He has a definite point of view and a thematic core that runs through his work. Thematically this is in keeping with most of Aronofsky's work. It's about control and the loss of that control. What happens when a perfectionist control freak is in a position where she HAS to let go of that control? What takes over when she does let go? In typical fashion Aronofsky shows us that sometimes in striving to get what we want we risk losing a part of us that we may never be able to get back and don't realize how desperately we need.Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Esteemed IMDb writer Theo Robertson messaged me the other day about this film and while I skimmed it for fear of having him influence me in terms of his opinion I did read that several older people had walked out of this film seemingly having expected some sort of highbrow film with its roots in ballet. One can understand why because with all the award buzz and the superficial subject matter ballet combined with the actress and of course the previous work of the director this must surely be an intelligent piece to be appreciated and considered. What one wouldn't expect would be a film that with a bit more gore could easily be just another trashy horrorthriller that is released on video and has plenty of sex violence and jump scares to it.Well got news for you this is what Black Swan is  albeit a superior example of the genre. Essentially our lead character struggles to get in touch with her dark side when she wins the lead in Swan Lake gradually losing touch with reality andor being hunted by those around her who wish her harm. This manifests itself through some painful scenes of selfharm imagined doppelgangers intense sexual discovery shadowy figures and a domineering mother who keeps her controlling menace under a veil of vulnerability that only falls here or there. It is trashy stuff in a way but it is done very well so that it produces this genre material but does so in a way that feels slightly classy while also engaging more than it would thanks to a brilliant turn by Portman.And she is brilliant. I understand the mother because of how well Portman plays  this is not a character she has worked on for a few months this feels like a product of years under the influence of this mother. She is nervous to her core frustrated by her own inability to be this thing that she has spent her life not being  wild loose imperfect. Portman nails it and while I don't think it is a brilliant film her performance is little less than brilliant. In support Hersey is equally as good with less time to do it. The flickers across her face say so much and I was impressed that with so little I was able to understand roughly what had happened in the previous 20 years. Cassel is simplistic but effective in his predatory director turn. Kunis is unbelievably sexual and again she helps the lead role by showing us everything that Nina struggles to find in herself. Ryder is solid in a smaller role. Aronofsky's direction is strong but particularly impressive is the cinematography  the camera flows so well around the scenes and yet appears in no mirrors. I think he knows he is making a horror movie so although he embraces the ballet he doesn't avoid the shock or the build of the horror.Some have embraced this film as art and a thing of beauty  while others have come away disappointed because that is what they expected it to be but didn't find it. However Black Swan is an effective psychological horror movie that just happens to be set in the world of ballet. As such it is very much a genre movie even if the director etc lift it to feel like more. In particular Portman makes the film  I cannot think I have seen her better and her Oscar can there be doubt? will be deserved.".

Still having been partnered with a dancer for a number of years I couldn't resist the temptation  as a result of which I have to side with those reviewers here who regard it as an utterly pointless affair.What bothered me slightly were the abundant factual errors in depicting a dance company although that's where most of the action takes place. Even overlooking the myth of the allpowerful choreographer who can choose his lead at random and at any given time to have the lead's antagonist being chosen as her substitute almost at the end of the film is a quite unnecessary blunder.

Other incoherences were Winona Ryder's character  a lead isn't likely to be fired like that  and Vincent Cassel's character  a choreographer engaging in such rampant displays of sexual harassment wouldn't be likely to make creative director. Add the stereotypical career mom of Portman's stereotypically fretting artiste plus the stereotypically venomous scheming antagonist and voil there's your assembly of paperthin characters in a papiermch world.What bothered me more about 'Black Swan' was the excessive use of special effects to drive its already notquitesohardtounderstand message home feathers growing out of scratches talking photos and the muchused eyelinerenhanced demonic expression of the transformed 'Black Swan' made me wish to metaphorically grab Aronofsky by the collar and scream Enough of this already!

The problem with this being that had the plot been as straight forward as in Aronofsky's much better 'Wrestler' the runtime would have hardly exceeded 30 minutes.However what bothers me most about 'Black Swan' is its complete lack of respect for its subject matter. Hitherto all dance films have somehow attempted to grasp the particular mix of hard work and inspiration this art form demands and presents like no other. Yet although this issue is pretty much the crux of Black Swan's story it fails to feature a full dance scene instead there are snippets of real and imaginary danceinflicted wounds and a steadycam rotating around its star thereby consciously ignoring the essence of ballet per se its effect as an ensemble piece. Anybody who has ever seen 'Swan Lake' or any other ballet piece for that matter will probably concur that the interaction between dancers is at least as important as their individual talent. 'Black Swan' makes it almost seem as if a lead dancer is something like the star of a Las Vegas show. The only thing missing is Portman smattering a catchy tune out of her shiny black lips.One may argue that accuracy is not what the film is about that it is a psychological thriller. But why make use of the black swan white swan metaphor of the piece and then detach the whole story from the piece and the art that inspires it? Even those who liked the film should ask themselves does this movie really address ballet in any way but that very metaphor? And isn't the whole story revolving around such an obvious analogy completely pointless? Another sign of disrespect to me is the investment of 'Swan Lake' which as a mainstay of classical ballet can be said to be a part of an unquestionable cultural heritage with a highly clich and pass Freudian repressedsexualityslashschizophrenia gimmick. Not only is such an approach rather pompous and shallow but it is also inadvertently funny the means by which the lead character attempts to relieve herself earned quite a few snickers in the audience I was in. Imagine a 90minutefilm about the sexual symbolism of 'Hansel  Gretel' and you'll get an idea what to intellectually expect and a conclusion which  I have to concur with a number of other reviews  is painfully easy to figure out.In short the most overhyped and annoying film I've seen in a long time. Definitely not for dance enthusiasts. If you're looking for a psychological thriller in the world of entertainment try the anime 'Perfect Blue' which judging from Black Swan's style seems to be familiar to Aronofsky. And better dance films? Just pick any of them from 'The Red Shoes' to 'Billy Elliot'  they all have more to say about the art of and devotion to dance than this one.".

In real life no production company would allow someone with so little confidence to assume the top role. Millions of dollars are at stake and investors would need to be confident that the lead could handle the more difficult Black Swan role upfront. No one would allow weeks of crying and hallucinations right up till opening night and even late for that to prove that they can actually do the job. Also the big flub in the first act would have likely caused the second to take her place. Obviously someone with the low selfesteem demonstrated by the Portman character could never hope to gain even a minor role with a ballet company and certainly not the lead. The competition is just too stiff. Also Portman does not have the correct body type and is a little short at only 5'3. The boiled chicken and freshplucked look was also a big turnoff. In real life someone so mechanical and fearful would never make it to the top ranks. A secondstring Rockette has more stones than the Portman character.".

Inexplicably I might add when there are far more talented dancers around her.She is a onenote swan. Her facial expression never varies from sad pursemouthed and leaky eyed. I got so tired of looking at her face and it is shown just about all the time. To top it off I felt absolutely no connection with any other character as the movie wound excruciatingly along on its hopeless execrable way to nowhere.The lack of script is a serious flaw but the graphic detail of what she does do is laid out she vomits she slashes herself she lives with her mother she has lesbian sex  sorta but she has no background no character apart from mommy's girl no friends no interactions with others apart from the briefest of convos about ballet. The mother is completely cardboard  with matching dialogue  I gave up my career for you poor me.This comes across as a horror movie with an unnecessary disgust factor aiming for the roof. I covered my eyes many times. Not in fear but in a kind of shame that a movie could be this bad. It is not even a good ballet movie the dance sequences are choppy compounded by the uneven hand of the director everywhere.When the audience started to laugh about 13 of the way through I knew it was all hopeless. I joined in that's how appallingly bad it all was. In the final scene the laugh meter topped out. It is that unbelievable and unintentionally comedic.1 out of 10 from me as minuses are not allowed.Avoid.".

It was a dismal experience.A young ambitious starved in all meanings of the word dancer gets chosen for the part of OdetteOdille here called the Queen Swan and the demands of the performance further the unraveling of her psyche.Natalie Portman is Nina the insecure dancer with controlling mother Barbara Hershey and desire for limelight. Mila Kunis is Lily the equally starved fun drug sex and alcohol loving newcomer. Nina feels threatened by the incomprehensible Lily having just witnessed how brutally the artistic director Vincent Casseldealt with the former company's star Beth.Nina begins to have odd experience and visions everything seems suspicious to her. She is getting paranoid. All that while she trains to dance the double part that is in this film presented as virginal innocence versus evil seducer.From the beginning the premise is off kilter. Ballet companies contract number of prima ballerinas and premier danseurs. These are the dancers who will perform the title roles. They do not audition for each part nor would anyone dare to call a prima ballerina girl.Each significant role in any ballet has at least three dancers performing it. This is necessary because there could be more than one performance a day which would pose a real strain on dancer's body. Hence there is never just one name posted or adulated. Premier dances in USA usually perform and train together think of Gelsey Kirkland and Misha Baryshnikov. And the OdetteOdille part is traditionally danced by two different dancers. In one staging the Black swan was danced by black prima ballerina while the White Swan by a white one.I have never even heard of am artistic director who would pick a dancer form the corps de ballet and elevated her to primadona. I assume such action would cost dearly in law suits.As per the constant sexual innuendo the film is about 30 year late for that.Ditto for those starved little girl bodies that Balanchine so adored and abused. That has been over for a bit now as well as most of the sexual harassment. Not all but most.Nina would not be the first woman who while perpetually undernourished under extreme stress of unnatural expectations no dancer is as good as the computer image exposed to alcohol drugs and power manipulation would crack.But to present this as succumbing to the role is ridiculous.Dancers train to dance. The ballet mistressmister is rarely concerned with the story beyond its barest gist. Their effort is for exact movement timing high jumps and effortless look. Anyone in dance company will hear the word heels as to land on your heels and jump from your knees far more often than seduction.The presented milieu is a throw into the past those stories read and heard on the fringes.Only when I realized that the entire production was run by men it began to make sense.This is one of those stories where males present feeble female mind. Females are only capable of submission to male will they desire to do so and sexually starved virgins go mad. Females cannot live without males it is unnatural. Ambitions is unseemly in a female whose psyche is best suited to nurturing of a child and making home for her man. Nina goes mad because she is a warped female as is the former star ballet Beth Winona RyderWinona Ryder.As a statement of Christian teaching clich the film does a good job. As a presentation of male ego and the nearly absolute lack of understanding of women by those men of certain age and education it does an excellent job.As dancer and dancer's world picture is worthless.As a portrait of a prima ballerina it is a bad joke.As for dancing there is very little of it. The memorable moment comes as Odette i remarkable costume and mask finishes her solo Nina's arms grow black makeup and change into beautiful black wings. It is a very compelling image possible only in film.So I went to take a class. Adult ballet dancer have to this every day. I did not dream about becoming Odette. I always hated those 16 turns on each leg the film does not show them either.Fox Searchlight directed by Darren Aronofsky written by Mark Heyman Andrew Heinz and John McLaughlinJohn McLaughlin.".

The best thing is that it makes you wish somebody would really center a great film in the fascinating world of ballet. This...ain't it. I read this script was developed over ten years. Really? Ten years in which to create a cartoon horny bombastic company director spouting clichs about 'passion' and 'letting go'? Ten years and no one notices that Nina has no character at all? Ten years and it seemed plausible that a blatantly frightened whiny dancer should get the lead in 'Swan Lake'? Quite honestly I kept waiting for this film to actually begin only when the absurd deathdrive ending was tacked on did I realize it was over. Utterly bad all the way and mostly because we get no sense of Portman's identity WHATSOEVER. More exactly there is no foundation upon which to build either the dark side's emergence from her OR her horror of it. Other reviews here rightly point out the idiocies as in a star ballerina being 'fired' and in drunken shock over it or an alternate lead selected so late in the game or a director engaging in conduct that would get any artistic director out on his ass in a heartbeat no matter the artsy milieu. All of that would have been bearable had there been any notion even hinted at of what and who Nina is. Nothing. So weird stuff happens to this noncharacter there's a ridiculously gratuitous lesbian fantasy you early on don't freak over the blood because after five minutes you know it's in her head and then she achieves perfection in death. And you don't care at all. PS How bad? I kept longing to see Barbra Streisand take the stage in a tutu saying 'You vanna kill a swvan? Dese lovelies?'".

One mistake and you can crack a toe nail under your body weight but I don't wanna oversell it. To look at Black Swan in another way it is an operatic horror film It has incredible style but uses it not so much to dazzle but to confuse and intimidate. The paradox of Black swan is that it creepiness is kind of seductive because it draws you in much like the way vampires are supposedly romanticBut style is only half the picture not even. The rest is in the cast and mostly in Natalie Portman. She is slow to get started but she grows quickly and the result is arguably her best performance yet. I've never loved her that much. She's always struck me as more of a girl than a woman but I guess all she needs is to get a little blood on her hands and you have an award worthy performance. Vincent Cassel though he gets some questionable lines is also at his best. I would have almost liked to see more of him because you get the sense that his role has a bit more room to grow.Black Swan does quite a bit but it's not for everyone. Do not go into this expecting to be emotionally enriched. From the beginning it is staged to be a mindtwirl delighting in playing tricks on the audience. Some might call it cheating but that would be the wrong way to look at Black Swan. It's quite epic and with year coming to an end I think it's fair to say that it is among the best of 2010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Darren Aronofsky proves once again that he is an absolute genius in the modern world of cinema and he can work in any genre and make it look beautiful real visceral and always keeping with his specific visual style proving himself to be an absolute auteur. Black Swan is Aronofsky's fifth feature film and it shows how his directing ability is somehow getting better. The movie is about a ballet dancer Nina Natalie Portman who is dealing with the pressures of playing The Swan Queen in her companies production of Swan Lake. The pressures brought about by this demanding role cause her to begin to slowly crack under pressure especially when she has to worry about a rival dancer possibly taking her spot. My synopsis doesn't do the film any justice though and the result of this story is a disturbing and breath taking thriller that combines beauty with visceral intensity and keeps you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued to the screen.Aronofsky's directing style is incredibly sophisticated and mature in this film. It is grand and beautiful. The ballet scenes are all very delicate and soft yet there's always an underlying tension. This tension eventually breaks through as the film at times switches to a much darker and more disturbing mood. We are lulled into a false sense of security in many aspects of the film as it builds and builds to the shocking and chilling climax. The movie flows so beautifully and it delicately weaves in and out of its multitude of moods that keeps us watching and waiting as the film only grows darker and darker. As the moods of the film change the style does as well in a very minuscule range but it is always fitting wherever the film moves. Black Swan is sensual seductive lustful and intense and Aronofsky's direction captures it all perfectly.With a style as complex and masterful as Aronofsky's it is hard for any aspect of the film to look bad but this wasn't a problem because I felt that every aspect of this film was nearly flawless. One such aspect was the brilliant acting from the small yet very important cast that really helped a movie that needed no help at all. Natalie Portman as Nina was incredible. Her transformation through the movie is disturbing and very intense and Portman handles it incredibly well. She plays a very flawed character making the role even tougher. Nina is not the greatest ballet dancer in the world by any stretch of the imagination. She has all the technique and is in fact a master at it yet it is her emotion that she has the problem with. Portman almost had to act her character poorly to capture the multiple layers correctly. The unfitting facial expressions and awkward movements are part of the character of Nina and Portman somehow makes it all work to a great advantage that makes the film even more fascinating.The rest of the cast is incredible as well. Mila Kunis takes on a much more serious and more complex role than she is used to. Her character has very many layers and doesn't fit into one specific archetype mainly for reasons that would spoil the movie. Vincent Cassel is the sleazy and inappropriate director of this ballet production. He is the driving force behind much of the tragedy of the film and he is a character you love to hate. Then perhaps one of the most disturbing characters is Barbara Hershey as Erica Nina's mother. Erica lives vicariously through her daughter and is constantly pushing her to better while also sheltering her from the world and everything that is out there past ballet. She is the reason for Nina's rigid structure in her life that is a constant pressure to do better. The introduction of Erica's true motivation is one of the most stunning and tragic elements of the movie. We are shown only a facade of the mother at the beginning of the film being tricked into believing that Nina and her mother live a happy and beautiful life together as a loving mother and daughter. But further down the road as the film grows darker we realize just how skewed and disturbed their relationship is. It is a great bit of character development that has a very important role in the films overall progression.If I could use one word to describe Black Swan it would be seductive. The movie is ripe with sexual tension and it drags you in whether you want to be or not. It grabs ahold of your attention as well as your emotions. The film is so beautiful yet so tense and so powerful. It fascinates and hypnotizes and you want nothing more than to know what is going to happen to these people in this disturbed story. It is a film that wraps itself around your brain rendering you speechless for its entire length. There is just something so unique and so incredible about this film that it almost felt awkward stepping back into reality when it was all over. Black Swan is a masterpiece and definitely one of the best of 2010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perfection is a state of completeness and flawlessness. How many of you have known a perfectionist or you yourself feel the need to be perfect at all times? To the point where it almost drives you or the person insane? But to be honest I think we've all had those moments of wanting to be perfect. Praised as one of the best films of the year Darren Aronofsky takes us into the psyche of another character I would say that this is my favorite film by him. At a young age he has come so far in creating some of cinema's most fascinating characters and stories he's given us such amazing films. His vision brings out one of the year's best films and one of my new favorites he and Natalie Portman were meant to work together. I absolutely adore Natalie Portman but I have been waiting for her to have a role as challenging as Black Swan her intelligence grace beauty and talent shine and I hope she is not only nominated but wins the Oscar for this film. The supporting cast is incredible as well Mila Kunis I am just falling in love with her. Proving more and more that she's not just a pretty face but can take on a role that can be dangerous and makes it her own and makes it relatable to the audience. Vincent Cassel is becoming one of my favorite actors he's so strong and passionate and clearly gave so much into this role as the seductive dance teacher who in a sense is his dancer's prince from Swan Lake.A New York City ballet company is preparing for the production of Swan Lake which tells the story of an innocent fragile White Swan who falls in love with a Prince. The ballet company has chosen to cast a newcomer to the dual role of both the White and Black Swan casting out their top ballerina Beth MacIntyre. Dancer Nina Sayers extremely dedicated to achieving technical perfection competes for the part alongside several other young dancers including Lily. Nina lives with her overbearing and controlling mother Erica who was herself a former dancer and is determined to keep Nina's career from getting derailed as hers did when she got pregnant with Nina. The director Thomas is casts Nina. But he claims that she is the perfect White Swan fragile and innocent but he simply doesn't believe she has the ability to transform herself into the darkly sensual Black Swan. Nina begins suffering bizarre and often grisly hallucinations often involving injuries to herself. However as soon as the injury appears it will disappear leaving Nina disoriented and frightened. Nina also begins to feel Lily a fellow dancer who was cast in a minor role in the production is determined to take the role from her. Lily is wild sensual and unruly  ideal casting for the Black Swan. Leroy is becoming increasingly frustrated with Nina desiring passion and guile from her and receiving only control and innocence. Tensions are also heating with Nina's mother who believes the role is too much for Nina. What Nina doesn't realize is that the only thing that is holding her back form being perfect is herself and her lack of making one mistake.Though I found the film predictable at times I loved the study of Nina's character. Is she crazy and how she became that way is just so tragic. The way her mother behaves around her almost an incestuous relationship is just horrific not giving her daughter a chance to grow up and become a woman. Nina is trying so hard to be perfect that she forgets that it's OK to let loose and make a mistake. Her dance is so beyond beautiful Natalie is one heck of a dancer and you can only imagine some of the pain she endured for this movie. Her dancing tells a story as well her body language you can tell she thinks too hard about things. Lily is exactly what Nina always wanted to be but couldn't because of her mother. Lily and Nina's love scene is so beyond intense you just find yourself loosing your mind with Nina.Black Swan is not only one of the best movies of the year but one of my favorite films. I can't stop thinking about it and cannot wait until I get the DVD so I can watch it more and study it. It's a darker version of the play Swan Lake and is just so hauntingly beautiful. I'm sure there are flaws I can think of a couple however the film did satisfy me greatly and I can't wait to see it again. Darren has once again given the world another film that is just incredible and will be discussed for years.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah! Another artsyfarty film about an artsyfartsy subject made for the artsyfartsy crowd.... TBS is a tedious stagnant and derivative film that goes absolutely nowhere. Well one wonders what can be as exciting as the backstage story of a young lady competing to be the prima ballerina in a new production of The Black Swan?

They are all very inspiring I guess.The end of TBS of course is very clich as is the whole film... because as expected what matters in the end is the performance the perfection of execution and all that stupid blablabla about winning and succeeding at any cost.To spike the interest in and keep the attention of the male audience watching this masterpiece  the producers resorted to an old trick and introduced two gratuitous sex scenes one of them depicting lesbian sex in the film.

Jim Carrey and the SNL crew made a better short comedy about this. At least you could tell where they were coming from. lol This movie isn't good enough for adults and you can't take little girls to see it because it's full of Xrated material. Therefore what audience is it meant for? I'm sure it'll get lots of awards. The stupid artsy fartsy stuff like this always does.".

In her first ever oncamera interview 81yearold Junge talks about her unique life. In the spring of 2001 Andre Heller succeeded in convincing Traudl Junge how valuable it is to record her unique memories. Fiftysix years after the end of the Second World War an important eyewitness reveals her experiences to us. What she saw and heard turned her into an furious opponent of National Socialism an opponent moreover who is still painfully aware and seems incapable of forgiving the young girl she once wasfor her naivete ignorance and her liking for Hitler.";

This leads to the facile equation monstrous man commits monstrous deeds. And of course this proposition is very satisfying for most of us because we think we can tell who's a monster and who is not in the political arena everybody that is except for those dopey Germans of the 1930s. But the great lesson of the 20th century is that regimes can arise which do not require monstrous humans to do monstrous thingsthey do just fine with the human material available next door to all of us. Which is not to say that Hitler was not a psychopath or a sociopath but only to say that he needn't have been one to be at the helm of a regime responsible for unspeakable atrocities.

	schema:reviewBody "Traudl Junge one of Hitler's personal secretaries finally decides to come out and tell the story of working for Hitler during one of the most catastrophic and studied times in German history. You sort of have to get past the fact that the movie is literally nothing more than a camera pointed at her while she tells these stories it's certainly not what I had expected when I rented the film but with subject matter like this it really doesn't matter. In a sense if they had dramatized her story with photos archive footage or god forbid reenactments I think it would really have diluted the potency and immediacy of what she had to say. This is a woman who at the time was in her late teens and like countless other people she was intoxicated with the unnerving charm and determination and grand view for the future of the world. Yes it's all told simply through the dialogue of this elderly woman talking to an interviewer but this is a woman who met with Hitler face to face during his most powerful time who watched him evolve from the dangerously charismatic leader with a master plan for the human race and into the darkly depressed visionary fallen from power and overcome with defeat faced with the crashing of his enormous ideals. She even tells the story literally of the last minutes of Hitler's life during which he actually bid her farewell just before ending his own life. One of the things that really struck me was the amazing detail of Junge's memory. Here she is in her 80s and she remembers wordforword conversations that happened decades earlier as well as remarkable details of situations and events. The looks on people's faces who was where and at what time as well as what was happening at those times smells emotions sounds etc. These are all of the things that good novelists use to convey a compelling sense of atmosphere which is I think one of the most important things to be created for a novel to be effective. I don't think at all that Junge's memory should be called into question even though she remembers such striking details of things that happened so many years ago and I don't think that her age should be a factor in deciding how accurate her memory is either. This is a time in this woman's life that she has surely been going over and over in her head for decades wondering how she could have been so fooled into thinking that she was working for a powerful benevolent leader and how she could not have seen what was really going on. She learns late in her life about a woman about her own who had been executed for opposing Hitler the same year that she herself came to work for him. It seems to me that a period in someone's life that has such a resonating effect of the rest of it is something that is remembered even more vividly than anything that happens later. The stories about Hitler himself are probably the most compelling element of the entire film. Junge tells stories about him that I would never have imagined since like many people to which this film is mainly aimed I think know little about Hitler beyond the public speeches that he made about his grand vision where he displayed his amazing speaking abilities and his shockingly effective ability to make his vision while always destructive to the people that he viewed as inferior sound appealing to so many people. Obviously a person would have to have some earthshaking motivational speaking abilities to make people on a large scale accept and support something so murderous and destructive to humanity in general.Some of the things about Hitler that I was most surprised by were things like his pet dog Blondie and his affection for her puppies the way he is described as softspoken and polite when speaking to the young women working for him as his secretaries the total transformation in appearance that he evidently underwent whenever he stepped before the cameras and microphones in public the fact that he didn't ever want flowers kept in his office because he hated dead things' etc. Junge expresses her own shock at that last point which surely mirrors that of anyone else watching the film. Can you imagine someone like Hitler who engineered millions of human deaths uncomfortable with flowers in his office because he hated dead things? It boggles the mind and is also reflected by other revelations in the film such as his total detachment from everything that was going on in Germany as a result of his leadership. He even traveled in a train with the blinds drawn and was taxied through the streets to his destinations by drivers who would take the routes with the least amount of war damage so that he wouldn't be made uncomfortable. This is certainly not a traditional documentary but the documentary genre is I think one of the most flexible genres in film. The subject matter is literally endless and as this movie shows even the simplest forms of the documentary can be enormously effective and moving. I think that the main purpose of a documentary is to provide information not entertainment and as long as it can do that I don't think that it really matters how intricate or complexly made the film itself is. Blind Spot provides plenty of information and while the presentation is not exactly thrilling it reminded me throughout of reading a book. One of the main reasons that I love to read and I think also one of the reasons that people are so often disappointed with film adaptations of novels is because it is always an individual experience. You create in your head the world that is described in the book and film adaptations are someone else's vision of that world which is pretty much invariably not the same as your own. This is why movies that are as closely faithful to the original material are so often the most critically and popularly successful ones. In Blind Spot Junge tells her story in her own words without any kind of cinematic enhancement of them allowing the viewer to create what it must have been like in his or her own head which I think makes the world and the events that she describes that much more vivid and immediate.".

	schema:headline " Blind Spot should be required viewing";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of this German documentary Im Toten Winkel  Hitlers Sekretarin would be more accurately translated as The Dead Zone Hitler's Secretary. An even better title would be Dead Calm as in the eye of a hurricane. The narrator or interviewee Traudl Humps Junge maintains that  far from being at the hub of the Nazi regime and privy to sensitive political and military information  she was actually completely out of the loop in the splendid isolation of the Wolf's Lair.But Blind Spot is an equally apt description of Frau Junge's vantage point on Hilter and the war years especially at the beginning of her career. The Hitler she knew was partly a creation of her own mind. She admits that she was attracted to him as a benevolent father figure one she needed to compensate for the shortcomings of her own parents. The Hitler she depicts in the first half of the documentary is lightyears removed from the Hitler portrayed by Noah Taylor in the recent feature film Max.Frau Junge's Hitler is almost endearing gentle is her word with his fondness for his pet dog Blondie and his abstemious lifestyle as a vegetarian and teetotaller.Yet in retrospect Frau Junge wonders why she did not see Hitler for the monster he turned out to be. If nothing else he lived in total denial of the realities of global conflict and mass genocide. He preferred to eat with his secretaries and avoid the war talk of his male staff. When travelling through a devastated Germany by train he kept the window blinds pulled down. He was careful about his diet yet this did not prevent him from being dyspeptic and suffering from digestive complaints.In the second half of the documentary Frau Junge details Hitler's last days before committing suicide in his bunker. Over and over she uses the same three adjectives like a refrain or leitmotiv nightmarish weird macabre. Her face shows little emotion except when she speaks of the six Goebbels children who were injected with poison because their mother could not conceive of life after the Third Reich. Her voice is calm and strong. Indeed I found myself able to udnerstand much of the original German because her diction was so clear. Her version of events does not sound rehearsed. Like anyone else recalling a distant past she sometimes forgets to recount something and must backtrack. She is a credible witness to history  and yet at the same time her story is that of someone wearing blinkers or with tunnel vision. As the old saying goes Hindsight is better than foresight and There is none so blind as he who will not see.Hitler's denial of reality and Frau Junge's blind spot are the reflection in microcosm of an entire nation's unwillingness for decades to acknowledge its responsibility for the horrors of the Nazi regime. Frau Junge says that even the revelations of the death camps and the Nuremberg trials were not enough to force the German people to look themselves squarely in the face. She herself did not tell her story for almost 60 years.Just before the lights go up we learn that Frau Junge died of cancer the day after the documentary premiered in Berlin. In her last conversation with the filmmakers she confessed I think I am just now beginning to forgive myself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Near the beginning of the film Hitler's secretary tells a story of a concentration camp guard asked if he felt pity for the victims and that he replied yes of course he does but that he had to get over it for the greater good. His sense of morality was still intact just perverted. Like that line in Rules of the Game everyone has their reasons. The film forces us to humanize the bad guys  this is an old woman and with the exception of Leni Riefenstahl nobody wants to immediately hate an old woman least of all one was never a member of the Nazi party and whose own husband died fighting. She got the job largely out of chance during her typing test which she was doing terribly on a phone call which would prove lifechanging came in for Hitler and she had time while he was on the phone to calm herself down and type properly.The film isn't much as a film but the director does something very smart in showing her watch the film herself. On the one hand it allows her to go back and make an addendum should something seem incomplete or out of context and on a subject as touchy as this that makes sense. And it's something that allows her to remain dignified  the aim here isn't to catch her admitting to something nor is it to make her into a symbol we can feel sorry for she cries only once and even then it's brief. But on the other hand it could also be seen to be allowing her to backtrack on her own admissions. For instance at one point she dismisses her descriptions of Hitler as being banal and with the exception of her description of the joy he took in showing off his dog's tricks that's too obvious a comparison for it to speak of his manner in dealing with humans the insight she gives is valuable because it explains her experience how it felt at the time. The atrocious digital video is painful on the eyes but the director's decision to cut to her watching the video herself has a secondary value at one point as she is watching the video she adds a question asking rhetorically if Hitler had found Jewish blood in him would he have gassed himself? Because it is so casually interspersed with the interview proper and because of the echo in the room it's a haunting moment and it adds an aesthetic dimension to the film that is otherwise lacking and maybe rightfully so.She describes her house as being one raised by a man her grandfather on her mother's side her father was absent who favored ideals such as backing down and making sacrifices. That and the fact that she openly admits to being endeared to Hitler based partly on a paternal image partly explains her naivety but even the background reasons for why she didn't understand who Hitler really was or what he was really doing as she had a closer understanding of who he was than those of us who pontificate from a distance doesn't do anything to change the fact that she can't live with herself because of it. The film doesn't really take an in depth approach at that at the nature of her depression it more listens to her relay the information as she experienced it which is an interesting perspective. We get a good sense of her guilt when she describes Hitler's private courteousness vs. his bombastic public persona. Which was the evil one? If he had ideals in his private life they became evils in his public life. But his success could not have been achieved if it was not for the collective us. THAT is a troubling thought and it betrays the common image we have of Hitler as the great evil. It's no wonder she was so distraught that after years of silence and disinterest in her story she emerges to make this film  and then die after its release.As a woman she has certain insights into the Hitler phenomenon. She never understood why Hitler received so many fan letters from women remarking that she didn't see him as a sexual beast she only once witnessed him kiss his wife Eva Braun on the lips and that he had relatively primitive views on women  he could never understand that a man might cheat on his beautiful wife with a less attractive woman after all what else could he want aside from his wife's beauty? She also speaks quite eloquently about eroticism and it might seem out of place to praise her for it or to praise the filmmakers for including it but just hearing her a woman of a certain age talk openly about giving yourself over to the erotic and how Hitler never did is a pleasure in itself.Those looking for a revelation into the Holocaust's inner workings will likely be disappointed  even though she was in the bunker she doesn't solve the Hitler suicide question she heard an officer claim to have burned the body postsuicide but didn't go look. But it's fascinating regardless and she finds it fascinating too  it's interesting to watch her fairly calm and reserved demeanor grow more excitable in the last half hour as she remembers certain bits of information. Listening to her we get a pretty full sense of the mania of the last days  she recounts the story of a wedding going on and the party afterward with someone playing an accordion this as Russian artillery fires in the background. Then she finds a rather poignant Hitler quote when she and others knowing what Russian soldiers do to the women they catch ask for cyanide tablets and Hitler consents saying he wishes he could offer a better farewell gift. 810".

The picture merely focuses on Traudl Junge talking and recounting her years as Hitler's secretary.  It is shot on videotape an almost looks like someones home movie.  The subject is captivating enough but calling this an actual film is a real stretch.  Even a TV interview have better visuals.     In some ways this is good and almost a novel idea because it avoids the distractions that come about when too many visual 'enhancements' are thrown in.  It allows the viewer to totally focus in on what the subject is saying and allowing them to create their own mental pictures.  However the framing setting and editing all look horribly amateurish.  The editing is especially a problem.  Black frames pop up to cut from one interview segment to another and it gets distracting even a bit disconcerting.  It also hurts the flow of the picture although this seems to happen more at the beginning and by the end pretty much drops off.     Content wise the stories are interesting but really don't offer any major revelations.  Junge seems to be given free rein to talk about anything she likes in anyway that she wants with no direction.  A more crossfire type interview may have allowed it to be better structured and more of a impact. At best her stories can be described as being revealing and even slightly amusing.  If anything her portrait of Hitler is different from anyone elses. His comments towards her during her interview for the job is down right stunning and memorable.  Her accounts of his actions and reactions to things during the last weeks of the war will really surprise some people.  In fact some of it seems so weird that it is almost too hard to imagine.     Overall despite it's humble production values it still has some good elements.  Those that are interested in history and psychology should find this the most interesting.  Junge seems a very affable and unpretentious individual that displays some amazingly good insight.  Her accounts of the final days of the war are the most vivid and captivating part of this picture.  The only thing that is missing is a little more on Junge the person especially with her adjustments after the war ended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite possibly the most minimal movie ever made. Except for the opening and closing credits all we ever see is an elderly woman in closeup apparently in her own home talking past the camera to an unseen interviewer. He's only heard a few times. He seems completely superfluous. The interview segments are punctuated with brief blackouts.There's no score. No film cutaways or slow Ken Burnsstyle pans over countless still images of the Third Reich. She just talks for an hour and a half in her native German so much of my attention was focused on the subtitles. A few segments show her watching her own interview and making additional comments.After watching Blind Spot I found on Youtube a much earlier interview in which she speaks in English. Judging from her apparent age it looks to have been made circa 1970 probably for the British World at War series. She recounts many things in much the same way in both interviews so it's obvious she's spent much of her adult life reliving the events she's talking about and pondering her own role in them. She doesn't need much prompting.Because of the minimal production values and the subtitles I felt more like I was reading a book than watching a movie. But this was a very good book that really engaged my imagination. I'd seen the movie Downfall based in large part on her recollections but her own verbal imagery would have been vivid enough.When Downfall came out there was a lot of hand wringing about how it humanized Hitler some from people I thought knew better. Similar criticisms have been leveled at Frau Junge but they completely miss the point. Accuracy is what matters in a historical account and I have no reason to doubt hers. Whether we want to admit it or not Hitler was a fully human being. He wasn't a highly evolved space alien or a demon from hell with supernatural powers who took human form to enslave mankind from the outside. He was one of us. We have to deal with that.As Junge explains so well Hitler actually had many positive personal attributes. At one time it was her job to open his personal mail so she saw the letters he received from the countless women who absolutely swooned over him. And the only time I doubted her veracity was when she claimed not to understand why. Her own story  that she so readily agreed to become one of his secretaries  shows that she understood his attraction all too well. Not just to women but to Germans in general.And that's precisely the point! We don't want to believe that Hitler was anything like us normal people. We don't want to believe that a man who caused so much destruction and suffering could have any redeeming qualities at all much less be perceived as highly attractive. We're much more comfortable putting him on a shelf and labeling him as something unique and different an inhuman monster quite apart from us ordinary people. We do the same with the German people of that era. Unlike us noble Americans with our humanitarianism and respect for personal freedoms and rights the Germans of 19331945 were stupid gullible unthinking automatons blind to the obvious evil of their leaders. Why that could never happen to us!It damn well COULD happen to us. That's why Frau Junge's story is so important. Watch this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some spoilers in the review below only read it if you are already knowledgable about the testimony Traudl Junge has given in other sources.The subject of this film Traudl Junge died as the film was first being released.  She spent her life feeling guilt over a job she took when she was very young which entailed nothing but typing a man's personal correspondence.  This man was Adolf Hitler.As I went to see this film people in the theatre were discussing the fact that a certain organization was trying to ban the film because it humanized Hitler.  I don't see why people feel he must be turned into some sort of alien life form.  He was just a man who happened to have the power to affect millions of people.  Unfortunately he did not handle that power well and the results were tragic.There is no fancy camera work here we look at Frau Junge's face for the entire film as she simply talks.  Sometimes she is shown watching herself on video and reacting to her own words.  In the beginning she was looking through a brownwithage book with handwritten notes but it was never explained what that book was.If you've done a lot of reading about Hitler you have probably already heard most of the stories Frau Junge tells in this film...How he miraculously survived an assassination attempt how Hennriette Von Shirach crticized the treatment of Jews in Holland how Eva Braun finally got married to Hitler and made a mistake when signing her marriage license. But hearing these stories from a first hand source with voice inflection and facial expression is so much more moving than reading them in a book.  I had long known that Hitler's dog Blondi was killed so that Hitler could test the poison he would use to end his own life.  The dry facts give way to emotion when you hear this story minutes after Frau Junge imitates the sweet voice Hitler used to coax Blondi to perform tricks and describes how her Boss sat forlornly in the hallway holding a puppy knowing that all hope was lost.There are also a few little gems a few little details that I have not seen in print including a moment when Joseph Goebbels was shedding tears.Frau Junge has obviously told these stories many times over the years. But her memories are still painful for her in this documentary.  I thank the late Frau Junge for getting in front of the camera and sharing her stories one last time.".

Junge was no stranger to interviews and the camera.  In fact this articulate woman appeared in several documentaries long before this minimalist film in which she is the only person on screen and in fact is the sole speaker except for a few questions posed by an offscreen interlocutor.Because of her typing skills she was offered the position of working directly for Hitler by the fuehrer himself.  This brought her into close indeed daily proximity with highranking Nazis as well as characters such as Eva Braun and the family members and hangerson of the regime. Junge herself maintains that she was apolitical and viewed the job offer as an exciting opportunity not a chance to serve the Party or its ideology.Junge frequently refers to Hitler as a criminal and ponders her own involvement and whether she is guilty of anything because of her association.  She maintains she knew nothing about the extermination camps and remarks that Jews were rarely referred to in any context at Hitler's headquarters.  Some have feared that her comments clearly not disingenuous will fuel revisionist Holocaust deniers in their sick quest to absolve Hitler and the Nazis.  In fact however many other accounts have long supported Junge's statements that the fervent antiSemitism of the Nazis wasn't on display for those visiting or working with Hitler. She recalls that one woman visitor asked Hitler about the cruel packing of Jews into trains for deportation and he angrily told her basically to mind her own business.  She was never invited to his headquarters again. The onetime secretary admits she initially much admired Hitler who often addressed her and the other female office workers as my child mein kind.  She describes his manner as gentle and very different from the filmed rally and Reichstag harangues all today have seen.  In fact Junge never attended any of the military conferences held near where she worked where Hitler's histrionic displays were always on offer and where his screaming berating of generals was routine.Junge was present on 20 July when the attempt on Hitler's life failed and she saw him in tattered clothes shortly after the bomb explosion.  Her closest association with the Third Reich's leader came during the final days when the Red Army slowly encircled and then took Berlin.  Her description of life in the bunker and Hitler's slow slide into defeatism  is neither new nor analytical  there are many other accounts of Hitler and his entourage in the bunker.  But she speaks with a clear memory cogently and not unemotionally.Junge is strong voiced and clearminded and she betrays little deep emotion. The one point where she loses her composure is as she describes getting food for propaganda minister Goebbel's six little girls the oldest only ten while their parents prepared to murder them in the belief they would have no worthwhile life after the Nazi defeat.  A microcosm of Nazi madness the killing of these six innocent children has always disturbed me.Directors Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer employed a wholly minimalist approach.  Their subject occupies the screen entirely during the interviews which spanned a number of sessions.  They decided correctly in my view to let her narrative totally dominate where many documentarians would have interweaved film illustrating the events she experienced.  This approach may bore some but listening to Junge for eightyplus minutes actually is a very absorbing and intense experience.A book containing Junge's reminiscences has just been published.Students of Nazism and the war won't learn anything new here but Junge's testament as a witness to Hitler in his headquarters is a valuable insight.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found two things most interesting about this film. The first is that as Hitler's personal secretary and scribe Traudl Junge had a particular proximity to the words and sentences that Hitler said. She had to carefully dictate each word. As such she was able to closely examine his words and was able to realize that behind the passion and intensity underneath the confidence and mania about German Third Reich supremacy The Fuhrer talked a lot of nonsense. A lot of his sentences were contradictory and made little coherent sense. That is what makes this particular subject Ms. Junge so interesting she was a lot closer to the man's speeches than most of Germany. The other interesting thing was realizing how so much of Hitler's success was due to people being intrinsically thrilled and attracted to his passion and excitement regardless of whether he had any true sensible vision of victory or he was simply a raving megalomaniacal lunatic. Hitler made people feel good feel confident feel like they were part of something grand and meaningful which thwarted their insecurity and low self esteem that arose out of the humiliating treaty following the end of WWI. And nothing is more desirable than feeling good feeling high feeling like part of something wonderful even if it means that millions are butchered in the process.".

Hitler made people feel good feel confident feel like they were part of something grand and meaningful which thwarted their insecurity and low self esteem that arose out of the humiliating treaty following the end of WWI. And nothing is more desirable than feeling good feeling high feeling like part of something wonderful even if it means that millions are butchered in the process.";

It is inconceivable how much would be lost to us if this important witness of history had not been interviewed.Although 90 per cent of the time there is nothing to see on the screen except Traudl Junge's face the film is more thrilling than most socalled thrillers I kept staring at the screen 90 minutes throughout. Not only because what Junge said was so unbelievable and I had never heard anything similar before but also because this woman was a genius in telling stories. She was able to remember and to talk. Old people can be wonderful storytellers.On the one hand the stories Junge tells speaking of Hitler as having the appearance of a friendly elder gentleman etc will not change history. They will not change the common view on Adolf Hitler and above all they will not change anything about the fact that Hitler was a terrible criminal who killed lots of people for low reasons. But on the other hand there would be a huge hole in history if no one had told us these stories. It is okay to know and to believe that Hitler was kind to his personnel his girlfriend and his dog. It is even necessary for understanding the whole dimension of what he did. Without these insights into Hitler's everyday life one might think that the Holocaust was committed by some virtual monster. In fact it was not a monster but a human being. This makes it in my opinion even more terrible and disturbing.".

All they did was tape one maybe two sessions with Junge slap some titles on it and call it a film.  Not to mention the filmmakers also try to take credit by calling it the first time Junge went on record when in reality she gave a much better account on record in the 1970's!

None of the tricks generally employed by documentary film makers are used. You never hear the questions of the interviewer there are no cutaways designed to give the illusion of continuity. Every natural break point is clearly indicated with a simple dissolve to black. This unusual technique is what gives this film its authenticity. The subject matter is too important for art to interfere. There is no need for extraneous cover footage or clever illusions. This is an historic document that will survive the test of time. There is no attempt to cover the fact that the film is made up from several interview sessions. There is no attempt to mask the subject's occasional forgetfulness or backtracking. Traudl Junge's remarkable narrative taught me more about the psychology of Adolf Hitler than the dozen books and scores of movies I have read or seen on this subject over the past 50 years.This is a stunning work  all the more brilliant for its honesty and adherence to journalistic integrity. One never gets the feeling that you are being pushed toward a particular point of view. Here is a woman who worked closely alongside a tyrant and  much to her later shame  admits to liking the man. We too are left to wonder how we might have responded if placed in a similar position. Traudl Junge does not attempt to white wash her own failure to perceive who and what Hitler really was. She recognizes her weakness and freely admits it.".

In his mind it was the ideal of the Superman that he was striving for. As far as political and military situations Junge claims not to have known much. She was in a sense shielded from the outside world as she and the other secretaries worked at first in Berlin the Berghof in Berchtesgaden at Wolfsschanze in East Prussia and lastly back in Berlin in the Fhrerbunker. They often switched off having lunch and tea with him  Hitler apparently wearied of dealing with war conversation with his officers. Her description of the last days is amazing  the bombs going off around them a wedding taking place in the bunker and everyone getting cyanide capsules. The secretaries asked for them because as Trudi said what would the world be without the National Socialism? The picture Hitler painted was bleak it would be horrible. Being out in the world Trudi realized that Hitler was 100 percent wrong and as she learned more about the goingson during the war she began to feel guilty that she had not done more investigation to find out what was really going on and guilt that she had liked such a monster. I have only one statement about that. If she didn't know he was a monster originally when he tested the cyanide on his beloved dog he certainly revealed himself. She was moved to tears talking about the Goebbels children who were going to be poisoned. For everyone suicide seemed the only way out. He had no respect for any life.Traudi and a lot of Germans had a blind spot  the title of this documentary  as to what was going on. I know for myself at Traudi's age one tends to not go into things as deeply as one should and to be oblivious to certain obvious matters. And as one ages like Traudi you being to remember those matters your own behavior and feel guilty. So what she felt to me was entirely normal.However if you lived near Jews and saw them taken away where did you think they'd gone? Many Germans hid their heads in the sand. The banality of evil.A truly excellent interview but despite the claims it wasn't the first time Traudi spoke publicly.

Every normal human eye has a certain point called in German the Der Tote Winkel or dead corner where no image registers and it is this blind spot which Ms. Junge invokes as the metaphor for her own inability to see the incredible evil of the infamous man she was in daily contact with for two and a half years perceiving him only as a kindly gentlemen and sympathetic employer while all the time feeling herself privileged to be working for such a great man.What is striking in the film is the vividness of her memory her near total recall and total refusal to gild the lily or make excuses for the fact that she was entirely taken in by Hitler's personal charisma.Among details she reveals are many which we would perhaps prefer not to believe  In person Hitler was a man full of warm Austrian charm softspoken polite and very considerate to the female members on his staff. He employed cute Austrian colloquialisms like 'nimmermehr' and never rolled his Rs stridently in private as he did in his public speeches. He was a strict vegetarian and didn't smoke or use alcohol and in general presented a healthy wellgroomed appearance. Most of the dictation Ms. Junge took was personal including answers to love letters from Hitler's hordes of female admirers! Politics were never discussed in her presence and the word Jude Jew was never mentioned.She was with Hitler at his Wolf's Lair HQ in East Prussia at the time of the failed assassination attempt on July 20 1944. When Hitler miraculously escaped with only minor lesions from a bomb blast during a strategy conference at the lair. Traudl was greatly relieved for he had by this time become a complete father figure to her.Convinced that the war was already lost and that Hitler was only leading them on to destruction a group of his own officers hatched the plot and planted the bomb. The miracle was that the meeting was transferred at the last minute from a concrete bunker where everyone in the room would have been killed to a flimsy wooden barracks where the force of the explosion was dissipated. Moreover the bomb was hastily placed under a heavy wooden table which further shielded Hitler from its effect. Instead of realizing that things were now going haywire Hitler took this as a sign that he was under divine protection and was more convinced than ever of ultimate victory. It was at this point observes Junge that Hitler began to lose his grip on reality. He no longer had his feet on solid ground is the way she puts it.The last third of the film is an hourbyhour account of the mounting despair in the bunker as the Russians approach and all hope of escape evaporates. Watching this lovable elderly woman reliving the ghastly experience she went through 56 years before as though it were yesterday becomes a hypnotic ordeal for the viewer. The German audience I watched it with was totally entranced to put it mildly. Breathless pindrop silence all the way.Finally Hitler announces he is going to shoot himself and asks Eva Braun to leave but she insists on staying with him to the bitter end. He calls in a magistrate and officially marries her on the eve of destruction. She proudly walks before all remaining members of Hitler's entourage and says Now you can call me Frau Hitler. Until then she had been addressed as Fraulein Braun.Cyanide capsules are distributed to all those who choose to remain but Hitler has now become so paranoid that he doesn't even trust the poison  thinking someone might try to drug him and deliver him to the allies  so he tests it out on his beloved canine Goldie. The dog dies immediately as the smell of bitter almonds fills the room. The atmosphere has now become surrealistic but a semblance of life goes on as the topic of conversation turns to the most effective and painless ways of committing suicide. To illustrate the changed atmosphere Junge points out that people for the very first time began to smoke in the fhrer's presence. After Mme. Goebbels poisons her six children to save them from the shame of growing up in postNazi Germany Trudl's love for father Hitler suddenly turns to hate and she wanders out of the bunker into the hell fire of the final day. Immediately after the nightmare of the bunker she was briefly interned by the Americans but released when it was determined that she had no political leanings whatsoever.Heller does not embellish the film with archival footage which only serves to make the confessional monologue even more powerful. What she is talking about is in itself so monumental it needs no embellishment. The only device he employs is to show Ms.Junge watching previously recorded segments of her interviews which sets off additional commentary on her own original comments but this effect is sparingly used and does not detract.This is a mindboggling story told by a magnificent old woman. Sadly two days after the world premiere here in Berlin of IM TOTEN WINKEL Traudl Junge terminally ill with cancer died in hospital at age 82  the very last eyewitness to the incredible last years and last days of Adolph Hitler. We can only hope that she died finally at peace with herself. ALEX BERLIN FEB 17 2002".

	schema:headline " BOND Plan B renew Connery remake Thunderball";
	schema:reviewBody "MASTER PLAN blackmail the world after stealing two nuclear warheads. Haven't we heard this plan before? Yes in Thunderball65. And wow two Bond films in the same year the other was Octopussy  what can it mean? This is now a curiosity in the Bond film series and not a part of the canon series an anomaly an oddity a film stemming from the reallife battles between Eon Productions and their nemesis producer McClory who won rights to remake the earlier film. It probably would have been better if he'd succeeded earlier  say around 1976 or so as it is Connery who managed to equal Roger Moore's number of Bond portrayals with this film is a full dozen years older since his previous Bonder Diamonds Are Forever and it shows. This isn't really a parody like Casino Royale from 1967 though there are some toocute moments right up to the conclusion a freezeframe of Bond winking at us. There are also elements of a weird restart such as the first scene with Bond and M who mentions he is new to the position much like the Bond  female M scene in GoldenEye. In this version M Fox is still male though he's a stuffy highstrung bureaucrat opposed to double0 agents and looks a bit younger than Bond. This is a bit strange to take in just on its own. Q is played by one of the best British actors McCowen so his scenes have a nice flair though he has a silly name Algernon.There's no teaser sequence or fancy credits such as we're used to  in fact the beginning is so mundane it's as if we're watching a typically substandard seventies thriller with a wretched song and an awful score. Many of the early scenes are perfunctory in other words they're presented as the stuff we're used to seeing in a Bond film Bond shoots bad guys Bond is eyed by the ladies Bond is menaced by sharks but without the style and panache of the regular film series. As in Thunderball Bond is sent to a health spa early in the film. In an early action scene he's attacked by a brawny assassinhenchman in the 'OddjobJaws' mold who seems unstoppable and things appear to be picking up until he's stopped by a silly gag. I admit I did laugh when I saw this in the theater way back when  but I don't nowadays. I also get the impression of a conspiracy by the producer to throw in some banal stuff amid the standard spy action not helped any by what seems like injoking involving Bond's aging hero bit including M's comically shrill disapproval. It mirrors the problem with Moore in his last couple of Bonders where the audience is laughing at the hero  undesirable conditions for a Bonder. Things seem to improve again in the middle half as much of the action here is dominated by the female villain Blush actress Carrera in her best role. She exults in her performance as the persistent killer with some odd sexual preoccupations anticipating the much later lethal ladies such as Onatopp in GoldenEye. But the best performance is by Brandauer as the main villain Largo  a much different Largo than the one in Thunderball. He's almost on another superior level from the rest of the cast suggesting insanity better than most other Bond villains somewhat effeminate in some of his gestures but also magnetic when sparring with Bond especially in their memorably electrifying video game duel a bizarre yet entrancing confrontation. Von Sydow always good has a much briefer role as famous ubervillain Blofeld staying behind the scenes for most of the movie. Basinger as Domino the Bond girl is unfortunately similar to many of the Bond girls of that period nice to look at but usually helpless and kind of an airhead though she demonstrates fear convincingly. Connery looking his age early fifties goes through the motions here but hey it's still Connery as Bond he can do this kind of thing in his sleep which he nearly does and is always watchable with that easy charisma. The pace is actually pretty good for awhile up until the climactic shootout in spite of some cheap production values. The finale underwater with Largo is murky stuff with no tension as if the filmmakers just gave up by this point and wanted to get it over with. We kind of forget what the threat is about halfanhour before the end. Oh and Atkinson is his small role is abominable like nails on chalkboard. Connery would not return.

	schema:reviewBody "The year 1983 saw a strange phenomenon two rival Bond films. Octopussy starring Roger Moore was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. Never Say Never Again made by a rival producer is apart from the awful Casino Royale the only Bond movie which does not form part of that franchise. Its big attraction was that it brought back the original Bond Sean Connery its title reputedly derived from Connery's remark after Diamonds Are Forever that he would never again play the role. Some have complained that Connery was at 53 too old for the role but he was in fact three years younger than his successor Moore who not only made Octopussy in the same year but went on to make one further Bond film A View to a Kill two years later.The film owes its existence to the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to Ian Fleming's work. It is perhaps unfortunate that the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film had to be a remake of Thunderball as that was perhaps not the greatest of the Connery Bonds. A remake of Dr No or Goldfinger might have worked better. The plot is much the same as that of the earlier film the terrorist organisation SPECTRE acting together with a megalomaniac tycoon named Largo have stolen two American nuclear warheads and are attempting to hold the world's governments to ransom by threatening to detonate them unless they receive a vast sum of money. It falls to Bond of course to save the world by tracking down the missing missiles.The film is fortunate in that it has not just one but two of the most beautiful Bond girls of all Barbara Carrera as the seductive but lethal Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo's girlfriend Domino who defects to Bond's side after learning of her lover's evil plans. A number of the Bond films have a plot that hangs upon the hero's ability to win over the villain's mistress or female accomplice there are similar developments for example in Goldfinger Live and Let Die and The Living Daylights. In the official series Bond's ally is normally regarded as the female lead but here Carrera playing the villainess is billed above Basinger who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Basinger of course has gone on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars whereas Carrera is one of a number of Bond girls who have somewhat faded from view.Of the villains Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld the head of SPECTRE but Klaus Maria Brandauer seemed too bland and nonthreatening as Largo except perhaps during the Domination game a more sophisticated variant on those violent computer games such as Space Invaders that were so popular in the early eighties. Brandauer can be an excellent actor in his native German in films such as Mephisto and Oberst Redl but he does not comes across so expressively in English.One of the film's features is that it both follows the normal Bond formula and at times departs from it. There is the standard worldinperil plot chase sequences a series of exotic locations glamorous women sinister villains and a specially written theme song based on the film's title. There is however no extended precredits sequence and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example Bond's boss M becomes a languid supercilious aristocrat his American colleague Felix Leiter is shown as black for the only time and the scientist Q is portrayed by Alec McCowen as a disillusioned cynic with despite his characteristically upperclass Christian name of Algernon a distinctly workingclass accent. There is also an amusing cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling British diplomat. Although Connery was perhaps not quite a good here as he was in some of his earlier films in the role this ringing the changes on the familiar theme makes this one of the more memorable Bonds. 710 A goof. Rowan Atkinson's character states that he is from the British Embassy in Nassau. As however the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country Britain would have a High Commission in its capital not an Embassy.".

Never say never again NSNA is one of the two unofficial 007 films made outside EON the other is the 1967 comedy spoof Casino Royale. NSNA is a remake of Thunderball and stars the original Bond Sean Connery who comes back to the role after many years of absence.The film is released some months after Octopussy with Roger Moore the 13th episode of the EON series.

Both films are a big success in 1983 even if Octopussy earns more money at the box office.NSNA is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians director Irvin Kershner who led The Empire strikes back Douglas Slocombe cinematographer of Raiders of the lost Ark and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr who wrote The three days of the Condor among others...The cast is excellent with Connery a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger Barbara Carrera Klaus Maria Brandauer Max Von Sydow Edward Fox...Although all that the film remains inferior to the original Thunderball. It lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real Bond movie there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence there's not the James Bond theme M and Q are not played by the traditional actors... It's a copyright reason EON only is allowed to use these elements. Briefly NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere.On the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women Basinger and Carrera are sensual and gorgeous. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He's once again wonderful in the role he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in Diamonds are forever his last performance in the role of the British superspy before NSNA.".

There are certain things one has come to expect even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10 Title NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline but is instead an injoke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case it is a catchy title. 8 points.PreCredit Teaser Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films there is no Teaser the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing yet another ohno Bond has been killed fakeout. 4 points.Opening Credits Other than a screen full of tiny 007's they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.Theme Song As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall Never Say Never Again would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme it's merely okay. 6 points.Bond James Bond Appropriately since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether BondConnery is still up to the job. Happily Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all it is one of Connery's best and most relaxed turns as the character. 9 points.Bond Babes Even in the best of the Bond films the female characters aren't given much dimension they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscarwinner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job  and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.Bond Villain The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated Blofeld is back  at least for the moment  showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. Onetime Jesus portrayerturnedstereotypical villain Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy ruthless without seeming cartoonish his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.Bond Baddies Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen Barbara Carrera breezes through the film displaying a mix of selfamused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular even by Bondian standards. 10 points.Sinister Plot As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL the film does seem a bit beentheredonethat nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multikazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.Production values The film starts out with an uneasy style like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose making it a superior adventure. 8 points. Bonus Points There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged as played by Edward Fox M is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the Double Os a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part and Q suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddybuddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film such as replacing Bond's AstinMartin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.Summary NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery villain Brandauer assassin Carrera and damselindistress Basinger. But the devil is in the details as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits theme song and such seem the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film a very good substitute but a substitute nonetheless.Bondometer Rating 78 points out of 100.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never Say Never Again got its title because Sean Connery had said in the 1970s shortly after Diamonds Are Forever that he would never do another Bond film. However in 1983 he was persuaded to return to the role for a oneoff special a remake of his fourth entry Thunderball and his wife rather humorously said to him that in the future he should make a point never to say never again. This film actually came out close to a Roger Moore entry in the series Octopussy and although Connery had more admirers as 007 than Moore it was surprisingly Octopussy that scored a bigger box office hit.Connery's Bond is older and more vulnerable than we remember him. His boss M doesn't hold him in very high regard and actually suggests that he take some time off in a plush health spa. During his time here Bond uncovers a strange plot and the further he delves into the mystery the more he discovers. It seems that his old adversaries SPECTRE fronted by the nefarious Blofeld Max Von Sydow have stolen two nuclear warheads which they will detonate if they are not paid an extortionate ransom. Chief overseer of this hideous plan is Emile Largo Klaus Maria Brandeur and Bond pursues Largo around the globe in an attempt to stop him visiting such places as Monte Carlo and North Africa during the course of the mission.The music by Michel Legrand is poor by series standards. It sounds rather similar to his music for the sleazy 1981 movie Your Ticket Is No Longer Valid and is really illsuited to this Bond production. However in terms of villains they've come with a couple of great ones for this film. Largo as personified by Brandeur is smooth but deadly and henchwoman Fatima Blush the sensual Barbara Carrera is uncommonly disturbing. Rowan Atkinson also has a fairly good role as a dimwitted agent assigned to help Bond. The big action sequences are quite good especially the horse chase around the North African seafortress and the motorbike chase although some of the underwater moments are tough to understand because it's hard to figure out who is who behind the diving masks.".

James Bond Sean Connery who shows his face cleanshaven and wearing a variety of grey and brown wigs matches wits with a nasty  goodlooking tycoon  Largo Klaus Maria Brandauer  who is holding the world nuclear hostage as part of a diabolical plan schemed by Espectre led by a sinister leader Max Von Sydow .

Later on  Bond facing off heavies and bedding a lot of pink and dust beauties Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush  Kim Basinger as Domino  Valerie Leon  among others . Will 007 prevent the killing of millions of innocent victims?Connery returns to the world of Bond after 12 years  it results to be smooth in this peculiar remake of Thunderball1965 by Terence Young with Claudine Auger  Adolfo Celi  Luciana Paluzzi . The noisy action is staged with all the mechanical efficiency of the classic Bond pictures with a bit more bite . After Diamonds are forever 1971 Sean told her he'd never play James Bond again there he was playing James Bond again  her response was for him to never say never again  however  for a big salary he accepted this film . Although Connery is back to recover two nuclear warheads stolen  purists will have qualms deeming this part of the official Bond series since longtime producers Albert Cubby Broccoli  Harry Saltzman  had nothing to do with this endeavor . This Bond film was not part of the franchise produced by these producers  but here Kevin McClory who was producer and cowriter of Thunderball 1965 won a legal battle against Ian Fleming to make his own Bond movie  the settlement stipulated that it had to effectively be a remake of Thunderball . Here James BondConnery bedding a variety of wonderful women  the bond girls are the followings  Kim Basinger as the beautiful heroine  Barbara Carrera is excellently cast as the nasty villainess and the Hammergirl Valerie Leon . BondConnery is given hot competition in the acting department by Klaus Maria Brandauer who makes Largo a stunning  memorable smiling psychotic baddie from Sprectra criminal organization  replacing prior Adolfo Celi . Being Final James Bond film to feature Spectre until recent film Spectre 2015 . Support cast is frankly magnificent as Bernie Casey  Alec McCowen  charming Pamela Salem as Miss Moneypenny  Rowan Atkinson as Embassy official  Edward Fox  Gavan O'Herlihy  Ronald Pickup and brief acting by the busty Bond girl Valerie Leon as Lady in Bahamas .Colorful cinematography by Douglas Slocombe shot on several locations in Cte d'Azur Antibes BeaulieuSurMer AlpesMaritimesFrance  Malta Nassau New Providence Island Bahamas  La Alcazaba  Almera El Ejido Almera Andalucia Spain . However  this Never say never again is hampered by an atrocious soundtrack by Michael Legrand . The motion picture was professionally directed by Irwin Kershener  but with no originality . The main theme that runs through many of his films is social alienation and human weaknesses  although his biggest commercial success was the science fiction blockbuster Star Wars Episodio V Empire strikes again and made decent sequels as Return a man called horseand Robocop II. This is an acceptable and passable Bond movie but inferior to other entries . This monarch of mayhem and luxury strides easily back into his kingdom .".

Although Connery is back to recover two nuclear warheads stolen  purists will have qualms deeming this part of the official Bond series since longtime producers Albert Cubby Broccoli  Harry Saltzman  had nothing to do with this endeavor . This Bond film was not part of the franchise produced by these producers  but here Kevin McClory who was producer and cowriter of Thunderball 1965 won a legal battle against Ian Fleming to make his own Bond movie  the settlement stipulated that it had to effectively be a remake of Thunderball . Here James BondConnery bedding a variety of wonderful women  the bond girls are the followings  Kim Basinger as the beautiful heroine  Barbara Carrera is excellently cast as the nasty villainess and the Hammergirl Valerie Leon . BondConnery is given hot competition in the acting department by Klaus Maria Brandauer who makes Largo a stunning  memorable smiling psychotic baddie from Sprectra criminal organization  replacing prior Adolfo Celi . Being Final James Bond film to feature Spectre until recent film Spectre 2015 . Support cast is frankly magnificent as Bernie Casey  Alec McCowen  charming Pamela Salem as Miss Moneypenny  Rowan Atkinson as Embassy official  Edward Fox  Gavan O'Herlihy  Ronald Pickup and brief acting by the busty Bond girl Valerie Leon as Lady in Bahamas .Colorful cinematography by Douglas Slocombe shot on several locations in Cte d'Azur Antibes BeaulieuSurMer AlpesMaritimesFrance  Malta Nassau New Providence Island Bahamas  La Alcazaba  Almera El Ejido Almera Andalucia Spain . However  this Never say never again is hampered by an atrocious soundtrack by Michael Legrand . The motion picture was professionally directed by Irwin Kershener  but with no originality . The main theme that runs through many of his films is social alienation and human weaknesses  although his biggest commercial success was the science fiction blockbuster Star Wars Episodio V Empire strikes again and made decent sequels as Return a man called horseand Robocop II. This is an acceptable and passable Bond movie but inferior to other entries . This monarch of mayhem and luxury strides easily back into his kingdom .";

	schema:reviewBody "Yes it's Sean Connery playing Bond again looking more alive and into his part than any time since the first time they made this film in 1965 when it was called Thunderball. But the tongue is so firmly in cheek one wonders if Connery isn't employing a few observed tricks from his friend and more humorous successor Roger Moore.Moore is my favorite Bond but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing. The only serious Bond film not made under the aegis of the classic Eon Bond series Never Say Never Again is an irreverent return to the well. Soft on action it's nevertheless strong on character and clever dialogue.Bond it's made clear right away is a man in disfavor. No matter how many times he has saved the world his new boss thinks little of his fat lifestyle. Too many free radicals that's your problem...Caused by eating too much red meat white bread too many martinis. Then I shall cut out the white bread sir Bond smartly replies.An early fight sequence in a spa represents the movie's high point actionwise with Bond and an attacker fighting their way through a kitchen a bedroom and a laboratory before Bond finally douses his opponent ironically with no small help from those free radicals. Humor is liberally applied in the film rather more cleverly than most of Moore's outings though Connery seems to be having more fun sending himself up as a result of Moore's less egotistic example.Was it because he was making a good chunk of the gross? Or was it working for less stingy producers? Whatever it is the screenplay serves his laidback style well and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connery's prior two Eon Bond outings You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond whether it was Connery Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers video games and ugly sports cars are all in evidence and the Bianca Jagger sunglasses Klaus Maria Brandauer is seen wearing in his first scene do him no favors. Forget first impressions. Brandauer's role as the chief villain Maximilian Largo is one of the best in any Bond film with Brandauer enjoyably playing up his character's menace and mania. At one point he allows Bond free roam of his situation room with a martini to boot and his dancing eyes and mad engaging grin make for compelling company throughout.The best thing in this film other than Connery are the Bond girls shot with more attention to personality than normal in Bond films a testament to cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as the villainess Fatima Blush every bit as crazy as Largo and even nicer to look at. She doesn't last the whole movie you almost need her gone in order to focus on the others.Kim Basinger's breasts and buttocks should have had their own agents for the screen time they get in this film but I'm not complaining. Basinger's a rare beauty who in this early role as Largo's mistress mixes incredible hotitude with a childlike vulnerability that brings out the Bond in me and many others I suspect. Her lips and cheekbones are pretty sweet too.It's not a wellconstructed film. It's a knockoff of a better Bond movie with a sloppy storyline a terrible score and a flat ending. But it does have Connery proving his was the definitive take on cinema's definitive secret agent even if he steals a page or two from my 007 Mr. Moore. The end result is entertaining enough so I'm not complaining.".

SPECTRE with the help of a foolish young Air Force officer who happens to be Kim Bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now SPECTRE headed by Blofeld played here by Max Von Sydow is threatening blackmail of the world.Von Sydow's operations guy is Klaus Maria Brandauer who is also courting Bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. And he's got a female assassin working for him in Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft look like Mrs. Butterworth.But before Sean Connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'M' running things at British Intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really did enjoy Fox's performance he's like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp.I also enjoyed Carrera she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she's scuba diving with Connery in the Bahamas note how she puts Mr. Shark on 007's case.Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never Say Never Again as everyone knows by now was the second Bond film to be released in 1983 and was nearly as big a hit as Octopussy was that film was still playing in some theaters when Never Say Never Again was released. Lacking the distinctive gunbarrel opening and famous Bond theme among other distinctive features of the EON franchise films this lacks not only the feel of the EON Bond series but of Fleming's work leaving a seriously bloated mess of an American action thriller which happens to feature Bond as the lead character. Why? That's the first question anybody should be asking about this film. A cynic which I probably qualify as would say 'for the cash' others might say it was just to get Connery back as Bond and give him a proper goodbye. Some might say it was in retaliation to the direction the Moore films were headed in although For Your Eyes Only is a far superior and far less bloated film than this so that argument doesn't quite work.Of course there's a lot to dislike here. Connery has moments of inspiration where he slips right back into character but for most of the film he just looks really old and slightly ridiculous which fits the plot but doesn't make his performance any less tired. Still I'd argue that this is a better sendoff for him as Bond than Diamonds are Forever. Kim Basinger is a terrible Bond girl and as much as I like Rowan Atkinson he shouldn't be anywhere near a Bond film. In addition the villains here fall flat as well. That said Never Say Never Again is not a film I can hate even if I wanted to and I never want to hate anything simply because little of it comes off as especially bad yet all of it comes off as flat bland and uninspired and far far too American for a Bond film. It's just sort of... there being the bloated overlong but not terrible film it is. I don't count it as a 'Bond film' as it doesn't feel remotely like one but even just as an action thriller it doesn't quite work.510".

I guess what disappointed me was the ending. After investing two hours into the film you expect a lesshokey more satisfying ending. And it may be nitpicking but I was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as Miss Moneypenny Q Felix Leiter etc.On the positive side there was plenty of unique action scenes particularly early on and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so lowkey and looked the nice guy next door. He wasn't your normal Bond villain.This had plenty of skin for a PG movie especially with Kim Basinger starring never being an actress known for hiding her figure. The language was very tame but most Bond movies are pretty good in that department.All in all it's a fair Bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it it doesn't mean it's automatically good.

Enticing Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play Bond again. Connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. The script is outstanding as are the photography and the performances. It's the earliest movie I recall with Kim Basinger who became much more famous after this film Barbara Carrera was excellent and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to the aging of Bond and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets equaled those of the other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme which of course could not be used by this competing production. It was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent James Bond movies released in the same year this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80's were the first heyday of such things and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie. The film is actually a different version of Thunderball updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repeated theme there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining. I will watch this one frequently.".

Well the cast is very very interesting Maria Brandauer is a great Bond villain Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the original Bond girls plus Rowan Atkinson and a truly great Edward Fox who looks really refreshing in the M role. In fact the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. Sean Connery does it once more confident and charming except that he looks a little bit too old. But alright he is the original Bond and it was great to see him once more in this role. The locations are also typical Bahamas France etc. The only thing that really fails is the music score the song Never say never again is O.K. but the theme song is just missing. All in one a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly Roger Moore movies like Moonraker. Only if there was another story Thunderball was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake".

	schema:reviewBody "As the '70's drew to a close rumours began to fly in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he had made famous back in 1962  James Bond. Cubby Broccoli was asked on location in Brazil during the making of 'Moonraker' by the B.B.C.'s Barry Norman how he viewed the prospect. Understandably the producer was reluctant to voice an opinion. 'Moonraker' outraged fans with what they perceived to be a cheapening of the character and the jumping onto the 'Star Wars' bandwagon much as 'Live  Let Die' had done with the blaxploitation craze a few years earlier. Many publicly hoped Connery would return if only to show Eon how a real Bond movie should look. Years of legal battles followed. The original script entitled 'James Bond Of The Secret Service'  later changed to 'Warhead'  by Kevin McClory Len Deighton and Connery involved the infamous Bermuda Triangle and a climactic battle in the Statue of Liberty but was never filmed. A new script closer to the 'Thunderball' storyline came from Lorenzo Semple Junior responsible for Adam West's 'Batman' and coauthor of 'The Parallax View' one of the decade's finest conspiracy thrillers. Feeling it needed a British touch Connery brought in Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais writers of hit British sitcoms 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'. The witty title was suggested by Connery's wife Micheline. 'Never Say Never Again' features Connery as an older wearier Bond reduced to a teaching post in Her Majesty's Secret Service. When he fumbles a training exercise in South America M  Edward Fox  sends him to Shrublands to get back into shape. But SPECTRE agents Fatima Blush  Barbara Carrera  and Lippe  Pat Roach  are there too. U.S. Captain Jack Pettachi  Gavan O'Herlihy  is recovering from surgery that has turned his retina into a copy of the American President's. The reason? To enable SPECTRE to steal two nuclear warheads and hold the entire world to ransom...The film opened before Christmas 1983 to unanimous critical praise some used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series particularly that year's 'Octopussy'. Directed by Irwin Kershner 'Never' lacks the excitement and spectacle one associates with Bond at times it looks and feels like a T.V. movie. 'Thunderball'  1965  is superior in every respect. 'Never' was also hampered by the lack of Monty Norman's 'James Bond Theme' and Maurice Binder's gunbarrel logo. Connery though is magnificent effortlessly stepping back into his most famous role. Hearing him deliver the oneliners is a joy. Barbara Carrera is terrific as 'Fatima' a snakeloving lady whose love for murder is such she dances after  so she thinks  killing Bond. Kim Basinger smolders as 'Domino'. As 'Maximillian Largo' Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a chilling believable performance. Alec McCowen manages to create a 'Q' every bit as likable as Desmond Llewelyn's betterknown version. Pamela Salem looks good as 'Moneypenny' but is underused. A major disappointment though is Max Von Sydow as 'Blofeld'. The posters gave the impression he would be a major character but in fact he appears only in a few scenes. With a stronger script he could have been one of the alltime great Bond villains. 'Never' promised to revert to the crunchy style of the early Eon Bonds but did not deliver. The gadgets were there but used almost apologetically such as Bond's rocketfiring motorcycle. The traditional baccarat duel is replaced by a very '80's computer game called 'Domination'. There was also an unwise attempt to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of juvenile humour ie. Bond saving himself by throwing his own urine sample into an assassin's face. But the nadir comes with Rowan Atkinson's bumbling Foreign Office official 'Nigel SmallFawcett'. He is so awful you wonder if he thought he was in a Footlights revue. Another flaw is the lack of a decent score. Instead of John Barry we have to make do with Michel Legrand whose score is absolutely hopeless. He seems to never to have seen a Bond film in his life. Though the film was a financial success Connery himself was disappointed and not did act again for some years. 1983 was a good year for 007 maniacs  in addition to the Connery and Moore movies George Lazenby did a delightful cameo in the madeforT.V. 'Return Of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. The Fifteen Years Later Affair'.".

Now when I first saw this film I was much younger and probably didn't notice most of it's faults because it had Sean Connery it must be good But now I've watched it a 3rd time I now realise Never Say Never Again is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. I couldn't possibly watch it in one sitting as I'd be on the brink of suicide by the final scene.Yes there are some highlights the opening sequence is exciting but it is ruined by the horrendous theme tune that's played over the top of it. There is also an abundance of good dialogue Fatima Oh I got you all wet Bond Yes but my martini's still dry and some interesting locations but they are sadly wasted. Bond visits two of the most beautiful locations in the world The Bahamas and the French Riviera and yet we see about 60 seconds of them onscreen before he's shipped off to somewhere else.For most of the film there is hardly any reference to the actual plot the stolen nuclear devices at all it seems as if Bond treats his 'mission' as a holiday where he can bed as many women as possible 4 on this occasion. The action sequences are incredibly boring and predicable and the underwater shots lack any imagination or flair. Its hard to believe that this was directed by Irvin Kershner who was responsible for the superb 'Empire Strikes Back'.As for the characters if you can call them that they are probably the most boring and 1dimensional of any bond film. The villain is almost nonexistent Kim Basinger is the most useless Bond girl to date including Mary goodnight and serves no purpose in the story at all. The attempt at a femme fatale Fatima Blush is also truly dire. An awful character played by an equally awful actress the adolescent producers obviously think they can make her 'sexy' by having her keep snakes in her car heroin needles in her garter and have her prance about in leather trousers and nurse's outfits whilst cackling like an old hag.NSNA looks terribly dated and it is only 23 years old. The set pieces are poorlythought out and look cheap probably because most of the films budget was spent on getting Connery back The majority of the script is dull and clichd and the entire film looks like it was edited in about 5 minutes. And when the film finally reaches a climax it refuses to end. There is still about another 20 minutes of tedium before it slowly comes to a halt. An incredibly boring and pointless film even the worst movies in the official series golden gun and die another day are more entertaining than this. It's no surprise Sean Connery refuses to watch the Bond films this wasn't exactly a highpoint in his career.".

I've never liked the washed out picture all powerful sunlight and 80s pastel costume design. But there's good stuff too. There's Michel Legrand's score the opening song has to substitute for the copyright pretitle sequence. There's prehyperbole Kim Basinger. There's Barbara Carrera dressed as a nurse  the sort of nurse you'd find in a Camden nightclub. Above all there's the pungently nasty Spectre field operative of Klaus Maria Brandauer.

There's Michel Legrand's score the opening song has to substitute for the copyright pretitle sequence. There's prehyperbole Kim Basinger. There's Barbara Carrera dressed as a nurse  the sort of nurse you'd find in a Camden nightclub. Above all there's the pungently nasty Spectre field operative of Klaus Maria Brandauer.

It had a great impact on my life and how i judge movies to this day. There are many great things about this movie which i have seen probably 50 times. One great things about it is the beautiful cinematography. The movie is mostly shot in the Bahamas and the shots are very pretty. The movie relies mostly on dialog and situational entertainment. This movie has a beautiful laid back nature to it. From the beginning when Bond is at the health spa to later when he is diving in tropic waters and then at the end when he is sitting back in a hot tub with the beautiful Domino who is played by Kim Basinger. The acting by the main villain Largo was superb even by real acting standards. This character is a real life person unlike the modern Bond villains that are totally unbelievable. He plays the role of the psychotic entrepreneur very well and his performance is definitely worth watching. This movie was mostly realistic and that is why it is so great.This was Sean Connery's last James Bond film which gives it a special kind of appeal. I felt like Connery was in fantastic shape for his age and played his role to the hilt. The plot is a remake of the movie ThunderBall yet i think they made an even better movie this time around.Sit back with your beverage of choice and watch this movie with your wife or girlfriend as it is not overly violent and the movie is entertaining enough to keep anyone interested.This is my favorite Bond film and i give it 10 stars!".

The music drags the mood down and that's an error of commissioning a composer not of the composer. The computer game sequence is a lame attempt to put the thenphenomenon of computer graphics into a serious context. But the audience isn't playing the game so they can't feel the player's drama. The list of such defects is too long.I wanted this to be just a satisfactory film if it couldn't be a good film. A lot of Bond films are flawed particularly Moore's of that era so there's a lot of give and take available.

	schema:reviewBody "In the twelve years he was away from 007 Sean Connery lost little of his appeal. Even deep into Roger Moore's respectable run as the glamorized spy it is tempting to argue that Connery's Never Say Never Again not Moore's Octopussy was the Bond movie to see in 1983. After all it features not only the quintessential Bond in Connery but also legitimate movie stars in Kim Basinger and Max von Sydow. And thanks to a decadeslong legal dispute it's a remake of Thunderball one of the meatier early Bond films whereas Octopussy is scraped from a short story collection near the bottom of the barrel of the almostexhausted Ian Fleming library. But as it turns out good actors and good source material do not a good 007 movie make and Octopussy not Never Say Never Again was the better Bond in 1983. What the former has that the latter lacks is the trademarked trappings that make Bond Bond regardless of actor regardless of time period regardless of quality. The gun barrel logo that opens almost every film in the official series the jangly guitar riff theme a Maurice Binder credit sequence Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewellyn as Q two fixtures and fan favorites who have proved hard to replace since their retirements and deaths. Never Say Never Again has to try to fill these shoes and inevitably falls short. It seems not even to have tried to replace the theme song and it opts against a title sequence. It has a title song but this stacks up poorly even against the forgettable and indecencyfree song from Octopussy. Even with Connery in the starring role Never Say Never Again never feels like a real Bond movie. It feels like what it is a knockoff. Not a cheap one its budget actually surpassed Octopussy's in part due to Connery's salary and reported production problems but with less bang for the buck. Its vehicles and gadgets are fewer and less imaginative its sets smaller. It tries much harder than Octopussy to be current with its prominent use of 80s arcade games and 80s aerobics outfits and constant references to the passing of time and the aging of Connery while Octopussy trades in nostalgia for colonial India traveling circuses and trains. There is perhaps a lesson here for the latterday revisionist relaunched Bond movies Bond is a throwback hero and works better in throwback settings than when he is shoehorned into the present. Never Say Never Again is not as relentlessly stupid as some of the worst official Bond films but it's not smart or entertaining enough to be a good standalone action movie in its own right. It has to be judged as a Bond movie and Bond movies have to be judged by their own peculiar standards. Octopussy checks the Bond movie boxes and Never Say Never Again being legally barred from so many of those boxes is neither a convincing facsimile nor an attempt to forge new benchmarks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following the rape and murder of a colonial family outlaw brothers Charlie and Mikey burns are captured by ruthless local lawman Captain Stanley. Rather than imprison both fugitives Stanley presents Charlie with a proposition though it's really a demand that Charlie kill his older brother and gang leader Arthur or else Mikey will meet his demise at the end of a hangman's noose. It is a proposition which will have karmic repercussions for all involved.Directed by Brisbanite John Hillcoate from a script by Aussie indie icon Nick Cave this film has some of the most gorgeous photography of the Australian outback ever committed to film showcasing it's unique desolate beauty in it's dust flies and exquisite sunsets.Hillcoate assembles a very fine ensemble cast most notably Ray Winstone as Captain Stanley and Guy Pearce as Charlie Burns  two actors performing at the top of their game. Danny Huston is effective as Arthur Burns a man whose serene exterior belies his vicious temperament. Other performers include Emily Watson and John Hurt as well as fine Australian talent David Wenham Leah Purcell Tommy Lewis and quintessential movie aborigine David Gulpilil. All performances are excellent.Despite it's high violence quotient the film has an admirable lack of moralistic tone. There are no obvious good guys and bad guys all the characters are shades of grey possessing both positive and negative attributes although some characters may lean one way or the other. In particular Captain Stanley has a good heart though history may judge his methods of justice with contempt and Charlie Burns has a fierce sense of loyalty and honour but his associated family ties have led him to commit horrific crimes. Even Captain Stanley's wife Martha in all her Victorian innocence and naivety has a dark side to her soul an attribute which will further propel all towards their destinies.It's strong subtext of white colonialists' condescending treatment of the aboriginal population puts this film in fine company with other Australian indigenousthemed films such as Fred Schepisi's The Chant Of Jimmy Blacksmith Nicholas Roeg's Walkabout Rolf de Heer's The Tracker and Phillip Noyce's Rabbit Proof Fence. The Proposition is the best of these. This is a big call I know but the fact is that none of those other very fine Australian films possess the tension which so completely permeates Hillcoates' picture. This film represents a major achievement for both Hillcoate and Cave and is the best Australian film to leave these shores since Ray Lawrence's Lantana.8.5 out of 10.Slick. cool".

Perhaps the sadistic violence gets a bit over the top especially towards the end but thanks to a fine cast crisp direction and the scorched cinematography it generally works. A standout performance in a minor role by John Hurt rather steals the show while Ray Winstone and Emily Watson are particularly sensitive together.

There's a fantastic blend of European and Australian sensibilities here that makes this the least clichd film to come out of this country for 20odd years  and if it doesn't do well it'll be because an increasingly soft and gutless nation is afraid to venture out of their frappuccino and mortgage comfort zone. This is powerful worthy art.".

A tight disciplined script from Nick Cave that's testament to how his writing continues to reach new levels  not to mention his collaboration with Warren Ellis on the beautifully uneasy score. There's a fantastic blend of European and Australian sensibilities here that makes this the least clichd film to come out of this country for 20odd years  and if it doesn't do well it'll be because an increasingly soft and gutless nation is afraid to venture out of their frappuccino and mortgage comfort zone. This is powerful worthy art.";

	schema:reviewBody "An inspired HillcoatCave collaboration that will repulse and attract audiences in equal measure The Proposition is a lyrical enigmatic but brutal examination of the human condition set in early settler Australia. Hillcoat's stark framing and unflinching portrayal of violence is perfectly blended with Cave's multidimensional characters and atmospheric soundtrack.Captain Stanley goes after the murderous Burns brothers by setting them against each other. His proposition is that middle brother Charlie kill older brother Arthur in order to save younger brother Mike from the noose. It is expedient justice but also astute psychology on Stanley's part Charlie seems less than reluctant to take on the task of dispensing with his charismatic but psychotic older sibling.Stanley's mantra is that he will civilize this land but his failing is in choosing the wrong target. His treacherous sergeant feeble superior and uptight wife together conspire through ignorance and fear to undo the Captain's intent. When Mike is flogged beyond reason and physical endurance the Captain's moral argument is won but perhaps at the price of all their lives as the Burns brothers come seeking vengeance.Pearce adds impressively to his CV in an understated but powerful performance as the brooding middle brother. Stanley is not exactly a good guy but as much on the side of good as it is possible to be in this Godforsaken landscape. It has taken a while to get used to Winstone in such roles starting with Sexy beast but he is wearing them with aplomb now. Danny Huston is a pleasant surprise as the educated but deranged Arthur while John Hurt revels in playing against type. Emily Watson never less than excellent embodies the prim Victorian. My own first impression of Australia was flies flies flies and Hillcoat captures this. The question is not why there are so many flies in this film but why they are curiously absent from other Australian films. They are both a metaphor for the squalor and decay that infest existence and an acutely observed detail of the arena.Before the British other Europeans famously arrived in Australia but considered the landscape uninhabitable. Threaded through The Proposition is the suggestion that they were right.The broader reference is the existence of our dark side embodied in Arthur a Kurtzlike figure a godlike presence in an inhospitable landscape facing an assassin dispatched from a 'civilization' that does not like what he reminds them of. The film references Conrad's infamous tale but anchors it in this universal tale of white men's illfated attempts to conquer a land where they do not belong. The aborigines tolerate them or despair of them. Strange you whities says Jacko while house servant Tobey shows his role as subservient ends at the garden gate where he leaves his boots and returns to his barefoot roots. Two Bob simply abandons his white mates at the end. Like the land their attitudes to these invaders range from indifferent to hostile.The Proposition is less poetic violence than violent poetry. Too much to take in here in one viewing in time to come this might just match Walkabout as the masterpiece of Australiaset cinema.".

	schema:headline " The narrative may be weak but there is much to make up for it in this hauntingly beautiful and bleak film";
	schema:reviewBody "Australia is a country in the throws of settlement by the English and lawlessness is rife. As the bloody clearing of aborigines continues one gang's attack on a white family causes outrage. The pressure is on Captain Stanley to bring in the Burns gang led by the sadistic and heartless Arthur. When Stanley's men capture the two younger brothers he strikes a deal with Charlie the elder of the two. In nine days time on Christmas Day young Mike will hang unless Charlie has returned with his brother  dead or alive.The plot summary and the advertising seemed to offer some form of thriller but in reality the film delivers something altogether more interesting and memorable. Set in the Australia outback where settlements are being born and laws being established the film charts the moral complexities of the good and bad in the story while painting a beautifully bleak backdrop of open space and bloody pointless violence. It is not an easy film to watch and certainly not one to expect to come out of laughing or feeling good about things. Nor is it a film to go into expecting a traditional plot because it is this area where the film is at its weakest because it is not a this happened this happened then that happened sort of story. This is not to say it is boring but it does require patience for the casual viewer. Personally I found most scenes to be interesting but most admit that the narrative kind of hangs around rather than moving forward firmly in one direction.The substance is more in the characters than in the narrative and on this level it was engaging. Although the posters and summary will tell you this is about the Burns brothers it is as much if not more about Stanley and his wife. It is he would has the duality of trying to defeat violence by encouraging it while also heaving under the burden of trying to take this job entirely on his own shoulders while protecting his wife from knowing anything about the real world out in the desert. It is an interesting thread and for my money it was the thrust of the story  the issue of what Charlie will do is actually part of Stanley's story rather than the other way around. With this as the story the film is much better because it does paint a convincing tale around this. The Burns brothers thread is still interesting but less is done with it  with Arthur himself being very little more than an enigmatic plot device.Style wise the film is fantastic as it delivers a bleakly convincing picture of the birth of Australia. The landscape is beautifully filmed and although Cave could have done more as writer his contribution to the soundtrack is as welcome as it is well used. The sudden moments of violence are uncomfortable and difficult to watch. They are delivered in visceral moments of gore that are bereft of any touches that would glamorise the death here it is horrible and full of flies. Of course you are right to note that a hauntingly stylish delivery should not be taken as a replacement for substance but I think it has just about enough of the latter and an abundance of the former to carry the film as a whole.The cast are mixed but nobody really turns in a bad performance. Winstone dominates the film with easily the best performance and the most interesting character. His Captain Stanley wears every decision and Winstone allows us to see the effect this country has had on his soul. Watson is also good simple at first but touched by the violence that her husband cannot defend her from. Pearce is an astute and subtle actor who keeps the audience with his thread even though it is less interesting however Huston is not used as well as he deserved. He gives a memorable performance but his character is never more than an action waiting to happen. Wilson is convincingly young and his flogging is difficult to stomach while Hurt turns up in a nice cameo as a bounty hunter. As much as the performances though the film is about atmosphere and Hillcoat has done a great job in producing a desolate film that is as beautiful as it is disheartening.An imperfect film due to the lack of a strong narrative this is still a memorable affair for many reasons. It looks great has a great use of music and produces a haunting desolation in the country and the characters. Not a fun night out by any means but for what it is it is well worth seeing.".

I too do not believe that our early settlement revolved around the gun mania of American settlement but I was not bothered by the gun culture shown in The Proposition. I kept looking for bits that did not play right and I could not find anythe film played real to me from beginning to end. Although extremely violent in those parts where violence was called for this violence did not seem out of place or overdone. I have tried to know something of our early settlement history and what I saw fitted into that mental picture well. The unimaginable violence we displayed to the Aboriginal people was masked and not really a part of what occurred in this film so if some of that violence was shown towards white settlers then it seemed to blend in this film.An extraordinary film and I hope against hope that it will be eminently successful and therefore lead to the creation of other films based upon our early settlement history.".

The unimaginable violence we displayed to the Aboriginal people was masked and not really a part of what occurred in this film so if some of that violence was shown towards white settlers then it seemed to blend in this film.An extraordinary film and I hope against hope that it will be eminently successful and therefore lead to the creation of other films based upon our early settlement history.";

Many people on this site talk about the violence. Well they are right. It is VERY real. However it is not glorified in any way. And that is the key. The violence is justified. There is one common theme in all Western films violence. America and Australia are unique in this way although different historically and culturally they both had very violent settlements. This was mainly due to the vast geography the climate the harsh conditions and the clashing of its inhabitants. So violence was the result of this mix. But don't be put off by this. There is much more going on in this movie than just violence.Whether it is the loneliness  the raw beautiful unforgiving nature of the Outback or the question of class race mortality or family we as an audience are privy to what it was probably like in the mid to late 1800's Australia. We are shown various groups involved the aboriginals the Irish and the English to name a few. After watching this film I simply want to know more. For that I give it a 10. Period.In addition to that. The acting is sublime. The direction and the cinematography are tops. The musical score cannot be more suitable. And the writing is supreme.Pound for pound the best Western I've ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a brutal western. I put western in quotes because most people think of the western half of the United States as being the locale for western movies. This movie was made and set in Australia but the time frame is similar around 1880. What's brutal about the story is the violence bloodshed and language  but only in spots. The language is odd in that the vocabulary of most of the people is aboveaverage but be warned there are a number of fwords. I question whether that word was around in the 19th century but it's prevalent in this film. Actually the violent scenes will be more offensive to viewers than the profanity. Like the profanity however the violence only comes in spurts. Most of the film has much calmer moments surprisingly lowkey.One thing that is there throughout the 104 minutes is the excellent cinematography. This is a pretty film nicely shot with some beautiful scenery and colors stylish at times too. To me this was the best part of the movie. It's indeed a visual treat. Benoit Delholmme deservedly won several international awards for his camerawork in here.The story is uniquely presented different enough that it kept me very involved wondering what was coming next. For those expecting a brainless revenge story or shoot 'em up western they will be disappointed. There is a lot of thought to this film and it varies scene toscene from classy to crude.Guy Pearce Ray Winstone and Emily Watson are three actors I am familiar with and I enjoyed all three of their performances. This is not a wellknown movie here in the States but if you like tough westerns and something a bit different check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Captain Stanley captures two notorious outlaw brothers Charlie and Mickey Burns . He makes a proposal to Charlie . If Charlie goes and kills the leader of their gang Arthur Burns and brings his body back they will be given an amnesty . If not Mickey will be hung on Christmas day which is nine days away You always know what you're going to get with a film by Australian director John Hillcoat namely strong memorable drama that's best viewed with a ready supply of antidepressants . You also know what you're not going to get  laughs  mirth and a strong narrative drive . Certainly both GHOSTS OF THE CIVIL DEAD and THE ROAD suffered slightly from a lack of a strong narrative drive and in this British produced pseudo Western set in 19th Century Australia there's also a sign of this flaw from the director The premise is one that grabs you and leads you to ask what you would do in that situation but as soon as Charlie leaves town on his quest the story meanders slightly as we're shown lots of panoramas of the Australian outback with a vague mystical air which will remind you of Australian cinema of the 1970s where the landscapes were the stars of the movie . One also gets the feeling in the first third that you're might be watching an Aussie version of APOCALYPSE NOW where a man with a mission involving extreme prejudice finds his target building an empire amongst the natives This doesn't happen thankfully and after a slightly unfocused first 40 minutes the story gets back on track with characterisation coming to the fore . THE PROPOSITION is much more character driven than the premise promises . There is a slight cop out in that Mickey is the poor unintelligent younger brother who has merely tagged along with the gang through family peer pressure and while Arthur isn't portrayed by Danny Huston as a stock psychotic villain with staring eyes and manic laugh his actions do more than enough to convince the audience that this rabid criminal dog needs to be put out of his misery . The characterisation between the good younger brother and the violent bad older brother could been written and developed as a bit more grey but there again it might have made it more difficult to cheer on Charlie the middle brother played by Guy Pearce The cast are excellent and special mention goes to Ray Winstone who is a national institution in Britain and watching him here you're aware of how underrated he is and gives a depth to Captain Stanley a man tormented by trying to uphold the law without giving in to rough justice from the locals . It's perhaps difficult to believe a rough working class bloke would be married to Emily Watson's rather middle class Martha but Watson does manage to project an innocence that seems out of place but that's undoubtedly the point . One character that did puzzle me was Jellon Lamb . John Hurt of course steals the show every scene he appears in but is there any point to the character except to spout Darwin ? it's a slightly confused and unnecessary character And THE PROPOSITION is a slightly confused film that stops it from attaining true classic status . It's a bleak nihilistic character study from John Hillcoat and contains all the strengths and weaknesses from the director's prior and future work . That said it's much better than most of the films the UK Film Council insist on wasting their money on from the same period".

	schema:reviewBody "Late nineteenth century Australia seems to have been quite a hellish place indeed if we are to believe what Nick Cave and John Hillcoat have given us here. From the unflinching seeming authenticity the weight of conflicting emotion on the part of each and every human being portrayed and the sheer beauty of itpain suffering and allI won't be the one to dispute it.I must admit that I have never seen a western before. The closest I have come is the first two seasons of the magnificent Deadwood on HBO. If The Proposition is any indication of what I am missing sign me up for a marathon now. Nick Cave has scripted a haunting ballad of a time left behind. Like his music with the Bad Seeds the film is both brutal and lyrical at alternating and overlapping instances yet if there is one thing that runs throughout it's honesty. This is the Australian outback at its' hottest and most dangerous. Flies scurry across frame every second of the way touching down on the sweatsoaked flesh of the people invading their space. Give credit to the actors this isn't a Hollywood film the swarms are plenty and there is never a flinch or notice even when one lands on a lip or eye. They are also real people and not clichs. When one character fast asleep in his bedroom with pistol at close proximity is awoken by a gunshot he doesn't rise with gun ready for action. Instead he jumps up hand on gun and goes full speed into the closed door falling to the floor. This jolt knocks the lingering sleep from his head and he turns to tell his wife to stay put before opening the door and leaving. There is no humor in the scene just the reality of fear quickening one's actions to a higher speed than his lucidity.As for the story the Irish Burns brothers have been wreaking havoc in the outback. The three and their cohorts ride through towns partaking in murder and rape without a second thought until one instance wakes Charlie to discover the nightmare he is in. Charlie played to stoic perfection by Guy Pearce takes his younger brother away from the carnage only to be soon found by local British authorities led by Captain Stanley Ray Winstone. A proposition is then struck that Charlie has nine days until Christmas nine days to find his brother Arthur Danny Huston to kill him and end the hellish trail of death he leaves in order to save his younger sibling from the noose. Charlie agrees as he has taken his brother out of the life to save him he must do what he can to keep that dream alive. The journey begins a quest for redemption for penance or maybe to join Arthur again and lead a charge for rescue.Flanking Pearce his Till Human Voices Wake Us has been on my to see list for almost 5 years now if anyone has seen it please let me know how it is are two amazing performances by Winstone and Huston both wear their emotions on their sleeves. Huston is an intelligent educated yet sadistic man. He does whatever he needs to and at night stares out into the distance a look of wildness etching the contours of his face. Is he thinking about his deeds with an anger keeping him awake at night or about what atrocities he will commit tomorrow? One compatriot asks later in the film if they are misanthropes if they hate humanity Huston's answer is Lord no we're family. Caring for his own blood is all the humanity he needs. Winstone's captain is the opposite. He is a just man trying to civilize a wild country. Trying to balance the cold stare needed to accept the violence he inflicts with the compassion necessary to hide it when confronting his wife is heartwrenching. Every emotion is flashing behind his eyes sometimes he must do what is right and not just and others he must do what is necessary for the overall good.The supporting roles are also superb as John Hurt supplies a nice turn as a bounty hunter out looking for the Burns clan and Emily Watson is unforgettable as the captain's wife. Her character is on the fringe of all the happenings going on but when she slowly finds herself discovering the truth her performance really shines. A gorgeous example is a scene where she is describing a dream to her husband the camerawork is magicalas it is throughout the movieand the composition of shots lend the tale even more emotion by shielding us from her face as she recites.This film cannot be critiqued without mention of the haunting score by Cave and Warren Ellis. Music enhances each scene it is used in. Gorgeous strings and piano mixed with hard driving guitar create mood and tension. Even the use of traditional Celtic melody works perfectly. The juxtaposition of Peggy Gordon with the visuals it is overlaid on is stirring. Nick Cave has bridged his dark storytelling from albums like Murder Ballads and Let Love In seamlessly to the big screen. Our emotions are amped up as we journey through the rollercoaster ride of feelings. If you have seen Wim Wenders' poetic Wings of Desire and remember the two scenes in the music clubs where the angel first meets his love and next seeks her out in human form all to driving rock beats you will know what I mean by music creating a powerful hold. You will also know then that the second band used is Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. His music has had a strong grip for almost two decades in cinema.Who knew dirt sweat graphic violence and a palpable humidity on screen could be so breathtaking a sight to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I just got back from The Proposition an extremely upsetting and visually arresting Australian western written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat. The cast was amazing Guy Pearce John Hurt Danny Huston and above and beyond all the stunning Ray Winstone and the always perfect Emily Watson...The film was brutal violent and like nothing I had seen before. When I say it was violent I can't stress enough how violent it actually was. There were some stomach turning moments where I had to actually avert my eyes...and I have a pretty high tolerance for that sort of thing. The thing about the excessive violence though is that it is completely appropriate for the story set I believe in the 1800s in desolate Australia.The plot is a simple classic genre plot a band of outlaw brothers rape and pillage a good Christian family and then comes the more complicated revenge loyalty and morality drama that will blow you away. Winstone's man of the law gives Pearce's criminal a proposition bring home his third brother responsible for a hideous crime or he will kill his weak younger brother. The mythological overtones are perfectly done as are the inferences to Conrad's Hearts of Darkness. Huston's character is like a version of Kurtz. The characters are all ambiguous in their motives and every actor is game for the challenge...Also of note are the indigenous people of Australia who the director says contributed to some of the script. There is black on black violence there are members of the tribes working with the white men on both the outlaw's side and the legal. All of the native people are wonderful in their parts proving again that stereotypes are not to be believed...Winstone plays the chief police man assigned to catch the gang responsible for killing a family who his wife Watson was friendly with. The gravitas and depth that Winstone conjures for this lawman who sometimes crosses the line is a wonder to watch his character's arc is the most impressive. Watson what more can I say about this actress?! I have loved her since Breaking the Waves and she is able to turn a wife role into something beyond any other actress' reach a true original. She looks right at home in the period setting. Hurt too gives a master class in character acting as a bounty hunter...The look of this film is stunning just unbelievable. The director uses the landscapes and the colors of nature to paint a story of their own. Not in the way say Terence Malick does and not in the way that compromises the integrity of the land. The land becomes the sets and seems perfectly natural and not at all contrived...the costumes and art direction too are really top notch...Hillcoat was on hand to answer questions and talk about the film as well which was cool. my boyfriend asked him a question about a disclaimer at the beginning of the film warning indigenous people that images of the dead were used throughout the film and he gave a great response about the cooperation of some of the Aborginal people and the opposition of others. He credited them with helping tell a story that hasn't yet been told in our time. He was very wellspoken and obviously knew the importance of handling the film's subject matter with compassion to all involved...Cave's music score was also very effective and contributed to the tense sweaty flyladen atmosphere of the dirty film.I highly recommend this film to anyone...".

She looks right at home in the period setting. Hurt too gives a master class in character acting as a bounty hunter...The look of this film is stunning just unbelievable. The director uses the landscapes and the colors of nature to paint a story of their own. Not in the way say Terence Malick does and not in the way that compromises the integrity of the land. The land becomes the sets and seems perfectly natural and not at all contrived...the costumes and art direction too are really top notch...Hillcoat was on hand to answer questions and talk about the film as well which was cool. my boyfriend asked him a question about a disclaimer at the beginning of the film warning indigenous people that images of the dead were used throughout the film and he gave a great response about the cooperation of some of the Aborginal people and the opposition of others. He credited them with helping tell a story that hasn't yet been told in our time. He was very wellspoken and obviously knew the importance of handling the film's subject matter with compassion to all involved...Cave's music score was also very effective and contributed to the tense sweaty flyladen atmosphere of the dirty film.I highly recommend this film to anyone...";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an Australian film and an Australian Western at that. It didn't get a lot of press or a lot of play and I didn't even get to see it until I rented it one day  from the library! It is so well done as a film and I believe probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Coming from a life long John Wayne fan that's a lot to say. But it is so rough and gritty and hard  even the violence is hard. And it is violent. Though none of it is gratuitous with all of it in context and very believable. Realism is one of the film styles I am drawn to and this is definitely that. It lacks all of the polish of Tombstone which is a great Hollywood western. In fact it is the complete opposite. I think only Unforgiven reaches some of the rawness here and I say some. There is one scene of vengeance that is even a bit much for me and pushes it almost to the edge of watchability. But just the one. The cast is excellent with outstanding performances by all most notably Ray Winstone as the chief good guy and John Huston's boy Danny as the chief bad guy. Danny Huston's performance is very understated which I think right for the character. This is one of the few films in my collection that I would say is not for everybody perhaps only for the adventurous. I say that as a conservative. as I look at the morality in anything I see  and will gladly walk out of a film if they're preaching the wrong message. If you can get past the hardness it is almost a haunting film even a little mystical. It stays with you for days.fullgrownministry.com".

This is a violent film but no more violent than your average run of the mill slasher flick. The difference is in the atmosphere that Hillcoat and Cave create out of the grime the dirt racism and desperation of the 19th Century Austrailian outback. That difference transcends the violence from shocking to downright gutwrenching.Ray Winstone as the local authority captures two members of the brotherly Burns gang Charlie and Mikey. Mikey is apparently mentally handicapped and as Winstone points out not able to comprehend his crimes and is as such essentially innocent. Charlie is offered a proposition  save his beloved younger brother Mikey from the noose by killing his murderous and sadistic older brother Arthur. This proposition is offered in the first 5 minutes of the film and sets the pace for the remainder. Charlie is faced with this morally ambiguous task of which brother must live and which must die. The final sequence of the film taking place during a Christmas dinner is incredibly powerful and terrifying alike.This is not an easy film to watch its dark its violent and its a moral puzzle. The film does not glorify its violence it abhors it and so do we. It shows us men who are essentially good doing bad things and men who are inherently bad doing even worse things. Eventually even bad men must draw a line in the sand and the film transcends the blood line of brothers and seeks to find the answer to how much is enough.Very dark and intensely violent in its mood and structure The Proposition is a artistic take on violence thats either hard to watch or hard to look away from.44".

The Proposition is a real old school western  gritty violent and fleshed out by sophisticated and interesting characters. Director John Hillcoat succeeds in capturing the style of the classic westerns and the fact that this film was written by Nick Cave means that it will be no surprise that there's a trippy hallucinogenic feel to it also. The plot focuses on an impossible situation. After capturing Charlie and Mike two of the notorious Burns brothers Capt. Stanley decides not to hang them both  but to give the elder of the brothers Charlie a proposal. He and his brother will be given a full pardon if he can bring the eldest and most notorious of the Burns brothers Arthur to justice in nine days. Otherwise the youngest brother Mike gets the hangman's noose.One of the main reasons why The Proposition is so good is down to the fact that it's so well put together and everyone involved in the film is at their best. Guy Pearce very much looks the part in the lead role and holds the film together well. He gets great support from the likes of Ray Winstone Danny Huston and Emily Watson. The fact that the film is brought to life by such a talented bunch of people really does it a lot of favours as each actor ensures that the story gets across in a way that is always interesting. Many of the best westerns are violent and gritty and this one is no different. While there aren't a great deal of gunfights and fistfights the ones that do feature really make an impact. The film feels very realistic throughout and this ensures that what happens is always credible and believable. It all boils down to a shocking and fittingly ambiguous climax that will generate as much thought from the audience as the film that precedes it. Overall The Proposition is easily one of the best westerns made in recent years and it's a damn good film in its own right too!".

No one wastes their ammunition either and the feuds are based on real problems ...if'n you raise your gun then you best plan to use it! Even days later just thinking about scenes... I still can't believe how real these characters all seemed their sets their clothing their equipment everything ...everything I swear that I went back in time! Wow! Oscarworthy indeed! From the opening scene ...when Capt. Stanley hit that kid I swear I could taste blood in my own mouth and then all the dust and the heat and those flies of that Australian outback which made our Old West in the U.S. seem like a kiddies' sandbox! And who the hell are the good guys in this film anyway!? No one is... I reckon. Nope. Life is tough. It really defies belief how anyone could survive. And I appreciate how the film portrayed some of the Aboriginal mystic perspective on things.Nick Cave took back the Western flick! No he's done better than any western I've seen ...in recent memory... Sorry Sergio?! His movie is that gritty Neorealism but with this band of Irish brothers. Convicts I suppose but I was really impressed how the idea of moral superiority kept shifting between all the characters. As motives and the film's plot are slowly revealed it's interesting how the worst of this lot lives in a cave like Osama bin Laden! Maybe in brutal environments like these some folk endup relying so much on their own internal compassmore so than folk living safely in their civilized citiesthat mountain dwellers lose the context of what is means to be human?? Then again maybe there are reasons why some people are forced to lose their meaning or belief in humanity?!? These brothers have made their own brand of integrity not manmade laws mind you but this savage integrity that is based on the instincts of survival.Cave's story should give anyone pause to consider... politically about what it means to live in a society and the idea of civilization. Because these characters are most complex. Each has the capacity for good AND evil yet all of themin their own simple way just want to find some kind of safety and a little comfort ...please... from that brutal Australian environment mate!".

No one wastes their ammunition either and the feuds are based on real problems ...if'n you raise your gun then you best plan to use it! Even days later just thinking about scenes... I still can't believe how real these characters all seemed their sets their clothing their equipment everything ...everything I swear that I went back in time! Wow! Oscarworthy indeed! From the opening scene ...when Capt. Stanley hit that kid I swear I could taste blood in my own mouth and then all the dust and the heat and those flies of that Australian outback which made our Old West in the U.S. seem like a kiddies' sandbox! And who the hell are the good guys in this film anyway!? No one is... I reckon. Nope. Life is tough. It really defies belief how anyone could survive. And I appreciate how the film portrayed some of the Aboriginal mystic perspective on things.Nick Cave took back the Western flick! No he's done better than any western I've seen ...in recent memory... Sorry Sergio?! His movie is that gritty Neorealism but with this band of Irish brothers. Convicts I suppose but I was really impressed how the idea of moral superiority kept shifting between all the characters. As motives and the film's plot are slowly revealed it's interesting how the worst of this lot lives in a cave like Osama bin Laden! Maybe in brutal environments like these some folk endup relying so much on their own internal compassmore so than folk living safely in their civilized citiesthat mountain dwellers lose the context of what is means to be human?? Then again maybe there are reasons why some people are forced to lose their meaning or belief in humanity?!? These brothers have made their own brand of integrity not manmade laws mind you but this savage integrity that is based on the instincts of survival.Cave's story should give anyone pause to consider... politically about what it means to live in a society and the idea of civilization. Because these characters are most complex. Each has the capacity for good AND evil yet all of themin their own simple way just want to find some kind of safety and a little comfort ...please... from that brutal Australian environment mate!";

If fun time is what you're looking for in a cinema hall then stay away from this film! And for all you diehard Sushmita Sen fans here's a different flavor of this woman to relish and cherish.You are sure to take home a slice of Basanti Sushmita Sen after watching 'Chingari'. The film is a close look at the goings on in a remote village in Northern India. So head for this film if you're in the mood for realism. But the film has a major drawback its length. It could have been trimmed by at least half an hour and made crisp. Then it would have made a stronger impact! 'Chingari' has many layers to it. It's the love story of a prostitute and a postman. There are other issues too that are still prevalent in these remote areas in the North illiteracy sexual exploitation of the poor and fake Godmen.There are some brilliantly executed scenes. Besides the performers credit is due to Kalpana Lajmi the director. Watch out for the scene in which Basanti goes to the post office a day before her marriage to confess her love to Chandan Anuj Sawhney and explain to him the reason for her agreeing to marry someone else is heart wrenching as well as performed from the heart. It shows the strong willed prostitute's transition into a woman.One could also never associate this sort of vulnerability with the normally strong and confident Sushmita Sen! It puts her in the same league as some of our great actresses. Another brilliantly performed scene is one in which Basanti takes on Bhuvan Panda in her house. And the climax in which she kills him is just superb. She looks possessed by the Goddess. It's almost like Sushmita had recently said It's not me it's the Goddess herself!' Mithun looks like he's truly made a comeback. This sensitive actor had somewhere got lost in all those flashy clothes and disco numbers in his yesteryear's. 'Chingari' brings out the actor in him although he does go over the top in some scenes. Ila Arun fits the bill. Anuj Sawhney looks convincing. The kid who plays Basanti's daughter is cute. A couple of the songs are good. The background score is brilliant. There is a liberal usage of foul language which goes with the genre of the film.But the box office prospects of the film cannot be predicted. It has limited appeal. But a movie to be watched for the performances particularly Sushmita's!".

This role demands such intensity and discipline from her as an actress and she convincingly brings us along Celebrating her strength as the selfsufficient wage earning single mother cringing through the abuse and humiliation she suffers at the hands of the village priest weeping as we watch her fall in love with the young postman who befriends the women of the brothel.Ila Arun's role as the owner of the brothel is carried off excellentlyall the way from her overdone makeup to her alternations between the over solicitous motherly nurturer and the coldhearted exploitative business woman. This veteran actress is expert at portraying the caricature of a person that the madam of this small village actually is.Mithun Chakraborty's career is also revived in his role as the powerful but corrupt village priest. He allows the prostitutes to serve Kali through dance and by making offerings but they can never touch the goddess' feet. At night he visits the prostitute but he cannot deal with the truth of his own desires and so subjects her to all manner of abuses during his visitations. Chakraborty's own stoic performance matches Sen's in intensity and depth. And the final confrontation between the two of them provides a scene of rare cinematic climax!!

	schema:reviewBody "CHINGAARI Review by Romuz Dear Members I would like to share my opinion about the movie Chingaari which I recently watched in a DVD. I was waiting for them to release in UK cinema but unfortunately they did not showed in a UK cinema. I am not a good writer so please forgive me if you get distract by reading my review. And also please don't take personally if you get upset with my review. I am just sharing my own opinion as a spectator. Cast Mithun Chakraborty Bhuvan Panda Sushmita Sen Basanti Anuj Sahani Chandan MishraPostmanThe StoryChingaari is the story of a young and innocent prostitute Basanti played by Sushmita Sen Who is a humiliated frightened and ravaged sexworker. Anuj Sahani plays the post man Chandan Mishra who comes as a crusader with innocent views. Basanti falls in love with the Chandan the postman she dream for a relationship but the same time she is not allowed to dream of a relationship with postman. Mithun Chakraborty Lovingly called Mithunda who plays Bhuvan Panda a village priest. He misuses his powers he tortures the village people and incidentally he falls in love with Basanti. So now we can see Chinagri is based on three characters Bhuvan Panda Basanti and the Postman. The film story is very interesting it's an emotional story of Basanti who dream falls in love with postman? This news spread to Bhuvan panda's ears. Then Bhuvan Panda torture Basanti. Basanti is helpless. Once Basanti dream of getting married to postman so her daughter Titli can live in good life grow up in good society. But Bhuvan Panda who heard everything and hints titli says one day Titli will take your place when she grows up. That time Basanti get Spark of Revolution. She speaks against Bhuvan Panda. This scene is terrific. The way Mithun and Sush was expressing their acting. It's mind blowing.Then Bhuavan Panda kill Chandan. This is another challenging scene. Mithun look real devil when he kills Anuj. After that Basanti become Chingari and she get ready take the revenge. She fights Bhuvan Panda. My opinionSo let's talk about the Chingari. It is very difficult to write about this film. As I already mentioned I am not a good writer. It is very pleasing too see a very good and well made film after long time. I will not say it's the best film but it's very nice movie. This film is women centric film. I think in India the public does not shows interest in women centric film that much. This film is for certain audience who like watching good cinema. The other advantage of the film is location. After long time I have seen a film set on the village. Recently we seen many Bollywood film has shoot in western country and mostly the story is more westernize. This film Chingari is has very good location and looks more authentic. It will be good for Asian audience who is living in western. Normally we are fed up of watching same kind of film like Kaal Kal Hona Ho which has western effect and more stylish. Chingari is more like and authentic film. The costume the dance and songs are really great. I think the producer they must show in the over seas...The PerformanceMithun Chakraborty Mithunda a three times National Award Winner. He did a tremendous job in Chingari as Bhuvan Panda. He was like a nature its self. He was mind blowing. Mithun was not playing the role of Bhuvan he was Bhuvan. Mithunda is genius and unique... The Body language was precise. His lust for Basanti the way he looks and the way he walk it was very precise only genius actor like Mithun can do such a great acting. Mithun prove to be greatest actor. I hope if he could win his 4th national Award. He deserves his 4th National Award. The chemistry between Sush and Mithun were fantastic it look so real. Mithun love Basanti and at the same time he hate Basanti being a prostitute. Mithun talks Sanskrit but some time he used foul languages which is acceptable. All Mithunda's fan will enjoy watching this movie. If you like his Jallad you must like this role. He is absolutely fantastic. I hope he will win an award.Sushmita Sen What can I say about her acting? I think this is her best role I have ever seen. She was awesome. Honestly speaking I never liked her in other movies but she has proved her self she is indeed a talented actress. The role of Basanti she was completely into Basanti. I think this Sushmita sen's most cherishing work. She is very lucky to work with three time's National Award winner a living legend called Mithun. Sen should be pleased for this role. She has most fantastic role in her career. She did award wining performance. Anuj Sahani I always liked Anuj as a good actor. He is a fantastic actor. And he proved it in Chingari. He played his role with heart. He has put soul in his acting. There are few powerful scenes of Mithunda and Anuj. When Anuj speak against Mithun and Mithun killed him. That scene was great. Anuj was superb in Chingari. I think he also deserve an award for supporting actor category.The directionThis film directed by Kalpan Lajmi. The screen play is not up to standard. She has got the right concept but she could've avoided some of the foul language. The performance of artist is fantastic. The music was very good. Dank Mare song is great.Performance 1010 Direction 810".

The story is bold and Lajmi courageously exposes an injustice in the Indian villages prevalent since the beginning of society where hypocrites like the priest played by Mithun thoroughly exploit the caste system and play the role of God giving an ultimatum on every issue in the village while womanizing and abusing prostitutes at night. However despite all of the film's strengths these issues have been tackled numerous times in Bollywood. This film particularly its climax reminded me a lot of Daman. What is also irritating is that Chingaari is in the form of a narrative. At times it becomes extremely boring. I think Lajmi didn't do a good job converting from a theater production to a cinema format. I would prefer to see this on the stage than on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "No one gets it!!!!! This is a story of a woman gone mad who has managed to manipulate and gain the aid of a weak minded man to help her conspire against her loving husband. She cheats on her husband in a most deplorable way by selling her body to strangers and uses her body as a sex weapon to gain the alliance of their weak minded neighbour.Rolf de Heer is a Genius! Rolf exposes feminism for its sickness and inconsistencies. He is showing how subtle misandry is. This movie is about how sickness can fester inside a deranged woman's mind and from her perception she is always right. The message is that most woman think they are right even when they are wrong because society fosters that notion. That is why feminist groups constantly contradict each other. This movie also shows how this sickness can trickle down and influence other people in a negative way when it is left unchallenged. The power of sex also resides 100 completely with the woman.Steve is a hunk of a man who exercises to stay in shape. He is a good father and has a good job. He is doing what a role model of a human being should do. He listens to his daughter and stops smoking at her request. There is no reason to suspect he is different with his wife. Steve also enjoys watching his middle age wife do a strip tease that is a bonus since most husbands would rather watch a young girl perform a strip tease. He must love her a lot. She knows what a man wants but holds back to deny him of pleasure to maintain absolute control. Steve still gets excited by his middle aged wife. That should be construed as a bonus to her because he is certainly not asking for a divorce and running off with his secretary. But to Alexandra it is a problem only until she finds a use for it. It is a no win situation for Steve.Alexandra is sick and mentally deranged. She is unwilling to seek help and her condition worsens. She is also suffering from an acute sense of low self esteem. Aside from giving birth to two lovely children she has accomplished nothing with her life and she blames her husband for it. She is angry at herself and eventually her self loathing sickness has caused her to direct her anger towards her husband which is the only person who really cares about her. She feigns committing suicide and then feigns having breast cancer just to watch Steve cringe and cry at her feet. She is not only angry but is also filled with hate and is extremely cruel. She knows of no boundaries that should limit human behaviour.She is a prostitute and her excuse is that she claims Steve objectifies her. Being a prostitute is a poor excuse it is such hypocrisy that she does not understand. If objectifying woman is done by men then woman are one notch lower since they only look upon men as a  cash cow. If woman were to objectify men that would be a notch up for men. She complains that the turning point was the cucumber! What a joke! Most FeministsLesbians would love to have a cucumber handy if their other toys were unavailable. I was appalled in this present day that someone would be so closed minded not to experiment with toys She is a cruel frigid closed minded woman filled with hate and anger for her husband. He has to constantly try to open up her mind about sex. He has to constantly beg for sex. This shows women have complete control over sex and how they can make their partner beg for sex like Steve does. Conversely if Steve did not keep himself in shape and was not virile he would be laughed at by other woman with a normal sex drive. She would laugh at him and say her cucumber could do a better job or she would just cheat on him at every opportunity. A reasonable woman should be happy with having a husband like Steve. The feminist ideology only wants man to become a slave to them. To bend at each contradictory feminist whim. It's not about finding the right man it's about changing him molding him into whatever she wants. It's the slavery of man.Alexandra complains he is so easy to satisfy then her job should be easy instead she complains again. A normal wife should be happy her husband is easy to satisfy instead of being difficult to satisfy! Alexandra's control issues are so severe that she insists her husband call her Alexandra instead of Alex. Alex just won't do! At the end when she has taken away the children Steve is crying like a baby! If Alexandra's projection of Steve as the evil doer is accurate he wouldn't have cried so hard at so many occasions. Steve is obviously a passionate man who loves his children and his wife and has been subjected to a conspiracy concocted by a sick evil woman. Steve's neighbour has also been completely manipulated by Alexandra. This shows how easy it is for women to manipulate men. Her sickness spreads even to the minds of weak men! There are plenty of weak minded men to go around you can find one at every corner.Alexandra lives to hate. She kidnaps the children and will mess up their lives forever because Steve would have been the best father they could have had. Alexandra throws away her responsibilities to her children and to her husband. She thinks she lives in a vacuum. Her vile behaviour is seen and rejected by some and yet is supported by others who share her misandry. Misandry is alive and spreading!".

	schema:headline " One of a kind cruel and demented psychosexual thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "What a cruel demented movie this is from the same distributors as Wolves in the Snow one of my favorite thrillers this year without a doubt. This Australian movie is much different as it is about a man Steve celebrating his birthday. His morning starts with happy birthday stuff from his lovely family and his pretty wife Alexandra. But before leaving for work his Wife tells him her main birthday present for him will be when he returns from work. He goes to work thinking everything is rosy has a great day they have a surprise party for him and then he gets called in and receives a promotion. WOW Steve is definitely having a great birthday and he still has his lovely Wife's surprise gift to look forward to. When he arrives home everything is dark all the light bulbs have been removed nobody is in sight not his children not his Wife nobody. Furniture has been turned upside down and Steve is still thinking Alexandra is playing a cute little joke on him and searches around his home but finds nothing UNTIL!!!! In one room he finds a package from his wife with a videotape inside with a label that says play me. His easy chair is all ready for him with a VCR and television waiting. When he starts playing the tape his Wife gives him a happy birthday message and then goes into a slow strip tease for him and Steve is smiles from ear to ear. BUT things go rapidly downhill from there and before long Steve is starting to wish this whole thing is a bad nightmare. Steve gets subjected to remorse deception and revenge and then even a bigger shock as the tape stops but the video feed continues revealing that the next portion is indeed live and he is locked in his house. This is a one of a kind psychosexual thriller and I have never seen a movie like this before and it had me mesmerized to say the least. It goes all the way from being highly erotic to down right as mean spirited as hell. The studio that is putting these movies out is the first to release award winning movies at theaters and on DVD at the same time. And based on the only two I have seen so far the movies are remarkable. The subscription service is located at www.filmmovement.com  and definitely deserves attention.".

He goes to work thinking everything is rosy has a great day they have a surprise party for him and then he gets called in and receives a promotion. WOW Steve is definitely having a great birthday and he still has his lovely Wife's surprise gift to look forward to. When he arrives home everything is dark all the light bulbs have been removed nobody is in sight not his children not his Wife nobody. Furniture has been turned upside down and Steve is still thinking Alexandra is playing a cute little joke on him and searches around his home but finds nothing UNTIL!!!! In one room he finds a package from his wife with a videotape inside with a label that says play me. His easy chair is all ready for him with a VCR and television waiting. When he starts playing the tape his Wife gives him a happy birthday message and then goes into a slow strip tease for him and Steve is smiles from ear to ear. BUT things go rapidly downhill from there and before long Steve is starting to wish this whole thing is a bad nightmare. Steve gets subjected to remorse deception and revenge and then even a bigger shock as the tape stops but the video feed continues revealing that the next portion is indeed live and he is locked in his house. This is a one of a kind psychosexual thriller and I have never seen a movie like this before and it had me mesmerized to say the least. It goes all the way from being highly erotic to down right as mean spirited as hell. The studio that is putting these movies out is the first to release award winning movies at theaters and on DVD at the same time. And based on the only two I have seen so far the movies are remarkable. The subscription service is located at www.filmmovement.com  and definitely deserves attention.";

	schema:reviewBody "Alexandra's Project begins masterfully setting a dark and heavy mood long before the plot reveals itself. When the plot does reveal itself it is done craftily piece by piece as if you were a bird being led into a trap one crumb at a time. This is exactly how the main character is trapped also.For the first hour I loved this film and couldn't believe I had never heard of such an intelligent thriller before. This abruptly turned when the complex story quickly unravelled to a cheap rip off of every bad Hollywood catandmouse flick ever made.How did this happen? Because the lead character who for the first half of the movie was shown to be smart resourceful and levelheaded turns into a whiskey swilling moron gets drunk and spends the the last half of the movie soaking in selfpity while not taking the obvious actions to fix the situation.That's what I mean in my title. You will be so aggravated at how dense the main character becomes that you will likely hurl your popcorn at the screen in disgust. Like in those cheap slasher flicks when the murderer is hiding in the house and somehow the idiot victim decides it's a good idea to go into that dark room anyway. Cheap thrills are fun in cheap movies but I was led to expect a bit more from this awardwinning film.The message of the film itself offensive as it may be to some wasn't what bothered me. The movie ridicules feminism by portraying the villain as a rabid manhating feminist psycho. But my gripe isn't about that. My gripe is the fact that the villain's plan turned out to be totally halfbaked and only a total dolt would play into it. A simple call to the cops and all the bad guys could've been traced rounded up and punished. But no instead let's get plastered on whiskey and feel sorry for ourselves until the end of time. As others have commented the characters and their actions defy sensibility.I actually recommend that you watch this film so you'll see how a great idea can come apart with shoddy writing. This movie will probably leave you feeling sickened not by the plot or the director's message but simply by the director's ability to ruin an otherwise good idea. Four stars out of 10 only because it did keep me interested for an hour.".

Several of the reviews I encountered used the terms sick and disturbing and those type of films always grab my attention as a fan of horror and obscure cult cinema. Now I wouldn't really describe the events of Alexandra's Project as sick or disturbing. It's merely a bleak and very unpleasant viewing experience. I'm not too familiar with the work of the Dutch born writerdirector Rolf De Heer apparently he emigrated to Australia at young age but he doesn't exactly come across as the most cheerful and sociable person based on this film. In fact the film tremendously reminded me of the earlier work of Michael Haneke more particularly Benny's Video and Funny Games. The stories of all these films are extremely basic and substantially void but the slow and brooding atmosphere literally makes you feel uncomfortable. Most of the running time there's practically nothing going on but you just know drama and emotional agony will ensue at a certain point. Steve is having a fabulous birthday so far. He made another promotion at work and he can't wait to return home because he suspect that his wife and loving children prepared a surprise party for him. His wife Alexandra occasionally suffers from depressions and insomnia but generally speaking his marriage is successful and stable. Or so he thinks The only surprises that await him are an empty dark house and a videotape message from his wife Alexandra. What begins as an exciting private striptease quickly escalates into a discomforting monologue full of hatred condemnation humiliation and domestic tragedy. I can't really say I found Alexandra's Project to be a good film. The narrative is compelling and the film definitely benefices from the marvelous performances of Gary Sweet and Helen Buday but the material is too implausible and farfetched. To label Alexandra's Project as a feminist statement or even a thoughtprovoking humane drama would be far too much honor.".

He is amazing and whether liking the movie or hating it this cannot be taken away.As for Alexandra's revenge I think it would have taken a lot more than a Prozac to cure. She unleashes years of repressed anger and lashes out with enough venom to poison Steve the kids and herself many times over. Of course neither party was faultless but while Steve's faults reflect a sadly typical man's point of view they're not vindictive. Nipped in the bud early on and some counseling andor trying to educate Steve in what he's doing wrong is reasonable. But here she stores up all that anger she prostitutes herself and blames the shame for that completely on her husband as well. When a marriage self destructs who hasn't witnessed the worst in people brought to the forefront. But Alexandra is sick a mental equivalent as dangerous as her faked cancer. The children are pawns in her revenge.As for the last scene when he pathetically attempts masturbation to a movie scene that cuts him to the core? It speaks to his total pathetic devastation. Here is a man in the depths of depression alternately engaging and failing in an act which will most likely drive his esteem lower and at other times watching the children  family  he's been robbed of. Repeated replay of his children wishing him happy birthday piledriving him further into utter repair. His faults were those of omission. Hers were evil through and through. How much hate would you have to harbour to do that to a person? Remember when he was trying to call her about the security bills for the rekeyed deadbolts etc. Salt in the wound when she apparently was providing payment to her neighbor for services rendered.And lastly if at some point his neighbor had been sliced diced and served up in some sushi bar I wouldn't have minded a bit!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is skillfully made good acting and a setup that allows for some some suspense and surprises. Otherwise it's a piece of garbage. I say that because I can't divine any intent or purpose for what is little more than a tale of psychological torture. Steve is a married guy with a wife and two children and after receiving a promotion at work he comes home to find his wife and kids gone and him locked in his apartment without means of escape or communication. Conspiring with a swinish technician neighbor his wife has contrived to imprison him in the house. She has left him with a videotape of herself. He plays the tape. At first she does a strip tease for him and then abruptly changes course and launches into a hatefilled rant about how she's been abused by him for their entire marriage and that she's taken the children to parts unknown and he'll never see them again. There are a few more twists but that is the essence of it. Steve who thought he had a loving family is reduced to a wreck tearfully having to listen to his wife's raving accusations. According to her he is an insensitive pig and she the helpless victim. But the entire setup is false. First of all in the beginning we don't see Steve as anything but a loving father and husband. And what really does she accuse him of? Of being insensitive to her needs and making unwanted sexual advances. She complains that he's always trying to grope her. Evidently he wants her body but doesn't appreciate her mind. From what we see of her mind with its insane vengefulness and cruelty maybe he was better off having nothing to do with it. The whole thing doesn't make psychological sense. We are supposed to believe that for 12 years she submitted meekly to his clumsy and repulsive advances without complaint or protest then suddenly she becomes this aggressive sadistic mastermind of a diabolical plot to humiliate and destroy him. I know it is a fantasy of the feminist left that women are helpless to resist the abuses of their men and any sort of bizarre revenge on the offending males is justified. But it's impossible to believe that this woman was so unhappy and angry with her marriage and submitted for so long then suddenly became a calculating avenging Valkyrie. We aren't talking about a woman living under sharia law but a liberated Western woman who would have plenty of recourse in an unhappy marriage long before she had to go literally insane with hatred. The movie gives no real sense of justice or balance. We see a man reduced to rubble very likely a decent man for all his faults but we see no moral resolution or even a moral center. The only justification for the wife's actions is her own selfserving mentally warped rant much of which may be pure fantasy. Some reviewers have suggested that the movie is actually a condemnation of the wife and her uberfeminist world view. But that isn't clear. That's why I don't think this is a good film. It reminds me of another movie Antichrist a nasty European product in which a wife also goes off her rocker and tortures her husband. Neither movie makes any clear moral point except to fill some voyeuristic need in sick minds to see cruelty in action. In neither movie are we shown men who would by any means merit the cruelty inflicted on them.".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend referred me to this Aussie film strange I never heard of it before seeing I'm in Australia don't think there was much publicity about it not too long ago and I finally rented it on DVD. I was somewhat intrigued by reading the plot and viewing the trailer beforehand but in no way did this prepare me for what I was going to see. This film isn't for the viewer who wants to see some light entertainment it's a hard hitting and a very disturbing film. The main focus point to this film I feel is the relationship breakdown of two married people especially the hidden anguish of Alexandra towards her husband. This entire film is being narrated solely by her and I feel this is a onesided story. You only can see the torture on the husband's face and a few muttered words here and there from him while watching a prerecorded birthday tape. A few reviewers have stated Alexandra is insane but is she really..a pretty elaborate plan for someone who's gone mad? She wanted her husband to suffer like she has suffered while married to him does she really know the meaning of the word how has she suffered???.the point that gets me though why such a ruthless and cruel way of showing her husband how much she despises him. You would expect something of this nature to manifest itself from feelings of pure hatred and revenge not simply on the basis of 'feeling sad' or 'very sad' as she put it. She's blaming her husband for all his indiscretions about their sex life and not thinking about what she wanted or how she felt.but what about her nothing said there??? I think there was more to the plot that the director couldn't show the viewer. A little more background information on both main characters would have been a bonus. I know it wasn't feasible to be more detailed otherwise it would have dragged on forever. Another strange oddity was why she had to involve herself in prostitution to earn money??? This point actually disintegrates any credibility to feel any sympathy towards Alexandra at all..how many of us would do that I wonder??? Using sex to acquire money shaming and humiliating her husband.she's being such a hypocrite. The part where she was staring at herself in the mirror in the beginning of the film saying..'nothing to be sorry for' never be sorry.and then spitting on her reflection was a key moment. It showed the contempt within herself and her little performance to me was a reversed projection on how much she loathed herself. All I saw was a pitiful image of a woman trying to avoid taking responsibility for her own obvious situation.indeed a person with little selfworth.Trying to analyze every shred of character trait and film footage would need an expert..nevertheless this film did have something to say whether people liked it or not. It's not a film you would watch over and over again in my opinion it's one where the viewer has to appreciate and try to comprehend the direction De Heer was implementing throughout the film. I must say to show my support. full credit to the director and the actor's efforts.well done!!! 810. even though I don't condone Alexandra's actions.".

	onyx:emotionText "A friend referred me to this Aussie film strange I never heard of it before seeing I'm in Australia don't think there was much publicity about it not too long ago and I finally rented it on DVD. I was somewhat intrigued by reading the plot and viewing the trailer beforehand but in no way did this prepare me for what I was going to see. This film isn't for the viewer who wants to see some light entertainment it's a hard hitting and a very disturbing film. The main focus point to this film I feel is the relationship breakdown of two married people especially the hidden anguish of Alexandra towards her husband. This entire film is being narrated solely by her and I feel this is a onesided story. You only can see the torture on the husband's face and a few muttered words here and there from him while watching a prerecorded birthday tape. A few reviewers have stated Alexandra is insane but is she really..a pretty elaborate plan for someone who's gone mad?

It's clear that there is something fundamentally wrong with one of the characters and the result is a messy and unnecessarily cruel chain of events.Don't misunderstand me...I'm not letting either character off the hook for hisher past actions and behavior. But people really do control their own lives even if they don't realize the mistakes at the time they make them. Mistakes come from making decisions and decisions have consequences. Whether or not Alexandra believes her actions to be justified or whether more events transpired between the couple than we even suspect they cannot be justified in the context in which they're presented. Sorry but this really isn't open to debate at least among reasonable people.So what remains? Basically an opportunity to peer a bit into a disturbed mind and a little sick thrill from doing so.I wish this film had struck more of a balance as I believe that the subject would have fared well in the hands of such a competent director.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I'm a bit confused by the responses of so many people to Alexandra's Project. Enough Australians have gone to see it for it to be one of the only arthouse films in my living memory to make it into the Top 10 at the Box Office but noone really seems to like it with the exception of a few critics. In fact when I came out of the cinema after seeing it I heard one woman say That was a really bad movie. And this intrigues me  in what way is this a really bad movie? I can understand that very few people will enjoy it. I personally cannot say that I did. But as to its technique construction delivery etc. how can you fault it? The only explanation that occurs to me is that audiences are so alienated by the material that they can't notice a Gary Sweet and Helen Buday's amazing performances b tight direction c brilliant sound and film editing and d eerily effective cinematography. Perhaps Australian audiences don't like to be provoked in this kind of way and I can see how that could easily be the case. Alexandra's Project is a feelbad movie to end all feelbad movies. It makes Leaving Las Vegas look like Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood. But does that make it a really bad movie? Some have actually criticised the material for being mundane  I REALLY don't understand that. Rolf de Heer has come up with a phenomenally complex and thoughtprovoking story which with the benefit of an amazing cast and very skilled technical crew who don't seem at all affected by what was a ridiculously lowbudget has been made into one of the technically best Australian films in years. If you don't want your films to be challenging then don't bother  you'll hate it. But if you DO go and see it try to accept it for what it is which is an unpleasant but brilliant film that will give you food for thought for the next year.That being said I don't think I could ever watch it again and probably couldn't bear to watch a film that I thought would be anything like it. It's impossible to come out of with your emotions at all intact.Objectively speaking ten out of ten. Congratulations Rolf. But in terms of audience enjoyment? Impossible to assess. Just watch it for yourself and see.".

This movie is not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. This is first and foremost a psychological thriller it is NOT intended to leave you feeling comfy with your world view or everyday assumptions of how day to day life works. It is very much a what you see is not always what you get kind of movie. If you watch this and feel that enraged that you start attacking women feminism or encouraging violence against women then you have serious psychological issues that need MUCH MORE than Prozac to fix. But if you are a man who is secure in yourself and your ability to relate with women as human beings this movie won't bother you at all. It might even amuse you. Several times I found myself laughing because this movie really does portray the average white collar career climbing narcissist as the clueless dismissive derp that he is. Over here in the states they act much more arrogant and stuck on themselves but the idea comes across well enough.The pointofperspective of this movie is very intriguing. The first part of the movie is from the point of view about the husband. The viewer sees HE is visible to the public HE is compensated for his contribution to society HE is rewarded for doing a good job HE is celebrated as a valuable member of society. The wife is sort of just there doing all the things society takes for granted and goes relatively unnoticed unless she is doing something out of the ordinary.Fast forward about a half an hour and we start to see things from the wife's perspective. Her perspective is shown from the television screen which is meant to symbolize the smallness of her voice and visibility compared to the husband's. His birthday present is a tape that he has the power to pause fast forward turn off or do whatever he wants conveying that everything has been on his terms from the word go. Despite all this I did NOT walk away from this movie feeling it was feminist. It is a story that is MEANT to fly in the face of popular opinion of what people have the right to do. People saying the wife is wacko are clueless. That was never part of the story. She didn't Snap. She was completely lucid throughout. THAT is what makes the movie so disturbing in the first place.For pete's sakes. The conclusions people come up with about movies are endlessly creative in their interpretation. And out of all the movies that visit graphic psychopathic explicit obscene scenes of violence and rape on the bodies of women people choose THIS movie to get upset about? Really? It wasn't even scary well not unless you think losing control of the remote to the television or anything else you think is property is a horrifying thought.

She had to video all her thoughts and revenge because she can't tell him to his face because he talks over her. Poor sweetie. She doesn't explain why she married him in the first place or what happened to the love she felt or why she waited so long to tell him. She doesn't recognise that her attempt to remove the children from his life treats them the way she blames him for treating her ie ignoring their opinion and desires and ignoring the fact that they are perfectly capable of doing something about this themselves either now or when they are older.So this is a man's idea of how a woman would behave if she was unhappily married and could wreak whatever revenge she likes eh?

The movie becomes so emotionally charged as it moves along and Alexandra starts to explain her wellcrafted web of deceit in her attempt to crush Steve's spirits as much as possible.I would agree with one viewer that the there are parts of the film which are not so well developed and particularly the introduction of the family and especially Alexandra and Steve at the start of the film. But nonetheless the shock of the film can rock audiences pretty hard. And at least as evident from some of the comments on the boards for this movie leave people feeling bitterly angry about either gender. The power that this film has to separate its audiences to that extent is amazing because the film seems to on the one hand waver between its sympathies of its lead characters essentially leaving the audiences to their own vices in deciding which character is to blame and which is really deserving of sympathies. In the end is it better to view Alexandra in such a vicious light because of the she admits to doing when alone in the house or when she explains what she has in store for the man who consistently ignored her? Or are we supposed to be more sympathetic to Steve who by some rationales of audience members was acting by hormonal response and only needed a good talking to in order to get Alexandra's point about him using her strictly for sex. What results on the videotape as it moves along as Steve is watching in almost paralyzed helplessness by a particular point is certain Alexandra is not the character we made our assumptions about at the beginning of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the critical drubbing this movie received not to mention the fact that it's by the writerdirector of Two Days in the Valley I expected it to be pretty terrible.  Surprisingly it turned out to be an exciting and occasionally quite funny thriller about two media obsessed thugs from the former Soviet Union who decide to become celebrities by committing a series of murders and videotaping the crimes.  The movie is definitely not without serious flaws for instance nobody ever points out that it's almost impossible to mount a successful insanity defense in the US legal system. In a land where Jeffrey Dahmer and New York's highly delusional subway shooter are certified as sane these guys wouldn't have a shot in hell of making their case and an insanity defence is the linchpin of their whole plan to profit from their crimes.  Movie also ignores the fact that laws have been on the books to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes by selling their stories since the 1960's.  Also given the legal and ethical ramifications involved it's hard to imagine any credible scenario under which a news program even a sleazy tabloid news program would pay a million dollars cash to an at large murderer for a videotape of one of his crimes and then broadcast the thing live on television.  Obvious flaws aside 15 Minutes has several shockingly wellstaged action sequences great acting except for the guy who played Ed Burns' bosshis grating one note performance went way over the selfparody line and occasional welcome touches of black humor like the very funny death scene of the thug who fancied himself a film director and manufactures the final shot of his movie for maximum emotional impact.  All in all 15 Minutes is a dark and funny thriller and certainly a lot better than most of the schlock Hollywood churns out.".

Surprisingly it turned out to be an exciting and occasionally quite funny thriller about two media obsessed thugs from the former Soviet Union who decide to become celebrities by committing a series of murders and videotaping the crimes.  The movie is definitely not without serious flaws for instance nobody ever points out that it's almost impossible to mount a successful insanity defense in the US legal system. In a land where Jeffrey Dahmer and New York's highly delusional subway shooter are certified as sane these guys wouldn't have a shot in hell of making their case and an insanity defence is the linchpin of their whole plan to profit from their crimes.  Movie also ignores the fact that laws have been on the books to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes by selling their stories since the 1960's.  Also given the legal and ethical ramifications involved it's hard to imagine any credible scenario under which a news program even a sleazy tabloid news program would pay a million dollars cash to an at large murderer for a videotape of one of his crimes and then broadcast the thing live on television.  Obvious flaws aside 15 Minutes has several shockingly wellstaged action sequences great acting except for the guy who played Ed Burns' bosshis grating one note performance went way over the selfparody line and occasional welcome touches of black humor like the very funny death scene of the thug who fancied himself a film director and manufactures the final shot of his movie for maximum emotional impact.  All in all 15 Minutes is a dark and funny thriller and certainly a lot better than most of the schlock Hollywood churns out.";

It has some excellent writing and some topnotch acting performances.

In many respects it suffers horribly from being predictable although there were instances where it strayed sharply from the rules of formulaic movies. Saying any more on that score would give away important aspects of the plot so I'll refrain from elaborating. Furthermore in true Hollywood tradition the main villains are dumb completely amoral and oh did I mention foreign? The idea might have been to give an outsider perspective on the abuse of American culture but that angle ultimately just plays into outdated audience prejudices against people who speak with an Eastern European accent.Too the movie has very graphic violence  but not as bad as I'd expected and not as bad as what is shown in many other movies. Through creative camera angles many of the bloodiest scenes are only obscurely hinted at leaving the audience to fill in the pieces.Not surprisingly many entertainment reviewers disliked the movie because it has the effect of exposing some of the more negative effects of the media. 15 Minutes does not claim that the media causes violence rather it explains that the interplay between the two is ingrained in American culture. This movie may not be saying anything original but it is sufficiently entertaining and thoughtprovoking to make it worth seeing.".

Robert Deniro who plays the homicide detective is more low key in this one and Eddie Burns cinematic presence adds fuel to the fire as the arson investigator.

	schema:headline " Unconventional and unexpected a great film that takes a strong brave stand on American culture. 12 out of four";
	schema:reviewBody "FIFTEEN MINUTES  2001 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchFifteen Minutes is a powerful thoughtprovoking and unexpected thriller about real life. It is a thematic movie that makes a strong supported and convincing stand on many current controversial issues targeting and exposing the many weaknesses and absurdities of the American legal systems. The film also incorporates prospects dealing with greed power popularity the public eye influences of media the power of television and the desire of immigrants to achieve fame in America. This is not your typical Hollywood action flick it is occupied with twists and unconventional surprises in which many producers would stay far away. Fifteen Minutes is a movie with guts and impact and for the first time in a long time the theater audience where I screened the film gave it a recognizable applause as the closing credits appeared.Fifteen Minutes is complete with big Hollywood names like Robert De Niro Edward Burns Kelsey Grammer and even includes cameos from several distinguishable actors Charlize Theron has a neat little appearance as a recruiter for hookers and David Alan Grier shows up as a pedestrian causing trouble in New York City. But the movie actually centers on two Eastern European immigrants named Emil Slovak Karel Roden and Oleg Razgul Oleg Taktarov. They have come to the United States looking for a man who owes them a large sum of money but eventually discover opportunities for fame. They kill their debtors and capture the murders on a stolen home video camera. There is of course an illegal immigrant who witnessed the crime Daphne Vera Farmiga who is now wary and on the run.Enter homicide detective Eddie Flemming De Niro a local celebrity and arson investigator Jordy Warsaw Burns who could not care less about the media. They form a team to undercover what appears to be a fatal fire accident but soon discover the scene was the location of a brutal murder. Enter a subplot where a veteran detective informs a novice of the same sort new ways to explore his profession. The story then takes an unexpected turn of events where the criminal's intentions explode into sadistic atrocity Oleg and Emil plan to sell the video of their murders to a TV network anchor Kelsey Grammer for a million dollars. They intend to beat the charges with an insanity plea also stating that they were abused as children. Why would the two immigrants want to do such a thing? To achieve fameeven if it is of a notorious nature.  We wait patiently for the story to take off with the setup but it stays with two separate narratives for quite sometime. When the narratives do cross its obvious this is not your typical runofthemill action picture but an insightful picture that says something about among many other concepts the power and influence of the media. The madman fascinated with video taping is yesterday's news already seen in 1999's American Beauty. It does not have the same impact in this film however mostly because here it is more of a sadistic obsession never truly understood rather than the passion and exploration in the multiple Academy Award winner. It is fun watching the incidences photographed with the home video camera there are some cool special effects that add a nice touch to the scenes. Robert De Niro gives another suave hotshot performance it is coming to the point where his talent is more effective in shtick comedies like Analyzed This. Regardless the veteran actor grabs us by the collar and yanks with no regrets and a thoughtprovoking determined attitude. The screenplay provides his character with an effective soft side through a romance with his girlfriend. Edward Burns Saving Private Ryan is never really bad in a movie but his personality feels too resigned and modest to be in these violent dramas. He has a few understood moments and often his performance fits his character accordingly but a braver more aggressive actor may have fit the part better.Surprisingly the best performances in Fifteen Minutes come from the villains Oleg Taktarov and Karel Roden. Both are very clever in their roles which are also exceedingly well written when the two encounter a visit with a local prostitute the scene does not result in mechanical sex but in violent misunderstanding that furthers the complications of the plot. Both actors are convincing and unpredictable. Many early critics have complained about the film's implausibility but Taktarov and Roden portray their characters with such meanspirited brutality and complex emotions I believed every step they took.  John Herzfeld is the film's director. His last project 2 Days in the Valley was quite a bit different from Fifteen Minutes. There are certain aspects of his filmmaking style that carry over but for the most part this film stands on its own from his previous achievements. Herzfeld constructs Fifteen Minutes with complexity and thought. It is a brave courageous movie deserving of controversy but will likely pass as a themeorientated action picture. I think most audiences will appreciate the production for what it is and how it informs us on such distressing issues. When we walk out of the theater we get a sense that we trust in our government's legal system even less than we did before watching the movie.".

I got the movie on DVD two days ago and I hardly couldn't wait to watch it because I had already read quite a few comments mostly negative one's on it over the past few months. At first I was kind of disappointed. I was not the kind of movie I had expected. I was hoping to see a movie as great as Heat' or Ronin'. But one cannot compare these three movies. They are completely different. So I let my first impressions rest for a while and watched the movie the next day a second time. 15 Minutes is not as bad a movie after all. It has its good parts though I would prefer some things to be different.The movie clearly shows how greedy and immoral the media can be if it comes to win ratings and get some money even though it appears to be overdone in some parts. Bad news is good news!' That is how it has always been and that is how it will always be as long as there is an audience. Who would watch a news channel with only good news? People want sensation even though they don't want to admit it. But there is certainly a limit to what the media should broadcast. In this movie the media exceeds this limit by far. Furthermore the film quite well points out the problem with the insanity plea. Some critics say the film glorifies violence which is not right. The two bad guys in this movie are so ugly and their crimes are so heinous one cannot but loathe their deeds. I also want to mention how well chosen the cast is. Robert DeNiro is as always brilliant is his role. His performance is definitely the highlight in this movie. The action scenes are very well done too.What I didn't like is the way the story goes in some parts. For example how the two criminals get access to Eddy's Robert DeNiro apartment. A famous detective just doesn't make a stupid mistake like this. Then the bad guy Oleg with the digital camcorder acts just way too silly which lets him appear rather unrealistic to me. Even though he is meant to be crazy his stupid behavior goes way too far. His character can not be taken seriously. Edward Burns as the arson investigator also has to act a little too unprofessional at times which doesn't add anything positive to his character's credibility. All this gives the whole story an unrealistic touch from time to time which is very sad. In general I don't like a movie to be cut down just to get it to an 2hour length. Most of the time I prefer to have the deleted scenes put back in again but this movie is really better off without them. The final scene has an interesting twist but the coincidence with Nicolette is just too farfetched. Oleg's final appearance looks ridiculous and doesn't fit into the whole tragic unless it were supposed to be a comedy. It is a tense thriller with some suspense though only two scenes really kept me on the edge of my seat. I also missed scenes introducing some more the characters played by Robert DeNiro and Edward Burns.Nevertheless I rank it a 7 out of 10.".

The script does deserve to be commended for one very neat plot twist halfway through though. And the movie's oddly repellent. It wants to preach to its audience about the dangers of mass media but besides the general hypocrisy of having a movie of all things tell me this there's a specific vibe here that glories in the same thing it's denouncing. There's a completely gratuitous murder of a prostitute here for instance that's excitingly shot and performed and seems to exist only to gin the ratings up to an R I'd rather not be lectured on morality by a movie that does that.In general 15 MINUTES is a secret sharer in the very thing it denounces.

You can tell he tries to let Edward Burns have his time but he is such a charismatic screen presence people would probably pay to watch him sit in a chair for two hours. The movie around him is also good touching on the interesting topic of the media's effect on violent crimes. Edward Burns does a good job but i think the real stars here except for De Niro of course are the two East European criminals who come to America searching for fame and fortune played by Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov. They are funny and terrifying all at the same time. Oleg's character seems like a friendly guy but he is actually a violent pervert. And Karel's character is just plain nuts. I recommend this movie for the great performances and it's thought provoking premise. 710".

Playing the villain in that regard is good 'ole Frasier from TV Kelsey Grammar.

Great concept is well directed by John Herzfeld who plays this like a reality TV segment. De Niro does well as the celebrity cop investigating the crime. He is set to propose to his girlfriend before tragedy strikes. He is involved in a nonsense scene where he fights two guys while taped to a chair. Burns steals the film as the rookie cop pushed to the limits when someone close to him is murdered for entertainment. When made a concluding offer he answers with swift aggression. Grammar as the media host is a corrupt sort who learns rather bluntly that Burns cannot be bought. Vera Farmiga plays a witness whom the killers track down through escort services.

	schema:headline " An ugly movie not worth 15 minutes let alone two hours";
	schema:reviewBody "It's so much easier for me when a movie is just plain bad.  15 Minutes does me the disservice of sticking little bits of originality or thought provoking material in with the excess that makes up the rest of the movie. As a film it has many flaws.  It's choppy with many useless scenes watch for the scene towards the end with Ed Burns and Emil in the warehousewhat's the point?.  It's characters are generally contrived and silly but are brought to halflife only by the actors behind them. It is original in some spots one in particular but mostly runs on tired cliche.  The timing of the humor is very poor and leads to a general feeling of awkward discomfort in the audience.  Everything about this film right down to costumes and set decoration is extremely ugly.  I don't know if that was intended but it's just plain hard to look at.  The entire film was surrounded by that aura of ugliness ugliness not only of the sets and costumes but of the characters and story. And that story involves a cop named Eddie Flemming Robert DeNiro an inferior rehash of Kevin Spacey's Jack Vincennes in  L.A. Confidential. Eddie uses the media to make his job easier and as a result has become a minor celebrity.  Edward Burns plays Jordi Warsaw a New York Fire Marshall who joins Eddie on the case to find two Eastern European criminals newly in the US to wreak havoc.  They have learned from watching television that no one in America is responsible for what they do and that the media run the show.  Murderers become millionaires and these two know it.  They begin to kill and videotape their killings.  They plan to kill somebody famous and sell it for millions of dollars.  Eddie and Jordi have to stop them.Now you might ask why is a fireman on the case The answer is that there is no answer.  They throw in a bit with fire just to bring the Jordi character into it.  All writers in Hollywood like to invent different jobs that allow people to be just like cops without being cops.  I guess they figure it makes it more exciting because the cop thing has been done so much.  They're wrong.  Making the character a fireman is a distraction leaving the audience wondering what he's doing there. There is no justification for his presence at the crime scenes.  Just making him DeNiro's character would have allowed the film to run much smoother.  There are lots of scenes character developments and even romances in this film that serve absolutely no purpose.  WriterDirector Herzfeld was filling gaps where they didn't need to be filled.  It shows that he was looking for something to do that he only really had one idea and was strained to make a two hour film out of it. I mentioned the film's ugliness It just leaves you with a sick feeling in your stomach.  This isn't a sign that the material was effective just horrible.  In a way the movie  is mean spirited and that is never a good thing.  The way the humor was added showed absolutely no skill on the part of the filmmaker.  He should have watched his own movie before releasing it because if he did he would know how awkward that humour is.So it all sounds pretty bad I know.  The film's only high points come from generally good performances DeNiro never fails even if the script does and a single point of originality.  The film's message regarding the injustice of the American system and its preoccupation with fame publicity image and the media that creates it all are points well taken but not properly executed. The first hour of the movie is deeply unentertaining and choppy but the second half at least becomes somewhat suspenseful and little bit interesting. Overall 15 Minutes should be avoided.  It was an ugly movie with low points far outnumbering the high ones.".

Robert works hard and convincingly in this as the officer and Burns is good as a supporting man. I say this is a white knuckle fast action thrill ride that is great for action fans that love a biting and twisted story with a surprise end that leaves you knockedout!! Plus I love the fact that I had a former female friend that was in this as a reporter in the crowd. 9 out of ten. There is only one reason that I gave this a 9 and not a ten.

Afterwards I found myself forgetting that he had been there at all.  A human character ... in 15 Minutes?  Surely I must have imagined it.The hero a firemancop seems a nice enough guy at the start which makes his subsequent moral nosedives all the more depressing.  Not just depressing sickening too since the film seems unaware that its hero is doing anything particularly wrong in fact he never loses his selfpossession and we're clearly meant to be cheering him on.  Ugh.

And what does he say?  The kind of whataboutthevictimsofcrime talkback radio speech that ought to remain buried there.  Does it occur to ANYONE in this kind of film that the purpose of courts is not repeat NOT to exact revenge?3  He shoots the villain.  Six times.  Arguably the first shot freed a hostage and if you think the villain needed to die then the second shot achieved something too in killing him but the remaining four shots were pure bloodlust.  There was little to justify even the first shot.  The hero was no longer a policeman but a private citizen taking the law into his own hands moreover the villain had already been decisively defeated you have to pay attention to notice this since by the final scene the director has long since forgotten what his film was supposed to be about. What's particularly disgusting is the way this scene is presented.  We see law enforcement officials smiling to themselves as the hero  now a criminal himself  walks away from the scene of the shooting.  Nobody stops him.  Our hero we're meant to think having become a gunslinger is now a MAN. Wrong.  He was a man at the start of the film he is now a petulant child.The film ends with so much random tawdry sensation that you have to stop and ask WHAT exactly is its complaint against random tawdry sensation on television?".

Instead we get a pair of ultraviolent villians a ridiculous plot and onenote characters that I cared nothing about.  The great Avery Brooks Capt. Cisco from Deep Space Nine is thoroughly wasted as one of De Niro's cop buddies.  And any shred of believability or integrity the movie had left is completely blown by the ending which is as predictable as it is awful.  There is a better movie inside 15 Minutes that could have been made but this version is not it.  A definite MustNotSee.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Herzfield's 15 Minutes is a mean spirited little slice of satirical fun with an eclectic nihilistic vibe that grabs you holds on and stings after. It deals with the media's fixation on lurid disgusting human beings and the violent acts they commit glorifying such spectacle and pouring salt in the wound simply for rating. Robert Deniro plays NY detective Eddie Flemming a burnt out hero cop who stages busts so the press can see him in action and get the scoop. When two demented psychopathic eastern European guys come to town to collect an old debt they go on an impulsive crime spree and discover that by filming their crimes and peddling the footage to a sleazeball news network they can gain money and notoriety. Fleming and a rookie arson investigator Ed Burns are soon on their trail as their rampage reaches feverish heights of heinous villainy. Karel Roden an astoundingly good Czech actor gives the best work of the film as the lead nut job giving us a grinning cunning joker esque portrait of evil. MMA fighter Oleg Taktarov is deadpan good as his child like brutish companion. Kelsey Grammar plays the amoral smutty news anchor expertly and there's great work from David Alan Grier Melinda Kanakaredes Vera Farmiga and a nice cameo from Charlize Theron. The film knows it has to be unpleasant to get its point across and has fun with the twitchy almost Tony Scott like excess of style. The heart of the film rests with Roden and Taktarov though follow in them almost like protagonists and letting them do their thing like a nightmare Slavic version of Laurel and Hardy. It's a deliciously twisted little flick with some cool ideas a great cast and a cheerfully trashy style.".

Ed Burns is the local fire marshall who also does a wonderful job of acting humble to DeNiro's somewhat flamboyant character.

That to me was unique.If you're a DeNiro fan don't miss this one.";

What this film has is a very clever selfreferential notion another film about films but one that directly indicts its own audience. It also has two excellent bad guys. These guys really move like East Europeans like Liam in 'Schindler' which starts out with a set of movements that is rare in film and adds an unusual logic with a visual metaphor. Plus we have deNiro in a role that is more apt than any of his recent ones. He plays someone who lives to be seen by a camera. He practices his proposal as if it were to be filmed  shades of Taxi Driver  plus his intended is reporter! He uses a different set of moves than the visitors and which are natural to the man and are already common enough to be selfparodied. But watching an actor act like an actor is a treat especially when we have two guys who turn into actors and a slew of TeeVee people who are in front of cameras but who don't know the moves. Then deNiro gets killed. That's novel. Theron has a powerful few minutes. Farmiga is lovely playing much the same as her Autumn role.With this alone Soderburgh could have done really well. This could be the sort of stuff that would make up for Ritchie's fluff problem. But in Herzfeld's hands it turns to goo because he lards it up with so many formulaic devices.The primary problem is the Burns character Warsaw. Everything about him is tired. This is a fellow that avoids the camera avoids people acts as the center of intelligence the detective the spine of the film. But he actually plays none of these things just an automatic device played by a rank mugger. This problem of stereotype is compounded by the introduction of the anchor and lawyer. Its the easiest thing in the world to poke fun at these smarmy types. But what we have here are cardboard.This formulaic machinery progressively drags things into the mediocre until the banal ending with the hero walking away having tasted his revenge. Oh why do writers not give endings the attention they deserve? Why does Hollywood force such drek always on the end?".

The movie pokes savagely satirical fun at the media the criminal justice system and those who would use the media and be used by it in order to attain their 15 minutes of fame.  I suspect that most who see this film will either love it or hate it because it is violent and ultimately sad.  Neverthelessit is funny smart well acted and beautifully photographed too.  Recommended. 7 out of 10.".
