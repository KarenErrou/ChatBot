It is based on a novel by Ehm Welk who wrote it in 1937 despite living under occupational ban by the Nazi government. The story gives a fond insight in the way people lived in the good old days when Germany still was a monarchy under Kaiser Wilhelm. However big politics never reach the remote world of the people in this story. Instead they solve their problems with their own rural politics. The picture of an old tripartite society is painted with a whimsical smile and a dash of anarchism that adds to the lightness of the subject. Although never leaving the layer of a family movie that can be watched well during the christmas days the film accomplishes remarkable depth. It's emotions range from laughter to crying presented in an unsentimental brash way. The overall acting is superb which includes about a dozen children. This film is an underestimated jewel. The older it gets the more it shows what we lost today emotions based on real life instead of the shallow sensations of modern media entetainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Heiden Von Kummerow Und Ihre Lustigen Streiche or The Heathens of Kummerow not heroes is a German movie from 1967 and it has its 50th anniversary this year. The special thing here is that it is a coproduction between East and West Germany and this is something that you really don't see that often overall. It runs for 90 minutes and was written by a whole lot of screen writers. the director is Werner Jacobs and among his most known are the Lmmel movies and you can certainly consider this film here something similar too. With the exception that the heathens listed in the title are actually grownups in this movie here as well as even smaller children. And to show you how famous these films and Jacobs were back then it is enough to take a look at the cast. There are really quite some familiar names in here and the one I personally found the most appealing is Theo Lingen. I just wished he had more screen time in here. Also Winnetou fans will be delighted to see Ralf Wolter who actually has a lot of screen time as he plays possibly the most important adult character the one who makes friends with the kids through his interesting stories but is not exactly appreciated by the other grownups.In general I had some problem with the direction this movie was taking. The kids scenes really seemed to aim at a younger audience but there were many more scenes with the grownups and children in the audience would find these really boring I am sure. But I am not sure what adult audiences would think about this film. If they found it entertaining or childish. I personally found little memorable stuff in the story apart from the scene with the 2 kids naked in the lake searching for crabs and the father who takes them away and I also think the emotional impact the film is trying to make especially at the very end was not really successful. Maybe it is because I am just not the biggest Wolter fan. Despite the relatively high rating here on IMDb I don't think this is better than than Jacobs' Lmmel films. I myself found many scenes dragging during the runtime here and this is even worse as it's far from being a really long films. Thumbsdown from me and I don't recommend the watch. This is another example of how forgettable the 1960s were in terms of German films and the special connection I mentioned earlier with regards to this one sadly did not turn into a quality outcome. Watch something else instead.".

The head of the Yu clan has been condemned to death by the evil prime minister who has usurped imperial power. A palace eunuch who managed to claw his way to power he is also reputed to be China's greatest swordsman. He plots to eliminate the entire Yu family but is opposed by a master swordsman and swordswoman.A memorable scene that has nothing to do with fighting is the dinner at Dragon Inn which introduced me to the Mongolian Fire Pot shabushabu style of eating. To the uninitiated there is a fire pot in the middle of the table decked out with all sorts of raw food which you put into the boiling water of the firepot and eat them as they are cooked. The cooking water is sipped as soup.I took my little sister to see it and from then on she got hooked on Chinese swordplay movies. She began reading up on ancient China and in college she majored in history and archaeology  all because I took her to see Dragon Inn. I am gratified to learn recently that the female supporting actress Feng Hsu moved on to become a producerdirector herself with a number of critically acclaimed films to her credit. I look forward to seeing them soon.".

The main story deals with a family's loss of their patriarch who 20 years earlier was prepared to silently exit his family's life because he saw no hope for his marriage to a dominating wife. At the funeral a man enters the picture insisting on speaking to the widow. He reveals the secret that during that fateful evening 20 years earlier he had convinced the now deceased husband to save his marriage by dancing with his wife. The man watched the couple from the street as they danced in their kitchen. He was hopelessly in love with the image of this woman who had just fallen in love again with her husband. Better late than never he now percistantly builds a relationship and eventually marries the woman.There are many subplots to the story. One tells of the boy who feels the presence of his dead grandfather and is certain that he is now invincible. This leads to several incidents where the boy tempts fate by putting his life in danger. His mother herself dealing with the recent death of a younger child escapes into a fantasy world by dressing up as Marilyn Monroe or Mrs. Robinson. There is also a subplot discussing how elderly view their prospects of growing more dependent on others and eventually dying. The film's main setting is NYC 1969. There are several beautiful references to the time i. e. the Moon landing and the Mets winning the World Series.  You gotta watch this movie carefully in order not to miss a beat but you will enjoy it. The final scene drives it home. 5 stars for this one!".

At the funeral a man enters the picture insisting on speaking to the widow. He reveals the secret that during that fateful evening 20 years earlier he had convinced the now deceased husband to save his marriage by dancing with his wife.

The script is unusually good and the acting is outstanding. The leads Marcello Mastronini and Shirley McLaine could not have been selected and directed with greater care. Kathy Bates Jessica Tandy and Marcia Gay Harden are terrific. The photography is outstanding and the sets recreate the 1940s and late 1960s very believably.

	schema:reviewBody "Either the producers behind Used People are incredible salespeople or there was once something in this screenplay which attracted the amazing cast that proliferates this film. Unfortunately whatever charm may once have been inherent in the story fails to make its way to the screen in the end product.The story centers on a NYC Jewish matriarch Shirley MacLaine who is taken aback following her husband's funeral when Italian charmer Marcello Mastroianni introduces himself as a friend of the deceased who has loved her from afar for years. Around this rather astounding declaration MacLaine and Mastroianni's extended family spins in their own assorted subplots. MacLaine has two daughters  Kathy Bates and Marcia Gay Harden  with whom she has embattled relationships with. Her young grandson convinced that the spirit of his grandfather is protecting him runs about doing one dangerous stunt after another. Meanwhile her mother Jessica Tandy and her best friend Sylvia Sidney kvetch from the sidelines. Everything gets tied up in a neat little bow in time for the U.S. moon landing.The film is obviously trying to be something in the same vein as Moonstruck but its fails spectacularly and only increases appreciation of that earlier film. The bulk of the film's problems stem from the screenplay and the characters. Did there really have to be this many people? Bates is a great actress but her character is too generic. By contrast Harden is so offthewall that no scene with her can possibly be taken seriously. Harden spends the film donning one cinematic disguise after another  one moment she is Mrs. Robinson from The Graduate in another scene she is Bonnie Parker from Bonnie and Clyde etc. This is obviously a woman with something pathological wrong with her and the fact that almost no one in the film addresses it is disturbing.Tandy and Sidney are fun as the oldtimers but they are given limited screen time. And even with that it is hard to dismiss the notion that Tandy is miscast and Sidney should have been given her role instead.Most damning of all is that it is impossible to root for a romance between MacLaine and Mastroianni. I usually enjoy MacLaine but she is playing a castiron shrew here. She comes off as an utterly joyless woman who gets her jollies by picking other people apart  especially those unwilling or unable to defend themselves. When the goodnatured Bates finally summons the courage to escape her mother's home and malignant influence she should be given a moment where she lays out how MacLaine has denigrated her. Instead somehow MacLaine gets a foolish rant about how everything impacts her  revealing the utter selfishness in an unlikable character. We can see no reason why anyone with an iota of intelligence would fall for such a charmless person  and this ends up making the otherwise charming Mastroianni seem either delusional or insane. If we have nothing invested in the romantic central pairing then the film can only be considered an abject failure.This is the kind of film where literally every character on screen is given a manufactured crisis that can then be solved magically by the climax. MacLaine will find love with Mastroianni Tandy and Sidney will find satisfaction in their twilight years Harden will learn to put away her childish game and become a mother to her needy son. It is the kind of film where Bates has barely left MacLaine's sphere of influence to launch a new life across the country before she has returned a success  which means she shows up at a family function with a new hairstyle.A really brazen and shallow film that would work far better as a lowrent sitcom.".

Look also for veteran actress Sylvia Sidney who puts in a fine turn. A very satisfying movie to make you laugh and cry.Wednesday July 21 1993  Waverley Pinewood Cinema";

To start with the positive it is a very ambitious movie. The takes on crime mixed with comedy are something you won't find too often in German films around that era and the acting wasn't bad either. Its always fun to see established actors like Mario Adorf during their really early years. The director is Wolfgang Staudte who worked on a handful other known films at that point too. With writer Horst Wendlandt I am not familiar. The cast includes a couple big names not just Adorf. Elsner Erhardt Giller and Held may be known to some too maybe others even. The major problem here is the detail. It is ambitious yes but every time the film goes into detail during its 90 minutes be it either in terms of character development or comedy or just the general plot it feels really off the mark. It is not realistic. It is not entertaining it is just strange and bizarre and at some point this was simply not interesting enough anymore to work for a full feature film. That's why I give it a thumbs down. Quite a shame as there certainly was some potential in here. This could have been a lot better than it turned out. Not recommended.".

Bergman's return to WangCheng to marry Colonel Linnan is implied in the final scene. As to Meryl Streep being more suitable as a previous commenter suggested  words fail me!!!! Ingrid Bergman was and IS far greater than Meryl Streep  there is no comparison. Miss Bergman made no attempt to conceal her accent at the beginning of the movie  as a previous commenter suggests. She is so wellknown that no one bothers to take any notice of her accent and she can play anyone of any nationality. This is a brilliant film and I happen to know that Miss Bergman researched her role in detail she spoke at length to a Chinese lady who had had her feet bound as a child  this was when on location in North Wales. The lady was helping to look after the Chinese children. In real life Gladys Aylward DID succeed in getting one hundred children across the mountains to safety in Sian. This is a lovely film extraordinarily wellacted by all  especially by Miss Bergman Curt Jurgens and Robert Donat whose last film it was. Watch it!!!!! It's great. I don't think cynical comments have any place where this film is concerned. Today's films are nothing compared with films made in the 1940s and 1950s  they are all blood and thunder and special effects Titanic for example.

	schema:reviewBody "This film concerns the life and achievements of one Gladys Aylward a Christian woman from Great Britain who conceived early on that her place in the world was in China. She was a remarkable person who let absolutely nothing deter her in her calling. That included a lack of formal education no support at all from any accredited missionary group and no money of her own. She worked as a maid to get the money to get a one way ticket to China with only an address of an aged female missionary who needed a young assistant.This film marked Ingrid Bergman's complete return to our fickle public's favor. After the scandal of her affair with Roberto Rosellini and her divorce the public would not accept her in saintly roles like Joan of Arc and The Bells of St. Mary's. But winning her second Oscar two years earlier cemented her comeback from Europe and this part restored her in our fickle public's affections. We'd never get away with casting her as an Englishwoman today but she overcomes any accent problems with unbridled talent.She soon inherits the whole mission when Athene Sayler dies. And she supports it by working as a foot inspector for the local mandarin. In those days of the twenties among other things the Kuomintang government was trying to do was undo the Chinese custom of footbinding females at a young age so they would have petite feet. It met with a lot of local resistance but she proves up to the task.The title of the film comes from the idea that Athene Sayler had. Not to open up a formal church as such. Instead she wanted to open an inn in which travelers could stop and hear stories for entertainment. No television in those rooms. The stories they heard were those of the Bible. It was Sayler Bergman and their cook Peter Chong who ran the place and soon it was Bergman and Chong.If Bergman's casting seems bizarre by today's standards the casting of Curt Jurgens as a Chinese Kuomintang Army Colonel is worse. Jurgens's occidental features are written into the script making him biracial Dutch father and Chinese mother. He's a man with little convictions about spiritual matters except he comes to believe in Bergman in her innate decency her dedication to his people and what she's trying to accomplish. The mandarin is even more bizarrely cast. The part calls for an asthetic actor so they got the best around in Robert Donat. This was Mr. Donat's farewell performance he died while the film was still in theaters. No one would get away with that casting today but Robert Donat is also that good a player.I'm sure if the film were remade today we'd have real oriental players like Russell Wong for the Colonel and James Shigeta for the mandarin and maybe someone like Kate Winslet for Gladys Aylward. But would it be as good as this film?The subject of missionaries and the good they do is one hotly debated topic. It does take a certain amount of brass to go to a given place and tell everyone your belief system is all wrong. I suppose the best way to lead is by example and Ingrid Bergman as Gladys Aylward set the best example she could. In fact she did one thing most missionaries good or bad wouldn't consider. She gave up her British citizenship and became a Chinese citizen.The film was helped a great deal by the inclusion of that children's song This Old Man where Ingrid tries to teach her youngest charges some English with it. It was enormously popular back in the day and Mitch Miller's record of it was heard constantly.The climax of the film and what gave Gladys Aylward her place in history is that trek with a hundred orphans away from the advancing Japanese army. A remarkable achievement indeed from a remarkable dedicated woman who wouldn't listen to anything but what was inside her soul.".

OK OK I'm being a bit unfair to a very enjoyable film  and the real life woman whose story inspired it  to suggest that The Inn of the Sixth Happiness is blighted by the tendency to glorify the Caucasian individual at the expense of the native group. If you can watch it in context it's great cinema. Radiant Ingrid Bergman plays somewhat implausibly but nonetheless effectively the former servant Gladys Aylward another in the long history of famous English Eccentrics whose missionary zeal takes her quixotically on a difficult journey to a remote northern province of China. There in the period leading up to WWII and Japan's attack on China she becomes an indispensable part of the community in no small part due to her work as the local Mandarin's Foot Inspector travelling the province to enforce the new law banning the binding of women's feet. Along the way her life is shaped by her evolving friendship with the Mandarin himself and her initially difficult relationship with handsome bitter Captain Lin Nan.That the Mandarin and Lin Nan are both played by Caucasian actors is not surprising for the 1950s but is distracting and annoying. This casts no discredit on the actors themselves. Robert Donat's last film performance as the ageing wily Mandarin and Curt Jurgens' powerful study of a cold military man whose life is turned upside down are both excellent nuanced and committed. Bergman really throws herself into the part and a large cast lend believability. Yang the Chinese cook adds comic humour with his entertainingly tall Bible tales and there's a welcome appearance by the charismatic Burt Kwouk.So I gleefully overlook the outdated attitudes and conventions and immerse myself in a different world with great pleasure  but I take even greater pleasure from knowing that in the modern age each country gets to tell their own stories without Caucasian interference. Now great directors such as Ang Lee Zhang Yimou Kiduk Kim Kitano Takeshi Mohsen Makhmalbaf and Idrissa Ouedraogo show the western world how it's done.".

What is the point of simply saying I am a Christian if you just sit in a comfortable house on a well kept street and read your Bible once a month and go to church for an hour each Sunday but never care enough about other people to be ready to sacrifice your life for them to hear the gospel? Gladys was a young woman who felt led by God to go to one of the poorest uncivilized areas of the world to preach the story of Jesus brave a treacherous trip across many lands learn a strange new language face the hostility of a people with a different religious background etc. Comparitively few professing modern Christians would ever put themselves in the line of fire as Gladys did. Ingrid Bergman does a beautiful job playing the role. It was obvious she researched the woman quite deeply and cared about her part. Apparently after the film was made she tried to visit Gladys but arrived several days too late Gladys had died. In her modest home Ingrid saw a book with press clippings about the film that Gladys had put together. She had heard second hand that Gladys hadn't been too thrilled with the film however the fan book seemed to declare that bit of gossip a fallacy.Robert Donat does a wonderful job of acting as the leading official of the town. It doesn't matter that he was not an Asian actor he makes it quite believable. Kudos to him. Curt Jurgen is masterful and manly as the soldier Gladys grows to love. I like the way the two of them slowly mellow towards each other during the progression of their relationship it is one of the chief delights of the film.I highly recommend this film to people of faith and to people without faith in God. With so few major motion pictures ever made about people who desire to preach the Christian gospel it is a nice change to view this classic movie and be inspired.".

She is also instrumental in effecting prison reform. She overcomes many obstacles and saves the lives of close to a hundred Chinese orphans who are fleeing from the Japanese. Finally she was considered qualified.";

She is incredibly moving.The art direction is also magnificent and wholly convincing.The rest of the cast is doing their best but neither Curt Jurgens nor Robert Donat are very convincing as Chinese characters. Also disappointing is Sir Malcolm Arnold's score. It is certainly not overly Chinese. As a matter of fact it could be used for any British war film.I also just saw a very similar movie The Devil at 4 O'Clock. Sixth Happiness is considerably better thanks to Bergman and the decision not to have a subplot for the teenagers. Next to Happiness Devil seems calculating and a bit cynical too.".

However Hollywood writers decided to mess with the story a bit and include a love interest in the form of Kurt Jurgen. But in spite of some unnecessary additions and some unnecessary cuts like a lot of the Christian themes this story is so fantastic that this is a movie that stands up all these years later. Like they say Truth is stranger than fiction. What is worth noting is that it is the final role of Robert Donat best known for his portrayal and Oscar in Goodbye Mister Chips. The final scene Robert Donat ever acted on screen was when the head of the city wants it put into the city's final records before it is deserted because of the invading Japanese that he has become a Christian. Even though this movie might seem to have the ingredients to make it very mushy a la The Sound of Music it is so based in real life that it is able to sustain the gritty realism that a person would face going to a remote place in China in the years before World War 2 and indoor plumbing. For young and old man or woman this is a film for anyone and everyone.  by LauraLee".

I suppose there's more interest in that posture than accomplishing in a more selfeffacing manner. While Ms. Aylward developed strength and leadership ability I can't see her being so much the center of attention. One of her gifts was the ability to promote others and involve them in her vision. There needn't be a disturbance about a close bond forming with a man. That does not translate to an affair. The usual film embellishment is likely responsible for the angst and denial. However the fact is true to the book. Yet Ms. Aylward was able to have a close relationship with a man without moral compromise. Her dedication to her life calling was kept in priority when the circumstances of the time made a personal alliance impractical. I understand from reports that Ms. Aylward was embarrassed by the handling of the love interest. This is an overall honoring account of a missionary figure. A true giver and lover of people is never a boring subject. Besides it is inherent that missionaries have adventures. David Livingston is one case in point. There is a treasure trove of other fascinating stories out there should they be mined and shared.I don't share the idolization of the actress over the substantial person who is the subject of the film.

On her way to the introduced employer for a housemaid she stopped by a travel agent and booked a train to China via Siberia. In this way she always does what she believes she ought to do upon belief of that God protects and leads her. She shows her sanguine attitude and tireless energy which are typical to God believers. One may doubt if such a woman actually exists but I remember similar woman. I read an autobiography Chasing the Dragon by Jackie Pulllinger of another English woman who served as a missionary at the Walled City of Hong Kong. From the memory of my surprise from the book I could believe that Cladys Aylward actually existed. I think Ingrid Bergman acted this woman very well. However this movie has many embroideries and dramatizations that are typical to 1950s Hollywood movies. For example English language dominates the movie in China and the scene the children are welcomed amid hearty cheers of people of Sian. The most questioned embroidery is that the colonel is given Caucasian blood and made to the lover of Cladys.".

Bergman appears in nearly every scene in the 150min film and delivers another flawless performance in her fabulous career How she didn't win an Oscar for this film is beyond me. Actually how she didn't win one for Goodbye Again Arch of Triumph Notorious Under Capricorn Indiscreet Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and many others I'll never know..  If I have a problem with this film it would be that I find the last 20min to be the weakest in the film but it's still marvellous.  To finish I just have to say that I'm a 26yearold male who loves all types of films I'm not nostalgic for the Classics I hate the Maltese Falcon Vertigo and the Philadelphia Story.  I also think the 'Fight Club' is one of the greatest films ever made but so is 'The Inn of the Sixth Happiness' if you haven't seen it which is probably doubtful if you're reading this then my advice is go see it.  Because Bergman has been in loads of amazing films I wouldn't include 'the Inn' in my top 5 Bergman films but it's still a great film 1010".

In particular there is Bernard Campan he plays the husband whose wife is unfaithful to him who turns in a subtle nuanced performance.Only criticism I would have is that since each of the men has relationships with two women it's hard to keep the female characters straight in one's mind.

That's why this movie works! Because it shows how life that's so simple can become complicated through the choices we make. Dialogue is also very witty and natural. Direction was superb. It was amazing how he can make a scene where the four of them simply stare off at the beach from a simple one to an emotionfilled scene. Superb acting from all of the actors.

In retrospect it's a coming of age film that very subtly reflects the transition from the 1970s to the 1980s.  We see the freewheeling spirit of the 70s while at the same time a longing for meaning and depth that being a free spirit alone cannot bring.

But their friendship is threatened when a beautiful woman enters their lives. 1984I really love discovering great films like this. I saw a brief description of it in a guide which intrigued me see above and watched it in the early hours of the morning. I've never been to LA during or after the early '80s but films like this seem to me to accurately depict things as they were back then. Many people's optimisitic and hedonistic ideals were being crushed towards the end of that decade due to AIDS Reganomics and other factors too numerous to mention. The characters are all well written and acted even some of the cameos like Max Gail's. Peter Coyote is always excellent in small films like this especially in Polanski's 'Bitter Moon'1992 and receives some great support from Nick Mancuso as his longtime friend. Some of the scenes featuring nudity though do seem unnecessary and heavy handed. This is one of those movies which doesn't need car chases or endless explosions to hold onto a viewer's attention because it's about something most of us are familliar with People's relationships with each other. Another film I liked as much as this with a similar story was 'Twogether' 1994 starring Nick Cassavettes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I graduated high school in the 1980s so I can attest to the authenticity of this film. The difference between this and a brat pack film is that this film really captures the adult ambiance of the 80s without trumping it up with teen comingofage clichs. These are sexually predatory adults crashing into each other.There is a ruthlessness to the casual nature of the relationships in this movie that you rarely see addressed in film and in a nonjudgemental fashion. In a way the fact that such a film can even be made is testament to the time it was made in because no film today would set up this kind of behavior without punishing it in the plot later. That feel and philosophy is what is so early 80s above all. Instead of sermonizing this film lays the situations out almost as if the characters have to survive their own petty foibles. Its not a comfortable film and Coyote does a harrowing job of portraying an artist seemingly bent on selfdestruction. I've always known Coyote as a mellow older actor. Seeing him in this showed me a whole different angle.The film addresses an even more rarelycovered topic that of the art world and the battle between poor message artists and rich decor or abstract artists. Coyote gives some beautiful speeches on the topic while heckling a wealthier competitor at his opening. The film also accurately portrays a gallery owner and painting model as characters. This could only be in the film because it was directly related to the writerdirector's life. It is super real except perhaps in Coyote's change of fortunes although he was doing something similar to Nagel who did end up rich painting women in the 80s.I have a bit of a envy for the warehouse district these guys were living in before the housing bubble made these places worth millions. Medium to giant painting studios with an art scene coffee shop nearby filled with locals. It shows you what an art district in a city like LA SF Seattle Portland was actually like before the gentrifying latecomers showed up and kicked everyone out. The crime of central LA wasn't really shown though this film just predated the most pronounced rise of gang drivebys that peaked in the late 80searly 90s. Colors the 'first' modern gang film came out in 1988.There are some flaws in the pacing and purpose of the film and some off acting here and there but it's an example of a director who just set out with a low budget and captured a lot of mood and a lot of the time in which it was made and now its a supervaluable time capsule. It's also the only film I can ever remember covering sexual competition between men more specifically men under 30 in an age when AIDS and herpes were just around the corner.I say its a 6 for execution and an 9 for intent average out to 7.5. Kudos to the THIS network for broadcasting it. Oh yeah it does have an awesome 80s ambient synth soundtrack mixed in with some other fare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heartbreakers is a very special movie for me being an artist myself I could relate to some of the dialog in the movie. I remember going to see this movie by myself at the age of 21. I usually go to movies by myself if I felt that it would be too strange for my date. Art films like this are strange to the typical person and I didn't have to worry about anyone else not enjoying it. I live in Chicago and at that time it was about 3 art movie theaters that would show a movie like this which I'm very grateful for living in a big city and be able to see it then. I connect to this movie in every way from the title the male friendship the music the attractive ladies the story and the strange artwork. Heartbreakers is the perfect title for the film because all the characters were selfish and unapologetic with their love. The friendship with Blu Peter Coyote and Eli Nick Mandcuso seem so authentic and at that time I felt similar to my own friendship I had with someone I grew up with. The music at that time didn't impress me but now that I gotten older I have a better appreciation for it. The art gallery receptionist was very sexy She stayed on my mind for a while after seeing the movie and when I look at the movie now she still look sexy. I though the other women Blu's exgirlfriend and Blu's muse were pretty sexy back then but now not so much but still attractive. The story had everything I wanted with romance betrayal friendship and payoff for perseverance. The artwork was hauntingly dark and sexy it was something I never seen before a bigbreasted woman in lingerie painted in black and white Oh that was new creative territory for me. At that time I didn't know anything about Bettie Page but recently a movie came out about her and then I put two and two together. I bought the VHS version of Heartbreakers but I'm eagerly waiting for it to go on DVD. I guess I will have to check out this Bettie Page movie until Heartbreakers make it onto DVD.".

	schema:headline " A Great Time Capsule from the Early 80'sMinor Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Bobby Roth has written and directed a gem of a film and a Los Angeles classic. I totally lived this in the early '80's. I was the Nick Mancuso character the guy who worked in business dressed well and had a father who was dying of cancer. My artistic friend Richard was in television and knew all the hip people as well as the right clubs bars and restaurants to hang out in. In other words a little like the artist played by Peter Coyote. Heartbreakers is the real deal. D.P. Michael Ballhaus gets the 80's look down to a tee. The woman in this film are all beautiful and are perfectly cast. The music in the film is also totally awesome to use a hip term from that time. Tangerine Dream and Pat Benatar round out the great soundtrack. I just can't say enough about how good this film is. I love how it captures the precise moment just before AIDS would work itself into the main stream of American culture. We see perfectly how Eli and Blue are perplexed and somewhat scared by Terry Ray and his gay boys at the art gallery. They are still free to sleep around as much they want as AIDS is still a gay disease. But that's about to change very soon.I was able to enjoy this one on a wide screen as one day I was playing hooky from work.

	onyx:emotionText "Bobby Roth has written and directed a gem of a film and a Los Angeles classic. I totally lived this in the early '80's. I was the Nick Mancuso character the guy who worked in business dressed well and had a father who was dying of cancer. My artistic friend Richard was in television and knew all the hip people as well as the right clubs bars and restaurants to hang out in. In other words a little like the artist played by Peter Coyote. Heartbreakers is the real deal. D.P. Michael Ballhaus gets the 80's look down to a tee. The woman in this film are all beautiful and are perfectly cast. The music in the film is also totally awesome to use a hip term from that time. Tangerine Dream and Pat Benatar round out the great soundtrack. I just can't say enough about how good this film is. I love how it captures the precise moment just before AIDS would work itself into the main stream of American culture. We see perfectly how Eli and Blue are perplexed and somewhat scared by Terry Ray and his gay boys at the art gallery. They are still free to sleep around as much they want as AIDS is still a gay disease. But that's about to change very soon.I was able to enjoy this one on a wide screen as one day I was playing hooky from work.

This is largely the fault of the awful awful pacing but everyone in this movie just seems like such a shallow cheeseball. The relationships in this film are about as realistic as those in a bad preteen novella. Really onedimensional stuff.

	schema:headline " Ironic film about absence of meaning gets bashed for lack of meaning";
	schema:reviewBody "Are we not straying through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods too decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.  Nietzsche However vast the darkness we must supply our own light.  Kubrick Brad Anderson directs Vanishing on 7th Street. The plot? An event occurs in which the whole world is blanketed by shadow. This shadow a seemingly living moving sentient creature swiftly eradicates everyone and anyone it touches. All those who happened to have been bathed in light when this event occurred remain alive. The film focuses on four such survivors.For most of its running time Vanishing functions as a conventional horror movie content to simply watch as our heroes struggle to avoid shadows and stay within Earth's last few dwindling pockets of light. As the film's monster is essentially nothingness the film generates a unique form of horror. Specialeffect monsterscreatures often age terribly often signify a limited imagination. In contrast there is nothing more frightening than the inconceivable the incomprehensible and the unrepresentable. Compare for example the countless rubber suit and CGI aliens found in bad movies to the invisible unseen concept of the Unknown in something like 2001 A Space Odyssey. In a similar regard the monster in Vanishing remains at a seductive distance. It is never explained and takes the shape of simple inky pools of black. At times this approach doesn't work it's kitschy especially when Anderson utilises moving puddles of CGI blackness better to use banal reallife shadows but at other points he cooks up some unique scares most notably when he creates humanoid shadows which are often beautifully mysterious chilling and abstract they recall brief shadow moments in Monster's House and Knowing two otherwise ordinary films.Anderson describes his film as an existential horror movie. It's along such lines which the film works best Anderson channelling a little Sartre Dostoevsky Kafka and Lovecraft. His shadows represent an existential dread the threat of nothingness the fear of absence and the utter extinguishing of all consciousness. In this regard our heroes osculate between ascribing meaning to the darkness or accepting both it and their existence as sheer quantum capriciousness. Significantly all the survivors yearn for reconnection one severed from his ex wife one from her son one from his mother and one seemingly from everyone. Everyone is dealing with the threat of not only annihilation but loneliness. Of course this is textbook existentialism philosophy 101 perhaps offencive in its obviousness but such things are not common in popcorn horror movies.So the film is about a very specific type of existential anxiety the horror of the unknown and the total horrific absence of meaning the word Croatoan appears several times a reference to a famous unknown unexplainable historical event. Ironically the film has been criticised for lacking explanations and meaning. But this is the point. From an existential perspective the individual seeks to grasp meaning in the face of impermanence. Loneliness in this regard is not something that someone experiences but which everyone is. In a culture entrenched in the rhetoric of autonomy rights and agency such terror often goes unvoiced and unheeded though only consciously.

	onyx:emotionText "Are we not straying through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods too decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.  Nietzsche However vast the darkness we must supply our own light.  Kubrick Brad Anderson directs Vanishing on 7th Street. The plot? An event occurs in which the whole world is blanketed by shadow. This shadow a seemingly living moving sentient creature swiftly eradicates everyone and anyone it touches. All those who happened to have been bathed in light when this event occurred remain alive. The film focuses on four such survivors.For most of its running time Vanishing functions as a conventional horror movie content to simply watch as our heroes struggle to avoid shadows and stay within Earth's last few dwindling pockets of light. As the film's monster is essentially nothingness the film generates a unique form of horror. Specialeffect monsterscreatures often age terribly often signify a limited imagination. In contrast there is nothing more frightening than the inconceivable the incomprehensible and the unrepresentable. Compare for example the countless rubber suit and CGI aliens found in bad movies to the invisible unseen concept of the Unknown in something like 2001 A Space Odyssey. In a similar regard the monster in Vanishing remains at a seductive distance. It is never explained and takes the shape of simple inky pools of black. At times this approach doesn't work it's kitschy especially when Anderson utilises moving puddles of CGI blackness better to use banal reallife shadows but at other points he cooks up some unique scares most notably when he creates humanoid shadows which are often beautifully mysterious chilling and abstract they recall brief shadow moments in Monster's House and Knowing two otherwise ordinary films.Anderson describes his film as an existential horror movie. It's along such lines which the film works best Anderson channelling a little Sartre Dostoevsky Kafka and Lovecraft. His shadows represent an existential dread the threat of nothingness the fear of absence and the utter extinguishing of all consciousness. In this regard our heroes osculate between ascribing meaning to the darkness or accepting both it and their existence as sheer quantum capriciousness. Significantly all the survivors yearn for reconnection one severed from his ex wife one from her son one from his mother and one seemingly from everyone. Everyone is dealing with the threat of not only annihilation but loneliness. Of course this is textbook existentialism philosophy 101 perhaps offencive in its obviousness but such things are not common in popcorn horror movies.So the film is about a very specific type of existential anxiety the horror of the unknown and the total horrific absence of meaning the word Croatoan appears several times a reference to a famous unknown unexplainable historical event. Ironically the film has been criticised for lacking explanations and meaning. But this is the point. From an existential perspective the individual seeks to grasp meaning in the face of impermanence. Loneliness in this regard is not something that someone experiences but which everyone is. In a culture entrenched in the rhetoric of autonomy rights and agency such terror often goes unvoiced and unheeded though only consciously. Unconciously we expend extraordinary power conquering or denying death.There are other nice touches. Some characters grasp for scientific explanations and dismiss them whilst others find solace in Christianity.

C MagnoliaI hate to use something from RUBBER a film I loathed but it fits so well here VANISHING uses the plot of no reason a plot that raises many questions but doesn't answer them by the time the credits roll. It is this very reason why the film is disliked by many. Yet films like THE HAPPENING KNOWING and THE FORGOTTEN get bashed because of the explanations of their plots. Go figure. Yes as human beings we often want to make sense of events that occur especially in films yet we need to realize things in life just happen. VANISHING may be low on explanation but it's high on suspense due to the use of a common fear the dark.Let's take a moment to talk about why so many people fear the darkness It's not the darkness itself that people are afraid of but rather the fear of the unknown. Just what is lurking in the darkness? VANISHING uses this fear and capitalizes on it which generates many of the films' unnerving moments. In fact its resistance on explaining everything is what makes the film scary. And no the film doesn't use any pop out scares. It's better than that. The film builds up its scares with a chilling atmosphere. That ladies and gentlemen is called suspense and don't be surprised. Director Brad Anderson is in the chair. With films like TRANSIBBERIAN and THE MACHINEST already under his belt Anderson knows how to make films that are thrilling.The cast is good as well but that's probably because I have a soft side for them. Haters of Hayden Christensen will find themselves unconvinced but I thought he pulled off a good performance. Although their characters don't ask for much John Leguizamo and the beautiful Thandie Newton do a great job providing sympathy to their roles. Jacob Latimore the kid actor plays quite an annoying character at first which shouldn't be a surprise but I got to eventually warm up to him in the middle point of the film.Overall VANISHING impressed me. While there may be some inconsistency in its highconcept premise it really makes up for it on the scares. The actors are good as well and the production values are great for a small film like this. Give this film a chance.".

Both the male adults are displayed as standing in the dark for couple of seconds and guess what ?

Of course there is only one car with a battery not dead ironically as in a kind of bad movie idea and the batteries for the flash lights are VERY limited the light an be barely obtained but why just why don't they wait for the sun to come up and try to go to Chicago why are they so boldly stupid why ?

Shadow was used to great effect and there were some chilling moments but most of the time it wasn't very stimulating.I'm not opposed to open endings provided they give enough information for me to form possible explanations. Recently I read Solaris and put down the book extremely satisfied despite not really understanding the planet's intentions. Unfortunately there's not really that much by way of clues and what is vague enough to arouse the suspicion that driver may not have known where the movie was going.So should you watch it? Depends on your attitude to character development and plot resolution. If either of these things ruin your ability to take a movie seriously skip it.";

	schema:reviewBody "'VANISHING ON 7TH STREET' Two and a Half Stars Out of Five Brad Anderson directs this apocalyptic horror film about an unknown darkness falling on mankind and devouring everything in it's path. Hayden Christensen Thandie Newton John Lequizamo and newcomer Jacob Latimore star as a small group of survivors who band together. The film was written by Anthony Jaswinski who's written a few other low rent horror films no one's heard of mainly of the made for TV variety. Anderson has shown some skill in past projects he directed the impressive 2004 thriller 'THE MACHINIST' featuring a 110 pound Christian Bale but here he sinks to pure mediocrity directing a pretty forgettable routine thriller.One random day there's a severe power outage and most of the world's population vanishes into thin air leaving nothing behind but their clothes. The remaining survivors are quickly gobbled up by the ever growing darkness as well and the only way to escape it is to stay in the light which becomes more and more scarce as electricity continues to fail and the days grow shorter and shorter. The film focuses on four surviving strangers who find each other in a bar on 7th Street in Detroit Michigan. Christensen stars as a TV anchorman named Luke Leguizamo costars as a movie theater projectionist named Paul Newton also costars as a mother desperately looking for her lost child and Latimore plays a young boy first camped out in the bar hopelessly waiting for his mom to return.The film is interesting at first but none of it's puzzling questions are really answered. It's suspenseful and effectively eerie at times but nothing builds to a very satisfying conclusion. The point of the movie is never clearly known. Some will enjoy it's openendedness but others will be frustrated by what some will call it's creative laziness. The performances are all adequate at best the screenplay somewhat boring and the directing hohum. Not a complete waste of time for horror and suspense thriller fans but ultimately forgettable.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vaotBOLCPYg".

I think the main thing that baffled me was the fact that they did not use fire more. Your in a bar with wood furniture and gallons of flammable materials get a fire going not to mention all the gasoline left in the thousands of abandoned cars. The used one torch and a few candles when they could have kept a bonfire going pretty much indefinitely.Overall not a bad movie and as a fan of the apocalyptic style movies I enjoyed it.

A man working at a movie theater who had a battery powered headlightLeguizamo. A man who was sleeping near lit candles Christensen. A woman who had just stepped out to take a smoke break  opened the lighter at the exact second it happened Newton..people who were near prevailing light sources when the darkness came.Now there is a fight for survival against the darkness that seems to be quickly taking over any light left  daylight becomes increasingly scarce w night lasting longer  daytime lasting shorter. Batteries used for flashlights keep dying lasting at first hours on end but quickly dying out after minutes. Nearly all cars are dead  batteries drained. The survivors are trapped in a city specifically 7th street that is being taken over by night a darkness that will take you unless you are surrounded by light.Sounds interesting right? I know.. this movie had so much promise which makes the execution so frustrating. I wish someone would have told me going into it not to try and figure out what was happening. With most psychological thrillers or horror films like this creepyodd things happen  then in the end an explanation is given for what happened  why. I kept trying to find clues piece them together  figure out what the initial darkness was why it was light vs. dark why the daylight was getting shorter why light sources were dying at rapid rates etc..  how the darkness had a mind of it's own since it is shown in the movie that the darkness thinks  has the ability to create fake light sources as well as add in loved ones' voices to draw the survivors out thinking they are safe and without warning the light goes out and the person is taken instantly....but alas nothing is ever explained. The audience is just supposed to accept what happened as an unexplained disappearance  take it for what it is  so beware  don't bother trying to piece together what is happening that is too advanced of a concept for this film.I want to be clear that this is NOT some high concept brilliant movie that answers some questions in a vague thought provoking manner that leaves the audience drawing their own conclusions.. movies like that can be quite interesting. Just bc this film doesn't answer questions about what is happening  why doesn't magically make it 'brilliant' or 'smart'  this film is straight forward with a disappearance of a population a light vs. dark scenario and the explanation that it's just an unexplained disappearance which isn't any explanation at all.310 Utter failure  anyone can come up with some crazy concept the true talent is putting all the parts together to explain the truth behind the mystery or what is really happening  this movie doesn't even bother. Also I found it hard to sympathizecare about any of the leads. I didn't really care if they lived or died do they even really die? Who knows  again.. what happens to those that disappear was never explained Also the movie comes to a halt about 30 minutes in when a place called Sonny's Bar comes into play  and never really get back to where it was going. Finally expect the usual problem of characters acting stupidly in this movie  when someone is in need of a light source  is desperate FIRE come to mind especially when surrounded by alcohol in a bar  there is tons of fuel at their disposal from the cars in the streets  too bad no one could take that mental leap.SPOILER WARNING NOW  DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILEDJust to be clear the idea that it's a reboot or some AdamEve scenario which I saw some people trying to sell as answers is NOT an explanation  that is just a potential reason for what happened but still doesn't answer anything about how it happened. If the people turn into the darknessshadows when they are taken then what was the darkness made of when it initially came  it was obviously large  powerful enough to take over everything  wipe out ALL electrical light so what was that? Why light vs. dark? What was going on with Leguizamo's character's death? etc... Also  the AdamEve idea based on the boygirl in the end makes NO sense given the ending of the film. If they road off into the sunset w daylight shining upon them then I might buy that as a reason for what happened NOT as an actual explanation as to how it happened BUT that is not the case. As the boygirl ride off the shadowsdarkness can be seen taking back over the city w night fall coming signaling to the audience that whatever is happening is NOT over. If the girl's magical flashlight dies  then I am assuming she  the boy will be gone just like everyone else. There was no indication in the end that the occurrence was over so clearly the 2 kids are not the chosen ones so that theory doesn't work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bertolt Brecht Art is not a mirror to hold up to society but a hammer with which to shape it.  The level of malicious ignorance from the other reviews pale in comparison to the frustration I face when witnessing others blindly blinker out the shining light in their eyes.SPOILER ALERTIn order to truly enjoy this movie you need to understand the subtext. A good piece of art demands more of the audience than the artist is willing to indulge. True art demands that it elevates others to the same plane of consciousness. Creating an environment that allows others to cultivate the ideas creativity and compassion to lead us into the next day....don't trust any other light other than the one that you hold in your hand.That is the subtext for this movie. The struggle between light and dark is the fight between personal exploration and submission to institutions. In this particular movie the darkness comes from the fear that comes with not understanding how our lives manipulated almost to the point of technophobia. From birth we're taught not to question the amenities provided to us through such infrastructures.Yeah sorry this is a humanist argument. I understand if this review already makes you feel uncomfortable but it bares getting through. This will be hard but there's a light at the end of the tunnel promise.Alright let's start with the most obvious part light versus dark. Light good dark bad. Jaswinski draws some very clear parallels between our human dependence upon the infrastructure of hydrocarbon energy oil and the necessity for innovation required for the future solar powered flashlight. The allusions to the oil based infrastructure can be seen in the dwindling supply of gas tanks subsequent failing generator and the last ditch hope in the Chevy nearing the end. The fear generated by the imposing danger of the darkness is only associated with the characters' reliance on outdated and obsolete machines such as the generator and truck. While it might be construed that these were offered as the last hope for this small group of humanity left they both ultimately failed leaving the characters to question whether or not they even existed.On top of demonizing the use of our trusted friend oil Jaswinski also sheds some light on the subject of faith. In particular our intangible faith in the institution of religion. Just like the generator and the truck the church offers the last refuge of hope for James. The fire in those candles represented hope that he would find his mother that he would be reconnected with those feeling from his flash back. But those candles too were a false hope the shadows over took the surrounding statues of emotional solace corrupting what looked like a refuge into a spot where they could lure first James and then Luke into their folds. James survives due to the ingenuity of Briana. As this was her spot to protect herself she set those candles up that eventually saves James.Woah woah woah so is this some crazy conspiracy going on here? There's no way these life altering materials can run out though right? We don't live on a mysterious island perhaps named Roanoke do we?Only a nut case would draw that sort of conclusion.Paul's character represents the knee jerk reaction people have when they are first engaged into thinking critically about our societies' dependence on such institutions. It frightens and confuses people trying to maintain their self identity.Look at it this way. If a stranger were to walk up to you and tell you that the life you have been living has been a lie you'd probably try to sit as far away as you could from the creepy guy on the other side of the bus.This is Paul's character he has a lot to say if you actually listen to him. If you write him off as a conspiracy theorist you might protect yourself from thinking but maybe he won't save you from the impending darkness like he did with James.I think therefore I am. I think I exist.While Jaswinski paints a bleak portrait of our dark reality the path to clarity is often in front of our face. What do you know greater than the back of your hand? According to Jaswinski the power to fight darkness is all at our finger tips. ...don't trust any other light other than the one that you hold in your hand.From the hearth of gods Prometheus not only granted us the gift of fire but the gift of the ability to make fire. Human invention and creation of other technical advents are the only thing that has protected us from darkness. The power to assert your own existence in this world therefore is not determined by our ability to believe we exist but our necessity to create something which proves our existence. Jaswinski makes numerous allusions to power of light creation based purely on human ingenuity from Luke's tribulation with the torch to Briana's chamber of solace in the church. The most striking allusion to this is Briana's solar powered flashlight. While the institutions around our characters are crumbling it is the sun which returns at the end to power Briana's flashlight and lead them into the the credits and into the future. The flashlight is used twofold it illustrates capacity for human innovation to overcome any adversitydarkness and the immutable laws of nature. The sun redeems our Adam and Eve at the end leading our characters into the next day with the knowledge that harnessing the sun when its out during the day will lead to protection even during the darkest nights.Sheesh no wonder these reviews are short and superficial. Thinking is long and hard.".

When they realize the darkness is what is causing the vanishings can they find enough light to survive? Based on the previews I had pretty high expectations for this movie it was very slow moving. The idea was pretty creepy and it is tons better then The Happening although the story line was pretty similar. This movie seems like a really good Twilight Zone episode but it doesn't really work as a full length movie. It gets repetitive pretty quick. It begins as a pretty scary movie but runs out of steam quick and begins to drag. This is not a bad movie at all but after the last man on earth type movies like I Am Legend this one doesn't really compare. Much much better then The Happening but not one to rush out and see. I give it a C.Would I watch again?  Probably not.Also try  Skyline  The Happening".

First of all this is not a movie for people who need EVERYTHING explained to them and who are looking for answers so badly that they are totally ignoring the fact who well and atmospheric this movie was made. From the great use of light shadow and eerie sounds to the creepy score the movie created an unsettling apocalyptic setting. The actors were great as well. While I'm not a big fan of Hayden Christensen I have to say that he really shined in this one as the unlikeable survivortype. John Leguizamo and Thandue Newton played their roles well and young Jacob Latimore carried himself well as heart and center of the survivors. Overall this was a well shotsuspenseful movie with a great cast. But those who are too lazy or uninspired to come up with on theories and answers about the movie and especially the movie's ending he the whole Roanokecase was never solved as well should avoid this one like the group in the movie avoid dark corners!".

A non stop clich filled score annoys rather than sets a mood. The cinematography is extremely dark and depressing .... difficult to see what is happening and generally ugly in its design. The story?

Mystery and suspense yes. But horror? No! The story told in Vanishing on 7th Street is and I am sorry to say boring weak and rather uneventful. Nothing much is happening throughout the entire movie except for a small group of people trying to cling to every single source of light in a world of impending darkness and with the darkness comes something else...With names like John Leguizamo and Hayden Christensen on the list you would believe yourself in for a somewhat good movie. And they did do their best with their roles but the movie just failed to impress.What was really working for the movie was the feel of the atmosphere and the creeping darkness that was always lurking. There was a good sense of dread and hopelessness in the movie. That worked quite well to be honest. And I also enjoyed the fact that you never really got to find out what it was that was lurking about in the darkness.Vanishing on 7th Street was really a major disappointment in many ways and it was building up lots of suspense throughout the entire movie and most of them came off in a good climax but just not fully enough to make the movie worthwhile.If you are in for an evening of horror Vanishing on 7th Street is not a good choice. But if you like supernatural movies that keep you in suspense then Vanishing on 7th Street might just be the right movie for you.".

Nothing much is happening throughout the entire movie except for a small group of people trying to cling to every single source of light in a world of impending darkness and with the darkness comes something else...With names like John Leguizamo and Hayden Christensen on the list you would believe yourself in for a somewhat good movie. And they did do their best with their roles but the movie just failed to impress.What was really working for the movie was the feel of the atmosphere and the creeping darkness that was always lurking. There was a good sense of dread and hopelessness in the movie. That worked quite well to be honest. And I also enjoyed the fact that you never really got to find out what it was that was lurking about in the darkness.Vanishing on 7th Street was really a major disappointment in many ways and it was building up lots of suspense throughout the entire movie and most of them came off in a good climax but just not fully enough to make the movie worthwhile.If you are in for an evening of horror Vanishing on 7th Street is not a good choice. But if you like supernatural movies that keep you in suspense then Vanishing on 7th Street might just be the right movie for you.";

	schema:reviewBody "This Sidney Pink production was one of many quirky films the indie expatriate producer made in Spain in the 1960s many of which featured wellchosen American stars. This was the first of two Pink films starring Jeffrey Hunter best known as playing Jesus in KING OF KINGS and of being the original Captain in the Star Trek pilot the second film in his twofilm contract with Pink was the interesting allegorical western THE Christmas KID aka JOE NAVIDAD. Here he plays a Madrid University professor who imagines he sees a lovely young lady played by the wideeyed Maria Perschy sitting in the front row of his class but who is seen by no one else. She turns out to be a bumbling witch who likes him and who winds up sending him to different periods in time in her attempt to bring him to her time period or to the present time. So about half the film or so it seemstakes place in the Roman era with Hunter as a slavethat part of the film plays like a sword and sandal comedy. It also winds up in a futuristic period 1999 was the future in 1967 where humanity has been wiped out in a world war and only seven women are left women who expect Hunter to repopulate the world with them! With the popularity of I DREAM OF JEANNIE and BEWITCHED during this period a witchcraft comedy must have seemed like a safe bet for a feature film but this film is a lot rawer and less refined than either TV show. Originally from Austria Ms. Perschy is a distinctivelooking lady and fine dramatic actress who is quite a charmer and plays comedy well. During the 60s she appeared in all kinds of films in many countries and has continued working regularly up through the late 1990s...any fans of 60s eurocinema can probably name a dozen films of hers they've enjoyed. She also worked for Pink in the excellent female western THE TALL WOMEN the year before. Jeffrey Hunter was much underrated during his lifetime and died youngmuch of his later output was made overseas. I don't remember him doing a lot of comedy but he is fine here playing an uptight college professor who is bumbling yet lovable. He looks uncomfortable in the sword and sandal sequences but fortunately he is SUPPOSED TO look uncomfortable because he is after all a 20th century college professor NOT a Roman slave! He carries the whole film well and any Hunter fan should seek this out. Overall another interesting entry in the Sid Pink canon see my reviews of two other Pink comedies...THE FICKLE FINGER OF FATE with Tab Hunter and MADIGAN'S MILLIONS with Dustin Hoffman. This does not at all look like a Hollywood film which gives it much of its interest. The comedy is not particularly sophisticated and some of the supporting players' voices are not synchronized too well but it's a pleasant comedy and those looking for something different will probably not regret the time spent. I'll spend 86 minutes with Maria Perschy anytime and Jeff Hunter died while still a relatively young man so any performance of his is worth watching particularly those made outside the Hollywood studio system check out THE Christmas KID or FIND A WAY TO DIE sometime.".

Two of my favorite scenes are where Jerry paints a tuxedo on himself and the flashback sequence showing Jerry as a youngster in a dance where the girls don't want to dance with him.Those scenes show what a great mime Jerry really is.Here in Finland they have been showing Jerry Lewis movies on Sundays this summer.The last time they showed his movies successively was in 1998.Now I can see the tragedy in Jerry's characters better than I did back then.Then I saw only the crazy and zany and funny man.Now I can see his characters are often tragic figures who also happen to be very funny.Jerry Lewis can still make me laugh like crazy.Jerry is a fool with heart.Nobody can do it like Jerry Lewis.".

	schema:reviewBody "There isn't a big star that you can name who doesn't have an entourage. These folks have their careers rise and fall with the stars that time and circumstance has attached them to. But what does happen to these people if the star is taken out of the picture. Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley were known for their large entourages and I daresay right at this moment there any number of people trying to figure out what the future holds for them with Michael Jackson's demise.The Patsy examines one such entourage who when its star a popular comedian is killed in a plane crash they will not just disperse. They function as a team and all they need is another star. Where to find one however.And that's where Jerry Lewis comes in an innocent schlep of a bellboy who comes in with an ice tray wreaking havoc in the typical Lewis manner. The rest of the film is devoted to how well they succeed in their objective.As one of the last players under studio contract Paramount kept in the black pretty much during the Fifties and Sixties because of Jerry Lewis. Either with Dino or later as a solo Jerry's films made money and gradually he got creative control over them. In this one he directs as well.It's not his best work but it's still pretty good with some really hilarious performances. Jerry Lewis has a reputation as an egotist but you would not know it in The Patsy he was quite generous in giving time to the fine cast he assembled. The entourage consists of Everett Sloane Phil Harris Ina Balin John Carradine Keenan Wynn and in his last film Peter Lorre. You're not going to hold too tight a rein on this group of scene stealers and Lewis doesn't even try.Best scene in the film however is with Hans Conreid as a voice teacher the entourage hires for Lewis. It involves Jerry with a snooty Hans who is also an antique collector. Let's just say the laughs are equally for Hans as they are for Jerry.And the ending is something that Mel Brooks could have used. In fact I'm not sure Brooks didn't appropriate an idea or two for some of his films.The Patsy is a great introduction to Jerry Lewis and I know his fans count it among his best.".

They function as a team and all they need is another star. Where to find one however.And that's where Jerry Lewis comes in an innocent schlep of a bellboy who comes in with an ice tray wreaking havoc in the typical Lewis manner. The rest of the film is devoted to how well they succeed in their objective.As one of the last players under studio contract Paramount kept in the black pretty much during the Fifties and Sixties because of Jerry Lewis. Either with Dino or later as a solo Jerry's films made money and gradually he got creative control over them. In this one he directs as well.It's not his best work but it's still pretty good with some really hilarious performances. Jerry Lewis has a reputation as an egotist but you would not know it in The Patsy he was quite generous in giving time to the fine cast he assembled. The entourage consists of Everett Sloane Phil Harris Ina Balin John Carradine Keenan Wynn and in his last film Peter Lorre. You're not going to hold too tight a rein on this group of scene stealers and Lewis doesn't even try.Best scene in the film however is with Hans Conreid as a voice teacher the entourage hires for Lewis. It involves Jerry with a snooty Hans who is also an antique collector. Let's just say the laughs are equally for Hans as they are for Jerry.And the ending is something that Mel Brooks could have used. In fact I'm not sure Brooks didn't appropriate an idea or two for some of his films.The Patsy is a great introduction to Jerry Lewis and I know his fans count it among his best.";

	schema:reviewBody "This Jerry Lewis comedy which he also cowrote and directed begins with an unusual premise a movie star has died and his staff of handlers Keenan Wynn Everett Sloane John Carradine Phil Harris Ina Balin and Peter Lorre who died before this was released are discussing if they should split up. That would become no when Jerry as bellhop Stanley Belt shows up and clumsily drops his ice and glasses which makes the team try to make him a star. I'll stop there and just say that while I know that Lewis tends to overdo his shtick I usually find it funny maybe both because and despite him doing so. I mean when he mouths in the wrong places his recorded lyrics to his hit song which I personally don't think would have been a hit even as a novelty tune or has a disastrous encounter with music teacher Hans Conried a veteran player of Lewis' movies I'm so there laughing my head off! And a couple of silent sequences are pretty amusing if not as funny. But when we see Stanley at his night club debut his accidentprone and mixedwords performance is painful to watch not only to the characters watching but to the actual film audience as well though it's possible Lewis meant it that way. There's also some entertaining tap dancing by The Four Step Brothers and some cool shoe shinebopping by Scatman Crothers even though his character borders on an AfricanAmerican stereotype though even there you get something of an edge in modern humor at the end of that bit. After the aforementioned night club bit it loses some steam but the ending more than makes up for it. Oh and cameos by the likes of Hedda Hopper and Ed Sullivan are also fine for the good sports they show up as. So on that note The Patsy is well worth a look for any Lewis fan out there. P.S. This is one of the few movies that both Keenan and his father Ed Wynn both show up in though in this case they have no scenes together. Oh and Sullivan mentions both Martin  Lewis and The Beatles as among those that made their TV debut on his show having filmed his scene not long after The Fab Four's first appearance with him on February 9 1964.".

	schema:headline " Anushka's shining moment Ranveer's shining start and their ultimate wedding spree";
	schema:reviewBody "Maneesh Sharma's directorial debut Band Baaja Baaraat is one of the year's most refreshing and entertaining films. It is a charming romance filled with colour energy and pep. The movie can be easily set apart from all the recent films made by Yash Raj Films in that it is very simple and it actually shows the beauty of India through its two main characters of young wedding planners who unexpectedly for them fall in love. Sharma's direction is absolutely marvelous and the film is totally benefited from the fantastic sets props and costumes which give the film an authentic feel along with the characters which look more like real people rather than cinematic heroes. This very portrayal and the script had actually more weight for me in making the movie work. The narrative style makes for a fun watch and that's thanks to the dialogues and the catchy songs. The film's first half is more of an ornamental wedding spree. And it is towards the second half when the story takes the audience by surprise and turns into a romantic drama that is quite moving and interesting.While watching the movie it is quite inspiring to see how young people from relatively traditional middleclass families strive to make a career on their own. Rarely do we see in Indian films such young people starting to run their own independent business particularly when all they have is willpower and faith in their abilities. The growing prosperity of the main characters' business is interesting to watch mainly because it's not made to look forcedly larger than life but rather real and gradual. Thinking about wedding planning one would certainly expect to see some lavish overthetop ceremonies but here everything is lifelike and genuine and yet colourful and impressively creative. As for the love story it is incorporated into the story efficiently. The musical duo SalimSulaiman significantly contribute to the film's mood with a great list of tracks among which the energetic Ainvayi Ainvayi is rightly the most popular. Dumm Dumm is also very good and is wonderfully performed onscreen. My favourite numbers are the romantic Aadha Ishq and the melancholic Mitra.The movie stars two young actors. The role of the male lead is played by newcomer Ranveer Singh and he makes a confident debut playing his character's different shades exceedingly well at times so well that throughout the movie it is hard to believe it is his debut performance. But without a doubt it is Anushka Sharma who dominates the proceedings with her wonderfully natural performance. Just like her male costar she commendably masters the dialect of a street smart Delhi Punjabi girl but more than anything it is her sensitive portrayal of Shruti's feisty nature pain and strength that stands out. Moreover Ranveer and Anushka's chemistry is fantastic. Just watch the scene in which the two of them are standing drunk in front of each other in the dark room. Director Sharma handles the scene very well creating the right amount of romantic tension using some really soothing music in the background and of course the two young leads play the shy nature of the moment with conviction. It is one of the beautiful scenes in the film and I'm actually not one of those romantic fools.Towards the last portions of the second half the movie gets more emotional at times too much but thankfully unlike many bland attempts made in recent films in which everything turns into ancient melodrama here it works. The scene in which Shruti fearlessly and honestly reveals her true feelings without blinking an eye is terrific  again superbly acted by Sharma. Singh's reaction is also very real and believable. This scene captures much of their potential. With this film Anushka establishes herself as a capable actress and I believe she will now be flooded with offers for demanding parts. As for Ranveer this movie may well put him on the map as one of the most competent young actors today and I personally find him more promising than most of the guys who have debuted in recent years. The film's ending is nice albeit a tad too sentimental. The situation itself is relatable but it could have been better done. Still Band Baaja Baaraat works more for its youthful lighthearted and effervescent mood and is overall a worthy feature which makes for a pleasant watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "Maneesh Sharma's directorial debut Band Baaja Baaraat is one of the year's most refreshing and entertaining films. It is a charming romance filled with colour energy and pep. The movie can be easily set apart from all the recent films made by Yash Raj Films in that it is very simple and it actually shows the beauty of India through its two main characters of young wedding planners who unexpectedly for them fall in love. Sharma's direction is absolutely marvelous and the film is totally benefited from the fantastic sets props and costumes which give the film an authentic feel along with the characters which look more like real people rather than cinematic heroes. This very portrayal and the script had actually more weight for me in making the movie work. The narrative style makes for a fun watch and that's thanks to the dialogues and the catchy songs. The film's first half is more of an ornamental wedding spree. And it is towards the second half when the story takes the audience by surprise and turns into a romantic drama that is quite moving and interesting.While watching the movie it is quite inspiring to see how young people from relatively traditional middleclass families strive to make a career on their own. Rarely do we see in Indian films such young people starting to run their own independent business particularly when all they have is willpower and faith in their abilities. The growing prosperity of the main characters' business is interesting to watch mainly because it's not made to look forcedly larger than life but rather real and gradual. Thinking about wedding planning one would certainly expect to see some lavish overthetop ceremonies but here everything is lifelike and genuine and yet colourful and impressively creative. As for the love story it is incorporated into the story efficiently. The musical duo SalimSulaiman significantly contribute to the film's mood with a great list of tracks among which the energetic Ainvayi Ainvayi is rightly the most popular. Dumm Dumm is also very good and is wonderfully performed onscreen. My favourite numbers are the romantic Aadha Ishq and the melancholic Mitra.The movie stars two young actors. The role of the male lead is played by newcomer Ranveer Singh and he makes a confident debut playing his character's different shades exceedingly well at times so well that throughout the movie it is hard to believe it is his debut performance.

Lead actors are debutant Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma  who has already had a box office hit with her debut film with SRK.The movie is fully set and shot in Delhi and all characters speak with authentic Delhiite accent it almost becomes difficult understanding after being so used to the Mumbaiya accent in all the other films. Shruti Anushka aspires to open her own wedding planner business while Bitto Ranveer is finding a way to escape his father's plans to taking him back to village to help in the sugar cane business. They get together and start their wedding planning company named Shaadi Mubarak with strict policy of never involving emotions or love in between them. Business goes successfully for them and predictably emotions come in between causing a conflict in running the business together.The love conflict is not new but the treatment given on the subject and the whole execution of the movie is fresh and commendable. Also the movie has a fairly fast pace where there is no dull moment. However I wish the ending would have been handled a different way but I guess the director did not want to opt for clichd ways.Anushka is very pleasant to watch and she is looking very good in her simple girlnextdoor getups some scenes even with minimal makeup. Ranveer does his role well too but seeing his interview on Koffee With Karan it almost feels like he acted as himself.Highly recommended romcom!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Band Baaja Baaraat";
	schema:reviewBody "With Band Baaja Baarat Anushka Sharma has completed her three picture deal with Yash Raj Films and in some way had gone full circle. In her debut film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi we first see her burst onto the screens in a prewedding scene  her character's before tragedy doomed her to a hastily agreed upon marriage to Shah Rukh Khan's Surinder Singh as arranged by her father on his deathbed. Here she plays the wedding planner and a number of major scenes see her both fussing around and enjoying herself in the weddings of her relatives and clients and playing a role whose profession symbolizes some major shifts in conservative mindsets where weddings are outsourced to professionals behind the scenes rather than leaving it under the hands of relatives.And one wonders how bold the studio is in entrusting a major film to a new first time director Maneesh Sharma whose experience has come from working as an AD in other major films and pairing the still relative newcomer Anushka opposite the complete rookie Ranveer Singh as her costar. This risk had paid off as the end product is something relatively refreshing and spunky going well with the themes look and feel for Band Baaja Baaraat which is to break mindsets and as teenage characters epitomized the cando fearless spirit of entrepreneurship wanting to try rather than to regret later in life.Anushka plays Shruti Kakkar who is dead set in her ways in wanting to start her own firm Shaadi Mubarak in the wedding planning arena and deflecting the usual route where a girl has to seek marriage after graduation and live a life that's more or less set rote and formulaic. Fate has her chance upon the laid back Bittoo Sharma Ranveer Singh who is looking to stay in Delhi a little longer after graduation otherwise at his father's insistence he has to pack up and go back to his village to continue his family's roots in running a sugarcane plantation. Like all romantic films it's opposites attract to a certain extent with Mr Relax vs Ms Focused as she reluctantly makes him a partner in her start up as they draft an informal pact to stay focused on their career path and keep their friendship platonic. At least up until the Intermission where things start to spiral a little out of control as emotions run high and you'd come to expect the entire second half of the film to run aground with the usual fights and arguments which in some way parallels the mood of the film where a split becomes problematic and only when they work together as a team does the magic of the film happen. Basically it's the rules that the duo set out to break in their chosen industry and with a pact made on their friendship never treading into the romantic space you know it's a set up since breaking and bending the rules is something they do on a daily basis with a growing business.And this mirror is more pronounced as we start to see how materialism and the building of a career can get in the way of romance with the tussle on demands for time taking its toil. The only spark in the second half as it plods itself to an inevitable end for a romantic film is how sometimes we get a little callous especially in taking someone else for granted and here we see how the female of the species is actually quite complicated when her heart is set aflutter painting Bittoo inadvertently as the cad without feelings and a silly boy at that when love comes knocking at his doorstep.On the characters' professional front I would have preferred it a little more if there's some poetic justice dished out in being more direct in being competitors to their brief mentor in the business who perceived as the best turns out nothing more than a fraud when it comes to delivering quality service. I suppose in the outsourcing business one wonders if one gets the best or are shortchanged left right and center in the way unscrupulous business is done. This of course gives rise to a myriad of supporting characters such as Maqsood the florist Neeraj Sood Rajinder Singh the caterer Manmeet Singh and Bittoo's friend Santy the musician Revant Shergill to join in as small suppliers hell bent on delivering quality as a business ethic.I've always loved Indian weddings put on screen because that promises colour and spectacle with lovely songs and energetic dances putting up quite a performance for an outsider like myself to witness and enjoy. Band Baaja Baaraat offers just that in large doses with the different projects the fledging Shaadi Mubarak organizes and needless to say I was having a field day. It's bands horns and revelry out in full force and both leads were a delight as they breathed life into their roles as business partners turned lovers. Anushka Sharma has grown from strength to strength with each film release and Ranveer Singh is quite the discovery with new male Bollywood heroes being quite the rare species in recent years and his well oiled performance here doesn't betray the fact that he's into his debut. Let's see what other films will appear over the horizon for this rookie.Band Baaja Baaraat is that spectacle that comes highly recommended so catch it if you can as it nears the end of its run here.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are times when you like predictability in a film and you actually look forward to it. You know exactly how the story will unfold and that there will be no dramatic twists and turns and distressing suspense. You still manage to enjoy whatever is going on. JAB WE MET JWM was a similar movie. The moment hero heroine meet you know that they will end up falling in love even if they are not romantically interested in each other.BAND BAAJA BARAT B3 is also a similar tale of two youngster and it's not surprising to see that it's doing wonderfully well with its target audience. The box office collections only dropped 10 in the second week against the industry average of 65 this year. JWM actually had higher collections in the second week of its release and in some centers B3 has higher collections than first week. Things might change with the release of TEES MAAR KHAN though. Coming back to the movie the first surprise was a house full theater on the second weekend of release. The only seat I could manage to get was in the first row and I had to watch the entire movie with my neck looking up at 80 degrees angle. Precisely why I won't be able to write much about cinematography because every shot from that seat was a lowangle shot.B3 is a romantic comedy which is not a genre which I usually enjoy especially after going through the agonizing experience of watching I HATE LUV STORYS. When I watched the promos of B3 I had a feeling that it will be on the same lines especially when I do not have much respect for Anushka Sharma. I still decided to watch it based on some positive reviews I read.It was a good experience. It's a refreshing and highly entertaining outing. It's not the award winning effort but it delivers on the promise of keeping you interested till the end. Mainly it's the directorial treatment of Manesh Sharma which has made a simple story worth watching. Slightly inspired by THE WEDDING PLANNER as far as central idea goes it's original and genuine. A lot of attention has been paid to detail from art direction to dialog. Check out the underwear on ropes in the men's hostel. It's funny.The cause is also backed up by entertaining music by SalimSulaiman who are on a better run for the last two years. The background music by is one of the best I have heard this year barring Dabangg. Choreography has Vaibhavi Merchant written all over it and it adds a big plus in the entertainment factor of the film.The film has a two film old female lead and a new comer. While the slightly senior Anushka has done the best work of her short career the film belongs to the newcomer Ranveer Singh. Where Anushka has worked really hard on mastering the tapori style and Delhi lingo her role is quite similar to the one she had in BADMASH COMPANY earlier this year where she again used similar body language and lingo. Nothing to take away from the decent effort she has put in though.Ranveer is fantastic. He is a trained actor who has waited for the right film to make debut and will win directors as well as audience with this performance. He is not traditionally good looking but the way he fit in his role was commendable. Neil Nitim Mukesh needs to see him to know what tapori is and not what he was in LAFANGAY PARINDAY. Watch out for Ranveer in coming films. Effortless acting and effortless dancing. If he doesn't make decisions like Vivek Oberoi he can be a real threat to at least Imran Khan and other less talented actors like Neil Nitin Mukesh. Ranbir Kapoor I believe is safe when it comes to talent. Ranveer will already be challenging Ali Zafar for the best new comer of the year for sure.The supporting cast is bloody good. Neeraj Sood as Maqsood is effective but my personal favorites were Revant Shergill as Santy and the guy who was Ranveer's room mate in the hostel.On the whole I had a lot of fun watching B3. Its one of the better films to come out this year unlike the bigger names like KHATTA MEETHA. I'm glad it also left NO PROBLEM behind. Way to go Youth!".

	onyx:emotionText "There are times when you like predictability in a film and you actually look forward to it. You know exactly how the story will unfold and that there will be no dramatic twists and turns and distressing suspense. You still manage to enjoy whatever is going on. JAB WE MET JWM was a similar movie. The moment hero heroine meet you know that they will end up falling in love even if they are not romantically interested in each other.BAND BAAJA BARAT B3 is also a similar tale of two youngster and it's not surprising to see that it's doing wonderfully well with its target audience. The box office collections only dropped 10 in the second week against the industry average of 65 this year. JWM actually had higher collections in the second week of its release and in some centers B3 has higher collections than first week. Things might change with the release of TEES MAAR KHAN though. Coming back to the movie the first surprise was a house full theater on the second weekend of release. The only seat I could manage to get was in the first row and I had to watch the entire movie with my neck looking up at 80 degrees angle. Precisely why I won't be able to write much about cinematography because every shot from that seat was a lowangle shot.B3 is a romantic comedy which is not a genre which I usually enjoy especially after going through the agonizing experience of watching I HATE LUV STORYS. When I watched the promos of B3 I had a feeling that it will be on the same lines especially when I do not have much respect for Anushka Sharma. I still decided to watch it based on some positive reviews I read.It was a good experience. It's a refreshing and highly entertaining outing. It's not the award winning effort but it delivers on the promise of keeping you interested till the end. Mainly it's the directorial treatment of Manesh Sharma which has made a simple story worth watching. Slightly inspired by THE WEDDING PLANNER as far as central idea goes it's original and genuine. A lot of attention has been paid to detail from art direction to dialog. Check out the underwear on ropes in the men's hostel. It's funny.The cause is also backed up by entertaining music by SalimSulaiman who are on a better run for the last two years. The background music by is one of the best I have heard this year barring Dabangg. Choreography has Vaibhavi Merchant written all over it and it adds a big plus in the entertainment factor of the film.The film has a two film old female lead and a new comer.

With very less expectation i entered the movie hall but the movie turned out to be a good surprise of good package.. a very light hearted movie which will bring smile on your face and you will forget your tensions and all. Ranveer singh who is making his debut through this film deserves an award for the best newcomer in the industry as not for a single moment he has looked like a newcomer.

But BBB is such a refreshing change and I immensely enjoyed it as did my Mum and the rest of the small audience. You can tell this film hasn't been promoted as much and distributed which is a shame because it's a great debut for both the director and for Ranveer Singh. The leads have done a superb job and acting out their characters and giving it that authentic 'Delhi' feel.It's not a remake of any sort and the dialogues will have you laughing out loud. The film has everything it's funny endearing touching shocking and romantic.The songs are great and well placed and the story moves along smoothly. There are slight plot holes and perhaps certain scenes didn't need to be added or shown in full extent in terms of it being a Bollywood film but nonetheless it still works because both Anushka and Ranveer have done a fab job at emoting the chemistry and dialogues. Highlights are the Ainvyi Ainvyi Song and the Dumb Dumb Mast SongI've seen a fair few films this year and I will say this is in my Top 5 for the bollywood ones that i've seen.Give this film a chance it deserves it.".

It was amazing on so many levels. The chemistry alone from Maneesh  Ranveer was so enjoyable to watch. They just fit so well together on screen like their characters do in the film. The music which I now own as of five minutes ago DVD soon to follow is amazing because you get a little bit of everything. Dance Rock some slow but quickly picks up tempo. I am still reeling from how much I loved this movie but I knew I would from the second I saw the trailer. If you love a good story great music wonderful acting beautiful weddings  just a really good film then you will love this one. The director right from the start has you pulled in to this film. The shots he gets in this film are just nothing short of amazing. I really like his style  the way he did his montage scenes. Recommended for anyone who loves an amazing musical style film!!".

For a romantic comedy the balance between Romance and Comedy should blend and this movie does it perfectly.In acting department the movie belongs to Anushka Sharma she portrays her comic timing dancing emotions with perfection and dissolves in the role of Shruti but no review is complete without mentioning the performance of dbutante Ranvir Singh whose confidence energy and expressions held the movie together the movie required very powerful performance from him and he delivered in an year when star studded Anajana Anjani proved like piece of crap Ranvir had tough task to bring people to theaters as a newcomer but he showed the obsession towards his role. The rest of supporting cast has nothing much to do as I mentioned before subplots are none here the movie totally focuses on Ranvir and Anushka.The highest point in BBB is the treatment of the subject by director Manish Sharma directing a firsttime hero and a Genre which is very risky in India he gave the movie a realistic touch from the word go no un necessary snoricams closeups beeps its just focuses on characters and the story Manish Sharma is a promising talent and I wish he chooses future subjects carefully and performs with the fanbase he made from this movie.The Cinematograpghy and set designs are aclass as the movie is based on wedding planners and weddings in South Asia are all fun the movie portrays the colors beauty and freshness with perfection the songs are according to subject though Ainwayi Ainwai song is regular on my car stereo from days.The bottomline is that 2010 was a great year for Hollywood as Inception Black Swan Social Network and EasyA were Eye candies but the Indian cinema suffered 90 movies were just runofthemill stinkers apart from MY NAME IS KHAN TERE BIN LADEN this is the 3rd Indian movie I enjoyed watch it with your buddies or Girlfriend its a fun filled ride till the end..".

The promos ensured not to leave any stone unturned  typical! Only after some genuine positive word of mouth started pouring in I decided to give it a go. Ranveer Singh Not only he shows a lot of promise and but manages to deliver the good as well. Shares a good onscreen chemistry with Ms. Sharma. Lets hope the new found success doesn't go over his head. And yes please do ignore the way he comes across offscreen totally uncool. Anushka Sharma Without a doubt she had my attention in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. To stand opposite SRK and yet manage to hold her own deserves a round of applause. She will no doubt give a run to her contemporaries. The layer which explores the woman giving in to the matters of heart whilst the boy reluctant to mix business with emotional issues deserves a commendation on the writing front. The narrative slightly loses stream when the partners call it quits and the LOC is drawn. Thankfully the editor senses this lacunae and trims at right place to ensure it does not become overbearing.Postsuccess of Band Bajaa Baraat I am sure Ainvayi Ainvayi became a national anthem. Next comes Dam Dam which has some good foottapping beats. And yes choreography for both numbers deserves a good solid adulation. Aadha Ishq is soft number is soulfully rendered by Shreya Ghoshal. Bari Barsi a folksong bears slight resemblance to Main Sasural Nahin Jaaongi from Chandni. SalimMerchant have managed to come up with some fresh compositions. For a firsttimer Maneesh Sharma surely hold the directorial reigns quite well. Habib Faisal does a good job on the screenplay front. Undoubtedly its a lifesaver for Yashraj. Here's hoping that they stop churning the usual and take the path lesser travelled.".

The promos ensured not to leave any stone unturned  typical! Only after some genuine positive word of mouth started pouring in I decided to give it a go. Ranveer Singh Not only he shows a lot of promise and but manages to deliver the good as well. Shares a good onscreen chemistry with Ms. Sharma. Lets hope the new found success doesn't go over his head. And yes please do ignore the way he comes across offscreen totally uncool. Anushka Sharma Without a doubt she had my attention in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. To stand opposite SRK and yet manage to hold her own deserves a round of applause. She will no doubt give a run to her contemporaries. The layer which explores the woman giving in to the matters of heart whilst the boy reluctant to mix business with emotional issues deserves a commendation on the writing front.

The plus side is that the characters were more Indian mentality based as opposed to trying to act as westernized people which has been the case for quite a lot of young actors and actresses these days.Ranveer and Anushka complement each other very well especially in the comedy scenes and the initial interaction. Anushka falters a bit in the emotional element but that can be forgiven. She's young and has time to improve. This is also the first movie where her male costar actually looks more her age unlike her pairings with Akshay and Shahrukh thus far.The initial story is fresh and good and it's interesting to see the two main characters set up their business and forge a partnership. It stumbles after their quarrel and from there on it becomes a case of following the well used and typical path to a conclusion that was never in doubt nor surprising. Still it's worth watching.Songs are great and both actors are excellent dancers. I liked the trio of supporting cast in the flower arranger the cook and the music guy.Ranveer and Anushka have shown that you don't need a star father uncle or mother to make it in show business and that it's the ability to act rather than who's name you have that makes a big difference. Sadly bollywood will always give preferential treatment to truly awful sons and daughters of the stars of yesterday and nothing to promising and talented non related people. But in the meantime enjoy a little gem of a movie and when Ainwayi Ainvayi plays turn up the sound!".

Don't know if he's like one film wonder but I want to say one thing he has his eyes to details and this would take him far. Silence and subtlety are such beautifully handled that I've really impressed by him. Editing One and only downside of this movie. Some scenes are stretched and prior intermission movie pace is very slow. After intermission it picks up again and does not stop until end.Cinematography Being a marriage centric movie this had to be a colourful movie and that job is done perfectly. Lots of colour music and crowd no where a slight intention to take a shot from different angle. The director and cameraman knew exactly who are the directed audience for this movie and they stuck to the basic. God job here.Screenplay Dialogs are raw and total Delhi oriented If someone is not familiar with such way of conversation heshe might find it rude or improper but this how its done there and that is exactly captured in script. Anushka and Ranveer Singh got balanced dialogs. Balanced means none ever shadowed another in any scene. The conversation at the climax is very real life like.....without drama.Acting Anushka showed she can act and can be trusted with more responsibility. Ranveer Singh is one who surprised me. He showed more confidence and maturity in acting than any recent new launches. In trailers I totally disliked him. But now I know he was the perfect choice for this role. In supporting cast liked performance of Neeraj Sood as Maqsoodflorist. Rest of the cast did not get much screen time so can't really complain.Verdict A nice above avg romantic flick.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that start off in a predictable fashion. Boy meets girl boy being a stud chases after girl and girl being focused snubs him. But that's all the predictability you are going to get from this movie. The movie soon steers itself into Shruti and Bittu's ambitious plans of wedding planning 'binness' and you lose your earlier sense of what you thought was going to happen. Cast and direction  Anushka and Ranveer apart from their obvious sizzling physical chemistry seem to have learned acting from a common source. Both actors have amazing control on their face expressions and dialog delivery. Being a U.P. k 'chhokra' Bittu never fails to falter in English words like 'hundaad hundred' or 'quechchun question' while Shruti being a hardcore Delhi 'kudi' speaks half wordssentences and can spit out alarming and loud Hindi insults without blinking an eye. When Shruti dances with her friends in the midst of a mad celebrationshe doesn't care about being graceful nor does Bittu have any qualms about speaking while eating. These small things surprise you in every scene and make you want to believe this story and these characters. Anushka Sharma plays Shruti with a diehard conviction and Ranveer Singh slips into Bittu's character with amazing ease. In fact Ranveer will have to prove himself in Ricky Bahl once again because he seems so at ease as the unsophisticated 'saharanpuriya chhora' that it's hard to imagine him in a sophisticated city boy Casanova role. Anushka may not be the best looking bollywood dreamgirl out there but she is more believable as a middleclass ambitious Shruti compared to the enormously unconvincing taxidriver Deepike Padukone in Bachna Ae Haseenon or utterly absurd Katrina Kaif as porn star Sheela. As Karan Johar asked her on KWK Anushka can definitely act the pants off of today's Alist dream girls. The cast is brilliant as not just the main actors but even sideactors seem like people you may have met in your life. Maqsood bhaai florist Rajendar caterer Santy band lead and Shruti's parents are all good actors who have been utilized very well in bringing this 'filmy story' as close to real life as possible. Dialogues  Realistic dialog spoken in an equally real tonelingo are the highlight of BBB. When Shruti says she doesn't want 'loveshove k syaapa' you are forced to believe she has grownup in a typical Punjabi family in Delhi. They call out to each other mostly by 'oye' rather than the more typical 'suno' or 'hey you' in movies. Bittu doesn't say the clichd 'I love you' or 'tujhse payer hai' but chooses to propose with a more 'U.P. k Luanda' fashioned boldegi love?. It's awkward and hilarious at first but fits as Bittu is no conventeducated and they don't speak a civilized language anyway. Commonplace expressions like 'dhinchaak' 'fati kyun padi hai' and 'janakpuri k kanjar' seem 3rd world when you hear them in this movie because you may not have heard them in a Hindi movie before. It's not hard to guess the director and crew is from Delhi as they have used their knowledge of Delhi lingo and expressions to their best advantage. Repeat Value  The movie leaves you at a high point and you feel compelled to go back and enjoy the lively scenes once more. There is a definite repeat value to it. Every scene is buzzing with life in some way.Music  Music is very pleasant and background score is the life and heart of every scene. The continuous 'beep' is the only noise heard in the kiss scene and kind of gives you warm cheeks. While the passionate youngatheart music that plays in the climax makes you want to fall in love again. The cocky tune that plays every time Bittu is up to some mischief is quite endearing and makes you smile. Overall background music in this movie is there for a reason and enhances the effect 10 times. Best scenes and memorable moments The kiss This has to be the best and most realistic kiss I have seen in a Hindi movie by far. Its believableconvincing and immersing. The scene of the after morning that follows is even more brilliant. Shruti's face expressions of seeing the whole world in a new light Bittoo's clueless and 'screwed up written in bold letters' face as his friends puts it later were so believable. Once Shruti was dropped home I straightened myself up to watch rest of the movie carefully as I realized I could be watching the best and my soon to be most favorite love story on screen. And it was!!Bittoo's character development scenes I expected Bittoo would just tell his friend how he had 'fun' with Shruti or how he just wants to dodge her somehow in typical bollywood style. But because Bittoo is only childish and not a villain which other hopeless ROMCom's make the hero out to be in such scenes he respects Shruti for the role she played in his life and just worries about the future of their business. Also i loved the fact that he tries to be at his best behavior with Shruti. The hero normally becomes a villain at this point in bad ROMCom's who wants to do nothing but hurt the heroine's feelings. The confrontation scene Anushka confronts Ranveer about their onenight stand. This scene left me a helpless fan of the direction as well as Anushka's acting skills. She is flawless and mesmerizing good in this scene. Summary Overall BBB is a rare ROMcom which has a familiar sounding story but told in such a refreshing way that will take you by surprise. There are some memorable moments and performances which may not be Oscarworthy but definitely touch the heart!! Don't miss experiencing this colorful and fun ride with Bittu and Shruti!!".

	schema:headline " Another predictable bollywood love marriage";
	schema:reviewBody "I had heard lots of good reviews from people in forums or blogs that have trailers and news of this movie so I thought if it's getting a good rating from the welleducated and higlyinformed internet community then it must be different from the standard bollywood fair of girl meets boy both fall in love have a bad patch and makeup in the end kind of story. This is a review Im writing much to dismiss those misguiding in this online community than to actually state the fact that the movie isn't anything special. Maybe the standards of bollywood have fallen so low now from such recent movies as HousefulTees Maar Khan Action Replayy and others that people are making movies like Band Bajaa Baraat a benchmark for entertainment.Its not as if there is anything going against the bollywood style love stories that more or less end in the same fashion than the depth wellmade love stories usually achieve and the immense passion they depict. Band Bajaa Baraat doesn't venture into depicting the development of a love relationship between the 2 main protaginists because the director wants the audience to just assume that since Ranveer is the hero and Anoushka is the heroine both definitely have to fall in love or make the mistake of doing so exclusively with each other. Everything else in the story actually turns out to be just a shenanigan for them to come together then split before eventually realising that they are actually meant for each other. The whole wedding planning thingy is just a secondary thing to the socalled lovestory that never happened. Really?? Is that all that we have learnt to do in movies in the last almost 7080 years of cinema in bollywood which by now even a 10 yr old might come up with for a script writing homework given one.Not only have the filmmakers given less importance to the love between Shruti and Bittoo but made sure the intimacy between them happens so suddenly and brazenly that it leaves room for wondering whether this is going anywhere or its just another one night stand turned guilt sort of thing only. Its like a 2minute noodle concept being applied to a lovestory. One minute you cookup the whole story about the protaginists fall in love making a mistake and another you cook a story about wedding planners mix the two together and serve them with some hot kissing and lovemaking scene to the audience who will readily eat it up. Sorry but Im not able to digest what was served in this over the top love marriage ceremony.I do not have much to write about the main actors Ranveer and Anoushka except that they were expectedly fine in performing what the director had in mind. It's not going to be a love story or performance people will keep remembering and talking abt even a year or maybe a few months from now so they have to find better projects to show their worth.In summary I'd say only go watch it if you're a diehard bollywood movie maniac who has nothing better to do in life. Better luck next time descerning viewers!!".

	onyx:emotionText "I had heard lots of good reviews from people in forums or blogs that have trailers and news of this movie so I thought if it's getting a good rating from the welleducated and higlyinformed internet community then it must be different from the standard bollywood fair of girl meets boy both fall in love have a bad patch and makeup in the end kind of story. This is a review Im writing much to dismiss those misguiding in this online community than to actually state the fact that the movie isn't anything special. Maybe the standards of bollywood have fallen so low now from such recent movies as HousefulTees Maar Khan Action Replayy and others that people are making movies like Band Bajaa Baraat a benchmark for entertainment.Its not as if there is anything going against the bollywood style love stories that more or less end in the same fashion than the depth wellmade love stories usually achieve and the immense passion they depict. Band Bajaa Baraat doesn't venture into depicting the development of a love relationship between the 2 main protaginists because the director wants the audience to just assume that since Ranveer is the hero and Anoushka is the heroine both definitely have to fall in love or make the mistake of doing so exclusively with each other. Everything else in the story actually turns out to be just a shenanigan for them to come together then split before eventually realising that they are actually meant for each other. The whole wedding planning thingy is just a secondary thing to the socalled lovestory that never happened. Really?? Is that all that we have learnt to do in movies in the last almost 7080 years of cinema in bollywood which by now even a 10 yr old might come up with for a script writing homework given one.Not only have the filmmakers given less importance to the love between Shruti and Bittoo but made sure the intimacy between them happens so suddenly and brazenly that it leaves room for wondering whether this is going anywhere or its just another one night stand turned guilt sort of thing only. Its like a 2minute noodle concept being applied to a lovestory. One minute you cookup the whole story about the protaginists fall in love making a mistake and another you cook a story about wedding planners mix the two together and serve them with some hot kissing and lovemaking scene to the audience who will readily eat it up.

	schema:headline " Truly captures the lively West Delhi ambiance and is a delightful watch with two shining performances.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the present scenario there are only two ways to write a descent movie One  give the viewers a completely fresh entertaining storyline and Two  surprise them with a novel style of narration using the same old kind of plots. BAND BAAJA BAARAATfollows a bit of both these rules in its execution and thus comes as a clear winner both in terms of entertainment and value of money.First of all its uses the backdrop of a entirely new kind of business in which the lead pair is running a company of WEDDING PLANNERS in which they plan a whole wedding for a fixed amount of fees. Secondly though revolving around the same concept of opposites attract the boy and girl first fight and then fall in love BAND BAAJA BAARAAT comes up with a completely fresh style of narration using the realistic ambiance of Punjabi Families and youth living in the areas of WEST DELHI. The openness found in the narrow lanes of Delhi's famous colonies like Janak Puri has got a huge attraction value in terms of language warmth and daring.The other important merit of the film is the way it defines the word INSPIRATION in the best possible manner. No doubt the writers take the inspiration for their basic plot from the English flick THE WEDDING PLANNER 2001. But here they have only taken the base for their story from the Original film and then have developed their own script on the foundation of that borrowed idea.Coming to the film all together it's a pleasant journey throughout with a highly entertaining first half and a very thoughtfully directed second. The whole narration is so fresh in execution and content that the viewer at once falls in love with the entire proceedings and starts enjoying. Looking at the basic premises where the movie is based i.e. New Delhi it is an extension of the genre introduced by KHOSLA KA GHOSLA OYE LUKCY LUCKY OYEand the recent DO DOONI CHAAR. Interestingly BBB's screenplay has also been brilliantly written by Habib Faisal the director of DO DOONI CHAAR and his script gives its full support to the confident direction of the debutant director Muneesh Sharma.As a team they both are really capable of doing wonders in the near future and I would be eagerly waiting for their next.To be precise BAND BAAJA BAARAAT wholeheartedly belongs to its lead pair of Anushka and the newcomer Ranveer. With their immensely likable chemistry they both deliver superb performances in the movie and leave a highly positive impact on the viewer in the end. Here I would like to admit that with BBB Anushka whom I never took seriously in her previous movies forced me to change my view about her acting skills. She very effortlessly slips into the body of a strong North Campus University Girl who reacts with her brave boyish attitude and speaks with a heavy Punjabi accent.On the other hand Ranveer is simply outstanding in his amazing first time screen appearance and he straight away creates fans out of his viewers. The boy clearly gives you the reason Why he was chosen to make his debut in a Yash Raj Film who are known to be more comfortable with all the big saleable stars. In fact it was Ranveer and his remarkable portrayal of a directionless young graduate in the movie which satisfied me a lot after a long long time and also made me feel like dancing on my seat at several instances. So God willing the boy has a great future ahead. His impressive act even reminded me of another similar kind of superb debut performance given by Arshad Warsi in his first film Tere Mere Sapne released in 1996. Apart from their sparkling youthful performances both Anushka and Ranveer equally excel in their emotional scenes too which says a lot about their real hidden talent. And that's not all since BAND BAAJA BAARAAT also has one the most sensuous emotional and touchy kissing scene ever filmed on the Indian Silver Screen between its leading pair. After a long time I felt a director dealing with the issue of premarital sex with a more thoughtful practical and appreciative approach in our Indian Cinema which is a clear indication of our filmmakers growing in their fearful stance towards the issue.On the music front one starts liking the soundtrack by SalimSulaiman and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya while he is watching the film but I still think that a big universal HIT song could surely have helped the film in a much better way. The songs Tarkeebein Main Te Ainve Ainve Ainve and Band Baaja Baarat are good and do stay in your mind while leaving the theater. In the marriage sequences both Choreography and Cinematography add to the entertaining mood of the film shot in some interesting real locations of West Delhi. And in the supportive performances Neeraj Sood stands out as the Flower Vendor while Manmeet Singh and Manish Chaudhari suit their roles perfectly.In all BAND BAAJA BAARAAT is the most pleasant surprise of the year which entertains many thousand times more than the big budget NO PROBLEM released along with it. But if still the latter gets more success on the box office then it would certainly be a big loss for the viewers themselves in the long run. Finally Yash Raj Films have a winner in their hand and they should continue doing the good work of giving chance to new kind of scripts writers actors and directors to come up with more movies like BAND BAAJA BAARAAT. So you are all cordially invited to take part in this entertaining onscreen celebrations at the earliest.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a long time you get to see a lovestory packaged in a completely fresh manner by Yashraj banner which has a very few dull moments. The debutant director Maneesh Sharma has done an excellent job in his first movie with a debutant actor Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma who is doing only her third movie. The movie though having no big names turns out to be a complete entertainer. The tone of the movie is set by the song 'tarkeebein' right in the beginning. You will realise that Ranveer Singh might not be that accomplished an actor but still he has done a very good job playing Bitto Sharma the carefree lad from Saharnpur studying in Delhi to break away from the clutches of his village agricultural business. On the other hand Shruti KakkarAnushka is a typical girl from Janakpuri Delhi aspiring to be a big wedding planner. The hero heroine meet and starts the business of wedding planning. The movie thereon catches their journey from bottom to top with a lot of twist and turns. The director has tried to make sure that there is not a single dull moment in the movie and handles the storyline very well. The director has also captured the Delhi wedding scene in an excellent manner making this movie even more fun to watch. Ranveer Singh has got great comic timing and surprisingly he is the one who actually makes the movie worth the watch. Some people think that Ranveer is not hero material but he has done complete justice to his role and you couldn't have expected better casting though Manu Rishi was completely wasted as the inspector in the movie. Anushka with all other actors has done a very good job. Though the movie becomes a bit predictable towards the end but still overall it turns out to be a very good watch. Its a must see for people who love seeing fun movies!!".

On the other hand newcomer Randhir was pitch perfect and I simply cannot wait to see him in much more after this. I really hope he chooses the right scripts and fame does not have its way with him but that he has his way with fame.The music was awesome especially the 'Band Baaja Baarat' theme and the show stopping item number 'Dumb Dumb Mast' which in my opinion was so much better yet underrated in comparison to 'Sheila ki Jawani' from 'Tees Maar Khan' which was released around the same time. Of course it's a film released under the Yash Raj banner so the picture quality is topnotch dialogue perfect soundtrack awesome with an as good as it gets script. I definitely recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The French film La Horde doesn't exactly bring a fresh approach to the over saturated zombie genre yet is still entertaining enough for what it is. It benefits from its breakneck pace and intensity and is just as much about character as it is bloodshed. Not that it skimps in the gore department at all though far from it. A quartet of detectives  Aurore Claude Perron Ouessem JeanPierre Martins Jimenez Aurelien Recoing and Tony Antoine Oppenheim find the dead body of a colleague and turn rogue vowing to avenge his death. Unfortunately things don't go as planned first their quarry gangster Adewale Eriq Ebouaney is able to get the drop on them and start torturing them then this big mess becomes an even bigger one when scores upon scores of the living dead start to overwhelm humanity as the apocalypse seems to have begun. While this is all pretty predictable in terms of the script La Horde does manage to entertain by ensuring that its audience never gets bored. It starts quietly enough but soon it's kicked itself into a high gear and has stayed there. Some zombie cinema lovers may take exception to the fact that these are very FAST zombies as well as to the generous array of digital rather than practical carnage but if you don't concern yourself too much with those elements you may find this a reasonable viewing experience. The characters by and large are NOT sympathetic including the cops so the lack of rooting interest may make this hard for some people to follow. Still as in any film with a similar premise there is a certain amusement in seeing cops and crooks alike being forced to team up in order to survive  and as we can see the crooks aren't completely one dimensional. The acting is good for this sort of thing. Both Martins and Ebouaney have a formidable screen presence and Martins has one hell of a great exit where he truly goes down fighting. While La Horde may not be among the most stimulating films of its kind  at least in an intellectual way  one could definitely do far worse as it manages to maintain a fever pitch for much of its duration. Seven out of 10.".

A team of angry Parisian police officers vow revenge against a gang lead by two Nigerian brothers who have recently killed a friend of theirs. They lead a seemingly suicidal unsanctioned raid on the gang's compound and are almost immediately captured. As the torture interrogation and killing of police slowly reaches an apex it becomes apparent that the cops and gangsters should probably be the least of each other's worries. Inexplicably zombies are destroying civilization and Paris is burning. Don't be fooled by the complete absurdity of this premise. The Horde though redolent with the usual genredefining campiness and clich is not a selfparody and does not bother to explain itself. Aside from Mr. Romero's more serious efforts I have rarely seen a zombie film which was created with the level of TLC that went into The Horde. Most of the characters actually have their own personalities and the acting is good. The script is though predictable a lot less absurd than the usual horror film and never insults your intelligence. Though the film is not utterly humorless it stops well short of comedy and carries its plot admirably. The visual effects and choreography are excellent. Claude Perron's fight scenes are especially entertaining.".

The difference here is that several of the living engage in fist fights with zombies when a gun isn't handy you don't see that very much. The fights tend to be quick realistic and brutal. That was interesting.The tension between cops and gangsters goes on until the very end adding a bit of a twist to the plot. The acting is good the production values high and the special effects are good and gory. This isn't the backyard zombie movie your brotherinlaw Cletus made with his camcorder and five drunken friends it's a decently budgeted well acted and somewhat original zombie movie with atmosphere.I recommend this film to any zombie flick fan.

	schema:reviewBody "You get a slight impression that the film unfolds without attempting to appease the viewer or tick the conventional boxes of audience expectation. The attempt to exact revenge goes wrong very quickly and before too long zombies flock towards the building. The situation is an unlikely lifeline for the cops who are slated for executed at the hands of their captors. However together they become the hunted. The opening encounter with the infected feels unplanned and realistic a confused and messy affair which causes two opposing forces cops and robbers to adopt a common purpose survival. Obviously its a zombie movie stupid. This is exemplified in a speech by Ouessem when joining rank with the bad guys. None of the characters stood out as immediately likable or otherwise but there weren't any lines or scenes that felt forced or unnatural in light of the film's events. The atmosphere was suitable dark corridors usually do the trick and the sense that in that gloom was something left dripping or neglected encouraged the theme of isolation. The character motives outlive the building siege in the end. Aurore the female lead character is still driven by her original motive and nothing deters her from it. The consistency is done well just because the building has come under attack from the undead doesn't mean the bad guys turn good or that the good guys have to achieve some sort of major character ark. There are moments that connect with the wider zombie genre which are succinct and cruel when several characters mock a zombie with a severed head a grim group mentality is portrayed. Their behavior is challenged by the lead villainMarkudiwho reminds his brother Bola of the horrors back home in Nigeria. Zombie movies typically indulge in the opportunity to show a dark side of humanity. La Horde does this well but also features characters with depth and motive which exceeds the restriction of their confine and current situation. The action scenes are also top notch. There was a spark of dark humor because the fight scenes with zombies were so physical. It was the first time I'd seen such conflict between the zombie and the human. In several scenes zombie buttkicking ensues literally. The final third of the film sees the group shrink. There are a couple of events that show several characters being voluntarily heroic but this is done in an understated way. Those who take the fall on behalf of the group do so while being consistent with their character so heroic acts don't come out of nowhere and don't seem corny.The closing of the film sees the female lead deliver her message not deterred by the zombie siege. This film left me guessing until the end who was going to survive and who wasn't.All in all not the best zombie film but as a grim portrayal of survival with characters that are consistent and action scenes that are slick looking well choreographed and plenty gory not bad at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zombie Films have always been the staple for low budget filmmakers and La Horde is clearly a low budget movie. That is not to say that the director does his level best to disguise the fact.The story is nothing special. It seems to have been constructed with budget in mind so the protagonists are trapped in a derelict tower block. The acting is generally good if a little over the top. The female lead overacts too much and appears overly earnest in most scenes.La Horde has a mix of the Danny Boyle type Zoombies and Romero's shambling Zombies. The makeups are pretty basic with the usual contact lenses and dripping blood. The reason for the outbreak is left unexplored.The film at times loses that allimportant sense of impending doom. The Zombies are too often absent from the unfolding events. This becomes even clearer in the final moments where Zombies are conspicuously absent.The level of gore is enhanced with computergenerated imagery. As yet this technique is still unconvincing when compared with practical onset makeups. Few heads are blown away as our heroes constantly shoot at the body. By the films midpoint you would expect these characters to have learnt by experience.So all in all a fair Zombie movie that is better than most low budget releases but with nothing really new to say or see.".

THE HORDE's storyline is nothing to write home about and the cast is typical for those of us familiar with French cinema like DISTRICT 13. In essence a group of gangsters cops and eccentrics are cooped up in a rundown apartment block and forced to fend off the frenzied attacks of the living dead.The characters are all hardass and the script is littered with toughasnails dialogue but along the way there are some genuinely decent performances particularly from JeanPierre Martins and Eriq Ebouaney whose initial hostility gradually gives way to a grudging respect. But the characters come second to the direction which is all about tense closequarters combat and the filmmakers don't skimp on the bloodshed either. This is a nasty movie in which the zombies are vicious maneaters all the way. There's even time for something new in the form of some breathtaking handtohand combat battles between humans and zombies which are like something out of THE RAID and just as great to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was decent at best but it could have been so much better. The concept tries to be unique but in reality most zombie movies toy with the idea that there are people who have to put aside their differences to survive zombies. Nothing extraordinary they just put crooked cops and gangsters into a large apartment complex. I say crooked because that's how they are described in every synopsis I've read for this film but they never really show why they're crooked. They show up for vengeance and are then quickly disarmed which is really interesting because later the cops fight zombies hand to hand and become expert marksmen.The Horde wastes zero time jumping right into the action which is good because aside from a few interactions between the characters there is nothing but zombie killing. Most of the characters are throw aways save for a few and most fit into archetypes we've all seen in zombie films. You have the principal actors who get some characterization and then zombie meat. In all honesty I don't remember most of the characters names.Now this movie is a solid zombie film except for one thing. The female lead in the film Aurore is atrociously unlikeable. There is nothing about her that makes you want her to survive. She seems to be trying to channel Sigourney Weaver in Aliens Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 and Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil and it just doesn't work. I felt myself rooting for the murderous drugdealing gangsters more than her. And this is a film that does not shy away from knocking off characters brutally and quickly. But for some reason this woman not only survives but is constantly annoying. Aside from that there is an old guy who provides quasicomic relief who turns out to be the most compelling character.If you are trying to decide if you want to watch this film know this. There is a scene at the end that is one of the best death scenes for a character in a zombie movie. Though it is the clich sort of save the others sort of death it is filmed well and it kills off one of the film's best characters in spectacular fashion.".

I say crooked because that's how they are described in every synopsis I've read for this film but they never really show why they're crooked. They show up for vengeance and are then quickly disarmed which is really interesting because later the cops fight zombies hand to hand and become expert marksmen.The Horde wastes zero time jumping right into the action which is good because aside from a few interactions between the characters there is nothing but zombie killing. Most of the characters are throw aways save for a few and most fit into archetypes we've all seen in zombie films. You have the principal actors who get some characterization and then zombie meat. In all honesty I don't remember most of the characters names.Now this movie is a solid zombie film except for one thing. The female lead in the film Aurore is atrociously unlikeable. There is nothing about her that makes you want her to survive. She seems to be trying to channel Sigourney Weaver in Aliens Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 and Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil and it just doesn't work. I felt myself rooting for the murderous drugdealing gangsters more than her. And this is a film that does not shy away from knocking off characters brutally and quickly. But for some reason this woman not only survives but is constantly annoying. Aside from that there is an old guy who provides quasicomic relief who turns out to be the most compelling character.If you are trying to decide if you want to watch this film know this. There is a scene at the end that is one of the best death scenes for a character in a zombie movie. Though it is the clich sort of save the others sort of death it is filmed well and it kills off one of the film's best characters in spectacular fashion.";

One criticism I have seen mentioned in some reviews is the lack of an explanation as to the origin of the Zombie Apocalypse. Personally I quite like this. It just seems to leap out at them all the end of the world no clues no warnings nothing but Hell on Earth. Also please don't be put off with it being a French language film with English subtitles. It works! Don't be tempted to watch the dubbed version available on the DVD because that doesn't work half as well. I must also say that this movie has one of THE best scenes in a Zombie flick since Captain Rhodes' demise in 'Day of the Dead'. It's just brilliant fun see it now!".

People locked up in a building while Chaos surrounds them with only a few social andor political comments.While I'm a huge fan of the original George A.

This is in retaliation for the brutal murder of one of their own and to rescue others held hostage. The raid has unexpected consequences.This movie was off to a great start once the raid of the building commenced. It was very realistic very tough. The criminals were convincingly hardcore and menacing. But this great start slowly began to dismantle as the movie progressed. Eventually it's edge and credibility was lost and it became for me just another farcical zombie movie. What went wrong? A lot of things for me some subtle and not easy to articulate. It seems to me that the decline began when the cops and the criminals decided to join forces. Perhaps because at this point the criminals didn't seem so menacing and in control anymore no longer hardcore. Just terrified and confused. The dangerousness of them had been transfered to the new threat the zombies.Something more concrete is the fact that they kept shooting the zombies in the body or torso when clearly this wasn't working and this after a successful head shot earlier. If it were you or I we would have figured this out concentrated our shots to the head. But the people in this movie never came to this elementary deduction. So credibility was lost because no one is that stupid. My guess is that the director and the writer didn't want the zombies killed too quickly more suspenseful if they kept coming at you. How to do this? Let the people in the movie avoid head shots and common sense.Another thing that bothered me was the introduction of this bloated cartoonish old fart who kept referring to the zombies as chinks. As well there was a scene wherein one guy took on a swarm of zombies all by himself. I did not at all find that credible. None of the zombies got even a nibble for some time. And mind you these aren't the slow legdragging zombies of old. These are the newer more ferocious ones that run as good as you and me.Lastly the advent of the zombies wasn't explained at all. In no time at all zombies were all over the place and humans were extinct or nearextinction. How could the world make such a seachange in such a short span of time? What happened? Was there radiation from a nuclear explosion? Was there a virus? What the hell happened??? Notwithstanding all I've said so far the movie has entertainment value.

Having said that this movie is basically the opposite of the ones I just mentioned. What we're talking about is actually an action movie with the zombie element causally thrown in and that formally transforms it into a survival 'Horror'. Fact is that this movie has no plot no story no development and what's more no thrills and very few scares... There is absolutely no explanation behind the story or the characters' existence actions and behavior or for the 'zombification' apocalypse that befalls all around them. Everything just happens out of the blue and the whole thing feels totally unbelievable and inconsistent. Cinematography and settings aren't eye appealing either of course the ambient is meant to look bleak but it looks pretty cheap too just like the few effects used a couple obvious CG fx 'blood' splattered everywhere firearms wounds and zombie makeup essentially. Acting is passable on average for this kind of movie I guess but it's not like the actors needed to and surely didn't use the Stanislavski's system anyhow given the absolutely shallow dialogs and plot. Ebouaney seemed however to be the most 'credible' so to speak... and solid in his performance. All in all I think this movie brings absolutely nothing new to the genre and if it weren't shot its absence wouldn't certainly have been felt.

Look at her face she seems to make love when screaming her dog to bit the training man. Yes folks she literally makes love through her dog...Outstanding sequence !!! Terrific.

As various soldiers of fortune Tom Berenger  Paul Freeman  among others  used to be the best of friends give a toast  Long live death long live war long live the cursed mercenary this is an adaptation of the original Foreign legion toast and all of them battle side by side in hellhole Africa .This war film packs adventures  largescale blowup  thrilling plot  and lots of action for the most part  but also contains too much dialogue . It's a good mix of actionpacked  adventure  thriller and warfare genre . Overly somber rendition based on Frederick Forsyth's novel  in fact  while researching the novel in the early 1970s author pretended he was actually financing a coup d'etat in Equatorial Guinea  the pretense allowed Forsyth access to a number of underworld figures including mercenaries and arms dealers  Forsyth has since commented that the arms dealers were the most frightening people he has ever met . Frederick is a famous author bestsellers whose novels have been successfully adapted to cinema and TV such as The day of Jackal Odessa and The fourth protocol . Fine support cast who realize professionally competent interpretations  some of them with no more than a line or two to say such as Colin Blakely  Paul Freeman  and brief interventions from JoBeth Williams  Robert Urquhart  Ed O'Neill  Jim Broadbent  Jean Pierre Kalfon  Victoria Tennant  Pedro Armendariz Jr and first cinema film of David Schofield.Good cinematography by Jack Cardiff  who also shot a movie about mercenaries in Africa titled The mercenaries it was filmed on location  as African and Central America sequences were filmed in Belize City Belize in Central America . The motion picture was well directed by John Irvin  though it was originally going to be directed by Norman Jewison. John had previously filmed amidst real life battles when he worked in a television news crew in Vietnam during the 1960s. Irvin once said Unlike most young film directors I've been in battle. Throughout the sixties I went to various war zones and I met numerous mercenaries in Algeria and South East Asia so I had my own personal strings to draw on. I would say our depiction of mercenaries is pretty accurate. We talked to a lot of mercenaries and were able to get a lot of information from them about how they would have handled the operation. As the movie's major battle sequence was directed by director John Irvin and not the Second Unit Director . Rating  Nice picture  better than average . Worthwhile watching .".

I can forgive this since I know what to expect from a Forsyth story but would Mr action fan ? I can just imagine a disappointed ArnieBruceSly fan slagging the movie off for having only two battle scenes  one at the start of the movie and one at the end  so let me point out that if you're expecting to see DIE HARD IN AFRICA it's maybe not you're kind of movie If there's a problem with the movie it's mainly down to the structure of the novel with much of the running time taken up with planning the coup  getting the equipment  hiring the boat etc . I also noticed the dialogue was a bit iffy  Which one of your men do I kill to make way for mine ?  . Things like structure and dialogue don't matter too much on the written page but tend to leap out at you on the silver screen  but as many of the commentators on this page have pointed out it's an action filmpolitical thriller with a brain .

I finally read the book in 2000 somewhere along the way I picked up a used fulllength attention span! I've seen TDOW about five times the last was yesterday Superbowls generally bore me worse than dry clinical novels and I have to say that this is a rarity a movie better than the book. Whether it was Christopher Walken's jerky paranoid performance the superbly shown squalor of the capitol of the country about to be taken or the pathetic teary fear in President Kimba's eyes I was both hooked and pleased by the film version. The Dogs of War isn't a great film or a wellknown one but it was both entertaining and diverting. All a viewer needs on Superbowl Sunday!".

	schema:reviewBody "Frederick Forsyth's novels always lay firm ground for a screenplay adaption and next to Fred Zinneman's 1973 Day Of The Jackal this is the finest of the batch. It is not by any means perfect filmmaking as much of the sequences move along in a very bythenumbers fashion though never clumsily. Director Irvin seems more adept at the handling of his cast. Walken is solid as the coldly pragmatic soldierforhire one of his best suited roles. And he has very convincing support all round.There is very much the sense that the mercenary soldiers involved are bottom of the food chain in the greater and greedier scheme of things and the money being offered for jobs risking life and limb seems pittance at that. The loneliness of the Walken character who seems to walk the land of the dead on civie street and only find his zest in combat is nicely emphasised. Most of the bureaucrats and tyrants are played perfectly for their complete lack of consideration for humanity. There are few if any obvious moral dictations in the narrative and this remains faithful to Forsyth's approach. We are after all not playing with children here. This is a most violent and unscrupulous underbelly of the political world. The violence is matter of fact only stylised in one particular brief scene of torture with a shard of glass that this viewer found to be one of the most painful from any film.The ending is certainly worth the wait as Walken's small fish turns the coup at the heart of the overall plot into a coup of his very own. In this there is something noble amidst the entire desolation of things and it is apparent that the man who wields the gun is always in charge.".

He does it and sees the violence that takes place there and when he returns to US and tells about the evil dictator that dominates there the new job for him is to travel there again and wipe out the incarnation of evil..This film isn't any action film as many seem to have expected  me included  but this is pretty sophisticated but still also little slow moving dir. cut. 15mins longer than the US version portrait about the state of some countries in the world and what these dictators can do to people and country. I'm mostly fascinated by the film's atmosphere and calmness as there isn't stupid gunplay or other usual flaws often found in these films. Walken acts greatly in his role of retired war veteran who takes the job only because of money offered to him. At the end a twist in plot is coming and all the greediness and betrayal in the film gets a new face.The end is little stupid as it tries to imitate Apocalypse Now a little by depicting Walken's face and the horror as Francis Ford Coppola did and the gun fights at the end are also little unnecessary especially when the film managed to be without them for so long. Still the result is satisfying yet little too long and occasionally may make the viewer feel little tired but this film isn't meant to be watched when tired. The US distributor cut the original version by over ten minutes and I saw the original director's cut which includes many important bits of dialogue and things that add to the film. So I recommend the director's cut of the film as it is the directors original version.Dogs of War is pretty intelligent and interesting depiction of power and dictatorship and also very nostalgic in its atmosphere and scenery. The gun battle at the end of the film is great looking and also gripping but as mentioned also little unnecessary and too traditional finale. 710".

Needless to say as an adult I then rewatched the film with new eyes and appreciated it all the more. The movie and the book are very different but you forgive it all the changes made in order to appeal to an American audience and to cut it down to a workable length. Some say it's nihilistic and critical of postcolonial Africa but that misses the point. Shannon and his team come across as absolute mercenaries willing to work for revenge and whomever pays their fee. But in the end Shannon develops a conscience killing the puppet dictator the mining corporation wishes to install in order to exploit the mineral wealth of the country trying to save the journalist who threatens to expose their plot and avenging his murder at his employer's hands. A huge step forwards for a man who when not paid to kill perfect strangers spends his time watching mundane television and playing computer chess a great performance from Christopher Walken a man seemingly dead inside but who actually defies our expectations by doing the right thing. It is only in the heat of battle that Shannon and his fellow 'Dogs of War' seem to truly come alive addicted to the adrenalin and thrill of combat. Yet in the end they care for the people of Africa whilst the refined and civilised corporate executives blatantly do not. What happens to the country after Shannon leaves it? Maybe the Dr becomes yet another dictator corrupted by power? But I prefer to think he does a deal with the mining corporation and uses the money to build a better future for his people?

This showed all the planning and what can go wrong. They make a big deal about the end user certificate. This is used to show the government where weapons are going to end up. This can be avoided by getting a certificate showing the weapons are going to one place and then the weapons are diverted to another location. I loved the ending. The scene where Shannon and men are in the open shooting was something not done in real life but its point was these men were in the glory. This is what they live for. They hate every day life. Tom Berrenger said his wife was pregnant and the thought of watching her just get fat was making him sick. This was the high point of their lives. It seemed for most of the men this was their last mission. Most people don't understand the mentality. These men know they will die sometime but want to go out in a Blase of Glory".

Walken was the lone reason I decided to stick around to watch The Dogs of War when it appeared on TV. It's a real mixed bag as somewhere there is so much potential but what eventuates is something quite hohum. After an excellent buildup the recon mission formulating intrigue tension and harbouring conflict then midway the planning it still remains interesting because of the intensity Walken and Tom Berenger despite stodgy pacing and the last quarter the final assault is uninspiring and rashly staged but the closing frames has a neat touch of irony. There's no knocking that it's more thoughtful and conniving in its narrative drive but the context never truly pushes the boundaries but gladly it never tries to manipulate the situation either. It's interesting seeing Walken's character really have a change of heart after his returns from his recon mission well more so booted out with the bruises to prove it. Director John Irvin really does make you feel uncomfortable during those scenes when it focuses on a badly beat up Walken. It was like fear had engulf his character and then he questions is there's something better in life than what he does but after realising he can't go back the subplot midway with his girlfriend he turns back to what he knows best and the torture he suffered would be a driving force. It almost becomes personal and what he also learns about the devious nature of the American government official he was hired by makes for a powerful climax  the value of human life where he would turn a blind eye but not now. Irvin's direction is competently workmanlike and straightface with a gritty surge stalwart pacing and some striking international locations. Not your typical war film but a decent study.".

They make movies like this all the time.A mega corporation wants the mineral rights in an African country ruled by a ruthless dictator. So the corporation organizes a private army to invade the nation kill the dictator and install a businessfriendly dictator in his place. Is that far fetched or what? Christopher Walken is hired to organize the mercenary army. They do their job except that at the end in an ironic coda they substitute a more independent president who will now rule his country with compassion.The film could have been written by a committee of MBAs who have figured out what the bottom line is. Whatever the bottom line turned out to be it was surely preceded by a dollar sign. The plot goes kind of in this order intrigue a little teaser of violence more intrigue a little completely irrelevant sex more intrigue the introduction to a couple of particularly lethal and ugly guns and a violent shoot out full of explosions. The climactic violence assumes the familiar form of a handful of courageous and supremely skilled military types attacking a garrison of disorganized native troops. Cf. Predator inter alia. One of the mercenaries is killed through an excess of pity. The number of dead garrison troops is uncountable. Walken himself coldbloodedly and deliberately shoots two unarmed men. It's a happy ending though because the guy who finally sits on the throne is a doctor and an idealist and we are compelled to hope he remains that way instead of discovering that hey it's good to be the king.I haven't read Frederick Forsyth's novel on which this movie is based but I can't believe it's the sloppy lash up job that the movie is. Forsyth's details are usually exquisite. When you finish one of his novels you're likely to know how to rig up a bomb that will explode only when the car hits a bump.That was the beauty of Fred Zinneman's The Day of the Jackal. How to commit identity theft for instance. Here all of that tedious business is skipped over. Walken is able to board a freighter posing as a seaman. Where did he get his credentials? Who knows. The producers don't care and we're not supposed to care either. We never heard of forged passports.Just before the invasion the mercenaries are together going over the attack plan one last time and when they are done Walkin raises his fist and shouts the name of the dictator they are about to murder and the other soldiers echo his gesture. And mind you these are supposed to be heroes and we are expected to identify with them. Why don't they raise their fists and cry Money!Not that pelf is the primary motive. What kind of person is willing to kill strangers and risk his own life for money? How do you murder someone whom you don't know and against whom you have nothing? And how do you think of yourself as a better man for having done it? Are there many of them around? I mean in the private sector? There must be some. There is Executive Outcomes and there is at least enough of an audience of fantasists to support a magazine designed for mercenaries Soldier of Fortune. Of course we all seek self satisfaction through doing something that we know we can do well. The Germans called it Funktionslust. It may be innate in higher organisms. But this goes way past self satisfaction. Dignity elevated beyond pride into grandiosity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taken from the Frederick Forsyth novel of the same name. The screenplay is not as good as the book which went into detail about mercenary operations but does do a good job in telling a mercenary tale. Christopher Walken leads a team of Soldiers of Fortune to overthrow a corrupt and brutal coastal African government. Unlike 1978's The Wild Geese this shows a more sinister side of the hazards of being a mercenary. One point in the film in order to make money Walkens character Shannon takes a contract to do a Recon mission on a country. He goes alone and nearly loses his life. When he returns to the states his doctor gives him a rundown on the many wounds and diseases he's had over the years attributed to his profession.  Another point Shannon tells a group of Army regulars that Mercenaries only provide support and tactics and it's actually their fight. If they fold in combat the hired soldier can find themselves in a bad situation. Plenty of explosions along with small arms warfare that includes a unique grenade launching submachine gun weapon. If you're a war film fan you'll enjoy. Other mercenary films to check out are 1968's Dark of the Sun and the above mentioned The Wild Geese.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Dogs of War based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth is an entertaining film that takes its time to get to the action.  Unlike most films of this sort we aren't thrown into the fighting in the first act.  It is wisely saved for the climax.  With that said there is enough along the way to keep you interested although I recommend the longer cut as it contains vital information and character interaction. SPOILERS The film follows mercenary Jamie Shannon from his defeat in Central America to the execution of a contract to stage a coup in West Africa. The film updates the opening from the Biafra war in Nigeria in the 60's to the various civil wars of Central America in the late 70's and 80's.  Shannon and his men are forced to flee when their side collapses and they barely escape with their lives.  Shannon returns home where he is lost without a war to fight.  Enter Endean a representative of a conglomerate that wants to stage a coup in Zangaro an African state.  Their reasons don't become clear until later platinum which is dispensed with an offhanded remark in a phone conversation.  Shannon ends up taking the contract after suffering a brutal beating during his initial reconnaissance. Shannon puts his old team together minus one played by Ed O'Neill. They make their plan gather their resources and launch the coup.  When Endean arrives with the new president Shannon pulls a doublecross.  Now Endean faces a new problem as Shannon departs with what's left of his men.Winston Ntshona returns in a similar role as he played in The Wild Geese that of a deposed leader.  He is quite good in his small role.  Tom Berenger prePlatoon is too overthetop for my tastes.  Paul Freeman of Raiders of the Lost Ark fame makes a credible mercenary.  Jo Beth Williams is a bit wasted especially in the American cut.  She disappears fairly soon after her introduction.  The real standout is Christopher Walken.  He is the cool planner and leader of this pack of Dogs.The final doublecross is a staple of Forstyth's writing and the movie greatly improves that of the original book.  In the book Shannon places his former employer from Biafra in power.  There is no real setup for this in the novel other than the obvious respect he shows the man in the opening chapter of the book.  Here he places Winston Ntshona's character who had a background with the country in power.  It makes far better sense.If you can stay interested at the beginning you will be rewarded by the end.  The main flaws in the action are the Hollywoodstyle gun play rather than authentic weapons handling by trained soldiers.  The film took great pains on technical details up to this point and then just dropped the ball. Still. its a minor flaw.".

Some countries are so unstable they are called LP records as their countries have a revolution every 33 and a 13 minutes. Thus the work of the mercenary is never finished. This movie is called  The Dogs of War  and stars one of the best dramatic actors to date. Many recall his work in ' The Deer Hunter.' In this story Christopher Walken is James Shannon an experienced soldier of fortune and Mercenary for hire. Although he is visibly disenchanted with his work he takes his doctor's medical advice seriously. The doctor has warned him after his last torturous encounter with the enemy he has taken a lot of years off his life. To that end he hopes to take on one more job which may give him enough money to retire. This film tells the story of a group of greedy but traitorous wealthy financiers who hope to stage a Coup d'etat to overthrow president Kimba Illario Bisi Pedro of Zangora and replace him with Col Bobi George Harris an equally despicable character. Entrusted with the job Shannon assembles his elite mercenary team which includes Tom Berenger as Drew a moderate candidate called Dr. Okoye Winston Ntshona and a well trained Cuban force of Zangora rebels. If they fail and be captured they will all be shot and killed. The film is well directed by John Irvin and written by Frederic Forsyth. There is a well charged atmosphere and Walken gives a most stirring performance together the end result is nothing short of a war Classic. Well done! ".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Hupter meiner Lieben or Heads You Win Tails You Lose is a German 90minute movie from 1999 so two more years and it will have its 20th anniversary. The director is HansGnther Bcking and it is one of his earlier career efforts. He is more known for his works as a cinematographer than for his directing efforts. The writer is Karl Boeser and these 1.5 hours were actually his only writing effort as he adapted the novel by Ingrid Noll here. This is the story of two young women who dive deeper and deeper into crime. It all starts with blackmailing then goes on to murder even. The intention however here is to make this duo seem likable in what could be seen as a German approach to Thelma and Louise. Their crimes are merely reactions to rape attempts or blackmailing etc. at least early on. And as if the writer does not have enough material to fit into 90 minutes they included another bloodlusty woman in the second half of the movie. It was probably intended as a very dark comedy but it is rarely working at such. First of all I believe that lead actresses Makatsch and Paul have almost no talent at all when it comes to comedy and little more when it comes to drama. Still you need to say that the script was also not doing them any favors. It all feels very random and very tryhard in terms of the makers' attempts to shock the audience and make them laugh. The title however actually isn't that bad but this is one of only very few positive aspects here. I must say I was glad this is a relatively short movie. The likes of Bohm Luca and von Lttichau maybe the other 2 known cast members add extremely little too apart from more awkwardness. So yeah actually the general premise isn't too bad and I think this could have been a better movie than it actually turned out. I have a feeling though that the novel was already the problem even if I haven't read it and maybe it was impossible to turn a subpar literary work into a really good movie. This is rather the opposite. Besides it is also obvious that this was never intended to be a drama at all as there is no police existing in the world of this film apparently despite all the murders happening. But then it also does not help that they included some dramatic moments and wanted them to be taken seriously like the girls' arguments at times. What else is there to say? I personally am pretty glad it was over this quickly. Not recommended.".

We are obviously supposed to read the film in a 1960's perspective. And considering the political climate in France in the 60's and the nature of Paul Prieur occupation he is a hotel owner therefore a businessman I find it impossible not to read this film as a statement of the impossibility of the bourgeois ideal of happiness.The bourgeois values make people equipped to strive for more but don't give them the emotional tools to deal with their life once they are arrived. The feeling that there must be something more and that this can't be the perfection of life is too easily translated in the feeling that there is something wrong a cheating wife the greatest shame for the latin male and in the creation of a personal hell.It is very significant I think that the film was released at the dawn of the new economy which even more that the traditional bourgeois values leads people to a life of continuous movement and makes them emotionally unprepared to deal with being finally arrived.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul an owner of a lakeside hotel and his naturally flirtatious and beautiful wife Nelly seems to have it all yet beneath the rosy facade there lurks a rotting jealousy eating away inside Paul's unbalanced mind. This is the basic premise of Claude Chabrol's adaptation of HenriGeorges Clouzot 1964 script. The film hinges on two interrelated questions. Was Nell really unfaithful with many men or was it all in Paul's unbalanced mind? Chabrol projects these anxieties from Paul's point of viewleaving the viewer to judge if there is any substance to Paul's jealousy.The film is compelling and the acting is excellent but we never know the real underlying cause of Paul's frightening descent to madness because Charbol complacently skips through the early years of their marriage within the first six minutes. yet all of the sudden Paul is talking with an inner voice in his head out of nowhere. This was one of the film's biggest weaknesses and perhaps Clouzot's original story was not psychological enough for Chabrol to work through in his usual thorough fashion.Moreover we also never know if Nelly really was unfaithful thus compounding the ambiguity of Paul's jealousy. Sometimes the direction is deliberately vague in projecting Paul's point of view blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy. Moreover the 1960s feel of the script is retained by Chabrol in his modernday remaking of the values of that era in the early 1990s. as a result L'enfer is strangely oldfashioned in its portrayal of women and men. The sets and costumes feel anachronistic esp Nelly and her flirty friend. Only Paul and his doctor seem to exist in the early 1990s.The openended existentialist nonendingwas the only way out for Chabrol and Cluzot but perhaps by negating the climax Chabrol did himself a disservice in not resolving the film's many ambiguities. But perhaps that's what Clouzot's intention was. All in all the film is a celluloid embodiment of Satrte's famous line Hell is other people.".

This is in my opinion also one of Beart's best performances. The cinematography is terrific with wonderful contrasts between the idyllic sundrenched locale and the dark tormented and claustrophobic emotional dimension.  The plot is somewhat predictable but the meat of the movie is on the psychological development of the main characters not on what happens next.

At the same time L'Enfer is absolutely a Claude Chabrol film and the fact that it rests comfortably in either canon attests to the lasting parallels between the two masters.As with all of Chabrol's foremost creations this is incisive social commentary masquerading under the banal tag of psychological thriller. Though the film can be enjoyed without any deeper engagement with or meditation on its themes of Othelloesquire obsessionjealousy I think some thought will reveal it to be a far more rewarding film than a superficial viewing might suggest.Situatingcontextualizing the film in Chabrol's vast corpus of work one finds in L'Enfer another nightmarish journey into the hazards of bourgeois sterility. Though one might say that the work is naturalistic in some respects the intense violence that simmers beneath the genteel exterior is revealed in his disdainful disparagement of the neighboring competition that the overreaching emotionally volatile and profoundly sensitive husband is particularly prone to this type of neurosis the telling proclamation of sans fin that closes the film suggests that the narrative is not one of isolated particulars but a general affliction a selfperpetuating tragedy engendered by flawed social mechanisms.Throughout his career Chabrol has been especially critical of the lifedenying entropy and suffocating claustrophobia of bourgeois marriage a plight where the insatiably voracious woman feels her haplessness and subordination most acutely. This in some respects might be his finest evaluation of marriage and erotic love in general. The tensions explored throughout the film are far from novel again we bear witness to the irresolvable Romantic preoccupation the desire to possess and identify with a subjective other. Again as with Les Bonnes Femmes we see the carnivorous destructive male principle eager to subdue asphyxiate smother and ultimately devour irrepressible femininity.Yet lest we distance ourselves from Paul's evident psychosis Chabrol implicates marriage as an institution endorsed by society at large. Note Paul's perverse masochistic pleasure in fabricating these outlandish fantasies particularly the wild reverie of Emanuelle Beart entertaining the entire hotel in the attic. Is this the only way to preserve erotic love in the nauseating ennui of marriage to continually reinvent the Other and through wild imaginings make himher a stranger so as to escape the concreteness of conjugal reality? On another level the film might be read as an Adlerian representation of modern neurosis of a nervous man who is inadequately equipped for the rigours of social expectation whose overreaching demand for absolute order and unity invariably drive him to dementia and a flight from reality. Chimeras of success and masculine authority elude him undermined by personal insecurities and a willful independent wife. How then does he compensate for his lack of control? Refuge in the sadistic alternate reality that he manufactures throughout the movie.Technically this movie is almost immaculate featuring outstanding performances Emmanuelle Beart is a force of nature and repeated viewings affirm that it is a movie of great understanding. I'm not sure if this review made any sort of sense at all but at the end of the day all I can do is urge you to immerse yourself in L'Enfer.".

But it's Chabrol and he's doing his thing. That ain't nothing...As a study of a man's descent from jealousy into madness however the film is powerful and well made but not super subtle.";

We are never 100 certain but what at first seems six of one and half a dozen of the other descends into the 'hell' of the title as the green eyed monster truly comes to fruition. Initially delightful this movie gets as dark as it possibly could and we are gripped even perhaps more than with a Hitchcock as the terrible finale awaits.".

	schema:headline " A film about jealousy and mental illness";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this film many years ago and have watched it again tonight. It is a good film about two topics that don't get much attention. We often see jealousy on the screen but it is often weak humorous selfharming or benign. We see mental illness on the screen but it is rarely combined with something like jealousy. These two elements together form a deadly cocktail.I say two but here there are many small things that make this a recipe for disaster.The couple have or are beginning to have financial troubles. This adds a strain on even the healthiest marriage.  Nelly is a flirt who does things that make render even the least jealous partner jealous or suspicious.  Nelly is a liar. She lies about small things cost of a bag gambling but it's enough to cause suspicion.  Paul is jealous and the thought of his wife with someone else burns him up. This is not a rare trait but many jealous people don't have trust issues. They're jealous if they see something that bothers them but suspicion and mistrust is its own disease.  Paul is suspicious of his wife and does not trust her at all. It does not help that Nelly flirts openly in front of him and lies to him. This fuels the problem.  Paul hallucinates and imagines things. He sees things that aren't there.  The lack of common friends or family means that the couple are in an island of their own misery. Paul has no one but customers to tell him that he's losing it. There are no parents or in laws that could help him with his madness or help him with the truth.The film is intentionally ambiguous with some scenes the boat scene with Martineau which was one of the biggest catalysts to his suspicions and the loss of her necklace which she did indeed lose but we are unsure if it was in the attic or not. The fact is audiovisual hallucinations such as seeing something else on the projector screen or hearing voices from a sleeping woman are one thing but actually picking up an item is something else. Near the end we see a really interesting montage Hitchcocklike a fast cut of imaginations and hallucinations. I wish the film had more of that. I'm disappointed that the film had no ending. It really had no ending showing us a text saying Without end instead of giving us a conclusion. There is no way this couple could keep on going like this. The escalation from mere suspicion to battery and rape was quick within weeks at most. This is an unsustainable relationship and an end in one form or another was near. It' just too bad that we didn't get one.All in all a good film about an interesting topic or intersection of topics.710.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching the stunning film L'Enfer and I couldn't wait to review it. The movie was written by one of my favorite French writers Clouzot so it was bound to be a good movie. Well not exactly. In fact it was not just good but exceptional and is one of the better films I have seen in some time.With my background as a psychotherapist I have to say that it was a brilliant psychological study of madness. All too often films don't get it righthere it's perfect.The story is about a jealous husband. At first he shows signs of anxietytrouble sleeping irritability and distractability. Later this slowly evolves to include paranoia as he begins to suspect his lovely wife of infidelity. Well at this point it MIGHT be that the husband is mildly mentally ill or perhaps he just has a very active imagination. However very slowly the paranoia becomes more and more delusional and it's obvious this is no mild illness. In fact it becomes increasingly obvious he is exhibiting strong symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. However his wife refuses to believethinking instead that he is just a jerk and not potentially dangerous. However he ultimately becomes violent and accusatoryand the violence continues to escalate.So far this is a magnificent portrait of mental illness as this SLOWLY developed and evolved. Unfortunately one inexplicable part of the movie keeps it from getting a score of 10. When he ultimately beats and rapes her she goes to the doctor. When the husband is confronted by the doctor the husband VERY QUICKLY and CONVINCINGLY decompensates. It is obvious to anyone with an IQ greater than 14 that he is VERY dangerous and MUST be hospitalized as soon as possible to protect himself and others. BUT the doctor sends them hometo come back in the morning!!! While it is VERY clever of the doctor to convince the paranoid husband the it is the wife who will be hospitalized I can't imagine any doctor not calling for an immediate ambulance or the police to apprehend and forcibly commit him.Despite this flaw what happens next and the absolute uncertainty of the ending is remarkableyou really aren't sure exactly what happened because it is all shown through the eyes of the husband and his own reality ultimately disintegrates and he is uncertain exactly what has occurred. This blending of paranoid schizophrenia with signs of disorganized schizophrenia was brilliant as some people diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia later become MUCH more more fragmented and irrational. A WONDERFUL JOB BY THE WRITER DIRECTOR and the MARVELOUS ACTOR PLAYING THE TROUBLED HUSBANDWOW what a great and convincing job! Too bad there was that little slipup with the way the doctor behaved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Emmanuelle Bart Manon des sources 1986 Un coeur en hiver 1992 etc. is particularly beautiful in this Claude Chabrol film and entirely compelling in the role of a freespirited wife suspected of adultery and even though her costar Francois Cluzet Une affaire de femmes 1988 does a fine job as a man obsessed with jealousy this turns out to be an almost boring movie.I think the problem is in the ambiguity about Nelly's infidelity that director and scriptwriter Chabrol relied on. Ambiguity by itself does not create tension. Artistic tension comes from an interplay within the mind of the viewer between an anticipated or expected result and its actual delineation. Thus in comedy we know that they will live happily ever after and in tragedy the fatal flaw will lead to something horrible. We can even know the end of the story as in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or in the Swedish film Elvira Madigan 1967 or indeed in any number of war films and still eagerly anticipate how it happens. In fact I think it is always the case that we anticipate the end of a story at least in a general way good will triumph over evil the evil person will get his or her comeuppance the British army will win the war etc. In modern cinema this may not seem always true since the bad guys sometimes triumph as in noire movies. Nonetheless I think the ending of such movies is really what we expect the revelation of the essential unfairness of the world. It becomes then only a question of just how this unfairness manifests itself. As in classic drama the modern comdie noire may be seen as a tragedy with society or the meek or the slow or the trusting being devoured by the wild animals of the city.Regardless here I think it might have been better to clearly reveal Nelly's infidelity or lack of it early on and then focus on its discovery or the revelation of a delusion. Obsessive jealousy is a theme that should work but may be harder to put on film than Chabrol realized. I think too that the character of the irrationally jealous man be made manifest in some collateral way perhaps we should see his insecurity before hand somehow perhaps he should have some obvious shortcoming of appearance or character or there should be something from his past that leads him to irrational jealousy. Clearly an older man with a young and beautiful wife may be jealous in anticipation of the inevitable or any man with a flirtatious wife. This is not necessarily irrational. Bart's Nelly reminds me of Brigitte Bardot from the days of her youth as in And God Created Woman 1957 a naturally warm and sensuous being full of affection for others very beautiful and impossibly sexy. The way Nelly walks and swings herself owes something to Bardot. The psychology of the Roger Vadim film from the fifties advanced the controversial argument that a woman like that needs a firm hand. Here the suggestion is that the husband's jealousy can only lead to pain and disaster and that the only hope is complete trust.What I am trying to say is that the psychology like the tension of the film seemed at loose ends. It is clear before we are halfway through that Nelly really loves her husband the real question being is he enough for her? I also think that Nelly's character should have included something negative in it she seems a little too good to be true something the viewer could relate to perhaps a past infidelity or betrayal.Charbol is a better director than this film might indicate. See the aforementioned Une affaire de femmes 1988 starring Isabelle Huppert as an example of what he can do.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Claude Chabrol's film was shot on various locations in Southern France and was produced by French director and producer Marin Karmitz. It tells the story about Paul Prieur a successful hotel manager who lives an idyllic life with his wife Nelly and their young son Vincent at a lakeside hotel in France. Paul and Nelly have been married for seven years and are happy together but Paul's job is wearing him out and he begins to become suspicious about things. These sudden suspicions gradually increases and when Paul suspects his wife of having an affair his personality alters and threatens both his own and Nelly's life.This visually ardent and characterdriven French production draws a pervasive study of character about a seemingly happy man who one warm summer when suddenly struck by jealousy descends into a state of madness and loses his grip on reality. Claude Chabrol's riveting and wellpaced internal voyage goes far into the excruciating and nightmarish mind of the protagonist and the persistent suspense in this clinical psychological thriller which examines themes such as marriage jealousy and mental illness is reinforced by his precise and acute directing the rigorous narrative structure and the efficient editing by Claude Chabrol's frequent collaborator Monique Fardoulis. The score by his longtime collaborator and son Matthieu Chabrol emphasizes the significant atmosphere in this luminous drama which is impelled by Francois Cluzet's multifaceted acting performance in a complicated role and a good acting performance by Emmanuelle Bart.".

Why would she even spend the night with a crazy man when the hospital is coming to take him to the loony bin the next morning? There's too much deaux ex machina stuff going on here.But the writers did foresee this objection they made her kinda simple a hipswinging flirt oblivious to the effect she has on other men and her increasingly more jealous husband. She even keeps it up when she finds out about his jealous but in her stupidity she thinks it means he truly loves her.There has been another French movie on this same subject with the husband becoming increasingly more jealous. As much as I love these Frenchies with their afternoon delights I find it weird that the French MEN would make 2 great movies about a French MAN becoming jealous. If it's so well accepted why this? Maybe there's a lot of suppression going on.And here's another point well made financial problems can drive you crazy. He was not having a lot of business and his insanity causes him to drive even more away as he rages in full hearing of his guests....and later full sight. Too bad we're not allowed any insight into the origins of his craziness. Those voices don't just come in out of the blue.The woman Emmanuelle was truly beautiful and would have had to have been in order to carry this movie off. His insanity did have some realistic triggers men DID covet her and she sure didn't try to hide her charms. Reminded me of Raquel Welch wearing her skin tight red tshirt in Mother Jugs and Speed then upbraiding the drivers for calling her 'Jugs'. A wee bit inconsistent hypocritical of the characters in both movies.The male actor was superior in showing all the nuances of jealousy on his face running desperately to parallel his wife's waterskiing escapade on the back of the Lothario's boat and finding her getting back on the boat after putting on her shoes. If I know my husband is jealous Im not going to further inflame him by going off with a guy like this. Again she was kinda dumb and childish but that could have been made a bit more obvious.Like the ending. No one knows what really happened. Time for a sequel. This movie was just shown at the MFA in Boston. It calls for a rerun but having been jealous myself it's rather painful to watch.".

Those voices don't just come in out of the blue.The woman Emmanuelle was truly beautiful and would have had to have been in order to carry this movie off. His insanity did have some realistic triggers men DID covet her and she sure didn't try to hide her charms. Reminded me of Raquel Welch wearing her skin tight red tshirt in Mother Jugs and Speed then upbraiding the drivers for calling her 'Jugs'. A wee bit inconsistent hypocritical of the characters in both movies.The male actor was superior in showing all the nuances of jealousy on his face running desperately to parallel his wife's waterskiing escapade on the back of the Lothario's boat and finding her getting back on the boat after putting on her shoes. If I know my husband is jealous Im not going to further inflame him by going off with a guy like this. Again she was kinda dumb and childish but that could have been made a bit more obvious.Like the ending. No one knows what really happened. Time for a sequel. This movie was just shown at the MFA in Boston. It calls for a rerun but having been jealous myself it's rather painful to watch.";

I know that i for one would not like people to know i was involved in the making and distribution of this umm...comedy?I know i know maybe i shouldn't be so harsh it is a zombie movie after all....NO ! NO this is without equal THE MOST STUPID MOVIE EVER MADE. I remember being a young petulant youth obsessed with all things zombie back in the days of the video nasty and being lucky enough to come across what was titled Zombi Creeping Flesh. I laughed at so many scenes in this movie i thought i may implode! You know that kinda laughter? The one that stops you breathing the one that hurts? Yea thats the one...Oh OK maybe not but hell this will remain in my heart forever more. Still not sure if this was ever actually a serious attempt at a horror story or a campy fun filled tongue in cheek gore fest like Redneck Zombies Which by the way is actually an awesome movie deliberately poking fun at itself as well as being extremely gory. Dawn of the Dead circa 1978 this ain't... I know dubbing can never recreate the original impact of the scripted Italian dialogue but this movie has lines of absurd proportions falling out of every pore. I mean like LAUGH OUT LOUD lines of complete inanity! Some of the situations the characters get themselves into makes you wonder if the writers found out the cast beforehand and must have been harbouring some kind of grudge to have put the actors through this. There is a complete disregard for any kind of continuity or story for that matter... I also think that there is probably more stock footage of SLOW MOTION ANIMALS SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS than there is actual shot footage by the crew. A Fantastic scene involving the acceptance of the local villagers for the SWAT team ranks high in the many gems within. Slow motion desert dwelling animals in the very depths of the rain forest is an indication that Mattei had long since given up. The gore is aplenty as long as you see the fully uncut version with a blatant DOTD embassy storming  substituting tenement blocks for government offices . There is a lot of gore mainly ranging from the above average to the downright silly. Soundtrack is Goblin so therefore fantastic by default. Though several pieces lifted from DOTD...not necessarily a bad thing. Watch this movie with the view that it is going to be BAD VERY BAD and i think you will enjoy it. It is THE best of the the worst in the wide range of poor 70s80s zombie movies just because of the sheer downright laziness involved. There are plenty more stinkers out there but this just pips them all.".

But for some reason alot of people hate movies with the name Bruno Mattei on it. Hell of the Living Dead has been put down and made fun of by so many. Why? I saw Night of the Zombies years ago on VHS and was hooked. The movie written by Claudio Fragasso Zombie 3 Rats Beyond Darkness AfterDeath etc.. is a complete rip off of Dawn of the Dead with Goblin Music taken from Dawn of the Dead  Luigi Cozzi's Toxic Spawn a swat team etc. So its a rip off Who cares. The movie is awesome. Where else are you going to see a swat member dress up in drag only to be eaten by zombies. The characters are hilarious! My favorite member is the swat member with long brown hair Guess I'm not on the menu after all!. The dubbing is so bad it rules! The acting is hilarious and fun. The story is basically the same Government project gone wrong story. FX are cheesy yet fun to watch. This title is pure cheese but great cheese!Thank god Anchor Bay decided to pick up some Bruno Mattei flicks and rerelease them on DVD. This and Bruno Mattei's Rats Nights of Terror are now out and they are definate Must Have titles. If you want a serious zombie flick look elsewhere. But Hell of the Living Dead rules! Now if Anchor Bay can pick up the Lucio FulciBruno Mattei Zombie 3 rights and put it on DVD!!".

I personally don't believe that this film is as bad as some people have made out. It is by no means on par with any of Romero's or Fulci's work yet I don't feel it deserves to be totally writtenoff. 'Creeping Flesh' is certainly a lot more fulfilling than 'Zombie Holocaust' for example and a great deal more 'gungho'. It just fails though because it is alarmingly 'corny' and very derivate of so much that stood before it.

After a chemical leak at the Hope Centre in New Guinea  an enterprise devoted to feeding underdeveloped countries turns its staff into flesheating zombies  there a special force led by Mike London Jose Gras 0r Robert O'Neil are sent to investigate it . They run into a TV news crew led by celebrity journalist Evelyn Newton  who are after the same news . As a female reporter and her cameraman boyfriend team up with a fourman commando unit in the New Guinea jungle whom are fighting flesheating zombies . Then  the group discovers that the entire country has been overrun by zombies .Gory gruesome  pretty repellent  and ghastly cannibal feast in which the stumbling flesheating stiffs and can be only destroyed by fire in the head . Unrelenting shockfeast plenty of disturbing images laced with brief touches of black humor . Army of Zombies appearance roaming the countryside  village and some people besieged inside a mansion and a factory deliver the goods  enough to be interesting . Bruno Mattei's main great success is regularly directed with startling visual content and acceptable production by Jose Maria Cunilles  also producing to Mattei and Fragasso a pair of spaghetti westerns titled Scalps and Apache Kid  furthermore special mention to filthy makeup by the craftsman Giuseppe Ferranti. In the first draft Claudio Fragasso had followed the idea of an entire Third World made up of an army of zombies against whom the armed forces of the industrialized nations would have had to fight. However the script had to be altered considerably due to budget limitations. This frightening movie is plenty of thrills  chills bodycount executed by the eerie Zombies and photographed in pallid color with lurid images and passable results . Stock footage from the film Nuova Guinea l'Isola Dei Cannibali was used for the native scenes  it has been recently rereleased on DVD as The Real Cannibal Holocaust. This is an ordinary excruciatingly Zombie film where the intrigue  tension  suspense appears threatening and lurking in the sunny outdoors and every room  and corridors from a house  a shack  a native hamlet  jungle and many other places . At the time considered the plus ultra of thoroughly disturbing movie is less stomachchurning by nowadays's standards yet its fundamental power to thrill remains undiminished. This genuinely frightening story with correct utilization of imagesshock is professionally photographed by John Cabrera on location in Barcelona  Catolonia  Spain . Using yet another alias Vincent Dawn Mattei middlingly directed this Hell of the Living Dead or Virus  a lowbudged zombie picture inspired by other zombie cannibal movies such as Zombi 1978 and Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2 1979. Virus was filmed in Spain and used jungle footage from New Guinea and a patch soundtrack from Goblins Dawn of the Dead soundtrack which was a minor hit in Italy and abroad . ClaudioFragasso the writer of the screenplay also directed one half of the movie he said in an interview .Mattei directed all kind of genres in low budget and exploitation pictures . He eventually had more pseudonyms than any working director in the world. He returned to editing before making another comeback in 1976 with two lowbudget Nazi exploitation films Women's Camp 119 and SS Girls1977 . Mattei followed these taboobreaking films with excursions into porno films and Mondo shockumentaries all directed under his many pseudonyms concentrating on shock value with films such as Mondo erotic 1973 and Libiodomania . Always on the lookout for new exploitation avenues Mattei followed with nunsploitation with the softcore sex film La Monaca di Monza 1980 and the violent sex thriller Guardian of Hell 1981. Both films involved a partnership with writerdirector Claudio Fragasso who helped him write and direct the backtoback productions . After directing two women's prison films starring Laura Gemser  Mattei moved to directing swordandsorcery flicks  starting with I Sette Magnifici Gadiatori 1983. Both Mattei and Fragasso collaborated on the SciFihorror flick Rats  1984 inspired by the futuristic movies of the early 1980s . Mattei considers this his best work despite his still having to work with a very low budget. He worked relentlessly through the 1980s some action flicks and about half of Zombi 3 1988 after Lucio Fulci was taken off the production though Mattei was not credited with it.RatingHell of the Living Dead or Night of the Zombies  Passable  this is one more revolting  foul Zombie horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style . It's just one long unrelenting cannibal feast and average budget terror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits.".

Unrelenting shockfeast plenty of disturbing images laced with brief touches of black humor . Army of Zombies appearance roaming the countryside  village and some people besieged inside a mansion and a factory deliver the goods  enough to be interesting . Bruno Mattei's main great success is regularly directed with startling visual content and acceptable production by Jose Maria Cunilles  also producing to Mattei and Fragasso a pair of spaghetti westerns titled Scalps and Apache Kid  furthermore special mention to filthy makeup by the craftsman Giuseppe Ferranti. In the first draft Claudio Fragasso had followed the idea of an entire Third World made up of an army of zombies against whom the armed forces of the industrialized nations would have had to fight. However the script had to be altered considerably due to budget limitations. This frightening movie is plenty of thrills  chills bodycount executed by the eerie Zombies and photographed in pallid color with lurid images and passable results . Stock footage from the film Nuova Guinea l'Isola Dei Cannibali was used for the native scenes  it has been recently rereleased on DVD as The Real Cannibal Holocaust. This is an ordinary excruciatingly Zombie film where the intrigue  tension  suspense appears threatening and lurking in the sunny outdoors and every room  and corridors from a house  a shack  a native hamlet  jungle and many other places . At the time considered the plus ultra of thoroughly disturbing movie is less stomachchurning by nowadays's standards yet its fundamental power to thrill remains undiminished. This genuinely frightening story with correct utilization of imagesshock is professionally photographed by John Cabrera on location in Barcelona  Catolonia  Spain . Using yet another alias Vincent Dawn Mattei middlingly directed this Hell of the Living Dead or Virus  a lowbudged zombie picture inspired by other zombie cannibal movies such as Zombi 1978 and Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2 1979. Virus was filmed in Spain and used jungle footage from New Guinea and a patch soundtrack from Goblins Dawn of the Dead soundtrack which was a minor hit in Italy and abroad . ClaudioFragasso the writer of the screenplay also directed one half of the movie he said in an interview .Mattei directed all kind of genres in low budget and exploitation pictures . He eventually had more pseudonyms than any working director in the world. He returned to editing before making another comeback in 1976 with two lowbudget Nazi exploitation films Women's Camp 119 and SS Girls1977 . Mattei followed these taboobreaking films with excursions into porno films and Mondo shockumentaries all directed under his many pseudonyms concentrating on shock value with films such as Mondo erotic 1973 and Libiodomania . Always on the lookout for new exploitation avenues Mattei followed with nunsploitation with the softcore sex film La Monaca di Monza 1980 and the violent sex thriller Guardian of Hell 1981. Both films involved a partnership with writerdirector Claudio Fragasso who helped him write and direct the backtoback productions . After directing two women's prison films starring Laura Gemser  Mattei moved to directing swordandsorcery flicks  starting with I Sette Magnifici Gadiatori 1983. Both Mattei and Fragasso collaborated on the SciFihorror flick Rats  1984 inspired by the futuristic movies of the early 1980s . Mattei considers this his best work despite his still having to work with a very low budget. He worked relentlessly through the 1980s some action flicks and about half of Zombi 3 1988 after Lucio Fulci was taken off the production though Mattei was not credited with it.RatingHell of the Living Dead or Night of the Zombies  Passable  this is one more revolting  foul Zombie horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style . It's just one long unrelenting cannibal feast and average budget terror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits.";

The main characters are a beautiful lady who is very interested in primitive tribes who live in a island in which the story takes its place.

	schema:reviewBody "What to say about this movie? Where to start? I think I will begin with the title. I bought it as Hell of the Living Dead. It is also known as Virus Night of the Zombie and Zombie Creeping Flesh. Out of these titles the creeping flesh one and virus fit but the other two do not. Especially the night one. Most of the zombie action takes place in broad daylight. Then there is the stock footage. I know many have commented on it but man there is a lot of it. Here is a little advice to all film makers don't set the movie in a location you can't film in. And if you must use stock footage at least use some different shots rather than just birds and monkeys in the tree tops. Then there is the music. When people say it is just like Dawn of the Dead they aren't kidding. It is exactly the same music and when it isn't music from Dawn it is music from a scifi movie called Alien Containamation and when it isn't music from it it is a combination of both. Then there is the similarities between Dawn and this movie. The swat team the reporters the center at the end and the mall in dawn the situation at the beginning where the swat team is first introduced the elevator scene and so on. The zombies themselves aren't the best in the game. Well some do look rather good but most of them have very little make up. Then there is the swat team who make it through horde after horde of zombie only losing one member this team seems competent then they reach the facilty and proceed to become very easily killed idiots. They aren't very distinct either I think they are all dubbed by the same person.A good point about this movie is the plot. It involves a leak a research facility called Hope. Its nice to have zombies come to life for a reason and as bad as this flick is the end isn't to bad with plenty of gore effects. In fact after the Hope scene the movie cuts to two people attacked in the park and it is like wow this is looks like a better zombie movie about to start! But it is actually the end of this one. You can learn some lessons from this movie though 1 Zombies can only be killed if you shoot them in the head but go ahead and shoot them in the body because it looks cool and you never run out of ammunition anyway 2 When going into an area of stock footage natives get the girl in your party to take her shirt off and dress up like a native does it help no! But if she's willing to do it let her why didn't the horny soldiers not make one comment when she took off her shirt? 3 If your friend is attacked by an apparently dead rat don't lend a hand he deserves to die for being stupid enough to let himself get killed by a rat 4 Don't put your guns down and put on a tutu and top hat and pick up a cane when zombies are in the area 5 When on a beach it is possible to find boats just lying around 6 and finally don't speculate on why everything is happening till you are out of the building where the zombies are this just gives them a chance to gang up on you. In the end this is a bad flick with some areas that are OK. If you have a wicked sense of humor though and like making fun of films then give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1983 I had the misfortune to miss out on seeing this film when a mate rang me to view it only for me to be on holiday. I never got to see it until it's rerelease in 2002! But it was worth the wait.I assume fellow zombie fans have their own rules regarding how the zombies act look etc. and I'm no exception. But this film did break one  only humans should become zombies. The first zombie in this film is a rat which doesn't make sense as the film proceeds into the jungle showing a lot of wildlife footage but no other zombie animals. But at least the director wisely chose not to show the rat chewing on its victim but rather a comical shot of the man clearly squirting a bottle of tomato sauce under his uniform!The zombies in this film look like normal people with grey shoe polish buffed onto their faces along with a smidgeon of blood and they seem to walk in the same unthreatening manner. I mean you would really have to stand completely still to be bitten by them. Twice Zantoro dances in the middle of a horde of zombies and they kinda dance slowly around him when they could easily move in for the kill. Also the bite effect is obviously a piece of meat being held against the actor's limb. A clever but cheap idea.The music is also funny at times twanging synthesiser to love story piano. But all in all I like this film. It's cheap badly dubbed and acted strange locations but plenty of zombie attacks and gore. Just fast forward the jungle scene as it's far too long.My niggles if the Hope Centre is deliberately creating a virus to turn people into zombies then why was it damned as a complete failure?  Osborn puts down his guns and dons a tutu and top hat and dances when you just know there will be zombies around the corner.  Wildlife footage...not required!  One of the native zombies in the jungle is wearing a shirt!  It is established early in the film that zombies die only with a bullet to the head but they still waste ammo to the bodies.  Lia gets covered in blood but does not wipe it off.  The soldiers are on holiday but still require orders. Hmm....  The strongest zombie is an old lady who wrestles London to the ground.  They shoot the kid zombie up against the jeep without damaging it or blowing it up.  Why didn't Josie and her husband who fell into such a deep sleep not even the removal of his intestines could wake him become zombies?  Max didn't become a zombie even though he died in the lift along with Zantoro.  Nice house. But why check out a house?".

Also the bite effect is obviously a piece of meat being held against the actor's limb. A clever but cheap idea.The music is also funny at times twanging synthesiser to love story piano. But all in all I like this film. It's cheap badly dubbed and acted strange locations but plenty of zombie attacks and gore. Just fast forward the jungle scene as it's far too long.My niggles if the Hope Centre is deliberately creating a virus to turn people into zombies then why was it damned as a complete failure?  Osborn puts down his guns and dons a tutu and top hat and dances when you just know there will be zombies around the corner.  Wildlife footage...not required!  One of the native zombies in the jungle is wearing a shirt!  It is established early in the film that zombies die only with a bullet to the head but they still waste ammo to the bodies.  Lia gets covered in blood but does not wipe it off.  The soldiers are on holiday but still require orders. Hmm....  The strongest zombie is an old lady who wrestles London to the ground.  They shoot the kid zombie up against the jeep without damaging it or blowing it up.  Why didn't Josie and her husband who fell into such a deep sleep not even the removal of his intestines could wake him become zombies?  Max didn't become a zombie even though he died in the lift along with Zantoro.  Nice house. But why check out a house?";

And then he kept watching and watching and kept making more comments seemingly in disbelief that an Alist actor could appear in such a Bgrade movie. The movie ended and he sat there with a shocked stare and he said Wow that was awful. I always found it someone funny that despite him feeling that the film is awful he still managed to watch the whole movie. To me a movie can be defined in many ways but entertainment value is  1 on my list. If a movie is entertaining  despite what it may lack in logic in plot in coherence etc  then nothing else really matters. So despite the many negative reviews on Night of the ZombiesViruswhatever you may call it I truly think it's a brilliant film. But only if you're in it for the entertainment value.As everyone else has mentioned the stock footage the plot less plot and the Dawn of the Dead aping are just a few minor offenses this film has to offer to the world. However who can deny how utterly surreal it is to view a scene mostly stolen from Dawn of the Dead the SWAT team scene with the same Goblin or Golbin as the box says music playing in the back ground? It almost works as a parody if only the tone weren't so deadon serious.The film actually looks quite decent and the directing is surprisingly pretty good. The stock footage is hilarious and useless. To establish the fact that we're in a jungle we see footage of monkeys kangaroos and elephants? It adds even more surrealism to the film  the footage doesn't really fit anywhere in the film and the fact that the stock footage picture quality is completely different from the film itself just gives even more evidence that this film is a joke. The dialogue is horrible and the finale is one of the most worthless finales to a zombie movie since Redneck Zombies. How about the scene where the woman gets naked and paints herself up to fit in with some bizarre tribe that is never explained in any other portion of the film? And how about her Frank Zappaesquire camera man? And what about the scenes yes sceneS where one of the SWAT people just runs around in the middle of a bunch of zombies and goes HUH? CAN'T CATCH ME! I WON'T BE ON YOUR DINNER PLATE! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? Priceless.However to the film's credit there is actually a decent amount of cheap gore in this film and the last few deaths are especially priceless. And as I said earlier this film is just pure entertainment given the surrealism I stated earlier mixed in with the fact that this film makes NO sense whatsoever at any given time the story of this film involves radiation rats zombies tribal people elephants global activists holding hostages Frank Zappa etc. If you're not looking for a serious zombie film pick this up. I got it for 3!".

I have watched films that promise zombie gore action and fail. Sure Virus uses the same music as Dawn of the Dead but hey... It's cool music. This movie has just all the zombies and gore I could ask for it's even got a chick that takes off her top. How's that for fun? Sure the characters are stupid there is stock footage of monkeys and the story is almost ripped off. I don't care I for one love zombie flicks and wish there were more of them.Lets be honest this movie is crap. But I was highly entertained.

	schema:reviewBody "Would someone please explain to me why the hell anyone would consider something like Dawn of the Dead or Lucio Fulci's Zombie's 2 superior to Bruno Mattei's masterpiece Hell of the Living Dead. What I've mostly read about this movie is criticism. Hell is ten times better than anything Lucio Fulci ever did bold statement? I don't think so. Lucio Fulci's work is boring the gore scenes are literally the only positive thing. Most Italian horror is a bit on the boring side anyway even Beyond the Darkness the grim masterpiece that it is is a tad boring Hell of the Living Dead is not boring for 70's standards as well as todays. The fact that the score is very borrowed means nothing to me I mean who the hell cares? Stealing Goblin tunes was a stroke of genius. So don't believe the nay sayers Hell of the Living Dead is quality horror.With that out of the way Hell of the Living Dead although far superior fits in quite nicely with it's peers. Besides being better and longer it's a lot darker with a powerful apocalyptic vibe. We begin with some sort of horrible accident at a nuclear plant in New Guinea so naturally a world wide virus breaks out bringing the dead back to life. This nightmare follows a female reporter and some swat team guys trying in vain to make a little sense out of all this. while making their way through the stock footagefilled jungles it takes these people a little longer than usual to figure out that you have to shoot them in the head although they pick it up soon enough. Our desperate crew now encounters a grieving bunch of natives that have lost loved ones to the plague of the dead this is where Hell of the living dead kind of turns into a cross between Day of the Dead and Cannibal Ferox so if you still feel the need to criticize this gory nightmare of an epic then just run along and go watch The Transformers or something. Hell of the Living Dead is a buffet of bad dubbing cheesy violence stolen music and amusing stock footage but none of those things take away from the fact that this movie is dark hardcore and absolutely hilarious. For a more than lowbudget Italian horror movie to accomplish all that considering everything else is quite miraculous. Don't get me wrong I'm sure very little effort or money went in to this but sometimes movies end up with positive qualities that they weren't meant to have if things didn't go how they were originally meant to. That's why they call it a diamond in the rough you know like The Chooper. Hell of the Living Dead along with the title and score among other key elements truly feels like the end of the world. And for a horror movie you can't ask for much more than that. Hell Of The Living Dead was a good idea. Long live Goblin. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Hell of the Living Dead 1980 was another in a long line of Italian made zombie movies. DAWN OF THE DEAD was a huge success so the film makers of Italian wanted to capitalize on it's release. In doing so they created a whole new genre of horror films the Italian Zombie Film. The eurozombie films are different in genre and scope. A lot of them were filmed in Romascope and the zombies moved more like dead people but that doesn't mean that they don't have a vicious streak in them. A lot of them were bad or laughable. Bruno Mattei creates a DAWN OF THE DEAD knockoff with some interesting results.A squad of S.W.A.T. team members have just taken out a group of radicals. They were just trying to get the world's attention about the ever growing dangerous of playing god. After a violent fire fight and earning another paycheck the squad heads out deep into the jungle to aid a group of innocents. When they arrive at the village to escort the people to safety they find themselves in something that all the training in the world could have never prepared them to deal with. ZOMBIES!!!!! What will happen to the squad? Who created these walking corpses? How will the living deal with the dead? To find the answers to these questions you'll just have to watch HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD!!An entertaining movie that's filled with cheesy gore effects and bad acting. Even if this wasn't in dubbed English the acting would still have been bad. Bruno Mattei is an average film maker at best but he does created a watchable movie. Music by Zombie.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw HoTLD I was about 7 years old when my sister's boyfriend rented it on VHS oh those good old days of the VCR era. So after watching it on a Friday night I have to admit that it scared the living hell out of me. There was something about it that terrified me maybe the grainy look or the ominous music or the gory zombie scenes but whatever it was I couldn't sleep for days. Back in 1997 I found a copy on the now late Suncoast video store and without thinking it twice I bought it. Has it ever happened to you that when you're a kid and you see a movie and you like it to the bone then you see the same movie as an adult and it's a total disappointment? Well this is one of those cases heck I even returned the movie. So I Haven't seen it since then until just a few weeks ago a friend of mine gave me his collection of cheap zombie flicks from the 80s and there it was Hell of the Living Dead.The story takes place somewhere in New Guinea where a research facility called Hope is developing some type of chemical that accidentally leaks out thanks to an infected rat turning most of the scientist into flesh eating zombies and the others into their happy meals. Meanwhile somewhere else a team of trigger happy commandos are sent to stop a group of environmental terrorist that have taken hostage an American Embassy I think it was the American Embassy and are demanding that all the Hope facilities be shutdown. The team storms the embassy eliminating the entire terrorists without much effort but not before the leader of the group says his last prophetic words about them being devoured or something like that. Then that same team of commandos is sent to New Guinea where they meet a group of reporters investigating God knows what. There they find that the world has been overrun by zombies as they make their way to the Hope facility to find the answer of this Virus.What makes this movie so memorable is not the story or the FX nor the acting but the amount of material they rippedoff from the much superior Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Director Bruno Mattei who credited himself as Vincent Dawn shamelessly used the same type of uniforms used by the SWAT team in DoTD for the team of commandos in HoTLD and even the same gas masks. But if that wasn't enough he used the exact same music composed by Goblin for DoTD without their permission. Also Mattei used a lot of old wildlife and news stock footage that didn't fit the scenes or the story. The script is incoherent at worst and the zombie scenes are totally illogical to idiotic. There's even a guy who dresses up in a tutu and starts dancing while a horde of zombies storms the room but most idiotic is when the ultra slow zombies approach their victims they just stand there screaming. Although I have to say the beginning is gory and entertaining but after the embassy scene the movie pretty much goes downhill from there.Okay I'm not going to lie. It was a guilty pleasure to watch this retro junk again after so long and even with all its atrocities it deserves some level of merit and it does delivers some horror value well at least when it was released back in the 80s. Interesting note is that this movie has many different titles such as Virus Night of the Zombies Zombie Creeping Flesh and of course the ultra generic title Hell of the Living Dead. So if you haven't seen HoTLD and you don't mind the trashy story the DoTD ripoff or the lame stock footage then you should check it out at least for the gore.".

It has zombies decent makeup fx cool weaponry though apparently few if any of the automatic weapons were actually modified to work with blanks oh yeah and gratuitous but surprisingly tasteful and artistic nudity. Storyline is standard but the cinematography sets Goblin musical score ripped off from Dawn of the Dead all add up to a great zombie schlock extravaganza. Ignore complaints of stock footage.

Team him up with Toshiro Mifune yojimbio Seven Samurai gorgeous scenery Paulau islands under the light hand of John Borman Deliverance and watch as a simple story grows and develops into a visual feast. There is no leadin to the film all we see is a lone Japanese soldier on a tropical island spotting a life raft and realising he is suddenly not alone and worse his company is an enemy soldier. The initial confrontations are tension filled as the two chase each other around and around their new home in a battle of wits and cunning. Eventually the inevitable happens and they are forced to start living together. Rather than a Disneyish style 'lets all learn to live together because we are all really the same under the skin' cooperation the two have as little to do with each other as possible unless arguing about possession of driftwood in a scene that left me in tears of laughter. Eventually they do cooperate through necessity to leave the island and develop a bond of friendship through adversity only to have this challenged when exposed to the realities of the world outside their desert island refuge. A bitter but unavoidable ending reminds us of the insanities of war. I loved this film because it was totally gripping in a way few movies are I genuinely cared about the characters. It was in some ways like watching 'survivor' in the way the relationship changedonly in reverse so naturally did it happen on screen. Bormans direction was great more of a fly on the wall perspective that made the story all the more involving. This movie deserves to be seen.".

You don't have to understand what Toshiro Mifune is saying to understand this movie.Does war extend to the individual? Trained to kill or be killed two adversaries face off.

There have been many attempts at making movies about people stranded on islands but this one pulls it off in a way no other has.Thsi is a film about not only survival but overcoming prejudice towards ones sworn enemy in a time of war. It is about moving past the fears of what you do not know and using what you do know and the basic need to survive to pull through and band together.I was more enthralled by this movie with almost no dialog than I have been with movies that have won screenplay Oscars. To me this is an example that if you have the right actors the right story and the right setting dialog is not always necessary.".

It is admirable in its bloodyminded focus and with only two actors to cast it's hard to imagine how it could have been any more perfect that pitching wildman extraordinaire Lee Marvin opposite Kurosawa favorite Toshiro Mifune. A genius idea but one that could have failed with a more conventional approach. We are introduced to both antagonists in a neutral way free to prefer which ever one we choose though that is hardly the point and director John Boorman makes it both easy and at times hard to sympathise with either in equal measure. Both actors do a fine job playing mostly emotional and physical roles with great restrain and intelligence. Boorman's direction is perfect rejecting excess stylization in favor of a subtle approach aided by superb photography. You have got to see this at least once simply because for all its visceral thrills it is quite profound without ever trying to be. Because it boasts top performances from two of the last century's greatest leading presences in action cinema. Because though frustrating at first the ending is for once the smartest one that could have been chosen.

	schema:reviewBody "John Boorman's allegorical story of two men stranded on an island during the latter part of WWII is a very powerful and cinematic experience. Boorman approaches the subject boldly providing a mere two characters and opting not to use subtitles when the foreign character speaks. Many films would fail under these circumstances but Boorman works wonders with this one and the result is a fascinating film indeed. There are a few weaknesses such as an ambiguous and abrupt ending and some longueurs in the narrative but on the whole the film is recommended viewing.A Japanese captain Toshiro Mifune and an American pilot Lee Marvin find themselves marooned on a remote Pacific island in 1944. Initially there is understandable hatred between the pair as their nations have been locked in conflict for so long. The Japanese soldier attempts to smoke his opponent out of the jungle the American pilot repeatedly attempts to steal his adversary's fresh water. On and on their feud goes until eventually they begin to realise that they are stuck on this lonely speck of land with noone on the way to rescue them and no chance of survival unless they work as a team. In spite of the cultural and linguistic differences between them the duo manage to construct a makeshift raft and launch out upon the Pacific waves in search of help. After an arduous trip across the sea they come to another island apparently formerly used as a military outpost but now deserted and totally in ruin. Amid the rubble the two men find alcohol newspapers and scissors among other things. After a long overdue shave and a few drinks they seem almost to be returning to the realms of civilisation after their trying ordeal.Marvin and Mifune are superb in largely wordless roles as the two sworn enemies stranded together. Their frustrating inability to communicate is brilliantly interwoven into the story and via gesticulations and expressions the two men eventually manage to get their message across to each other and the audience. The film is visually beautiful with very appropriate Palau Island backdrops used to emphasise the isolation that each man feels. There is an element of comedy about the film too which is cleverly underplayed but very funny if you watch closely. The scene where Marvin urinates on Mifune from the trees is simultaneously vulgar and hilarious also amusing is the scene where Marvin is startled by Mifune and growls for a second I thought you were a Jap! The sequence in which the two men attempt to navigate the ocean aboard their fragile raft is thrilling and culminates in an unforgettable shot of the pair slumped exhausted side by side  a perfect metaphor for the draining and pointless effect of war upon their respective nations. Indeed Hell In The Pacific is full of intelligent allegorical imagery  the experiences of both men can be viewed as a microcosmic representation of the whole Japan vs USA war. Hell In The Pacific is a great film that deserves better recognition.".

	schema:reviewBody "Antiwar movies have come in many shapes and sizes  from the shocking to the satirical from the blunt to the oblique  but few are as simply effective as Hell in the Pacific. At turns suspenseful mysterious cartoonishly funny and touchingly human it boils the conflict down to the adventures of two men on opposite sides forced to share an island but rather than just being a trite allegory it convincingly demonstrates the benefits of cooperation over competitiveness and shows that mistrust and enmity are not necessarily innate.Ignoring the ridiculously abrupt ending Hell in the Pacific is excellent in its structure. Considering that the target audience is going to be Englishspeaking although the experience would not be too diminished for a Japanese audience the story is told in the beginning from the perspective of the Japanese man. The American character is a mere presence amid the trees and the fact that we can understand him is of little consequence because he doesn't say much of relevance. The Toshiro Mifune character is more loquacious even though most viewers won't know what he's saying and Lee Marvin's relative quietness emphasises the wordless savagery of the first half. It's only as the picture progresses and the men become more amiable towards each that they become recognisably human characters. But even this is done more through imagery than words giving us an equally good impression of the two of them despite the language barrier.This telling from the Japanese pointofview is also reinforced in the methods of director John Boorman who often makes the camera Mifune's eyes or keeps him up front while Marvin lurks in the background. Other than that Boorman's style as a director is like a love letter to Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone the latter especially. He gives us gnarly closeups a dynamic rhythm and eyecatching tableaux such as the shot of Marvin and Mifune as they arrive on the second island like statues about to leap into action. It is all very overtly stylised but it is a pretty neat way of keeping this story of such simple elements constantly interesting and engaging.Toshiro Mifune is wellknown to even the most casual of foreign cinema buffs being the favourite star of the aforementioned Kurosawa. It's nice to see him used well in this less familiar context. The only other nonJapanese picture I have seen him in is a bizarre Britishmade Western called Red Sun which is incidentally one of the worst films I have ever seen. You notice seeing him here opposite Lee Marvin he is not a tall man but he makes up for this with his strong presence and irascible energy. But it's not all about the rage. I like here his passively bemused responses when Marvin is ranting at him. Lee Marvin shows his easy capacity for turning a serioussounding performance into something surprisingly comical such as his acting out of throwing the stick and picking it up.Appropriately for a movie of few words music plays a big part in Hell in the Pacific. The Lalo Schifrin score is by turns haunting playful and sometimes teasingly melodramatic. It is an unusually big score for a movie that is otherwise so minimalist but its constant variation and inventiveness suits the action very well. And aside from the power of its message this is part of what makes Hell in the Pacific so appealing. It is all of a piece a mesmerising tone poem on a the fate of humanity.".

It is an unusually big score for a movie that is otherwise so minimalist but its constant variation and inventiveness suits the action very well. And aside from the power of its message this is part of what makes Hell in the Pacific so appealing. It is all of a piece a mesmerising tone poem on a the fate of humanity.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT  If you have not seen this film you should get the MGM released DVD with the director's alternate ending included in the special features.I recently watched this movie for the first time and was enthralled by the story of two men stranded on a deserted island sworn enemies whose countries are at war with one another who are faced with a great dilemma. Can enemies work together to insure their survival under the harshest circumstances or will hate prevail and both men die? It is a very touching story about how friendship is formed out of necessity and fueled by the human survival instinct.At the end of the film Marvin and Mifune escape one island and land on another that had been conquered by U.S. soldiers then abandoned just as quickly in the swift series of battles throughout Pacific islands toward the end of World War II.With supplies left behind on the island the two men get cleaned up and shaven and are able to find something to eat and even find sake on which to get drunk.While drunk Mifune finds a copy of LIFE Magazine which shows Japan losing the war rapidly. Mifune understandably gets upset and angry then he and Marvin get into a drunken argument.In the theatrical release bombing can be heard in the background during this argument and the movie just ends abruptly with an explosion that tragically takes the lives of these enemiesturnedfriends. End of story war is hell now go home.Luckily I was watching the 2004 released MGM version DVD which has the alternate ending that presumably director John Boorman had submitted to the studio as the ending for his film.In this ending no bombing can be heard in the background. Mifune reads the magazine gets upset and the argument takes place. This version however contains no convenient explosion to make it seem like both men became enemies again only to be killed together. The tragedy here happens when both men seem to realize with dialoguefree fantastic physical acting by two legendary actors that despite everything they have been through and despite having becoming friends their place in this world is not meant to be together. They both exchange sad final glances and quietly walk off in opposite directions.I like to think that both men returned home to their respective countries and became actors who went on to star in movies like The Seven Samurai and The Dirty Dozen.This alternate ending is a much more complex more interesting more ironic more tragic and infinitely more satisfying ending than the one that was slapped on the end of the film for the theatrical release. I hope this movie is restored to the better ending and featured as a Criterion Collection release with commentary from director John Boorman some day soon.".

In all these cases you depend on the acting the actors themselves to make it special. And for some that might be enough. It's a unique movie for sure a kind of old Hollywood hangeron in the new Hollywood era. John Boorman had just finished the remarkable Point Blank with Marvin and would soon work on Deliverance and all three have a masculine quality of rising about a hostile world and making it on your own terms.Finally if you do get through it all the last five minutes is importantclumsy and improbable and sensationalist after all that preceded but important. It tries at last to talk about the difficulty of really understanding someone else personally and culturally and about the madness and indifference of war. It's 1968 after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "An American pilot washes up on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. He does not have time to savour his release from the ongoing and bloody war because he finds that he is not alone. His fellow island resident is a Japanese Captain similarly cut off from his colleagues on the island. The Captain has been here some time and has established methods for feeding himself collecting drinking water and a shelter to live in. The arrival of the American immediately puts him on high alert as indeed the sense of being pursued does to the American and a standoff quickly escalates into a battling game of cat and mouse.My plot summary has perhaps made it sound more exciting than it actually is and I can understand viewers who have come to this film expecting tension by the bucket load. However this is not about a thrillaminute narrative where the focus is on exciting the audience but rather it is much more low key and will be of more interest if you look at the characters and how they act and interact  this is where the film is happening and it is where I think we are meant to be concentrating rather than on a specific battle for drinking water. Here we see where the allegory is as the two men are initially fighting one another over turf and resources on this island before eventually coming to an understanding and working together. It isn't as clever as it thinks it is but it is interesting in this regard and does have some very good material in there personally I think the line I thought you were a Jap is a wonderful summary of what the film is saying.Boorman directs well considering how little is happening in the script. He keeps the narrative just about interesting enough while not pushing the meaning to the point where it is too obvious although it is a fine line. Mifune and Marvin are both excellent in this doublehander.

	onyx:emotionText "An American pilot washes up on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. He does not have time to savour his release from the ongoing and bloody war because he finds that he is not alone. His fellow island resident is a Japanese Captain similarly cut off from his colleagues on the island. The Captain has been here some time and has established methods for feeding himself collecting drinking water and a shelter to live in. The arrival of the American immediately puts him on high alert as indeed the sense of being pursued does to the American and a standoff quickly escalates into a battling game of cat and mouse.My plot summary has perhaps made it sound more exciting than it actually is and I can understand viewers who have come to this film expecting tension by the bucket load. However this is not about a thrillaminute narrative where the focus is on exciting the audience but rather it is much more low key and will be of more interest if you look at the characters and how they act and interact  this is where the film is happening and it is where I think we are meant to be concentrating rather than on a specific battle for drinking water. Here we see where the allegory is as the two men are initially fighting one another over turf and resources on this island before eventually coming to an understanding and working together. It isn't as clever as it thinks it is but it is interesting in this regard and does have some very good material in there personally I think the line I thought you were a Jap is a wonderful summary of what the film is saying.Boorman directs well considering how little is happening in the script. He keeps the narrative just about interesting enough while not pushing the meaning to the point where it is too obvious although it is a fine line. Mifune and Marvin are both excellent in this doublehander. They must have both been aware of the meaning of what they are doing but neither loses touch with the fact that they are also still playing out individuals. Some have criticised the ending but personally I just saw it as yet another wider point  this time just reminding us why the journey the two men went on is no use if it is not done at a higher level.A slow film then but one that is much better than I have made it sound here.

	schema:reviewBody "Hell in the Pacific is directed by John Boorman and stars Lee Marvin and Toshir Mifune. It's written by Reuben Bercovitch Alexander Jacobs  Eric Bercovici and the music is by Lalo Schifrin. During World War II two men one American and one Japanese are marooned on an uninhabited Pacific island. In order for them to survive they must find away to coexist and maybe just maybe forget the War and find a way off the island.Intriguing premise and two watchable stars not withstanding Hell In The Pacific is not a particularly great film. Decent? Yes! But the novelty value of a two actor piece with sparse dialogue soon wears thin. The central idea of two racially different characters forced to come together is hardly a new one. It's been done considerably better before this film with the likes of The Defiant Ones in 1958. But Boorman's movie does not lack for invention or trying to veer from the norm. Neither character speaks the other's language so with no dubbing or subtitles the viewers are forced to be part of the unique situation sharing in the frustrations of two people unable to communicate verbally. That both Mifune  Marvin are fine actors physically and with their faces also benefits the piece and the viewers. With both men exservicemen of their respective countries also a notable plus point.The film was entirely shot in the Rock Islands of Palau in the north Pacific Ocean near the Philippines in the Philippine Sea. Visually it is a treat with the blues and greens offering up a beauty that battles the harsh like atmosphere for supremacy. It's impact being that of throwing up a heaven and hell comparison. Yet this pleasing aspect of the film is almost ruined by Schifrin's score. In a piece awash with loneliness suspicion and borderline hatred we really don't need evocative and perky we want threatening and sedate. Which brings us to Boorman's direction which is choppy and unsure what tones work best within the story. It's no surprise to find that the producers wanted to fire him off the project his bacon saved by Mifune's insistence that Boorman stayed on. There is also some consternation with the endings of the film where both available endings have actually caused disapproval in equal measure. In truth neither ending fully rewards the viewer for having spent over 100 minutes with these two men. But for the record I personally like the abrupt one better.Its intentions are honourable and for trying something different it deserves a pat on the back. But too many itches exist within and thus the film is scratchy and never able to achieve allegorical greatness. 610".

I chose HELL IN THE PACIFIC and I was blown away. I'd read up on this film before I sat down to watch it so I knew what to expect but I had no idea that I would be kept watching spellbound throughout what is a slow paced film with little to no 'action' so to speak of.Desert island films have always intrigued me ever since I watched MYSTERIOUS ISLAND as a kid. The most recent one of note was Tom Hanks' CASTAWAY but even that isn't a patch on this movie which is so far my favourite desert island movie. The premise is simple but instantly appealing two arch enemies are trapped together and forced to get along. The plot has subsequently been used in the likes of scifi yarn ENEMY MINE as well as all those films where people are handcuffed together but it was done first and best here.John Boorman was a perfect choice for director. This is a guy who's at home in the wilderness or jungle whether he's making DELIVERANCE or THE EMERALD JUNGLE. He brings the isolation and the beauty of this tropical island to life in scenes matched only by the haunting backdrop of the film's climax. HELL IN THE PACIFIC is a twohander with two actors who can never actually understand each other thanks to their language barrier. This was a genius stroke as it adds to the realism and the intrigue no end. Both actors give great roles. Lee Marvin is Lee Marvin  tough weathered cheeky and likable. Toshiro Mifune has the edge stealing scenes as the gruff dependable Japanese soldier. I absolutely loved his character. Watching these two guys interact is my idea of screen entertainment and the film never disappoints.The tension builds up as the climax approaches and although I was hoping for a happy ending knowing this was an antiwar film I didn't set my expectations too high. The ending is abrupt and unsatisfactory  apparently the result of studio interference  but it doesn't spoil the great little film that has preceded it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A PLACE CALLED GLORY is a European western produced by Spanish and German companies starring an American and a Frenchman with Germans Spaniards and Italians in the cast under the direction of an American director working with a largely SpanishItalian crew. It played theatrically in America in 1966 some months before Sergio Leone's groundbreaking A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS starring Clint Eastwood became the first spaghetti western to get wide release in the U.S. In New York City A PLACE CALLED GLORY opened at a 42nd Street theater on a double bill with MINNESOTA CLAY an earlier Italian western which starred Cameron Mitchell.As Eurowesterns go A PLACE CALLED GLORY is fair to middling entertainment offering a simple plot two appealing heroes some roughedged villains and just enough confrontations shootouts and fistfights to keep the audience's attention until the copout ending. The plot comes in two distinct parts. The title town Glory sponsors an annual gunfight between two top gunslingers. A mysterious Frenchman Pierre Brice shows up to tell the Mayor that he has recently killed one of the scheduled gunfighters and now intends to take his place in the contest. The action then shifts to another town Powder City where the Frenchman goes to bide his time. He befriends one Clint Brenner Lex Barker without knowing that Clint is the other contestant in the gunfight. The two gunfighters are reluctantly enlisted in the cause of rancher Seth Grande who has opened up his land to homesteaders and now faces the wrath of rival landowner Joe Vallone who has hired killers and thugs to push the homesteaders away. Clint had once romanced Seth's daughter Jade Marianne Koch who is now involved with Vallone. Eventually Clint and the Frenchman take on Vallone and his gang. During all this time the upcoming gunfight is never mentioned and seems to have been forgotten about entirely.At about the 65minute mark the situation in Powder City is resolved and the action shifts back to Glory and the impending showdown staged amidst thousands of bloodthirsty spectators. There is some clever staging on display in scenes of the townspeople scrambling for prime viewing spots as the two gunmen slowly stride down the town streets until they turn around the corners from which they'll face each other presumably for the first time building up to a contrived unsatisfying ending. The fact that such a public gladiatorial event a battle to the death has absolutely no precedent in western history did not deter the filmmakers. In fact the idea was later picked up by Hollywood for a western entitled A GUNFIGHT 1971 starring Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash.The film gets by largely on the charms of its two rugged stars Lex Barker and Pierre Brice. Curiously Barker walks around for the entire film without a hat something no other selfrespecting western star ever did. Brice clad in black has handsome continental looks and bears a passing resemblance to Dean Martin. Barker a former Hollywood Tarzan had by this time become a top star in Germany and had costarred with Brice in a popular series of German westerns based on the novels of Karl May in which Barker played pioneer Old Shatterhand while Brice played his Indian sidekick Winnetou.Among the other cast members of A PLACE CALLED GLORY are a few performers who were also in Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS which was filmed in 1964 but not released in the U.S. until 1967. Marianne Koch who plays Jade here was the female lead Marisol in Leone's film. Wolfgang Lukschy had played the patriarch Baxter in FISTFUL and plays the watchful bartender here. Another FISTFUL alumnus Italian western regular Aldo Sambrell is on hand as one of Vallone's illfated gang. Veteran Eurocult actors Jorge Rigaud and Gerard Tichy appear as the rival ranchers Grande and Vallone respectively.".

During all this time the upcoming gunfight is never mentioned and seems to have been forgotten about entirely.At about the 65minute mark the situation in Powder City is resolved and the action shifts back to Glory and the impending showdown staged amidst thousands of bloodthirsty spectators. There is some clever staging on display in scenes of the townspeople scrambling for prime viewing spots as the two gunmen slowly stride down the town streets until they turn around the corners from which they'll face each other presumably for the first time building up to a contrived unsatisfying ending. The fact that such a public gladiatorial event a battle to the death has absolutely no precedent in western history did not deter the filmmakers. In fact the idea was later picked up by Hollywood for a western entitled A GUNFIGHT 1971 starring Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash.The film gets by largely on the charms of its two rugged stars Lex Barker and Pierre Brice. Curiously Barker walks around for the entire film without a hat something no other selfrespecting western star ever did. Brice clad in black has handsome continental looks and bears a passing resemblance to Dean Martin. Barker a former Hollywood Tarzan had by this time become a top star in Germany and had costarred with Brice in a popular series of German westerns based on the novels of Karl May in which Barker played pioneer Old Shatterhand while Brice played his Indian sidekick Winnetou.Among the other cast members of A PLACE CALLED GLORY are a few performers who were also in Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS which was filmed in 1964 but not released in the U.S. until 1967. Marianne Koch who plays Jade here was the female lead Marisol in Leone's film. Wolfgang Lukschy had played the patriarch Baxter in FISTFUL and plays the watchful bartender here. Another FISTFUL alumnus Italian western regular Aldo Sambrell is on hand as one of Vallone's illfated gang. Veteran Eurocult actors Jorge Rigaud and Gerard Tichy appear as the rival ranchers Grande and Vallone respectively.";

	schema:reviewBody "Die Hlle von Manitoba or Glory City and there are many more Germanlanguage and Englishlanguage titles for this film is a West German 90minute movie from 1965 so this one had its 50th anniversary last year already. The two stars in here are both familiar faces as this film came out when Pierre Brice and Lex Barker starred in the Winnetou  old Shatterhand franchise. This film here is also a western but has nothing to do with Karl May. The writers who adapted the novel are Spanish and that's why it is also a Spanish coproduction. The original writer as well as the director Sheldon Reynolds are American. As a whole I would say that this was a pretty generic western film. Nothing about it stands really out even if I must say that Barker is as charismatic as always and Brice is probably giving a better performance than in the Winnetou films. However the story is just very stereotypical and offers little that is not entirely forgettable. A lot of the film has to do with friendship. The relationship between the two protagonists is one of the better aspects of the movie. On the downside though the antagonists and most of the plot are entirely forgettable. The ending also feels like style over substance. And just like the Winnetou films this film here also lacks shade completely in terms of the characters. They are either all good or downright evil. I do not recommend the watch except you are a real diehard western fan. Thumbs down from me. Oh yeah final note It's a color movie not to be taken for granted half a century ago but BarkerBrice weren't doing blackandwhite films at least not at this point.".

	schema:reviewBody "The thing that intrigued me about this movie was the character of Clint Brenner and Lex Barker's portrayal of him. Of course there are the usual Western clichs like a range war the loner coming to town one man facing a whole gang of hired guns or even the gunslinger fight at the end. Though this one has a nice twist in that it is an annual prize fight leaving one contestant dead held by the obviously sensationalist voyeuristic and bloodthirsty population of the town of Glory.Back to Clint Brenner one of the gunslingers He is the essential loner who in a rather funny dialogue verbatim expresses that he chooses not to get involved with other people. Nevertheless he is no sociopath he has got humour and he gets along with people he even helps them if it cannot be avoided. What might be a deficit the fact that it is never explained how and why he got to dislike human company there are some hints though is rather an advantage because the focus is now on how opens up again. In the end there is one maybe two or three relationships he has got. Two scenes are really outstanding in this context. The first is when the wounded Jade tries to ask him to abandon the fight and Lex Barker's facial expression especially his eyes grows suddenly very hard and unforgiving when only the moment before he was very soft. His whole demeanor is saying that he won't discuss this with anybody. The second scene is him lying on the bed just before the fight staring at the ceiling and giving the impression that he is pretty well aware of the fact that this whole business will boil down on either him killing somebody or him being killed with every implication this might hold. I also love how this is contrasted with Reese' his opponents preparations. He is almost carelessly easy and lighthearted about it.".

If you are looking for action you better forget it  it takes more than half of the movie before the movie has its first scene that could be considered a true action sequence. And none of the action is particularly exciting under the direction of Sheldon Reynolds. In fact the material between the action sequences is also tough to sit through since it's so slow and boring. In fairness to Reynolds the script he had to work with was badly written. The story moves at a crawl and although I read the plot synopsis on the back of the DVD case before watching the movie I was more often than not bewildered and wondering what exactly was going on.

And the period  very early 20th century  is an interesting one with the film making several allusions to the new lifestyle that will be made possible by oil.Apparently Rhonda Fleming is in the chorus line in her very first film and Gabby Hayes isn't too annoying in his customary old cootsidekick role.".

	schema:reviewBody "This a John Wayne film like no other. Take it from a huge fan that's seen most of his movies. Although this not classified as a comedy the Duke's turns in a sly performance full of great oneliners and facial expressions that had me rolling. Its action adventure in the oil fields and it's very entertaining and fun. Wayne is Cowboy Dan Somers and he competes with oilman Jim Gardner for oil lease rights on Indian land in Oklahoma as well as for the attentions of schoolteacher turned scandalous book author Cathy Allen. It has a good supporting cast including George Gabby Hayes. You will never see the Duke quite like this in any other role. If you're a fan of the Duke you will love this film. It was originally titled In Old Oklahoma and then reissued as War of the Wildcats.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spanish American War Veteran John Wayne hitches a ride on oil magnate Albert Dekker's private railroad car just as he's putting the moves on traveling school teacher Martha Scott. That sets off a rivalry between them both professional and personal as Wayne gets under Dekker's skin.Dekker's the big kahuna in Oklahoma territory which would soon be admitted under President Theodore Roosevelt to the union. He's crowding a lot of the small operators out of the field and they see in Wayne a leader and savior.Later on when Wayne and Dekker compete with the rival proposals for leasing Indian oil lands they go to the White House where Dekker thinks he's got an inside track with the Interior Department. This leads to one of the three best scenes in the film. It turns out that the Duke served in the Rough Riders. The reunion of Wayne and Sidney Blackmer as Theodore Roosevelt is pretty good who'd have thought Wayne would have had the ultimate inside track.Dale Evans is in the film she has a brief role as a saloon entertainer and sings a couple of period songs. She had not yet met her future husband Roy Rogers on the Republic lot but in fact she was more the westerner than he in real life. He was from a rural Ohio town and she was from Uvalde Texas. Dale also sang with Anson Weeks band before coming west both literally and figuratively.Martha Scott is a good crinolined heroine wooed by both Wayne and Dekker. You will also see Grant Withers in one of his few roles in which he wasn't a villain. Second best scene in the film John Wayne emptying his pistol into Paul Fix who played one of Dekker's henchmen who actually goes a bit too far because of his personal hatred for Wayne. Third best scene the climatic rush to deliver oil by covered wagons and tankers when Dekker buys the pipeline to fulfill the contract. The normally parsimonious Republic studio and its boss Herbert J. Yates broke the piggy bank to stage this one in what was obviously their big budget film of the year. Still plays quite well today.This is one of John Wayne's better films of the forties. He's given good production values in this western and a perfect role for him. Fans of the eternal Duke should not miss this one.".

But he's up against the local little guys who've pooled their assets to get the same rights. Luckily they see in cowboy drifter Dan Somers a guy with the potential to lead them even if he doesn't see that potential himself. Plus Dan and Gardner become rivals over the affections of winsome writer Catherine. That climatic wagon stampede across the flat prairie still has me dizzy. Great action effect that must have employed every stuntman in Hollywood to say nothing about every wagon. Now if Dan Wayne doesn't get to the government office first then the scheming Gardner Dekker gets the oil millions. Okay so Dan's got an edge since the government man likes the ladies more than his duties. But what great rivals Wayne and Dekker make. Each is an imposing presence even if Wayne puts on his best aw shucks act while Dekker keeps an icy calm. And I love it when they duel gimleteye to gimleteye. Still sweetface Martha Scott gets as much screen time as the guys so likely Republic was trying to build her into a star. And of course where there's Wayne Gabby Hayes can't be far behind doing his unforgettable crusty old coot bit. And catch the preRoy Dale Evans bringing down the house with as charming a stage number as many an Amusical. No wonder Roy grabbed her.All in all it's a spectacular action flick even if the romantic interludes get a little tiresome. Wayne sure shows his acting chops more animated than I've seen him. His cowboy Dan goes from just another prairie drifter to harddriving trail boss in really convincing fashion. And though he'd probably hate the word he does it in what amounts to winning fashion. And catch that opening sequence in Gardner's private car. It's unusual and superbly done. Republic popped a bundle for this and it shows up in the colorful crowd scenes thanks to director Rogell and big oil well gushers along with that final stampede. I'm not sure why this unusual oater is so obscure in the Wayne canon. But in my book it's as good entertainment as any of his many horse operas. And for fans of crashing buckboards this is the Promised Land.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Poverty Row studio Republic's intermittent bigbudget efforts War of the Wildcats is a lively if fairly routine western notable for its early 20thcentury setting. Wayne plays Daniel F. Somers formerly one of Teddy Roosevelt's rough riders who finds himself entangled in a loveandoil battle with Albert Dekker. Wayne is fairly amiable here representing the old west and the little man forced to adapt in the face of modern technology and the dawn of big business. Dekker of course represents this future. He drives one of them newfangled automobeels and is erecting oil wells just as fast as he can. He is also dismissive of the native population  he even has one a Cherokee scrub his back as he takes a bath  while Wayne shows them respect and receives it in return. I'm not quite sure how that stacks up today given our knowledge that the treatment of the native American by the old west fell somewhat short of what can be considered fair.Anyway possibly the best aspect of this film is that Dekker's character isn't portrayed as an outandout villain driven only by greed. He is smart and relatively sophisticated and also brave. Anyone who has ever had the experience of working with or for a 'captain of industry' for want of a better term or a selfmade man will probably recognise oilman Gardner's characteristics exactly as those that account for the success of these people. They aren't necessarily bad people just ruthless enough to do whatever is necessary in pursuit of their goals.Martha Scott is a fairly bland heroine  it's difficult to see why such rugged individuals as Somers and Gardner would both be so keen to bed her. Gardner's frankness in this matter is also refreshing given the times in which this film was made. He makes no secret of what he desires from Catherine and doesn't resort to any particular underhand tactics to make his desires come true. Of course he doesn't succeed  it would be another quarter of a century before Hollywood would allow a character like Jim Gardiner to win the girl and the oil.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is also very commonly known as War of the Wildcats. As you watch it the movie sure looks like a Bbut with just a bit more polish a bit longer running time and a bit more in the way of budget. This is because the film is sort of like a transitional film for Wayne. While he played in a ton of Bs during the 1930s around 1939 with Stagecoach he began playing in better and better films. But many of them looked a lot like Bs and felt a lot like Bs. His bigger budget studio projects were still a few years ahead.The film begins with a feminist author Martha Scott leaving her tiny town. Apparently the local prudes were angry at her writing such a scandalous romance noveland you get the impression that it really isn't THAT bad. In fact it really can't be because Scott is a school teacher and never really lived a worldly life in this town. So at the urging of the women she is determined to see the worldand be more like one of her characters. But she is conflicted and isn't quite sure where to go or what to do. Her dull old aunt wants her to live with her in Kansas Citybut when she meets a bigtime oil man Albert Dekker he convinces her to follow him to the oil fields and promises her wealth and excitement. There are two problems with this. First Dekker is a bit of a pig and an egomaniac. Second John Wayne pops into her lifeand back then he was a major hunk. And since he was the star it's not especially surprising where it all ends. In the middle portion of the film Wayne and Dekker vie for power and fight over oil land that the Indians are willing to lease. But Dekker is determined not to play nicelyand seems willing to use some dirty tricks to make sure he alone gets these leases.Overall this is not an especially deep film nor is it very realistic. However it is funand that is very important. Gabby Hayes and especially Marjorie Rambeau provide some fun support and color.".

	schema:reviewBody "Albert Dekker was one excellent actor and in this movie shows he was an excellent action star as well.He and the Duke have one of the fiercest fight scenes ever yet the Dekker character is still ultimately likable even though he is a pretty rotten scoundrel.Siding Duke is his frequent costar another excellent actor George Gabby Hayes.Also siding him as the oil field manager is a terribly unheralded actor Grant Withers as one of the strongest characters on the screen.Martha Scott was one gorgeous and incredibly talented woman to repeat incredibly talented and apparently so recognized by her fellow actors. But for some strange reason she did not become that proverbial household name.Watch her in this movie and you too will wonder why. She is adorable and has a beautiful and extremely expressive face.Speaking of adorable Dale Evans became The Queen Of The Cowgirls and as costar and later wife of Roy Rogers that is how we know her  mostly. But in this movie she is also the sexy and delightful singer and dancer in the saloonnight club. And what a talent! That she became a major star later is a these days surprising and gratifying example of justice. Dale Evans had it all beauty and talent and our hearts.John Wayne gives one of his best performances playing light comedy in much of the first half of the movie and then his expected action hero thereafter.And there is plenty of action beautifully photographed by Jack Marta and beautifully directed by Albert S. Rogell. They make a good team and make this a wonderful film to watch.And to listen to? Well it has both Gabby Hayes and John Wayne singing  not so pleasant but funny.The rest of the listening is very pleasant as two women scriptwriters Ethel Hill and Eleanor Griffin produce a superlative script from the original story by Thomson Burtis. Those three writers have created likable and believable characters who speak delightful and also believable dialogue.Everything works together to produce for us an excellent motion picture experience and you can see it at YouTube. I hope you do. This is a great movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Albert Dekker was one excellent actor and in this movie shows he was an excellent action star as well.He and the Duke have one of the fiercest fight scenes ever yet the Dekker character is still ultimately likable even though he is a pretty rotten scoundrel.Siding Duke is his frequent costar another excellent actor George Gabby Hayes.Also siding him as the oil field manager is a terribly unheralded actor Grant Withers as one of the strongest characters on the screen.Martha Scott was one gorgeous and incredibly talented woman to repeat incredibly talented and apparently so recognized by her fellow actors. But for some strange reason she did not become that proverbial household name.Watch her in this movie and you too will wonder why. She is adorable and has a beautiful and extremely expressive face.Speaking of adorable Dale Evans became The Queen Of The Cowgirls and as costar and later wife of Roy Rogers that is how we know her  mostly. But in this movie she is also the sexy and delightful singer and dancer in the saloonnight club. And what a talent! That she became a major star later is a these days surprising and gratifying example of justice.

Yes he's a ruthless businessman single minded in his drive for success. On the other hand he's competent and he's no coward. Early in the movie he arrives at one of his well sites and is told there's a mechanical problem. None of his workers seem able or willing to fix it. Disregarding his personal safety he climbs a rope to the top of the well and fixes the problem. He's also a close physical match for John Wayne's character with two long fights.

John Wayne as Dan Somers although lacking experience in oil exploration is elected leader of the consortium. This turns out to be a fortuitous choice when the two go to Washington to plead their case before the presidentT.R..

Also Dan offers the Aboriginal Americans a 50 stake in the profits vs. Gardner's 12 12 . T.R. wants to make sure the Aboriginal Americans get their fair share thus decides in favor of the consortium. However if they fail to deliver a given quantity of oil after 4 months the concession will be transferred to Gardner thus providing him with the incentive to impede their ability to deliver in time. Toward this end Gardner buys the oil pipeline from this region to the Tulsa refinery thus forcing the consortium to transport their oil in wooden tanker wagons and makeshift containers in wagonsWhere did they all of a sudden get all of these wagons?.In addition the Cherokee Kid who sometimes works for Gardner has his independent reason to want to sabotage the consortium's efforts.As you might expect a woman is also involved in the competition for oil rights.

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne  Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah USA.An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with Wayne  Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It's based on a story by Thomson Burtis who cowrites the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol.

	onyx:emotionText "John Wayne  Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah USA.An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting with Wayne  Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It's based on a story by Thomson Burtis who cowrites the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 410";

True it is dated in parts Music editing but these are really minor complaints on the whole. The lead character is great really ruthless and a true antihero. Some great supporting cast also with some really unexpected moments. And it takes it's time getting to where it's going which I feel a lot of todays films lack. In 'The Deserter' the characters are given time to breath and it is not until well after the first hour that they inevitably start to die.

	schema:reviewBody "Support Your Local Sheriff director Burt Kennedy takes no time out for either comedy or romance in The Deserter a gritty violent frontier fracas written by western novelist Claire Huffaker. Previously Huffaker and Kennedy had teamed up on the superlative western adventure The War Wagon back in 1967 that costarred John Wayne and Kurt Douglas. This time around Kennedy and Huffaker are dealing with the U.S. Cavalry and bloodthirsty renegade Apache savages on the warpath. The Deserter qualifies as one of those ensemble military actioneers with a diverse bunch of hardcases selected either because they are prisoners or specialists and hurled into the breach to thwart a menacing villain and his army. This beautifully lensed 100minute Magnificent Seven meets The Dirty Dozen oater mixes and matches genres and ranks as a solid shoot'em up bolstered by a topnotch supporting cast of Hollywood veterans who were already western icons. You've got Chuck Connors of The Rifleman fame. You've got Patrick Wayne the son of the biggest western star ever John Wayne. You've got John Ford stock player Woody Strode of Sergeant Rutledge fame. You've got Brandon De Wilde of Shane he was the little boy who chased after Alan Ladd in the final scene screaming Shane! Additionally you're got Slim Pickens Ricardo Montalban Albert Salmi Richard Crenna John Huston and Ian Bannen. This dusty oater is worth seeing just to see these guys assembled against the savage Spanish scenery that substitutes splendidly for the American southwest. War and Peace producer Dino De Laurentiis has lavishly blown a fortune on this western. Although it has formidable production values a great supporting cast strong direction sharp editing and memorable dialogue the one weakness is the lead played by Bekim Fehmiu whose biggest movie was The Adventurers. Fehmiu is appropriately laconic but he lacks charisma. You can believe him as a character because Huffaker and Kennedy have incorporated his nonnative status in the storyline the same way that Warner Brothers use to provide for Australian actor Errol Flynn in their westerns. Indeed a high percentage of people who converted to American citizenship were immigrants during the 19th century. Last but not least prolific Italian composer Piero Piccioni of Contempt has furnished an orchestral score that is reminiscent more of American composer Neal Hefti than Ennio Morricone with its jazzlike melodies. The offbeat thing about The Deserter is that our indomitable hero must led a platoon of marauders into Mexico something that violated international agreements between Mexico and America at the time to wipe out an army of sadistic Indians that threaten not only the peace of white settlers but also innocent Native Americans! Talk about politically correct! Nevertheless The Deserter is a thoroughly enjoyable western that piles on drama at the expense of humor. If you are watching the Mill Creek version prepare yourself for a mangled viewing opportunity as the print is pretty butchered.".

John Huston easily steals every scene as the Calvary General who doesn't mind sending Bekim Fehmiu and his band of misfits on a suicide mission. The desert scenery is exceptional the acting passable and the action strong. This film has some very sharp editing thus eliminating scenes that would do little to move the story forward. It is also one of the least predictable westerns I have seen. Put this all together and you have a rarely viewed film that deserves far more attention.  MERK".

He is then recruited years later by general Miles to help them find and destroy Magnus Tanarngo an Apache warlord who is building a massive apache army to wrest control of the entire US Suoth West.Great acting by Bekin Feihmu as Captain Kaleb. Captain Victor Kaleb is way more badass than Rambo or the Terminator.General Miles is played by the great John Huston. Great supporting cast with Richard Crenna who ironically played COlonel Trautman to Rambo and Ricardo Montblan. More great performances from Chuck Connors as the dynamite wielding priest Chapman. Tattinger the scout is also great.Good music as well. The soundtrack has a jazz feel with more primitive sounding percussion. Very unique. Superb characterization and narrative. Never a dull moment in this film. If you like Westerns or Actin films this is a must watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a social issue picture and an early breakout effort of Bette Davis this movie shines! Miss Davis devours every scene she's in with her typical gusto! And it's her first performance as a Southern belle and contains the famous line Ah'd love t'kiss you but Ah jes washed mah hayuh. Richard Barthelmess plays Marvin Blake a poor sharecropper's son to whom Bette's character Madge is drawn. The only problem is that Richard was thirteen years older than Bette and too old to be playing this part and it shows. This is not helped by the fact that he spends a large part of the picture overly made up. But he does a fine job and when he gets to play a wonderful scene at the end of the movie giving an eloquent speech on behalf of the poor tenant farmers from whom he came he relishes the opportunity! The tension of the movie is contained in Marvin's torn loyalties the division of the haves and the have nots and his physical attraction to Madge.My Mom who watched this movie with me commented that Bette was hyperactive which goes a long way to explain her constant motion! This is a movie that explores feudalism in Thirties America and is a good commentary on injustice. The photography is lovely and it's directed by Michael Curtiz. Casablanca See it if you get the chance and enjoy!".

	onyx:emotionText "As a social issue picture and an early breakout effort of Bette Davis this movie shines! Miss Davis devours every scene she's in with her typical gusto! And it's her first performance as a Southern belle and contains the famous line Ah'd love t'kiss you but Ah jes washed mah hayuh. Richard Barthelmess plays Marvin Blake a poor sharecropper's son to whom Bette's character Madge is drawn. The only problem is that Richard was thirteen years older than Bette and too old to be playing this part and it shows. This is not helped by the fact that he spends a large part of the picture overly made up. But he does a fine job and when he gets to play a wonderful scene at the end of the movie giving an eloquent speech on behalf of the poor tenant farmers from whom he came he relishes the opportunity! The tension of the movie is contained in Marvin's torn loyalties the division of the haves and the have nots and his physical attraction to Madge.My Mom who watched this movie with me commented that Bette was hyperactive which goes a long way to explain her constant motion! This is a movie that explores feudalism in Thirties America and is a good commentary on injustice. The photography is lovely and it's directed by Michael Curtiz. Casablanca See it if you get the chance and enjoy!";

	schema:reviewBody "The Cabin in the Cotton 1932  out of 4 Set in the South this melodrama from Warner deals with the rich plant owners who continue to get everything they want while the poor tenants continue to grow poorer and not being able to feed their children. Marvin Blake Richard Barthelmess grew up as one of the poor kids but after getting an education thanks to land owner Norwood Berton Churchill he's put in the middle of the two sides. THE CABIN IN THE COTTON isn't a complete success but the cast is so good and the direction by Michael Curtiz is so on the mark that you can't help but be entertained. The biggest thing going for the film are the performances with Barthelmess leading the way in his part as the man caught in the middle. I thought the actor did a very good job at being torn by the two sides and you really believe everything that his character is going through. Dorothy Jordan is good as the poor girl who loves him and Bette Davis is grand as the Southern Belle who's also after him. Davis is incredibly beautiful here and she fits the role perfectly and especially the now famous line dealing with her refusing to kiss because she's just washed her hair. Churchill is also very effective in his role as is David Landau Tully Marshall and Henry B. Walthall. The biggest problem with the film is that it's quite predictable from start to finish. Also there's a prologue saying that the producers aren't taking sides in the matter and that they're presenting this film as is it is in life. Well I think having all the poor people being whites was a bit unfair and I do think this takes away from the film. Still fans of the stars will still want to check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The workingman's studio better known as Warner Brothers did most of its social commentary films with an urban setting. Which in itself makes The Cabin In The Cotton a very unique product to come out of this studio. It's not a bad film could have been better in delivering its message with a lighter hand. But what the Brothers Warner did was go back on an old standby.Watching The Cabin In The Cotton this morning put me in mind of a much better film in which Preston Sturges satirized the making of films like these. If you remember in Sullivan's Travels director John L. Sullivan played by Joel McCrea wants to make films like these the epic he wants to do is entitled Oh Brother Where Art Thou. But in order to sell it he's advised to make sure it has 'a little sex'.Which brings me to why The Cabin In The Cotton is remembered today at all. It's because of what Bette Davis brings to the film a little sex. This film was a big milestone in her career as she plays the hedonistic daughter of that old southern planter Berton Churchill who keeps his sharecroppers black and white in virtual peonage.The lead Richard Barthelmess plays a bright young sharecropper's son and Churchill takes an interest in him sending him to school to be educated because he has no son to help run the old plantation. What he does have is one sexpot of a daughter to keep Barthelmess on the side of the rich and privileged instead of finding true love with one of his own class in Dorothy Jordan.Churchill has been systematically exploiting the sharecroppers with high interest and cheating them on price. They in turn have been stealing cotton and selling bits of it on the black market. Henry B. Walthall and Russell Simpson have been leading the quiet peasant's revolt which threatens to get open and nasty. I'd have to say that the ending of the film has a forced and obvious conclusion both romantically and socially but you'll have to see it for yourselves to find out.The Cabin In The Cotton is a dated but historically valid film about conditions in the old Confederacy before the New Deal. But the sex that Bette Davis brings to her role is timeless.".

Bette Davis is a star on the rise in only her first year of her contract with Warner Bros. where she will become a major star.Unlike many silent era stars Barthelmess' problem was not his voice but his acting style. He was just a little too wooden to turn in a truly dynamic performance and this film is no exception. The story is pretty interesting  Barthelmess plays Marvin Blake a sharecropper's son who is educated by the plantation landowner and ends up keeping his books. His loyalty is torn between the planter who is sponsoring him and whose daughter attracts him and the sharecropper families with whom he grew up. The planter owns everything and is always charging high fees and interest via the company store and thus cheating the sharecroppers out of what they need. The sharecroppers have cooked up a plan to short the planter some of their cotton and sell it themselves and reap the rewards.It's really hard to take sides in this film because everyone seems so unsympathetic  both sides are stealing from the other without any remorse or much redeeming value for that matter. It is worth a look if you can find it although it is not yet on DVD.".

Sure her accent is a bit broad but she does a lovely job playing the happygolucky daughter of a rich Southern land owner. Richard Barthlemess plays a poor but decent guy caught between loyalties to the land owner and the sharecroppers he knows and loves. Perhaps the biggest downside to this film is Barthelmesshis character often seems very weak and wussythough he does a great job in the end standing up to both sides. On the plus side the dialog and direction is generally very good and like most Warner films it's great entertainment tied to an interesting social message.

	schema:reviewBody "Corny PreCoder about a peckerwood Richard Barthelmess on a Southern plantation who is torn between the poor cotton pickers and the greedy plantation owner all while falling for the owner's seductive daughter Bette Davis. Davis is the whole show here giving a fun performance that borders on camp. Even her straight lines seem humorous thanks to her risible Southern accent. The movie's most memorable scene is when Bette drawls I'd like to kiss you but I just washed my hair and runs away while a sexually frustrated Richard Barthelmess stares after her. Barthelmess is just short of terrible in this doing all of his acting in closeups of his constipated face. Berton Churchill Erville Alderson and Russell Simpson are all good in supporting roles.It's a film that's hard to take seriously at times but if you stick with it there is a decent 'message movie' here the kind Warner Bros. excelled at in the 1930s. The interesting thing about the movie's prolabor rights message is that while the plantation owner is a villain so are the poor workers. They include a slimeball who forces Barthelmess' widowed mother into marrying him in an unsettling scene. Their leader's another piece of work gleefully planning to blackmail Barthelmess into helping them. So no white hats and black hats here just different shades of despicable. But it's not a movie you watch for the story as much as for the performance of a young and attractive Bette Davis. She's really a treat to watch. My favorite scene is when Bette invites Barthelmess up to her room to seduce him. It's both sexy and unintentionally funny. Which pretty much sums up Bette Davis in this movie and why you just have to see it for her.".

Barthelmess' character is just going' ta schule for larnin' ritmetic. Barthelmess was 37 when he made the film. Guess he musta bin a leetel slow.Beyond that Barthelmess was considered a good actor??? Really? Here he is wooden has an almost constant odd stare that actually made me feel uncomfortable. If I were to give an award for the Worst Actor he'd certainly be a nominee.Aside from the Barthelmess problem this was quite an ambitious film in 1932 and I would imagine not very popular down South! The screenplay was written by a Pulitzer Prize winning playwright. The film shows the evil on both sides in the rural South  the poor sharecroppers often cotton pickers some of whom steal with abandon and the wealthy plantation owners who are ruthless in keeping the poor in their place. While the film says it doesn't take sides it clearly does. Chasing one of the thieves through the swamp with dogs and the resulting lynching is quite powerful. And the climactic scene in a community meeting is done quite well. It's a good script too bad the main actor was of questionable talent.Dorothy Jordan who? gets second billing here and does fine as the poor love interest but Bette Davis  the rich love interest  with third billing is more central to the plot and more interesting to watch. This was Davis' eleventh film...all done in just 2 years! She was learning fast! In the supporting cast Berton Churchill is quite good as the main plantation owner. You'll notice a number of other familiar faces in the supporting cast. But I was particularly pleased to see a wonderful character actor named Henry B. Walthall as one of the sharecroppers. Every time I run across him in an old film I am impressed with his talent.The ending of the film  so optimistic  seems a bit unrealistic considering the tenor of emotions in the town but the screenwriter did set up the things that would need to happen to make such as ending feasible.If it weren't for Barthelmess' acting I'd be tempted to give this film an 8 so we'll have to settle for a 7. It's an ambitious and serious film and they did well...especially for 1932. It won't end up on my DVD shelf but I'll watch it again sometime when it is on TCM again.".

Also see Films in Review October 1974.COMMENT Although the Foreword is careful to point out that this film isn't going to take sides between the planters and the peckerwoods it is pretty clear which side the scriptwriters favor. Certainly the planters do get a few arguments in but Berton Churchill who plays his characteristic role of blustering doubledealing is hardly an ideal spokesman. Still leaving aside the question of the rights and wrongs on either side  which is now only of historical interest anyway  the film has an engrossing story which is just as exciting today as when it was first presented back in 1932. If anything the film is much less dated than the usual plantation drama thanks to the skilled direction of Michael Curtiz which concentrates on a crisp and realistic handling and the script's development of character and its avoidance of some of the more usual melodramatic clichs. Two aspects I like are the genuine affection that obviously exists between father and daughter never overtly stated but plain from their bearing and attitude towards each other and the fact that Bette Davis receives no more than a climactic snub for her sin  actually none of the participants are punished for their crimes. Yes this realistic script is a far cry from the tinselly if idealistically moral reversions of normal human behavior that Hollywood was to turn out under the repressive hand of the Motion Picture Production Code.Curtiz's realistic handling is hampered in the early stages by the use of obvious stock shots and process backgrounds. Fortunately this practice ceases quite early on. Curtiz directs the whole film in short brisk takes superlatively edited by George Amy. Barney McGill's exquisite photography also ranks as a major asset not only for his broodingly atmospheric night scenes and the sparkle and whiteness of the plantation house episodes but for the wonders he has done with Bette Davis. Davis certainly looks most attractive in this madetoorder part of the rich and spoilt daughter. She acts with appealing vivacity too making the most of such lines as I'd like to kiss you but I've just washed my hair! Costar Richard Barthelmess is inclined to overdo the facial expressions indicating indecision and is not too believable as a poor sharecropper he is too wellgroomed and speaks too well but I like him.

	schema:headline " Cabin in the Cotton or How Two Wrongs Still Make A Wrong";
	schema:reviewBody "Described as a political film coupled with love betrayal and valor The Cabin in the Cotton successfully touches on everything that it promises. There is no denying that fact. Bette Davis plays the sultry love interest. Richard Barthelmess plays the hokey dumbfounded man caught in the middle. The stage is set angry plantation owners angry growers but and here comes the first analogy it feels as if The Cabin in the Cotton is a house and while our players and writer may be doing the best they can the foundation of it all was rushed crafted by items found at a refuse lot not new material. This film represents the idea of quantity over quality. Warner head of the studio at the time knew that he could use these raw goods and create a political mafioso about the current American economic standard. The problem which became apparent 15 minutes into the film is that this film has no direction. The cloud of romance is in one corner the air of politics is in another and then we have this deep lacking history of the south that seems to loom all around like a fog  yet none blend together. None built together a strong enough foundation or subsequent walls to make The Cabin in the Cotton anything more than just an opportunity to see Bette Davis use good lines.Watched within a group this reviewer was the only one to question the Cabin in the Cotton point. What was the focus of this film? When did poor construction pass for great filmmaking? From the opening definition of the obscure family to the overhyped courtroom scene in which the point that two wrongs obviously make a right  nothing is defined or developed. But let's begin at the start. Our actors. Bette Davis playing a New York Southerner was worth the 78minutes alone. She was handed some of the greatest lines some of the sauciest scenes and completely went perpendicular to her costar Barthelmess who  honestly didn't feel comfortable going from silent to sound. He was a classic example of a star that may have been big during the silent era but couldn't translate well beyond that. As he lurched around everything in this film he successfully was able to demonstrate that no chemistry was needed to act with Bette Davis. Then with no emotion for nearly  of the film he is asked to inspire at the end. He is asked to raise his voice demonstrate his chops and ultimately fail miserably. If we couldn't believe that he could woo Bette Davis why would I believe that he could inspire a group of angry men? I couldn't. The remaining actors fell into two categories either angry or angrier. There was little sympathy coming from anyone much less our main actors. Again I ask why would I then feel emotion for this film? With our actors causing problems over problems the excuse It was made in 1932 doesn't cut it you are left with the story. Does Cabin in the Cotton work with just the story as our characters again outside of Bette Davis flounder throughout  does this political film work? To me it did not. The lacking construction of developing the poor characters makes this film fail on every level. Director Michael Curtiz obviously working for the Hollywood factory didn't even bother finishing scenes. He provided us with PointA the boy Point B the crime Point C the courtroom and nothing else. There was a random lynching which was used to heighten an already depressed emotion but it failed. When our only reaction between Barthelmess and his crew was anger why would he be upset by a lynching? The consistency just wasn't there. Rumor had it that Mr. Norwood provided an education for Barthelmess' character  but again my argument there wasn't any connection between anyone. No connection between Barthelmess and his ladies none between Barthelmess and the cotton pickers none between him and the plantation owners  nothing. The glue to the film isn't even strong enough to keep our central guys together why would it care about the background? Questions plague this review but they plagued me while watching this film. I understood the political nature of the film I loved Bette Davis' line but everything else was atrocious. There was no redeeming value to this film perhaps political perhaps love story  who knows!?As this review wraps I continue to think perhaps I have misjudged what this film represents. Maybe it was only supposed to be a political film an allegory to the truth of what conditions were like in the south or in the USA but then I think about other films like My Man Godfrey made four years later  and how well developed that film was. Why couldn't Cabin in the Cotton be more like that? Why did our lead actor have to be so horrid at his job? Questions that will remain unanswered through the cinematic time vault. For anyone new to Cabin in the Cotton beware it is worthy of only seeing a young Bette Davis  nothing else.Overall in case it wasn't obvious Cabin in the Cotton was a failure. Davis and her lines allow for one star but that is it. Nothing worked from the acting to the direction to the construction of the film it just didn't work from one scene to the next. The value of this film was missing. What was this film? Political. Love story. Random family? Nothing made sense and while I will remain in the minority I ask you to revisit this film and see what makes it spark. In the end it was a wasted 78 minutes.Grade  out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "Described as a political film coupled with love betrayal and valor The Cabin in the Cotton successfully touches on everything that it promises. There is no denying that fact. Bette Davis plays the sultry love interest. Richard Barthelmess plays the hokey dumbfounded man caught in the middle. The stage is set angry plantation owners angry growers but and here comes the first analogy it feels as if The Cabin in the Cotton is a house and while our players and writer may be doing the best they can the foundation of it all was rushed crafted by items found at a refuse lot not new material. This film represents the idea of quantity over quality. Warner head of the studio at the time knew that he could use these raw goods and create a political mafioso about the current American economic standard. The problem which became apparent 15 minutes into the film is that this film has no direction. The cloud of romance is in one corner the air of politics is in another and then we have this deep lacking history of the south that seems to loom all around like a fog  yet none blend together. None built together a strong enough foundation or subsequent walls to make The Cabin in the Cotton anything more than just an opportunity to see Bette Davis use good lines.Watched within a group this reviewer was the only one to question the Cabin in the Cotton point. What was the focus of this film? When did poor construction pass for great filmmaking? From the opening definition of the obscure family to the overhyped courtroom scene in which the point that two wrongs obviously make a right  nothing is defined or developed. But let's begin at the start. Our actors. Bette Davis playing a New York Southerner was worth the 78minutes alone. She was handed some of the greatest lines some of the sauciest scenes and completely went perpendicular to her costar Barthelmess who  honestly didn't feel comfortable going from silent to sound. He was a classic example of a star that may have been big during the silent era but couldn't translate well beyond that. As he lurched around everything in this film he successfully was able to demonstrate that no chemistry was needed to act with Bette Davis.

She played the perfect villain in this movie.  You just wanted to hate her.  Charlie Sheen Corbin Bersen along with 3 unknown actors at the time Wesley Snipes Dennis Haysbert and Rene Russo.  Snipes was hilarious as Willie Mays Hayes as well as Haysbert as Pedro Cerrano the power hitter who practices voodoo.  The cast was well rounded off with Checie Ross as Eddie Harris the aging religious pitcher James Gammon Charles Cypers and Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle.There were many great one liners and hilarious scenes.  The American Express commercial was classic and here's a couple of my favorite scenesJake Taylor Willie Mays Hayes and Ricky Vaughn are in a bar after a game and discussing the long ball Vaughn gave upTaylor  It wasn't that bad Vaughn Oh yeah?  Name one park that ball couldn't have left Taylor Yellowstone All 3 laughingThat scene was in the theater version and I've seen it in the trailers for the movie but it was deleted in the video version.  I'd like to know why because that was one of my favorite scenes.Oh now you come around But he isn't fooled Eddie Harris on seeing Pedro Cerrano crossing himself.Here's a few bits of trivia on the movieFunny thing was seeing Pete Vukovich as Klu Haywood a first baseman. Mainly because he was a pitcher in the Major Leagues.Catcher Jake Taylor wore 7.  This was the uniform number of longtime Los Angeles Dodger catcher Steve Yeager who was the technical advisor to this movie and played 3rd Base Coach Duke Temple Fitting that Taylor wore his number?.The movie was filmed in Milwaukee and 3 people affiliated with the Brewers were featured  Pete Vukovich Bob Uecker Brewers playby play man and pitcher Jerry Augustine Duke Simms.Was it a coincedence that Miller and Lite Beer was used since Bob Uecker at the time was spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company?This movie is one of the best sports movies around.

This movie depicts the glorious story of a bunch of outsiders and underachievers who finally win some games. And it is told in such a wonderful manner that you can't but root for them on their way out of the slumps. Yes! It is a simple story! But the characters are wonderful the wisecracking Harry Doyle incredibly funny and the finals... well... no spoilers here.My most favorite moment is when oldtimer pitcher Harris is replaced by Charlie Sheens character in the finals. In the first games of the season some diehard fans had given Sheen the nickname Wild thing and sang the famous song. Now the whole crowd is chanting this song as Sheen steps onto the field to pitch his largest enemy. This scene always gives me goosebumps. It is splendid.Many great moments excellent humor and a fate you would wish for your favorite sports team as well  unless you are one of those boring Yankees Bulls or Bayern Muenchen fans...".

	schema:headline " Miracle On The Cuyahoga";
	schema:reviewBody "Major League was six years too early in its prophecy for success for the Cleveland Indians. I'm old enough to remember when they had a good team back in the Fifties. When I was just a small kid large Municipal Stadium known without affection as mistake on the lake used to have 70000 plus crowds because the Indians had such players as Bob Feller Lou Boudreau Joe Gordon and Satchel Paige. But when that team went bad the larger the stadium and they had the largest in baseball looked all the more empty.Terry Pluto wrote a book on the history of the Indians failure called The Curse Of Colavito. In 1959 the Indians finished a respectable second to the White Sox in the pennant race that year with Casey Stengel's Yankees having an inexplicable bad season and a distant third. Rocky Colavito led the American League in home runs and he was the most popular fellow in Cleveland. He became one of a select group of Major Leaguers that year to hit four homeruns in one game. And he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for the batting champion Harvey Kuenn. It was never the same for Cleveland. Which takes us to the futile Indians of 1989 as futile in real life as they start on screen. The team comes into the possession of a new owner former showgirl Margaret Whitton. Her contract with the city specifies that if the team attendance dips below 700000 for the season she can move the team and she wants the warm sun of Miami instead of winters on the Cuyahoga River.Building a winning team in baseball is a lot harder than what you see in Major League. But this collection of goofballs misfits and has beens actually get mad enough and start winning.Major League has a nice collection of players playing ballplayers like veteran catcher Tom Berenger narcissistic third baseman Corbin Bernsen juvenile delinquent rookie pitcher Charlie Sheen known as Wild Thing for his lack of control Wesley Snipes as centerfielder Willie Mays Hayes and Dennis Haysbert as a Santeria observing power hitter. It is the American League so Haysbert probably is the designated hitter. My favorite in the film is veteran manager James Gammon who pulls this collection together for a winning team.Major League is a film for baseball and film fans it so nicely blends the interests. As for the Cleveland Indians when Municipal Stadium closed down and they got a new ballpark in Jacobs Field they actually won a couple of pennants in 1995 and 1997. Of course the process to build the Indians wasn't half as entertaining as Major League is.".

	onyx:emotionText "Major League was six years too early in its prophecy for success for the Cleveland Indians. I'm old enough to remember when they had a good team back in the Fifties. When I was just a small kid large Municipal Stadium known without affection as mistake on the lake used to have 70000 plus crowds because the Indians had such players as Bob Feller Lou Boudreau Joe Gordon and Satchel Paige. But when that team went bad the larger the stadium and they had the largest in baseball looked all the more empty.Terry Pluto wrote a book on the history of the Indians failure called The Curse Of Colavito. In 1959 the Indians finished a respectable second to the White Sox in the pennant race that year with Casey Stengel's Yankees having an inexplicable bad season and a distant third. Rocky Colavito led the American League in home runs and he was the most popular fellow in Cleveland. He became one of a select group of Major Leaguers that year to hit four homeruns in one game. And he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for the batting champion Harvey Kuenn. It was never the same for Cleveland. Which takes us to the futile Indians of 1989 as futile in real life as they start on screen. The team comes into the possession of a new owner former showgirl Margaret Whitton. Her contract with the city specifies that if the team attendance dips below 700000 for the season she can move the team and she wants the warm sun of Miami instead of winters on the Cuyahoga River.Building a winning team in baseball is a lot harder than what you see in Major League. But this collection of goofballs misfits and has beens actually get mad enough and start winning.Major League has a nice collection of players playing ballplayers like veteran catcher Tom Berenger narcissistic third baseman Corbin Bernsen juvenile delinquent rookie pitcher Charlie Sheen known as Wild Thing for his lack of control Wesley Snipes as centerfielder Willie Mays Hayes and Dennis Haysbert as a Santeria observing power hitter.

Cleveland which the song being played over the main titles laughingly refers to as city of light city of magic perhaps they are referring to when the Cuyahuga River caught on fire? doesn't agree with her so she wants to exploit a loophole in her contract with the city which stipulates if attendance falls below a certain level she can take the franchise out of Cleveland. So she goes out and gets herself the sorriest looking group of ballplayers you've ever seen... A Cuban defector because his religion is voodoo who can only hit fastballs Dennis Haysbert the worlds laziest third baseman Think Bernsen as a clean shaven Wade Boggs a catcher with shotout knees Berenger channeling Johnny Bench or Cartlton Fisk a nearsighted pitcher who throws 100 MPH at everything but the plate Sheen and the leadoff hitter who thinks he is Rickey Henderson Wesley Snipes. The movie has a lot of laughs and it's a fun way to waste 90 minutes. Directed by David S. Ward of The Sting fame. Interestingly enough this movie did give the nickname Wild Thing to onetime Philadelphia pitcher Mitch whatshisname who threw a bad pitch to Joe Carter in the 9th inning to lose the '93 World Series to Toronto.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a big baseball fan I was anxious to see this movie. I did enjoy parts of it and got laughs out of Charlie Wild Thing Sheen's character as well as a few others. It was nice to see the poor Cleveland Indians wind up winners too.But in addition to being a fan of the game I am a Christian too and the bias against my faith in this movie was disgusting. Had they done this to any other group I suspect you would have heard an uproar over it.....but Christians are fair game in the film world. Here the dumbest and most annoying player on the team of course is the religious guy Eddie Harris played cartoonishly by Chelcie Ross. He is pictured as a nutcase and a guy nobody likes. On the other hand we have the very likable voodoobelieving Latin American player. His superstitions are given great credence naturally with the voodoo actually being something that has real spiritual power. In the end even Harris starts believing in them! Puhleeze. This film is one of the worst examples of Hollywood's prejudice you'll ever see. It's also sad comment that no one else here points this out.".

I was lucky my mom has one and two so last night I finally sat down and watched it and I have to say that I had a few good laughs here and there. I loved the scene where the guys had their first prayer and the monk set a fire for his little doll that he worships and it set off the sprinklers! Basically Rachel Pheleps is the new owner of the Cleveland Indians after her husband dies and she doesn't like Cleveland. In order to move the team to a warmer climate like Miami she has to have a low audience for the games and she hires the worst team possible. But they prove themselves to be more especially when the team finds out that Rachel wants the team to loose they pull themselves together to win the games! Major League had some good laughs and I would recommend it for anyone even those baseball haters just have a good time. Charlie Sheen really stole the show as Wild Thing! I loved how he had his sleeves cut off all the time even for formal events. Major League is a fun comedy that I'm sure anyone could get at least one good laugh out of.710".

Much of the humor arises out of character moments which keeps it from becoming tired or dated.Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen were hot coming off of the success of Platoon.  Corbin Bernsen was enjoying fame on LA Law.  Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes were relative unknowns who got a chance to shine.  And then there's Bob Uecker!  Uecker is the glue that brings everything together and he gets the best lines in the movie.You can't go wrong with a film like this.  Everything works well and a good time is had by all.

These types of films while short on plot and substance are incredibly funny and speak to the type of humor that is needed to emotionally survive such a long work week 162game season.The film Major League is obviously a comedy as its cast of characters is as goofy as goofy can get. There's the crazy psychopath played by Charlie Sheen the highego strutter Wesley Snipes the crazy voodoo guy Dennis Haysbert the serious playtowin guy Tom Berenger and even the gruff manager who's seen it all and his face never cracks James Gammon. Plus even the eccentric announcer Juuuuuuuuuuust a bit outsideBob Uecker is thrown into the mix. When that nutty lot is thrown together on the field because the owner of the Cleveland Indians wants attendance to drop so bad that she can move the team out of town hilarity ensues!Yet I actually think that what held this movie back a bit dropping it from a four to three star rating was the fact that at times it tried to take itself a bit too seriously. This is best personified in the film's focus on Tom Berenger's character who is the only character that really has any kind of backstory whatsoever. True his inspiration is needed to rally the troops towards the end of the season but all the scenes involving his personal liferomance really just make you wish you could get back to the baseball diamond.Thus although Major League is considered to be one of the classic baseball films of alltime and I will admit it has its share of iconic moments and characters it suffers a bit from wandering too far from the formula that made it that way...comedy. If you don't mind a little clichd sappiness with your humor though you won't have a problem. I recommend watching this film just for the sheer experience of it but don't be expecting the come away with it ranking in your Top Ten.".

Well this team is not as terrible as expected and it is brought to the manager's attention and his plan is to win not only a few games here and there but the entire division. The movie is funny and has a bit more bite to it than the sequel which is basically this movie again without much Reno Russo as Jake's girl and no Wesley Snipes at all as he is recast. For a baseball film featuring the whole underdogs trying to win it all it does fairly well. I enjoyed Charlie Sheen as the pitcher with a wild fastball that gets good by getting glasses.

I think that this movie was made for 15yearold boys!But I also couldn't believe for a moment that the Indians were a real baseball team.  I mean what baseball team would allow themselves to be made fun of this way?Imagine my surprise the next morning when I discovered that the Indians were in fact a real ball club and they really were as bad as they were portrayed as being in the film!  I immediately bought a Chief Wahoo hat and declared myself an Indians fan.Watching this film today is like a nostalgia session.  Cleveland's Municipal Stadium the mistake by the lake built as part of Cleveland's bid for the Olympic games has long since been torn down as was the Brewers' stadium in Milwaukee used for the scenes inside the ballpark.  The Indians though faltering in the 2002 season are still a far better team than they were in 1989.  An odd side note  the San Francisco Giants' last trip to the World Series was in 1954  when they played the Indians!  That was the last time the Tribe won the AL pennant until 1997 when they lost the World Series to the Marlins. Cleveland has actually been cleaned up pretty substantially since the film was released and a few buildings have been added to the skyline.  The Browns even have their own stadium nowadays!There are certainly movies that have better baseball Bull Durham comes to mind but not many that have as much fun with the sport.".

I immediately bought a Chief Wahoo hat and declared myself an Indians fan.Watching this film today is like a nostalgia session.  Cleveland's Municipal Stadium the mistake by the lake built as part of Cleveland's bid for the Olympic games has long since been torn down as was the Brewers' stadium in Milwaukee used for the scenes inside the ballpark.  The Indians though faltering in the 2002 season are still a far better team than they were in 1989.  An odd side note  the San Francisco Giants' last trip to the World Series was in 1954  when they played the Indians!  That was the last time the Tribe won the AL pennant until 1997 when they lost the World Series to the Marlins. Cleveland has actually been cleaned up pretty substantially since the film was released and a few buildings have been added to the skyline.  The Browns even have their own stadium nowadays!There are certainly movies that have better baseball Bull Durham comes to mind but not many that have as much fun with the sport.";

These are the original comedy things added to this great baseball film about the new owner of the Cleavland Indians who wants the team to finish dead last so she can sell the team.  That is until the team which includes Tom Berenger Cornin Bernson Charles Cyphers Wesley Snipes and Charlie Sheen changes all that.  Incredibly funny and it gets better with each viewing.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay the original Major League 1989 was a great movie and the surprise hit of 1989. So it's no surprise that not only did they want to sequelize it but that they toned the humor down to PG level to reach a wider audience. Unlike alot of other sequels most of the original crowd is back including Charlie Sheen as Rick Vaughn and Tom Berenger as Jake Taylor save for Wesley Snipes whose role of Willie Mays Hayes is reprised by thenupandcoming Omar Epps who pokes fun at Snipes' thenrising career as an action film star in a very funny sequence with Jake Ventura.The original film focused more on the story of a bunch of hasbeens and neverwillbes trying to have one last good day in the sun playing for the struggling Cleveland Indians. This sequel follows similar ground with most of the players having gained large egos from their sudden success and not caring much about the game anymore. Major League II seems to like to jump quickly through the story however so you don't get as much of a sense of what's on the line for the team like you did in the original.The film starts with some new characters like a new and arrogant catcher that provide some pretty necessary tension but soon gets rid of them to make way for broader characters like the Japanese outfielder. Perhaps the most irritating is the brilliantly misused Randy Quaid who plays a diehard fan that turns coat on the team when they start to lose. The odd part about his appearance is that his character behaves and acts like a returning character yet there was no sign of him in the first one. He even hangs out with the diehards from the first film remember the three man wave in the stands? but he is totally unfamiliar that he's almost unnecessary.The return of formerturnedcurrent team owner Rachel Phelps is unncessary and seems like a rehashing of the tension created by her presence in the first film. He appearance midway through the film combined with alot of other midmark plot changes makes it seem like the writers and director changed their minds on the story halfway through making the film and tried to weld it all together into something cohesive.There are alot of great lines in this film though and some truly funny parts. I think the major problem with this sequel is that it follows the superb original. If you were to watch it without constant comparison to the first it is a pretty entertaining film and better than alot of other sequels. But I guess it must be hard to followup something so great that wasn't really trying to be in the first place.".

Charlie Sheen is back as Wild Thing the heat throwing pitcher. Unfortunately he has become extremely corporate in his actions and his image. This is due to a marketing ploy to increase his marketability quotient. Towards the end he returns to reality and to his successful on field persona dumping the agent and her requirements. I really like the character of the manager played by Gammons. I don't know if it is just his voice and mustache but his presence his powerful. Alison Doody is back as the ogre of an owner and does it well. David Keith has a almost minor role as an irascible mercenary slugger. He gets his comeuppance when Sheen strikes him out to win the game. Dennis Haysbert is very good as the voodoo worshiping ? superstitious and now a pacifistic do gooder who gives it up when he realizes it doesn't work for him. Omar Epps replaces Wesley Snipes and while I like both actors Snipes was better as Willie Mays Hayes. The appearance of Tanaka is a nice touch and his samurai? principles eventually brings Cerrano out of his funk.".

Charlie Sheen is back as Wild Thing the heat throwing pitcher. Unfortunately he has become extremely corporate in his actions and his image. This is due to a marketing ploy to increase his marketability quotient. Towards the end he returns to reality and to his successful on field persona dumping the agent and her requirements. I really like the character of the manager played by Gammons. I don't know if it is just his voice and mustache but his presence his powerful. Alison Doody is back as the ogre of an owner and does it well. David Keith has a almost minor role as an irascible mercenary slugger. He gets his comeuppance when Sheen strikes him out to win the game. Dennis Haysbert is very good as the voodoo worshiping ? superstitious and now a pacifistic do gooder who gives it up when he realizes it doesn't work for him. Omar Epps replaces Wesley Snipes and while I like both actors Snipes was better as Willie Mays Hayes. The appearance of Tanaka is a nice touch and his samurai? principles eventually brings Cerrano out of his funk.";

You want the film to leave off on a good note and not be inhabited by sequels of lesser quality. Instead Major League did what was predicted and made a sequel that is a PG and not on par with the original and b doesn't include all of the original actors.I could tell from the beginning of the film that director David S. Ward also director of the first film really wanted to get everyone back to do a great sequel. Rene Russo and Wesley Snipes big names in the first film are now absent. Snipes is replaced with Omar Epps who is decent but not as funny as the way Snipes portrayed the character of Willy Mays Hayes.The plot The Indians open up next season confident because of their big surprise last year. But some changes have been made. Rick Wild Thing Vaughn Sheen the team's star player has quit sporting his bad boy image and now has a cleaner act. Jake Taylor Berenger the Indians catcher still has serve knee problems and is on his last leg no pun intended. Roger Dorn Bernsen retired from the Indians to later buy the team from Rachel Phelps. And the team's oddball player Pedro Cerrano Haysbert has converted to Buddhism and is way more of a relaxed player.Major League II is more or less a remake of the first film with some new little perks. The screenwriter didn't want to experiment with much so the film is just the Indians struggling at the beginning of the season to become respectable players by the end once more. When it comes to baseball movies there isn't a whole lot of originality. The end will surprise virtually no one.The character I still find hilarious is Lou Brown Gammon. As well as the character of the Indians announcer Harry Doyle Uecker who has a major alcohol problem throughout the season while announcing the games. Absolute hilarity in both of these actors.One character I grew tired of fast was Isuro Tanaka Takaaki Ishibashi. His on screen actors are utterly atrocious and just unfunny especially when he gets into fights with Pedro Cerrano. The obsessed fair weather Indians fan played by Randy Quaid is nothing but annoying as well.Several things drag Major League II in the gutter but it still is a fair sequel. I feel that this is a beginning of an end though. I feel this is the best sequel to Major League we're going to get. It's sad. But most likely true as I've heard nothing but average to poor reviews of Back to the Minors.Director David S. Ward wants to get Berenger Sheen and Snipes back for a third film but I find that highly unlikely. Berenge has gotten too old and probably lost interest. Good luck getting Sheen to put a pause on his Two and a Half Men drama to do it Snipes is in prison till 2013 and Gammon is dead. Major League III if it will happen is highly unlikely. That is no error. Ward wants the film to be titled Major League III even though chronologically it's Major League IV.Regardless I feel Back to the Minors will conclude the series good or bad. It looks like Major League II will be the best Major League sequel out there. This could've all been avoided if we just left the film alone where it was a funny and clever baseball comedy.Starring Charlie Sheen Tom Berenger Corbin Bernsen Dennis Haysbert Omar Epps David Keith Margaret Whitton James Gammon and Bob Uecker. Directed by David S. Ward.".

The team is back apparently after their magical run they got knocked out very quickly in the playoffs. Somehow Roger Dorn now owns the team and he paid way to much for it he also brought in this free agent catcher to knock in some runs. Well that backfires as does a lot of things as Ricky the wild thang is now throwing garbage and can not get his 100 mph fastball in gear Pedro has mellowed to a considerable degree Jake Taylor ends up one of the managers on staff and all is not right with the world. There are some funny scenes here and there but the original it is not. Not only are some characters simply not in the film like Eddie the aging pitcher some are back and just not like themselves like Dorn who seems to be playing a completely different character. The film focuses more on Charlie Sheen as Ricky and he has some funny moments as does Randy Quaid as a disenfranchised fan. Still it probably would have been best had they not made this sequel it is surprising they made one more after this but I do not think that one did anything at the box office.".

Outlandish however in a good way.First let me tell you that Major League II is a cult classic amongst young baseball players on Long Island. It's like an unspoken understanding until someone speaks. For example a pitcher might come in out of the bullpen to face a couple of batters perform poorly and then immediately get yanked out of the game...Cue someone on the bench saying Nice game. Others on the bench will instantly begin laughing and then talk about another scene they think of from Major League II. The nice game line is a reference to manager Jake Taylor taking Roger Dorn out of the game following his only at bat of the season...a hit by pitch. Taylor sends Dorn in there to lean into one during a crucial situation in the ALCS and Dorn reluctantly obliges. After a hilarious oh God! and tumble to the ground Dorn temporarily refuses to be relieved by a pinch runner.He eventually gives in and is greeted by Taylor who pats him on the butt and says Nice game. Of course there are other classics like He'd need a rocket up his a to get to that one! Jack Parkman mimicking Taylor's bad knees during the preseason I think I'll call it the 'Masterbator' 'Kamikaze' Tanaka's many amusing contributions 'Wild Thing' Vaughn's that's enough for today after five pitches in Spring Training...and more.Look with Major League II you can't take it seriously. The baseball action sequences play smoothly but the managerial decisions and player antics are silly. Just take this film for what it is...The funniest baseball movie of all time and quite simply the best.".

This is such a funfilled likable hilarious comedy that you really don't want to make comparisons.  Yes this is more sanitized.  You won't hear the f wordwhich is contained in my favorite line from the original  Strike that motherfker out!  But it's quite raunchy for PG standards.  And it's not the least bit watered down.  Many of the beloved characters return.  Omar Epps replaces Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes.  Maybe Wesley would've been funnier reprising his role but Omar does a fine job.  We also have the great Cuban ballplayer Pedro Cerrano Dennis Haysbert whose voodoo antics clash with the Buddhist antics of the new Asian ballplayer don't ask me the actor's name.  There's a very funny scene where Pedro introduces his voodoo doll to the the Asian guy's Buddha statue  Jobu Buddha.  Buddha Jobu.  Now I don't want no trouble out of you.  The Asian guy is also hilarious  You have no...you have no...looks in dictionary manners!  You have no manners!  And how can we have a kickass sequel without the return of Charlie Sheen as Rick Wild Thing Vaughn?!!!  Of course in this one Wild Thing is not so wild to start with as he meets a posh girlfriend Allison Doody who teaches him all about improving his image for the public which means dressing him in a suit and forcing him to shed the biker dude persona.  No way!  When Wild Thing finally returns to his old ways don't worry I'm not giving anything away you just want to jump up and cheer like you're at the game yourself and sing along to Wild Thing.  The coach James Gammon returns and has a funny subplot in which he passes out from a heart attack getting sent to the hospital and not being allowed to watch baseball since doctors feel it'll be detrimental to his health.  So he listens to the big game through a portable radio.  The final scene with him in the hospital is hilarious and he has a memorable line which I unfortunately can't give away since it's at the very end.  In the booth we have Bob Uecker who once again supplies his hysterically funny commentary on each game.  Adding to the initial cast we have Eric Bruskotter as the new catcher who's very funny as the stereotypical hick who keeps bios of Playboy centerfolds hanging on his walls.  Adding to the crowd we have Randy Quaid as an obsessed baseball fan who loses his faith in Wild Thing after his big transition  Wild Thing! You make my butt sting!  You make everything...embarrassing! The plot is predictable.  Don't expect any surprises.  But the lovable characters and grand slam comedy helps rise above its shortcomings.  Not to mention the exciting baseball footage.  If you fell in love with the first one you'll fall in love with the sequel! Take me out to the ballgame!My score  7 out of 10".

Not only that but their insufferable previous owner Rachel Phelps Margaret Whitton has sold the franchise to their aging third baseman Roger Dorn Corbin Bernsen. That said things are apparently looking good and all of the experts predict that they will go all the way to the World Series. However things aren't necessarily as good as they seem as the players they counted on have all lost their spark and to make matters even worse Roger Dorn overestimated his investment and has had to resell the team toof all peopleRachel Phelps. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film turned out to be a somewhat routine sequel in that it simply didn't quite have the same energy as its predecessor. I especially didn't care for two of the characters by the names of Isuro Tanaka Takaaki Ishibashi and the obnoxious fan named Johnny Randy Quaid who were quite annoying. Even so there were a couple of good moments here and there and having an attractive actress like Alison Doody as Rebecca Flannery certainly didn't hurt. All things considered then while it wasn't a great film by any means I suppose it wasn't necessarily that bad and I have rated it accordingly. Average.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to give director David Ward and writer R.J. Stewart a lot of credit for where they went with Major League II. They could have settled for just another loopy baseball comedy although Major League was more than that. Instead he wrote in my opinion one of the most incisive and thorough looks at behindthescenes major league baseball that Hollywood has ever produced.If you approach this movie from a drama perspective rather than solely a comedy one you will see that it addresses what motivates and hinders bigleague players not only in baseball but in all professional sports.Of important note was the effect that romantic partners can have on the individual's performance the role and prevalence of psychotherapy as a muchresortedto tool in the player's arsenal the need for money as impetustoperform and the need to just be a a part of baseball Jake Taylor's eventual concession to go from player to coach. Other psychological aspects that affect a player's performance were illustrated in Major League II For Pedro Cerrano it was finding that sweet spot and right time and place to balance inner peace with passion. For Rick Vaughan it was to live every moment like it could be his last.. and to forget about tomorrow.The skullduggery and chicanery in M.L.B. were not shiedwayfrom in this movie The general manager still had a vendetta against the team and wanted it to lose probably for financial reasons. The loudmouth lout in the grandstands played by Randy Quaid was not toneddown by the director. The disgusting vile hate that spews from some fans mouths is even worse that that displayed by Quaid.A brilliantifexaggerated example of the psychological role in athletic performance is that characterized by the catcher Rube Baker played by Eric Bruskotter He needed a distraction to prevent him from thinking and worrying too much when he threw the ball back to the pitcher.Athletes use these devices all the time and many infielders have lost their fear of the ball with similar psychological tactics.Vaughan decided to allow passion back into his life and was allthebetter for it. Taylor accepted his limitations and his value and stayed in the game. Lou Brown found a way to listen to the playoff game after all even though it could have cost him his life. Dorn got his last atbat. I wish they had given Hayes a bigger role in the movie he perhaps learning a mnemonic to break a batting slump.The funny parts kept Major League II entertaining but anyone who knows baseball can realize that this movie is much much more. James Gammon as the team's manager was the ideal casting choice and his short scene when Tom Berenger visited his home is one of the most memorable baseball scenes I have ever seen in a movie. Cerrano's care for the pigeon he momentarily harmed was touching even if illtimed. The good heart of this movie was confirmed as the bird took flight again.I did not really appreciate seeing Euker as an arrogant drunk because I think he's a great guy and was a great announcer. I would like to have seen some class from him but I understand he had to handle the lines he was given. I would have liked Major League II to have gotten a little deeper inside Vaughan's head...Just a couple more scenes where perhaps Nikki perhaps the shrink perhaps the kids.. help Rick find out why he started hedging his bets in life. When he intentionally walked the utility player to get to the slugger Parkman we knew he was again throwing his A game.Without becoming melodramatic or insisting on turning the movie into a serious baseball drama David Ward and R.J. Stewart gave us something of lasting value. Historically I have been critical of baseball movies The Rookie and The Natural being my favorites. If you watch Major League II just looking for goofy antics you'll probably rate it poorly.. or maybe your eyes are just getting old.".

And yada yada.The movie isn't bad by any means but it doesn't seem to have the same magic and spark that the first movie had I could watch the original ML a million times and never get tired of it.";

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersThe Indians are back in what is suppose to be the next year but was filmed 5 years later. That for one throws the movie because VaughnSheen aged a lot in between the 2 movies as did JakeBerenger. Now the movie is a disappointment from beginning to end. First off the movie is rated PG PG!!! the orginal was rated R. So they went for the family aspect which I can understand but not cool when your a filming a sequel to an original with enough F bombs in it to make Joe Pesci apreciate it. So going in I knew that it wasn't going to up to par. Plus Epps coming in and taking over the role of Willie Mays Hays for Snipes was a bad omen. Harris also did not come back for the sequel. Other than that everyone came back for it Jake was in a non player role. Plus there was a few new guys. Rubea funny down home red neck who can gun anyone out but can't trow the ball back to the pitcher. TanakaA guy who can't speak any english but has great heart and some really funny scenes wCerrano. Jackthe cocky catcher who no one likes. Dorn is back but as the Owner for a short while. For people not on the team you have Randy Quaid in a good role as the heckler in the outfield very funny.As for the movie it just doesn't have IT the way the first movie did when it just sucks you in. Right from the beginning wthe flash back scenes I remember seeing it in the teater wmy brother and he hated it right from that point on it just didn't have the same feel. The baseball scenes are done well plus it was filmed at Oriole Park my team!wahoo. The movie just never gets on a good pace plus this was when movies were getting away from this type of feel. For one thing we have Vaughn who in the first movie is a thug from the streets now he has sold out for his 7 figures because he doesn't want to burn himself out throwing nothing but fastballs. Don't get me wrong I liked the movie but just for what it was. It's a decent little baseball flick that Universal just tried to cash in on the first one being a cult hit. The drama from the first one isn't there and the formula is exactly the same as the first. With the exception of them trading their best player to the White Sox who beat them in the ALCS after the first movie. They get to a point then need to win to get into the playoffs. This time though the Indians are playing for the ALCS not just for a playoff birth and it's against the White Sox who are now their big rivals because they beat them in the ALCS last time. So there is a 7 game series where of course we just see clips of the first 6 games and it comes down to the final 7th game...The 7th game is well put together but falls short of the excitement of the first game. Of course the game pokes along with just about everything being the same except it comes down to the bases being loaded and Vaughn coming in to pitch agains Jack who they traded away. I've said it before in the review the drama just wasn't there. I liked the movie but that is just because it's a baseball movie so i'm biased in that aspect.  I'd give it 2 out of 4 stars.".

There are actually some witty lines in the script here and there Antonia Dorian is gorgeous in and out of her fur bikini and there is a fairly large scale dinosaur modelpuppetsuit which features.Less praiseworthy but worth remarking on are the presence of Michelle Bauer overexposed in more ways than several but still decorative and Griffin Drew including implants and a small quantity of extremely bad stopframe animation used to bring certain dinosaurs to er life.The big trick used here though is forced perspective. Thus there is no need to finance a giant egg prop  you use a normal egg near the camera and have your actors 50 yards away point in the right direction to make it look as if they are pointing at the egg near the camera. Or they run away as if chased by a dinosaur while a small scale dinosaur close to the camera is manipulated to look as though it is chasing them. Of course it helps if both the close and distant items are focused the same. And it helps as if the dinosaur model doesn't look as if you just bought it from a toy shop. And it helps if your models aren't grounded in normal sized and scaled foliage thus making them look like the models they are.The cheap tatty special effects are dreadful.

I just watched Dinosaur Island followed by an episode of Black Tie Nights on Cinemax. This couple was on a date and then they had sex. That's the show. Genius eh?Speaking of genius Dinosaur Island was a TA spectacular. Three army guys crash land on the island of the prehistoric breast implants. They must prove themselves worthy of their big bouncy affection by slaying the really cheap dinosaur that prowls the island. The girls are confused by the new arrivals in their midst. What is this thing you men call love? The guys are ready to shed the cavegirl's clothes and get this party started on a Saturday night.Once again I must give praise where it's due. Michelle Bauer is the real deal. As the women pair off with the men Michelle chooses the fattest loser to hook up with. She gives hope to all of us dorks out here every time she rips off her bra. Thank you Michelle for getting naked for us again. There are plenty of other women who take their tops off as well. So that's good too. All of the dinosaur scenes were ridiculously cheap but I didn't mind. You don't think I actually watched this for the dinosaurs do you? Of course not. Anyway Dinosaur Island is a good TA flick. It's worth a look for Bmovie lovers. One last thing keep an eye out for Nikki Fritz who shows up at the very beginning of the movie. I thought she looked familiar but I didn't realize it was her until after the credits rolled. She is the High Priestess who has her breasts painted blue and dances around like a stripper. Apparently the dinosaur is attracted to the human sacrifice by the hypnotic gyrations of cavewoman pole dancing.".

Ms. Drew is a very gifted actor and earned 2nd team AllCentury status with her charm which was especially evident during the healing scene.

The men must prove their worth by slaughtering the great one no it's not Jackie Gleason and bring food to the village. In the process the men teach the women about other activities involving very little clothing and we see a lot of stock footage. Tom Shell has since gone on to other pursuits in producing and I'm happy for him but I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss him. He played a good joe average who gets laid character and he did it without looking like a sleaze. Gabai gives a comedic performance reminiscent of Dean Martin.

How about the scene where one of the men tries to impress a voluptuous babe by cooking her a Pterodactyl he supposedly killed for her.

Any hope you may have for this film's potential to elevate and celebrate life vanishes a moment later when the camera cuts away to two parallel lines of scantily clad women brandishing spears and chanting rhythmically before a roughhewn altar upon which a woman writhing in a fur bikini struggles against the vines tethering her arms to the altar's towering sides though even a casual inspection reveals that the vines are looped around her wrists not tied and would probably fall limply to the ground if she would just open her hands and turn loose of them.Why is she tieder looped to the altar? She's a Snackable in a furbikini wrapper a squirming sacrifice to the Great Onea snarling bellowing Tyrannosaurus Rex rendered in stopmotion animation so shaky and erratic as to call to mind an image of Michael J. Fox doing an impression of Elvis dancing to All Shook Up. With more gratuitous nudity than one of Calvin Klein's wet dreams with dimestore plastic dinosaurs brought to life through hamhanded conspicuous special effects that are almost capable of momentarily startling a slowwitted fouryearold child and with acting more stiff selfconscious and unnatural than a breakdancing Mitt Romney Dinosaur Island is 85 minutes of mediocrity sinking into banality under the weight of the director's apathy and the actors' indifference most notable in the end for its almost complete lack of talent wit or imagination.I ranked it four out of five stars on Netflix in the hope that Netflix will start tossing more flicks like it my way. I would've given it five stars but I don't want Netflix to think that I lack discerning taste and a refined artistic sensibility.".

Any hope you may have for this film's potential to elevate and celebrate life vanishes a moment later when the camera cuts away to two parallel lines of scantily clad women brandishing spears and chanting rhythmically before a roughhewn altar upon which a woman writhing in a fur bikini struggles against the vines tethering her arms to the altar's towering sides though even a casual inspection reveals that the vines are looped around her wrists not tied and would probably fall limply to the ground if she would just open her hands and turn loose of them.Why is she tieder looped to the altar? She's a Snackable in a furbikini wrapper a squirming sacrifice to the Great Onea snarling bellowing Tyrannosaurus Rex rendered in stopmotion animation so shaky and erratic as to call to mind an image of Michael J. Fox doing an impression of Elvis dancing to All Shook Up. With more gratuitous nudity than one of Calvin Klein's wet dreams with dimestore plastic dinosaurs brought to life through hamhanded conspicuous special effects that are almost capable of momentarily startling a slowwitted fouryearold child and with acting more stiff selfconscious and unnatural than a breakdancing Mitt Romney Dinosaur Island is 85 minutes of mediocrity sinking into banality under the weight of the director's apathy and the actors' indifference most notable in the end for its almost complete lack of talent wit or imagination.I ranked it four out of five stars on Netflix in the hope that Netflix will start tossing more flicks like it my way. I would've given it five stars but I don't want Netflix to think that I lack discerning taste and a refined artistic sensibility.";

The guys are told they must die until they are thought to be gods who will help the cave women dispose of the great one a super dinosaur! The lead guy escorting the three losers to their court martial seems intent on delivering the men and even works out a deal with the leader of the cave women who distrusts these men but then he seems to side with the soldiers making one think they missed a scene or two.The film is good for one thing and that is nudity and it delivers some really nice looking females. The comedy pretty much fails for the most part the action is terrible and the effects are hokey. Ross Hagen plays the man intent on bringing the men back and whose change of heart comes out of nowhere. He is an actor who is a b movie king starring in a ton of films and also in films parodied on MST3K such as Sidehackers and Hellcats.

A group of Army guys have their plane crash into the ocean but thankfully they wash up on shore of an island that they think is deserted. They're incorrect because there's a bunch of big breasted and beautiful women but the only downside is that there's also dinosaurs who love to eat people. DINOSAUR ISLAND is obviously a film that wasn't meant to be taken serious as everything here is pretty cheap from start to finish. I'm really not sure why two directors were needed but they deliver pretty much what you'd expect in a film like this. The majority of the running time has nothing going on except for the beautiful women running around jiggling as they become curious about things like kissing and sex. This here leads to a lot of jokes where the men all try to get something from them while at the same time trying to figure out how to kill the dinosaurs. The CGI dinosaurs in this movie are perhaps the worst you'll ever see and I'm sure even Edward D. Wood Jr. would be embarrassed by them. Quite often the girls will be using their spears against the dinosaurs and yet you can tell that they didn't know what they were looking at during filming. There are several times where the girls are stabbing the dinosaurs but not coming close to actually hitting them as the timing of the real stuff and the CGI are off to the point where you can't help but laugh. The cast includes some familiar faces like cult favorite Michelle Bauer and Peter Spellos SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2 but everyone fits their roles just fine. DINOSAUR ISLAND is certainly a cheap and poorly shot little thing but there's enough nudity and camp to make it worth viewing for those who enjoy this sort of thing.".

However trouble begins when one of the white guards named Hartman Udo Kier falls in love with a native girl by the name of Cora Janet Lopez and subsequently attempts to help her escape. From then on the film pretty much includes one scene after another in which the white guards beat and humiliate the native women whenever they feel like it. Yet even though this is a standard theme in all WomeninPrison WIP movies the producers failed to incorporate a serious plot which could have improved this film immensely. As a matter of fact about the only two good things going for this movie was the beautiful tropical island scenery and the presence of the aforementioned Janet Lopez who was certainly easy on the eyes. Other than that this movie was almost a complete waste of time. As such I have rated it accordingly. Below average.".

In addition  there appears the dancing choreography  usual in Peplum genre . The film hasn't historic reference  it results to be a simple adventure movie with monsters  gladiator fights  betrayal  pursuits and many other things . This film takes images and stock shots from other movies and especially Colossus of Rhodes . Brad Harris is cool as the mythical hero who becomes involved into numerous risked incidents while trying to free his lover and achieve the kingdom . Brad Harris was a hunk man who made lots of roman epic films also called Musclemen movies. Luck's Harris changed when an Italian producer persuaded him to go overseas to star lots of swords and sandals film . Brad was an American bouncing who emigrated Italy and created a true starsystem based on pumpedup heroes.

In the film appears several familiar faces from Peplum and Spaghetti such as Fernando Rey  Fernando Sancho  Angel Aranda and Alvaro De Luna as a gladiator . Atmospheric and evocative musical score by Carlo Innocenzi . Colorful cinematography by expert cameraman Alejandro Ulloa Horror express  but a perfect remastering is necessary  being shot on location in Manzanares Del Real  Colmenar Viejo Madrid and Almeria  Andalucia  the latter  a known place where in the 60s and 70s was filmed lots of SpaghettiTortilla Westerns .

He's a writer and director of various Sword and Sandals movies  sometimes credited as James Read  such as Colossus and the headhunter  Fire over Rome  Colossus the Stone age and Revolt of the Barbarians. Rating  Acceptable and passable . The picture will appeal to Peplum buffs .".

One of them will be the new Prez. The selection procedure is pretty simple. The Board comprised of 7 members 2 other stockholders besides the 5 V.P.'s votes yes or no on whomever is nominated. 4 'yes' votes or more gets the job.The cast is superb really first rate but the one to watch for me was Fredric March as Shaw the V.P.Controller whose sole criteria for success is the bottom line. He's smooth too smooth and sweats a bit too much. You'll note that nothing is ever seen of his private life unlike the others. All his energy is geared around the company but ultimately for his own benefit even if he doesn't see it that way. All the actors are very articulate delivering their lines with impressive precision. The maneuvering done by each of the 5 V.P.'s is something to see one frontrunner Pidgeon for the top job seems a shooin but just as quickly this sense evaporates. Any of the 5 appears to be the man for the job at one point or another  the decision and vote needs to be reached quickly before the company starts to suffer so we add tension to the plot.This picture has not really dated 50 years later as much of the sensibilities and office politics remain unchanged today. There may be more sleaziness and unscrupulous behavior nowadays but even this is presented in the form of one of the board members Calhern a sneak who sees the death of the President as just another way to make some money in stocks.

Big business films are never dated! The same backstabbing political games were there then and are still there now!  Sure  this film was made in 1954 and it is now almost 50 years later and the way in which business is transacted has changed but big business itself hasn't changed a bit.  Watch the movie and you will see. Everyone was superb in this film and even though Paul Douglas didn't get very good reviews I personally thought that he was one of the best actors in this great film.  Barbara Stanwyck whose screen time was very short turned in a grand performance as a family stockholder.  Nina Foch was never better in the role of the secretary of the big boss and more than deserved her academy award nomination for best supporting actress even though she did not win.  I also liked the casting of William Holden and June Allyson together at first I thought an odd combination but they worked well together!  You gotta see this one!  Lots of suspense!".

	schema:reviewBody "Herbert Lehman the adapter of the novel that serves as the basis for this corporate drama makes a tremendous contribution with his screen play. Little seems to have changed in the way corporate America did business then which it still holds true today. The film as directed by Robert Wise keeps us involved in the maneuvers the executives of the company do behind the scenes when the head of the company dies suddenly.We are given a gripping drama as to what goes on among all the possible candidates to take the helm of the business. There will only be a winner but who can be the most qualified person to take the company to do better than it had performed under the dead man? Would it be the ambitious Loren Shaw a man with facts and figures at the tip of his fingers? Would it be Frederich Alderan the man who has dedicated almost 30 years of his life to the business? Or would it be McDonald Walling the younger man who knows what's wrong with the way the company has been turning inferior products to its customers?The all star cast assembled for the film do an outstanding job guided by Mr. Wise the director. William Holden plays Walling the youngest of all the executives. Mr. Holden gave an inspired performance as the man who knows where the focus of the company should be and he is decent enough not to want to be seen as pushing to get the CEO's job.Fredric March one of the best actors of his generation is one of the best things in the film. His ambitious Loren Shaw clearly the man who makes no bones about his aspirations is one of the best roles he played for the screen. Mr. March's portrayal of the ruthless Shaw gives us an idea of how driven some people in those high places will react knowing the power they'll yield not caring how they will affect the lives of those under them.The rest of the players are good. Barbara Stanwyck has a small part as the daughter of the man that created Treadway. Walter Pigeon is Fred the man who has given his life to this company. Paul Douglas is Walter the straying man having an illicit relation with his secretary. Louis Calhern is the reptilian Casswell who stands to make a lot of money out of his gamble to back up Shaw. Nina Foch the executive secretary Erica does a fine job in projecting the sadness of a lonely woman who has probably loved the dead man Bullard. Shelley Winters only has a couple of scenes as Eva the secretary that suddenly sees the light in her situation with Walter.The film offers a good look at the financial district of New York as it looked in those years. It's sad to realize what the recent events have done to that part of Manhattan and how different it looks today!".

He has a vision as to where the company should go and his speech at the board meeting spells it out eloquently.Most of the reviewers of this film single out Fredric March's performance as the best in this all star cast. But Holden is more than a match for March in the film and for acting kudos.Spencer Tracy was always the actor who could deliver the long speeches the best for example Boom Town and State of the Union. Holden goes into that category in this film.You couldn't make Executive Suite today. Now the Board of Directors would have chosen a new president who would have shipped the factory to some third world country and left that town unemployed.".

But Holden is more than a match for March in the film and for acting kudos.Spencer Tracy was always the actor who could deliver the long speeches the best for example Boom Town and State of the Union. Holden goes into that category in this film.You couldn't make Executive Suite today. Now the Board of Directors would have chosen a new president who would have shipped the factory to some third world country and left that town unemployed.";

But author Cameron Hawley was one of the first novelists to seriously write of American business as one of flesh and bone. Previously a novelist might comment on the greed or stupidity or short sightedness of a businessman and when movies dealt with big business it was a setting. Occasionally some knowledge of business crept in. When Preston Sturgis did THE POWER AND THE GLORY 1933 he actually included a board scene where Spencer Tracy discusses financing a consolidation move with debentures. And when Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz did their final screenplay for KANE there were scenes showing Welles shaking up a stodgy old paper he acquired. But the personality of the central figures dominate those films  not the details of the railway and newspaper empires.EXECUTIVE SUITE was different. Treadway is a furniture company whose founder committed suicide in 1933 at the height of the Depression. But the founder's right hand man one Adrian Bullock saved the company and made it into the third largest furniture company in the country. Bullock is only heard at the start of the film leaving work on a Friday and going into the street where he dies from a heart attack. Most of the directors are out in Pennsylvania. Only Louis Calhern who has financial contacts was on Wall Street at the time. Calhern sees Bullock die and makes the mistake of playing a sure thing insider trading sale of 3700 shares of stock  stock he can't afford to buy at the height of the market but which will dip upon the discovery that the company strongman has died. Unfortunately for Calhern this depends of the rapid discovery that Bullock died and the depressing effect over the weekend on the stock price. The fact that Bullock is not identified starts toppling Calhern's illegal scheme  you see he never owned the shares! It slowly develops in the film that all the leading figures in the corporation have their own problems and agendas. Calhern brought one Loren P. Shaw to Bullock's attention and Shaw Frederic March is a very modern company comptroller  more concerned with profit than with quality. March has made himself indispensable to Bullock and March was looking forward to being named Executive Vice President. But March now is in a possible position to succeed Bullock. However in getting there he has cut down in the quality of the furniture they a selling and has pushed the others aside.William Holden is an excellent design chief brought in by Bullock. He wants to streamline the designs. But this goes against the craw of the Production Chief Dean Jagger who thinks his old ways are the soundest. Curiously enough given the rivalry built up between March and Holden March is actually more willing to reach out eventually to Holden than Jagger is. But Holden has had his budget requests rejected too often by March's careful money pruning methods.Walter Pidgeon was with Bullock from the depression onward as his right hand man but Bullock never thought of him as Executive Vice Presidential material nor a successor. The head of the Sales Department is Paul Douglas who is a nice guy  but he has been a gladhandler for years. He also has been having an affair with his secretary Shelley Winters. Then there is the founder's daughter Julia Treadway Barbara Stanwyck who never wanted the company or the wealth  she wanted Bullock who never went the farthest step with her. Finally there are two peripheral characters Nina Foch the secretary to Bullock  whom March tries to get information from and June Alyson as Holden's wife  who hates how Holden is turning into a younger version of Bullock all company little time for family life.We are supposed to cheer on the forces for quality in this film against March's bean counting parsimony. It helps that the ambitious March uses blackmail. But March actually is quite on his toes. When Bullock's death is finally announced March arranges quote sensibly a large newspaper add across the country regarding the soundness of the stock and even dividends coming up! Pidgeon and Holden are not taken into his planning but they weren't around.Furthermore although it may have been in the original novel Bullock had been favorably responsive to Shaw when Caswell introduced them. That suggests he may have actually had some scheme in mind use Shaw to build up the financial muscle of Treadway and when the time came Bullock Shaw and Wailing Holden would customize and improve the product again. In fact in the final confrontation at the Board meeting March when attacked for the awful new line of crappy furniture admits it was just a temporary idea  and that was how it was to be sold! EXECUTIVE SUITE never fails to stimulate interest in it's characters and the corporate world they inhabit  really the first movie to do so.One final comment. Although he is in only one scene actor Harry Shannon plays a wise old foreman. They are closing the works for the night and Shannon talks to Holden about how the shabby recent production standards and cost cutting has been effecting the staff. He recalls the better pride full years before March and asks Holden if it can ever be brought back. Holden exhausted tilting at windmills can't even say anything a rarity for that great gritty voiced actor. Ironically Shannon is best recalled as the father of Charles Foster Kane.".

The striking thing is how well the movie is written staged and acted. Knowing what was going to happen the second time around I noticed the little clues in people's body language actually telegraphing what they are thinking and planning yet these are not so obvious that I noticed them on my first viewing. This happens all through the movie but especially leading up to and during the climactic board room scene. If you know what to look for you know exactly how everyone voted on the first ballotbefore Frederick March's character jumps to the wrong conclusion. Especially watch the play and interplay of Frederick March Louis Calhern Barbara Stanwyk and William Holden. Memorable dialogue includes William Holden's line Look you can't put Millburghyou can't put Treadwayin the hands of J. Walter Dudley. While the line only means anything in the context of this movie it has a certain arch resonance because the characters in Executive Suite based on the novel of the same name by Cameron Hawley have deliberately evocative names Because Dudley sounds like dud nothing should ever be put in the hands of anyone with the name J. Walter Dudley. All of the performances are very good. Walter Pidgeon and Nina Foch are understated and consequently underrated.".

	schema:reviewBody "You talk about an AllStar cast. This casting was right out of the former and present day stars of it's time. An absolute home run all the way.A president of a moderately successful furniture company dies and his minion's all scramble to see who's gonna be the new president. With this happening we realize that 2 main people up for the job are on 2 different wavelength's. One wants to keep the stockholders happy and trim the fat. Keep churning out crappy poorly made but profitable products. The other wants to return back to the days when they're product line was innovative and was quality by industry standard. The penny pincher is a Night school educated book worm who's more interested in controlling people than anything else. He knows everyone's personal business and he tries to use it against them to gain their vote at the end of the day. He's a weaselly little guy. You know the type picked on in school and would like to get back at anyone the best way...worming his way to the top. The other is a chemist at their plant that creates new finishesvarnishes for their products. He wants quality products and wants to return to the old way the company was run but at that day and time...is it the bottom line that matters most?I don't think I've seen a better film with this kinda star power. From Walter Pidgeon to Barbara Stanwyck to William Holden to Fredric March. If you don't know your film history these people are towering figures in acting and they all shine in this ruthless look at the backbiting that goes on behind closed doors at corporations. Fredric March is dead perfect at playing the weaselly little controllercomptroller of the company. William Holden plays the perfect hero with the perfect speech at the end. Walter Pidgeon plays the elder statesman like he always does. Barbara Stanwyck plays the hidden love interest of the previous president who died. She doesn't have a lot of scenes or lines but she's effective.Just watch this and see how relevant it is today. If you've seen this and then read this review you'll think this is about 2 guys vying for the presidency. Think about it. It's really about 2 different ways of thinking in the corporate world. How much quality do we actually put out in today's world? How many pieces of electronics do you return because of shoddy quality control? See this film and see why so many CEO jobs change hands these days. It's about the bottom line... and not the product.".

Wise once again proves his dexterity with most any genre by steering this somewhat stagy drama smoothly over the hurdles.He's aided by a great cast that could have only been pulled together by one of the top studios during its peak years. As the main couple William Holden and June Allyson are surprisingly simpatico as the idealistic young husband and wife whose happy home life and future are suddenly jeopardized by an unexpected turn of events. His intense reactionary temperament and her sunny somewhat quivery rectitude on the surface would seem an odd fit but instead they come across as a long married couple whose differences only strengthen their union. As far as the other men go Fredric March and Louis Calhern are interesting contrasts as two kinds of opportunist. March a resolute basically principled bean counter who allows his ambition to compromise his integrity and Calhern a profligate heel who miscalculates at the wrong moment. Walter Pidgeon's character doesn't get to do much but be exasperated at different people and on the phone he's more of a plot device to move the story forward. To a lesser extent the same is true of Paul Douglas' harassed salesman but he does get a couple of chances to flesh out his character in his interactions with Shelley Winters.Considering this is a 50's boardroom narrative it's nice to see several decent women roles included besides June's. Barbara Stanwyck as befits her star status gets the juiciest role even if it is limited in actual screen time. At first her big emotional outburst seems overdone until you realize it's decades of frustration and pain she's pouring out the rest of the time she cool and classy. Shelley Winters' secretary has a vulnerability not common in her work but she plays it well. That leaves Nina Foch an excellent actress and she's fine as the dutiful executive secretary but she was Oscar nominated for this and that's a puzzler. Of all the parts in the picture hers is the lest fleshed out. She's a steadying force but nothing else we learn nothing of her and she doesn't make much of an impact on the flow of the film.Similar in structure to Patterns The Power and the Prize and the much glossier Women's World if you like films about power struggles and the backstage machinations involved with them you're sure to find this enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "A story of survival and success within the corporate world Executive Suite from 1954 is a gripping tale of business men attempting to rebound after the sudden death of their leader.This wellmade film directed by Robert Wise has a terrific opening that grips the audience at the beginning and a continues to hold the viewer with a series of backroom actions by the executive staff of the Tredway Company. These scenes excellently written and directed complicate the plot a story that shows how simple actions endanger the survival of the company and the jobs of the entire work force.In this day of company layoffs and corporate misshandling of company funds Executive Suite hits home with a real punch because the arena in which virtually all the decisions about the future of the workers livelihood is seen as a petty soap opera that carries massive influences concerning millions of dollars.It is clear that a great film can be made from an equally great novel. Ernest Lehman adapted the novel by Cameron Hawley for Robert Wise to direct and the depth of character is what makes the story and drives it to its conclusion. In this film the motives of each character is what drives the narrative and each performance from the ensemble cast carries a weight and significance regardless of the amount of time the character is on screen. The community of executives that run a company is as human as the employees beneath who fulfill roles as administrators and salesmen researchers and laborers and that the basic pride in product and willingness to stand by what the company creates is what holds a corporate community together over the basic financial rewards.Ernest Lehman had a great resource to work from but also had a career of crafting excellent screenplays for directors to make films. Lehman is the man who wrote the scripts for the certifiable hits Somebody Up There Likes Me in 1956 and later penned the scripts for The Sound of Music and West Side Story for Robert Wise. Lehman clearly understands how to introduce a character through his goals and desires through the first words the character utters and by his or her actions. From their past work together it is clear that Lehman and Wise understood how to economically weave together groups of characters who each want something different but collectively create a culture with a particular value system.Lehman also wrote a couple of great scripts for Alfred Hitchcock North by Northwest in 1959 and later in the seventies for Family Plot. He is also responsible for the fine adaptation of Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint the script for Hello Dolly! and the adaptation for Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? That was adapted into the searing film with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in 1966. Lehman also wrote the great novella Sweet Smell of Success and cowrote the screenplay for the 1967 noir film. This is a man who understood clearly the complex drives of the human psyche and was able to show it with revealing character action and dialogue.The obviously influenced Oliver Stone on the commentary track is enlightening to hear in that he admits to using Executive Suite as a model for his own Wall Street and reminisces about his father's introducing him to the great business areas of New York. What is also great to hear from Stone as he talks through the film is reference points to his own films and how the craftsmanship that went into making Executive Suite affected his own role as auteur.This is a great movie and anyone who has ever spent time working in a corporate environment will immediately understand viscerally the tensions and stress that the administrative force experiences in the narrative. Although a real ensemble piece William Holden as Walling shows the angst and ultimate decisionmaking that goes into his standing up and overcoming his ambivalence when everyone including his wife works against him.Avery Bullard is the central character that motivates all the others in his absence and this is beautifully symbolized in the loud clanging of a tower bell at the top of the corporate offices where Bullard holds his board meetings promptly at six PM. This loud bell clanging is used more than once to show how the presence of Bullard remains in the hearts and minds of his executive staff and others who knew him and ultimately demonstrates how the persistence and distortion of memory guides individuals after death.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is similar to 12 Angry Men just with a lot more scenes and locations.As another reviewer said it bears a second watch to appreciate it fully. Holden plays an intense character who constantly analyzes the situation as it develops. In fact all the characters are intense each having having both a business and personal reason for their actions.The more I watch this movie the better I like it. Every scene has its importance and there is no wasted dialogue. It moves quickly to its conclusion without ever giving away the ending since its very basis is the unpredictability of human nature.It is also a very accurate portrayal of how business works at the tower level.Another reason I liken it to 12 Angry Men is its use of body language. For example in the penultimate scene when Holden is delivering his blockbuster speech for the election of President he stalks around the table stopping at the chair of various directors. At one point he plants his hand on the shoulder of the Stanwyck character and you can see her emotions shift. Shortly after he puts his hand on the shoulder of Walter Pidgeon.His speech and mannerisms provide an exciting climax to the movie as he breaks out as the strongest of the bunch and gives closure in an exciting ending. All in all this is a great movie with an allstar cast that requires close attention in order to appreciate its greatness.".

Add to that director Robert Wise Somebody Up There Likes Me West Side Story The Sound Of Music. Add producer John Houseman famous for his work with Orson Welles. Add to that writer Ernest Lehman Sabrina The King and I North by Northwest West Side Story The Sound of Music Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. I mean...wow! The biggest criticism I can find for this film is that it sometimes has the taste of a stage play because it mostly takes places in just a couple of sets. But it doesn't seem stiff as some movies are when they are translated to the big screen.William Holden is superb as an executive who lives more on the manufacturing line than in the board room but who decides to campaign for CEO. Barbara Stanwyck is appropriately hysterical when needed. Fredric March is excellent as the board member ready to grab the CEOship. Walter Pidgeon is great as a board member who realizes time has passed him by. Paul Douglas  not usually one of my favorites  is excellent as the head of sales whose private life is worming its way into his job performance. Louis Calhern is great as a board member who is just a little too slick for his own good. Dean Jagger isn't really given enough to do here and that's a shame. June Allyson as Holden's wife is very good...treading the line between being a nag and being supportive. Nina Foch is superb as the cold secretary who actually has a heart.The story is intense though some audiences today may find it a little slow. The script solid.A top notch film that I highly recommend.".

	schema:headline " Diamond smugglers vs the Police";
	schema:reviewBody "RIVER BEAT  1954  UK Phyllis Kirk is a radio operator on an American ship that has just docked in the Pool of London. She decides to spend the day taking in the sights. The ship's Steward Harold Ayer asks Kirk to take several packs of smokes through Customs and give them to a buddy Glyn Houston on the docks. Kirk does the favour and leaves the cigs with Houston. She then hits a local pub for a drink. There she meets John Bentley. Bentley is a Police Inspector with the Thames River Water Police. The two strike up a conversation and agree to meet the next evening. The next day Bentley and his fellow coppers get a flash about a smuggling outfit bringing in diamonds. They need to beef up checks etc around the docks. That evening as Kirk is leaving the ship for her date with Bentley she is again approached by Ayer. He asks if she could again drop off some more packs of smokes to his friend Houston. Kirk agrees but tells Ayer it is the last time. The Cop on the dock exit asks to look in her purse. He takes the cig packs into the Customs office and opens them. Needless to say that they find diamonds mixed in with the tobacco. A dumbfounded Kirk swears she had no idea about the diamonds. Ayer watching from the ship sees Kirk get grabbed up. He quickly phones his boss with the info. Bentley waiting at the pub decides Kirk is a no show and leaves. Kirk is of course busy being questioned by the Police and the Customs boys. She tells them about the Steward Ayer. The Police tell her to return to the ship and say nothing. The next morning the Police including Bentley come calling on the ship's Captain Robert Ayres. What can he tell them about Kirk and Ayer. Good people as far as I know. He answers. The Police try to interview Ayer but is seems he jumped ship the night before. Bentley interviews Kirk to ask if she recalls anything else about Ayer. The police now get word that Ayer has been found. The only problem here is that he was face down in the Thames. A quick check of his fingerprints etc reveal him as a long time villain. Bentley assumes he was given the deep six to keep him quiet. They do a further check on the associate files and come up with a couple of leads. They ask if Kirk would help with the case. Maybe she can identify one of the two as the man she passed the cig packs to the first time. The first man is a no go. The second man turns out to be Houston. He gives Bentley the slip by going out the back while his wife runs interference. Kirk however spots him and follows. Houston leads Kirk through the back lanes down to the docks. There she gets a surprise when Houston boards Kirk's ship. She boards and heads to Captain Ayres rooms for help finding Houston. Just as she is about knock she hears Ayres and Houston talking inside. It was that woman Ayer used who was with the police! Houston tells Ayres. It seems that Ayres is the man in charge of the diamond smugglers. He brings the stones from the States and lands them in London. They then end up in the hands of black market boss Charles Lloyd Pack. Kirk rushes to call Bentley on the ship's land connected phone. Before she can complete the call Ayres with gun in hand hustles her back to his office. Ayres tells Kirk and Houston they have both become annoying loose ends. A trip over the side for an unneeded dip is about to happen. Bentley now shows and the chase is on. Ayres holding Kirk as a hostage grabs a small launch and speeds off. Bentley and his Sgt Leonard White give pursuit in a Police boat. After several minutes Kirk manages to bump Ayres off the wheel causing the launch to beach. Bentley and White are right behind. Ayres jumps to the ground and attempts to escape on foot. He is tackled by Bentley and given a sound thrashing. White then applies the cuffs. It looks like Kirk and Bentley will get their date after all. Phyllis Kirk was best known for her roles in CRIME WAVE and HOUSE OF WAX. This film was Guy Green's first directing job. PORTRAIT OF ALLISON LOST HOUSE OF SECRETS THE SNORKEL and THE MARK are several of his films. As a cinematographer he worked on some early David Lean films such as GREAT EXPECTATIONS OLIVER TWIST and THE PASSIONATE FRIENDS. A middle of the road Bfilm that is well worth a look if you can find it. There is some interesting shots of the London Docks etc throughout. bw".

Before she can complete the call Ayres with gun in hand hustles her back to his office. Ayres tells Kirk and Houston they have both become annoying loose ends. A trip over the side for an unneeded dip is about to happen. Bentley now shows and the chase is on. Ayres holding Kirk as a hostage grabs a small launch and speeds off. Bentley and his Sgt Leonard White give pursuit in a Police boat. After several minutes Kirk manages to bump Ayres off the wheel causing the launch to beach. Bentley and White are right behind. Ayres jumps to the ground and attempts to escape on foot. He is tackled by Bentley and given a sound thrashing. White then applies the cuffs. It looks like Kirk and Bentley will get their date after all. Phyllis Kirk was best known for her roles in CRIME WAVE and HOUSE OF WAX. This film was Guy Green's first directing job. PORTRAIT OF ALLISON LOST HOUSE OF SECRETS THE SNORKEL and THE MARK are several of his films. As a cinematographer he worked on some early David Lean films such as GREAT EXPECTATIONS OLIVER TWIST and THE PASSIONATE FRIENDS. A middle of the road Bfilm that is well worth a look if you can find it. There is some interesting shots of the London Docks etc throughout. bw";

Australian release through British Empire Films 24 November 1955. 6306 feet. 70 minutes.SYNOPSIS As Judy Roberts radio operator of the Mowhawk Prince prepares to go ashore in London Al Gordon a steward asks her to take some cigarettes to a friend. She delivers the package and then goes to a riverside pub where she meets and becomes friendly with Inspector Dan Barker. When Judy next goes ashore she reluctantly takes more cigarettes for Gordon this time however she is questioned at the Customs.COMMENT Even better than the laterintheyear release from Insignia Radio Cab Murder also despite a plot that's more than slightly familiar but at least  like Radio Cab  allows some welcome opportunities for a fresh approach. The cast is certainly more interesting too and more importantly River Beat marks the directorial debut of one of Britain's few Hollywood Awardwinning cinematographers Guy Green for Great Expectations. Not that the direction of River Beat ranks anywhere in the David Lean class but it is superlatively photographed by veteran Geoffrey Faithful reduced to working in quota quickies at this stage of his career despite his masterly work on The Lavender Hill Mob because the major studios thought he was too old he'd been photographing films since 1908. No doubt director Guy Green gave Faithful every encouragement inspiring the dean of British cinematographers to give his best despite the film's short shooting schedule and povertyrow budget. Which brings me to the main point. What really raises River Beat above the rut of second features is the brilliant use made by director and photographer of actual locations. The movie looks expansively good and these higher production values have inspired the players too. True Bentley is a wee bit stiff as the hero but the lovely Phyllis Kirk shows no signs of resenting her sudden demotion from Warner Bros to a shoestring outfit nobody including you and I has ever heard of. She plays with just the right color and shading. A charming performance. Also worthy of note are Robert Ayres the ship's captain Glyn Houston from Panic an unwilling dupe Charles Lloyd Pack a gang leader Isabel George his wife David Hurst a tatty pawnbroker and Ewan Roberts.Although the script makes a big play of keeping the associate's identity a secret few viewers will not be able to guess who it is. And while the dialogue could happily be trimmed of a bit of excess markingtime talk it does all come to a grand climax.In all River Beat successfully overcomes all the odds against the British quota quickie. It's certainly no Great Expectations and maybe we have overpraised its appeal but noone will quibble about its photography. Most beautifully lit and composed River Beat brings the Thames and its docks to picturesque life.OTHER VIEWS An excellent film of its type River Beat is a competent little thriller which maintains a good pace and has a fairly simple plot with one or two interesting twists.  Monthly Film Bulletin.River Beat is a Blue Lamp type of story built around the activities of the Thames police with the accent on diamond smuggling. Phyllis Kirk Hollywood's first 3D girl was brought over to this country to costar with John Bentley. Authentic location shots around the Pool of London help to achieve complete conviction for an exciting story that throws a vivid spotlight on the activities of the men in blue whose beat is London's ageold waterway.

	schema:reviewBody "A radio operator Judy Roberts Phyllis Kirk on board an American ship is duped into smuggling diamonds by the ships steward via innocent looking cigarette packets which he says are for his friends. However one day she is pulled in by a customs official who opens them and finds the stones. She only avoids being charged there and then because her boyfriend is a policeman Inspector Dan Barker John Bentley whom has been assigned to close down the smuggling ring. He succeeds in buying time for her because she is the only person who can positively identify the two men to whom she passed on the cigarette packets to in the street. But a senior member of the gang Hendrick Charles Lloyd Pack is on her tail since he and his fellow crooks have no intention of going to prison. So they attempt to further incriminate her in smuggling by planting diamonds in her cabin on board ship. The fact that Barker is investigating the case threatens to end his relationship with Judy but he believes in her innocence throughout and together they fight to close down the gang's operations once and for all. But who is the big boss or 'the high fence' behind the smuggling operations?An above average British 'B' pic crime drama with interesting credits. It was the directing debut of acclaimed cinematographer Guy Green and the film was edited by Peter Graham Scott who would soon become a fine director in his own right too. Initially I thought that it was going to be nothing more than mundane programme fodder the plot development certainly looked as if it was going that way. But once it got into its stride it turned out to be a very tense and suspenseful crime drama with Green showing a real proficiency for the genre. Within a few years of making this he would direct the Hammer suspenser The Snorkel 1958 for years an unjustly neglected film in which he really outdid himself. There is a tense climax in which John Bentley and Phyllis Kirk go after the two receivers of the smuggled stones. One evades them and tips off the other and the pair have to race against the clock to catch him. We find ourselves gripping the edge of our seats even tighter since the suspense aspect behind it is that it depends on Bentley being able to charge the men for receiving the gems and Kirk being able to identify them. If that does not happen then Kirk will undoubtedly be charged as a smuggler and face a long term of imprisonment. The identity of the chief smuggler is well concealed and when it is finally revealed it will take you completely by surprise. The film concludes with a fairly exciting climatic boat chase between the river patrol and the criminal mastermind on the Thames. Green's tense direction is complemented by Peter Graham Scott's tight editing and the settings around London's dockland and the drab terraced houses inhabited by the working class villains look convincing and believable thanks to Geoffrey Faithful's atmospheric bw lighting which gives the proceedings a strong feeling for place and period. The acting is on the whole very competent all round even though there is nobody who really stands out and sets the screen alight. John Bentley's budding romance with Phyllis Kirk the imported Hollywood leading lady isn't sufficiently developed to be all that powerful in terms stirring our emotions. However they are both strong enough performers who do enough so that we can care about their plight.".

It's a Lifetime Channelstyle film that was released by Paramount pictures in 1982 during the Nancy Reagan's just say no period and it deservedly sank without a trace. Clayburgh is a trouper but she is made to look ridiculous in the overthetop scenes of her character's drug withdrawal. The film is remarkably barren lacks genuine conflict characterization ambiance or interest and it never gets inside the head of its main character. Aside from Clayburgh the most notable thing about the film is Nicol Williamson's performance as Clayburgh's boy friend he creates one of the most repellent characters I've ever encountered on stage or screen surely not intentionally. The film is directed by the numbers and ironically this film is less about Valium than a veritable Valium itself. It's best recommended as a safe nonhabit forming sleep aid.".

The characters are superb and Hauer and Chen really give them life.  Rutger needs to go back to this flick and see what he has lost! I really cared about this band of juggers and it seemed like everyone in the ensemble was on the same page. The Blood Of Heroes is a tremendous miss in the anals of great scifi films.

	schema:reviewBody "The juggers are coming! is a shout that strikes both fear and excitement into the hearts of the villagers. These wretched people living in the Mad Maxesque world of postnuclear devastation will now have to defend the honor of their village by playing against a wandering band of Juggers. This game is the centerpoint of the movie. It's a brutal match of American football and medieval warfare. Both teams will try to get a dog skull on a stake at the opposite ends of a small playing field. Only problem is that only a small lightly padded player the Qwik can touch the skull and all other players are armed with clubs chains mallets and bad attitudes. Needless to say the game can get brutal broken bones and gouged eyes are common enough. But once the game is over the real insights into the world this movie creates are made. There is no brutal rivalry outside the playing field only a camaraderie that can stem from knowing what you both have been through. The winners are treated to a feast no matter how poor the village for the player's blood has brough some exitement into their otherwise dreary and hopeless lives. I will not spoil the plot here but needless to say the young elements of the wandering band of Juggers which is led by Sallow Rutger Hauer will not long be content to fight in backwater villages for little money and poor entertainment a village of starving peasants can only provide so much. On the technical side this is not a brilliant movie clearly made on a low budget most of which was probably spent on actors. But movie itself is a great masterpiece showing more and more of the world in which the Juggers live with every time you watch it. Small things will speak volumes and prove true the old saying A picture speaks more than a thousand words. Also the action scenes while they do not contain the speedy cars and flashy wrecks of Mad Max are still full of adrenalin and will leave thinking about why the game of Jugging is not played already.".

Salute is an unapologetically brutal story perfectly cast well played and very competently filmed.  All the cast acquit themselves well Hauer is suitably grizzled and Chen manages believably to be cute scary vulnerable and savage all at once.There's very little plot or dialogue in Salute but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The showcase here is the heart pounding Jugger matches which are genuinely gripping and gritty action sequences shown to a sparse percussive soundtrack that only very occasionally veers slightly too close to smug Americana triumphalism.Top marks go to the stunt makeup and continuity people.  There are no Jackie Channish balletic combats here  faces smash open under brutal blows and the face remains smashed in the following scenes.  The wounds heal slowly over time but the grimly realistic scars of the Juggers remain consistent throughout.  Continuity is often underemphasised as you only miss it when it isn't there but there are no slip ups in Jugger despite its low budget.One interesting point is the change of emphasis in the 90 minute cut.  The title changes to Blood of Heroes and the message of Salute that there are no heroes only winners who sleep in silk sheets is diluted by ending prematurely on a victory high.  In the full Salute there's a frank message that for some beyond happily after after lies more sand and scars and blood.  If you get the choice the 104 minute Salute is a more complete and consistent film.".

So many gritty postapocalyptic hero type flicks that I liked when I was younger turn out upon a more sober adult viewing to be amateurish and juvenile.  But this movie has real depth and drew me back in from the opening scene.  It fully deserves any cult status it may have achieved and I went ahead and ordered the DVD which is finally out for my collection.The film is set against the backdrop of a fully realized postapocalyptic society that actually makes sense and the game the movie is built around is well conceived and executed too.  Unlike in many futuristic movies there is no need for grand exposition explaining why everybody in the film is acting so bizarrely  in this movie you understand the people their desperation and the certain grim courage of those who dare to dream of more.  The movie also has the courage to take itself seriously while still retaining a light enough touch to throw in spots of humor throughout.The cast here is several cuts above normal for this sort of thing with a number of recognizable faces Chen D'Onofrio Hauer Lindo making believable and sympathetic characters out of what easily could have been cartoonish cutouts in a lesser film.  Chen and Hauer play the two main characters.  For Chen I think it can be argued this is her finest performance deftly combining vulnerability with courage innocence with savagery.  And for Hauer an actor who has in more recent times has become a parody of himself I think this may have represented his last truly effective performance.  The stories of these two characters are not stories of grandiose savetheworld heroes but more down to Earth stories of courage redemption and most importantly hope in a world with little of it. The characters aren't pure they're not pompous they're just normal people trying to make the best of a tough life.  And I think that makes rooting for them all the easier.  Its not so important they win  its important that the find the strength to strive rather than give up.  Simple tenacity and the courage to never give up is far more inspiring than the vast majority of the superheroes in the modern comic book adaptation fad. It really is remarkable to find such deft handling of themes like these in an offbeat movie from a genre filled with Grade B quickies.P.S. I have never seen the longer version and actually don't really have an interest to.  The shorter Blood of Heroes is appealing precisely because it manages to scrounge out hope and weary courage from the grim backdrop in a believable fashion.".

	schema:reviewBody "I certainly didn't have high expectations as I rented this movie. I hadn't heard of it before so I figured it would be some Bversion of Mad Max. The reason it caught my eye was that it featured Rutger Hauer in the leading role. His acting skills is limited but his charisma gives his characters a weight that many better actors can't provide.David Webb Peoples have done more writing than directing. He is behind movies such as Blade Runner  Twelve Monkeys and Soldier all of them similar to Salute of the Jugger.It's easy to tell that this movie have a low budget. Most of it takes place out in an apocalyptic desert kind of landscape. The rest in an underground colosseum. No panoramic shots. There are no special effects whatsoever and that enforces the sense of gritty futuristic realism that sets this movie apart from many others in the same genre.You never get to know any of the characters well but they all have a certain depth thanks to the good acting performances. Luckily this movie has no humoristic sidekick character. That's a relief. Most of these movies have one or several of those.This movie is no masterpiece but it's a wellplayed movie that kept me entertained for the time it lasted. I wouldn't mind seeing it again.

	onyx:emotionText "I certainly didn't have high expectations as I rented this movie. I hadn't heard of it before so I figured it would be some Bversion of Mad Max. The reason it caught my eye was that it featured Rutger Hauer in the leading role. His acting skills is limited but his charisma gives his characters a weight that many better actors can't provide.David Webb Peoples have done more writing than directing. He is behind movies such as Blade Runner  Twelve Monkeys and Soldier all of them similar to Salute of the Jugger.It's easy to tell that this movie have a low budget. Most of it takes place out in an apocalyptic desert kind of landscape. The rest in an underground colosseum. No panoramic shots. There are no special effects whatsoever and that enforces the sense of gritty futuristic realism that sets this movie apart from many others in the same genre.You never get to know any of the characters well but they all have a certain depth thanks to the good acting performances.

	schema:headline " An unforgettable experience!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my most interesting experiences. Alas the offcamera drama proved far more fascinating than the rather superficial futuristic actionadventure grindhouse offering that finally emerged on the screen. I worked on the film for only four days of a tenweek shooting schedule. But aside from a brief shot of me in the Red City street as I pass by Gandhi on the right of the widewide screen my part was left on the cuttingroom floor. An earlier scene in the street in which I was accosted by a young boy excitedly telling me that he'd just found a magic stone was eliminated. Indeed not only was this scene and another in which I figured as worshiper in a weirdly colorful religious ceremony at a Red City temple completely deleted but the whole subplot involving this young lad was removed. He's no longer in Salute of the Jugger at all. That's a shame because he was easily the best actor in the movie. A fine acrobat a naturally gifted charismatic performer handsome as they come with a captivating personality he looked set for major stardom. I don't even remember his name.I was on the set at the same time as Rutger Hauer Delroy Lindo Gandhi McIntyre Joan Chen Hugh KeaysByrne a wonderful actor in a madetoorder villainous role which was cut to ribbons in the editing room and numerous extras in an elaborate opening ceremony to the Red City games. This ceremony was also hacked out of the final cut. And almost as bad as the deletions already mentioned was the pruning of Joan Chen's part in the climactic game. She bravely performed her own stunts receiving many spontaneous rounds of applause from the assembled crowd artists but all her efforts came to nought. They were scissored too. On the other hand just about all Glenn Ruehland's footage was left in. He doubled for Hauer. It's interesting that the star wasn't even on the set for most of Ruehland's vigorous fighting. He came in right at the end for close ups.I didn't see much of David Peoples on the set. The first morning he had a setto with Rutger Hauer. Peoples wanted to end the star's first sequence in a Red City street with Rutger turning his back on the camera walking away down the bustling thoroughfare and being swallowed up by the unknowing crowd. But Rutger absolutely refused to turn his back on the camera. After nearly an hour of fruitless argument the producer was sent for. We waited another hour and when the money man eventually arrived he adjudicated in favor of Hauer. Peoples walked off the set. The scene was then directed the Hauer way by Keith Heygate. And in the afternoon when Peoples had not returned the jettisoned temple scene in which Hauer didn't appear anyway was directed by David Eggby. Peoples unshaven blearyeyed returned a few days later. He explained that he'd been working on the script. In the meantime the climactic games sequence had been directed and painstakingly choreographed by Guy Norris. His principal players were Ruehland who assisted in coordinating these scenes and Joan Chen. While the action specialists were busy rehearsing the juggers photographer David Eggby in close collaboration with the continuity girl indeed she took charge as the filming progressed directed two scenes with the spectators.Another interesting point was that a second camera was used for all scenes except those actually involving the games. Eggby had no connection with the second camera which had its own crew and was generally set up behind and to the side of the first. Eggby did supervise the lighting of the set and actually operated his camera himself with the aid of a focus puller. Cross was in charge of the second camera which had its own operator and focus puller. These people were completely ignored by both Eggby and Peoples who both acted as if that crew didn't exist. Cross received his instructions from Keith Heygate who yelled at Cross angrily when Cross asked for timeout to make some camera adjustments. In addition to these duties the usually pleasantmannered Heygate also personally directed the placing and blocking of the extras as well as supervising the special effects men and the animal handler. The main scene that Peoples directed himself while I was on the set was the opening ceremony of the games very elaborately staged rehearsed and choreographed. I also overheard him telling a visitor that the young lad I mentioned earlier was a great discovery and that Salute of the Jugger would set the boy firmly on the path to international acclaim.So there you have it. The credits even the seemingly endless rollcalls attached to modern films don't tell the whole story. Anything like the whole story. Many people still make important contributions without any credit at all. And some people who are credited actually do either very little to earn that name in lights or contribute far more than the field in which their name appears!Which brings me to my final point. Salute to the Jugger is a Poverty Row film in reverse. The aim of a Poverty producer is to use every trick in the book to expand his meager budget so that it looks shatteringly lavish on the screen. Jugger's editor evidently had the opposite aim. Make the film look cheap. Although filmed on a money noobject scale the onscreen Jugger has the appearance of an inferior AmericanInternational. You should have seen the Red City street down which I and about two hundred meticulously costumed extras wandered. The shops. Wow! All filmed with the weirdest most bizarre most inventively created produce and goods that highly imaginative designers and set dressers could imagine. And what do we actually see on the screen. Zilch!".

As long as you are aware of what you are going to get in terms of film type then this is a really satisfying film. When it first started off it seemed to have a rather tacky feeling to it. It picked up soon enough and after a while I really started empathizing with the characters. None of them appear to be strong as individuals but this adds to the sense of them being the underdogs that is vaguely a spoiler. The acting is not amazingly expressive but the economy of the acting seems to give a sense of depth to each character. The main characters are tough and dangerous but also vulnerable and scared like people who have endured a harsh and painful life.The ambient nature of the setting gives a sense of depression and hardship but there is a subtle undercurrent of humanity. Even though life is rough and dangerous people still seem to have an obscure kind of respect for each other. This comes across as realistic to me. Too many dystopian type films seem to focus on people's complete lack of regard for human life. People are nasty to each other in this film but they still seem to have that vital spark of humanity. It is hard to describe but I believe that it has to be seen to be understood. It is not unnecessarily violent but I could almost feel the pain and discomfort due to the clever camera work. Enough gritty action is shown without the need for explicit scenes of gut churning violence.The steady pace that the film goes at could maybe be seen as boring but to me it just went at a perfect rate. The story is simple but the economic plot shows enough human interaction to provide a meaningful story. The film is more concerned with mood and ambiance than complex storylines. I really enjoyed it but I could imagine some people wanting more complexity. I was going to give it 9 but only because I could imagine certain people wanting more. I guess beauty is in the eye of the holder and for that reason I give it 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blood of Heroes is set in a desolate post apocalyptic future and you can taste the dirt and the misery. It also shows Rutger Hauer at his best.This flick never rose to fame probably because of its weird choice of topic a brutal game that looks like a mix of chess American football and ancient Rome gladiatorial combat. There's blood and pain at every turn. So it's not for everyone but the quality is there.The imagery costumes makeup and action are without reproach. The story might not bring anything new to the table but the world sure does and it's showed in full details. The dialogs are simple yet very effective and no quick easy slick remark jut hard harsh statements fitting the whole scene.The only reproach I would make is that the pellicle is getting old and without clean images it's getting tougher to appreciate. No widescreen no HD. Bummer. Still its age does show beyond that the rest is impeccable.If you don't mind violence see it.".

Set in a post apocalyptic world athletes known as Juggers travel from one village to the next playing an ultraviolent sport called simply the game. The game is a bizarre derivative of football where the quick tries to put a dog skull on a stake.Joan Chen plays the role of a young quick who joins a traveling team of juggers captained by an older man Rutger Hauer. Chen plays the role with as much or more intensity than any other role I have seen her in. Hauer is better in this role than anything else I have ever seen him in. Everyone in this film seemed to believe they could earn an academy award even with such a bizarre plot and played their parts with so much heart and skill that you truly care about the characters and what happens to them.The movie is so well done that by the end of the film you even understand the rules of the game.".

	schema:headline " Great Sports and Action movie based in a bleak and dark post apocalyptic scenario";
	schema:reviewBody "Blood of Heroes aka Salute to the Jugger. Why do i like it? The director did not make the mistake of jumping back and forth in giving a pseudo believable explanation why things are like they are.You just get thrown right there in the middle of a wasteland a la mad max leaving most of it pretty ambiguous there is a short written narration in the opening credits but it's not very insightful nor should it be. The world is shown as a giant desert small settlements here and there and overall it gives you a glimpse on how early civilizations might formed the people dressed in robes. Bedouins and nomads trying to survive in this pretty meager environment.It is demonstrative and beautifully portrayed the costumes are simplistic but great in design and efficiently put on display Especially the Jugger attires are outstanding.Well what is the premise of the movie? It is the Juggers who travel to from each settlement to play the game. so what is this game? A wild mix of gladiatorial fighting wrestling and classical ball games. Each player comes with their own attire self made helmets protection gear etc. Some teams feature a common theme such as having blue stripes on their gear fur helmets...weird among other things.Sounds bizarre but it is well thought off convincing and seems like a very interesting sport. You can pretty much guess the rules by just watching it and despite all it's brutality it really does look like fun.So the story begins like this The main protagonist SallowHauer is the leader of a clique of Juggers that travel to different settlements to play the game in oder to get recognized by the league and enter the challenge. In order to that they must collect jugs which are dog skulls and serve as play ball for the game. you win a game you keep the skulls as trophies. In the movie it is never explained fully how many games a Jugger team must win to get a challenge.Sallow himself has long a history and was once an acclaimed league player but because of some unfortunate events he had to leave the league which is hosted by the decadent authorities located in each of the nine kingdoms.the nine Kingdoms are Municap enclaves that are kept in underground vaults which are hundreds of stories deep embedded in the ground the last remains of the 20 th century.As the movie depict it it is comparable to ancient Rome or Babylon instead of beauty though we see a lot of scrap metal and factories remains of high technology from the better days. the people were fine garments of silk an is explained to be some sort of safe heaven and the closest thing to a normal functioning society.The settlements on the surface in comparison are consisting of no more then mere tents and fireplaces water is scarce etc.While Sallows team is playing in one of the towns a local young woman named KiddaJoan Chen is eagerly observing tired of field work she joins the debacle as a substitute after one of the local team members gets beaten to pulp during the game.She becomes a force to be reckoned with injuring one of of Sallows teammates severely but in the end gets dominated by Sallow himself  overwhelmed by the ability of the bunch she then tries to follow their trail and join them...This movie is great for it is simplicity the sport is brutal and violent but on the same level interesting to observe. The characters are fun to watch since all of them carry some unique visual aspects Delroy Lindo's character Mbulu for example has some huge bulging scars on his cheek that make him look incredibly fierce some.Each of them look so very different from their attire and look in general great costume design and make up work.You might have recognized that the plot itself is pretty basic and down to earth. It evolves wholly around the Juggers and their strive for recognition by the league. Each of them has their own motives and agendas why to do so or not to do so.To be frank only Sallow and Kidda's motives are wholly explained and overshadow the other protagonists ambitions by a long shot.The acting is on point cheesy at times but it gets the job done.Nothing fancy here and certainly not great nor bad. Some do a better job then others. I thought the young Vincent D' Onofrio was a bit over the top at times his character was overconfident and annoying but i guess that was supposed to be. Regardless He is a fine actor.Joan Chen was dull but certainly her display of agility and martial arts made up for it. very impressive indeed and I think and her actions spoke more then words.Delroy Lindo on the other hand took a backseat on this one and beside his awesome appearance did not get enough screen time to show his true potential as the fine actor that he really is. Disappointing in a way but I blame it on the script.In Case of Rutger Hauer who plays the main lead I have to say he was good but nowhere near as great as in Bladerunner. He did a good job and made the movie enjoyable.Their interesting appearances stole the show as so did the phenomenal action and the cool concept of the game. Big Kudos to the actors for pulling off a convincing portray of a sport that does not exist. It looked almost to real in many instances.If you like violent action movies and post apocalypse then do not pass on this little gem. It deserves more recognition then it currently has.".

The movie opens with a simple paragraph on the screen which basically says no one remembers how life used to be no one remembers how the game of jugging began and no one remembers why it is played with a dog's skull. AND THAT'S ALL YOU GET. The movie expects you to figure out the rest for yourself.I love it when a movie WANTS you to be smart... For instance it is never stated WHY after each match they mark up the game dog skull and carry it around with them  but when they present the bag of skulls at League HQ and the judges look them over carefully you can't help but guess the markings must be some sort of record of the scoring...The characters are great Sallow Hauer with his worldweary airs Juggers can't have sex with each other after a match  unless you like rubbing wounds on wounds... Kidda Chen who subs in a game against Sallow's team when her town's Qwik is injured and gets so caught up that she decides to run away with them the backbones of the team Mbulu and Big Cimber  both obviously vets who while they have no ambition can't stop playing and Young Gar D'onofrio the eager young pup who wants nothing more than to make a name for himself and who Sallow can see will probably follow in his own footsteps even to the point of taking the same fall.Even without the stellar performances I would suggest watching the movie for the background details. Every time I see it I see something cool and new.The first thing you see of the jugging team in the first ten minutes of the film is their gearing up for a game  one uses a bedrail for a weapon while another looks like a pipe with some kind of gearbox covering Mbulu has an honesttogod football helmet for his headgear while Sallow's more makeshift helmet is wrapped in old tire treads.And the places they travel  some have minimal electricity while most don't buildings are made of old tires and chain link fencing and the man with the accordion is god.".

	schema:headline " In a world of survival art is meaningless";
	schema:reviewBody "What a brutal little film this is. We enter a desolate wasteland the scorched remains of what once was the twentieth century before the cruel wars that followed and track a band of Juggers  a sports team that roam the wastes from filthy settlement to filthy settlement challenging the population to raise a team of juggers and play 'the game!' I love that the rules of 'jugging' are never explained we simply observe and learn. There seems to be few rules  it's a primitive extremely violent version of American football except the quarterback is also the running back and the offensive linesmen swing big sticks. The defensive linesman is a big dude swinging what sort of resembles a cat o'nine tails whip made from chains. Basically the ball is a dog's skull and the object is to ram it onto a stick on the opposing side of the field. As there are no time pieces in this new world order the game is timed by throwing stones at a metal gong. If the challenger can last 100 stones without the home side dogskulling them they win. Got all that? Good. Let's move on.My favourite scene although I do like that extreme violence is when they enter the underground Red City and Hauer and Chen pass a man doing chalk art on the filthy pavement. I like how everyone just walks over his artwork paying it no heed and I also like that he doesn't object he just keeps chalking. It's a great example of showing rather than telling the audience that in a world where survival is the priority there is no room for art. No time to stop and admire beauty.I really dig other parts of this movie like the fact they make the oldest guy in their troupe lug a wardrobe full of their sht on his back across endless miles of desert. Nice. And the guys in the weird tank that stop them in the middle of the desert and basically take a ransom from them. We're not really told who these weird guys are or why Rutger and his team bow down to them and fork over their hard earned winnings without a fight or even a harsh word. Well one guy spits on the ground in protest. I also like that when a member of their team is crippled with a broken leg they just leave him there and walk off. Darwin at his most brutal. But this opens the way for Joan Chen to join the team. I also like that it's never explained why she wants to hook up with this band of violent men and trek off into the desert looking for a fight. She just felt like a change I guess. I also really like that there's neither a back story nor a bright future anywhere in sight. We know from a single title card at the start that these people don't remember how the world got fcked up and are so busy simply surviving they're not really thinking about a way to fix things. This is simply the world they exist in and world where the game is everything and the epitome of social standing is to win 100 stones! This brings me to one of my favourite bits of the movie so typically Aussie where Rutger helps the dude big Australian guy he's just pummelled to his feet and the dude remarks ShtI forgot you were better than me! No hard feelings mate. Love it.That reminds me of another favourite bit and indeed one of the best bad guygood guy moments I've ever seen. It's where Rutger is walking off after the final confrontation to return to a life of endless jugging across the desert living from meal to meal and sleep to sleep. The big Australian dude who got pummelled by Rutger asks the villainous ruler of the Red City why he's letting Rutger go. The bad guy simply muses that there's nothing more he could do to make Rutger's life any worse than it already is. What I love more is that Rutger knows it and it doesn't bother him. He's not only resigned himself to this life he's gonna enjoy it as well dammit.".

This is simply the world they exist in and world where the game is everything and the epitome of social standing is to win 100 stones! This brings me to one of my favourite bits of the movie so typically Aussie where Rutger helps the dude big Australian guy he's just pummelled to his feet and the dude remarks ShtI forgot you were better than me! No hard feelings mate. Love it.That reminds me of another favourite bit and indeed one of the best bad guygood guy moments I've ever seen. It's where Rutger is walking off after the final confrontation to return to a life of endless jugging across the desert living from meal to meal and sleep to sleep. The big Australian dude who got pummelled by Rutger asks the villainous ruler of the Red City why he's letting Rutger go. The bad guy simply muses that there's nothing more he could do to make Rutger's life any worse than it already is. What I love more is that Rutger knows it and it doesn't bother him. He's not only resigned himself to this life he's gonna enjoy it as well dammit.";

The storyline creates a very believable notion of sports evolution and although the sports battles are very violent there is a very high level of camaraderie evident throughout the film. An excellent movie to watch on a dreary day or rainy night.

In a nut shell Christopher Connelly plays the strangely named Captain Yankie who is running an amusing scam in the tropics for those with more money than sense. The good captain is leading mock expeditions into the jungle to recover 'lost artifacts' from 'savage natives' in reality the friendly indigenous population who happen to be good friends with the captain Accompanying our hero is also a worldly wise jovial and very drunken Scottish guide Margheriti regular Luciano Pigozzi who is even 'killed' by the 'savages' early on in the shown scam for maximum effect!News of these scams or 'dreams' as our hero likes to call them however gets out to an inspector Lee Van Cleef who using them against our heroes coerces i.e. blackmails them into undertaking a very real mission to retrieve a priceless artifact known as the Ruby Of Doom a most unsettling name... Needless to say such a task proves to be anything but easy with our heroes having to fend off vicious Burmese pirates avoiding various lethal traps and being betrayed from within their own ranks. Mix in some of Margheriti's always cool miniature work and a trademark explosive finale and you have on paper what should have been a great flick.Unfortunately after such a great introduction though things go downhill with most of the action sequences being handled in a somewhat confused manner. Even the aforementioned finale whilst certainly pleasant to look at is handled with very little flair for Margheriti.The good news is that the leads are tremendously fun to watch and the comedy present throughout is very welcome. One of the best bits is a scene in which the natives hear that Captain Yankie has arrived unexpectedly and thus perform a mad rush to hide all their westernised attire and accoutrement's to play the part of 'savages' as they have done previously for the captain so many times. They even put out some fake human skulls for good measure!!!Overall Not a bad film by any means but for fans of the genre I would recommend Margheriti's The Ark Of The Sun God as a much better watch.".

You know you've got a terrible Bmovie when you see a picture like that on the cover i.e. the picture looks stupid and you know the actual movie won't look anything like the picture anyway. Oh and the best part the title Jungle Raiders was in the EXACT same font you'll see on the cover of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Obviously people were supposed to buy it thinking it was an Indiana Jones movie. Not realizing their mistake until they got home and too lazy to go back for a refund these sad individuals would then resign themselves with the knowledge that they had brought home Captain Yankee when they could have had Indy.Upon inserting the video into a friend's VCR I realized something. This wasn't merely a campy lowbudget '80s action flick. No it was a campy lowbudget '80s action flick FROM ITALY! The Italians are crazy of course so I knew I was in for something wacky. I was right. My friend and I couldn't stop laughing until it was over and even after that we were still chuckling about it. This was seriously the most fun I'd had watching a movie in a long time.I don't know where to start talking about it! Okay first of all it is NOT a ripoff of Raiders of the Lost Ark as some other IMDb reviewers have said. Apart from a couple of tombs and some angry natives the resemblance doesn't extend beyond the packaging.Jungle Raiders is in fact a rollercoaster ride of extremely random action sequences crappy special effects and horrendous dubbing. The plot is rapid fire one idiotic thing after another. This movie has everything! It has a boy who sends his pet cobra out to do errands for him! It has flamethrowers! It has pirates! It has a bucktoothed villain who wears a turban with a jewel in the middle of it! It has a Scottish sidekick who wears a plaid pancake hat! It has a firebreathing mummy! It has Lee Van Cleef! All things which could only come from the sick mind of an Italian. The ridiculous booby traps that our heroes encounter are enough to send you into fits of laughter and if that doesn't happen the hilariously bad film score will probably do the trick. And if you haven't died laughing by the time the ending credits roll you'll get to hear one of the worst songs ever written.Only seasoned veterans of bad movies should attempt to watch Jungle Raiders. The viewing should not be done alone. Popcorn is optional. And...what more can I say? I don't understand how anyone could not love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "GolanGlobus were shameless ripoff artists of the 80s who could take a formula from a successful film then turn it into atrocious cinema. How anyone outside of the third world could have been suckered into seeing Jungles Raiders instead of Raiders of the Lost Atk from which most the whole concept comes is beyond me.Bela Lugosi was to Ed Wood what Lee Van Cleef is to this film  the only recognizable actor past his prime but clearly content to collect a paycheck for the grandkids. For the most part the rest of the actors were Italian hacks whose dubbing is almost but not quite laughably bad. My favorite feature of the looping is what would appear to be a rule all actors that are onscreen at any given moment must be talking or at least making utterances. Never mind that their mouths may now be closed or that there is no reason for them to be talking  they are gonna make some noise and there's nothing you can do about it.It's like bad porn where the girl is moaning with her mouth shut or occupied. Furthermore these Italians must go to the School of Gusto Laughs where all male actors are taught to end all dialog lines with a hearty pirate's laugh.  Just watch  it could make a good drinking game.In a nutshell however this movie is bad  with a capital A. Not bad enough to be good as I had hoped but just plain bad. No story and the story elements there are are taken directly from Raiders of the Lost Ark no acting  lots of action with no motivation or reward in the last 20 minutes of the film.Although some companies take great pains to maintain the quality of their film stock archives noone should shed a tear if the entire GolanGlobus stock were to go up in flames tomorrow. The shelfspace is worth more.".

How anyone outside of the third world could have been suckered into seeing Jungles Raiders instead of Raiders of the Lost Atk from which most the whole concept comes is beyond me.Bela Lugosi was to Ed Wood what Lee Van Cleef is to this film  the only recognizable actor past his prime but clearly content to collect a paycheck for the grandkids.

While others played themselves with their tongues in their cheek this takes itself a little too seriously.  The first sign of this is that it drops the UNCLE opening theme in favour of a very 1960's groovy number by Every Mother's Son and then it starts to load itself up with star cameos. In fact the whole thing lacks the gently mocking humour of the other outings and puts itself forward as a proper spy movie.This is a major failing as the action and story are not good enough to carry the film.  The story is quite clever but the execution is poor.  The story is basically in 5 bits  4 sections dealing with each of the 4 daughters and the last being the final confrontation.  The problem with this is that there is no real continuity and it feels piecemeal.  Each chapter has a star  Terry Thomas Telly Savalas Joan Crawford Herbert Lom  but this makes each section more about the cameos than about getting the formula.  In fact in each section the formula usually easily falls into the hands of the 5th daughter by accident.Both Vaughn and McCallum are OK in their roles but it is obvious that they aren't having as much fun as before.  All the cameos are poor because they don't really have any time to do anything interesting and instead just play stereotypes English copper Italian count etc.  Lom is a terrible villain  all he does in each section is turn up and spark off a fight.  When he does get more of a chance to show his character he is exactly like Dr Evil  if fact I thought that Lom was a few steps from being a totally spoof villain despite trying to be menacing and sinister.This lacks the sense of fun that other outings have had.  It takes itself too seriously and immediately loses the one quality that made it good. Check out the spy in the green hat if you don't know what I mean  now that's an example of a tongue in cheek UNCLE movie with some stars as villains who give good performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only problem some reviewers seem to have is that this Uncle movie came from the dreaded season 3. But if they put aside their bias they would see it's actually a pretty entertaining starstudded affair. Two guest stars Telly Savalas and Curt Jurgens would later go on to be featured villains in James Bond films. The femme fatale Kim Darby would star with John Wayne in True Grit and the Pink Panther's Herbert Lom is perfect as the main protagonist. And with a special appearance by none other than Joan Crawford what else is there to say? I don't see the episodes this movie was culled from as overly campy. Everyone seems to treat the plot seriously enough and there are plenty of moments of sex and violence death of Crawford for example that would never make it into a Adam West Batman episode. The problem is these days everyone wants spies to be like Jason Bourne or for the action to be as melodramatic and serious as an episode of 24. This is what is ruining the Bond franchise imo nobody has an appreciation for tongueincheek espionage anymore.If you are willing to suspend reality and revisit the good old days of escapism you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. It's an engaging fun affair that has our heroes trotting around the globe chasing after Hitchcockian MacGuffin the formula what else could one ask for?".

THE KARATE KILLERS is a featurelength version of a twoepisode entry in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. series. I should probably admit right from the start that I had never seen an episode of this show so I really can't say how well this movie is or how good the two episodes are and how they compare to other episodes in the series. For the most part I found myself having a pretty good time. I will admit that I found a lot of this to be rather campy and I'm not sure if this is just how it's aged or perhaps the series was always meant to be campy. Either way there were a lot of fun moments scattered throughout the picture with some of the highlights including the opening sequence and another very good one where McCallum finds himself heading towards an ice breaker which will certainly kill him. There are several sequences here that manage to capture that cliffhanger feeling that people saw in serials back in the day. Another thing that kept this film moving were the countless celebrity appearances including Joan Crawford Herbert Lom Leo G. Carroll Telly Savalas and Kim Darby. Seeing all these stars pop up in small roles was nice. The two leads were also extremely good and fun. THE KARATE KILLERS I don't think was meant to be taken too serious so as long as you turn your brain off there's some fun to be had.".

But even as a fan I cannot say this is a good film in any way. Too bad a number of good actors such as Herbert Lom Joan Crawford Kim Darby Telly Savalas and the smoking hot Jill Ireland appear in this film a splicedtogether 2 part MFU adventure.Also a shame seeing as there is a fun opening sequence with a squadron of Wallis WA116 type autogyros that attack Our Heroes as they drive the Pirhanna UNCLE car...as an autogyro aficionado this sequence was released two months before the 007 'Little Nellie' autogyro sequence in 'You Only Live Twice.' There should be more autogyros in cinema but they still don't save this picture. It's mostly a bunch of short uninteresting vignettes and very silly fight scenes featuring a bunch of goons in matching outfits similar to the goons you'd see on the Batman show working for Penguin or the Riddler.The most silly fight takes place in a night club where the mostly forgotten bubblegum band 'Every Mother's Son' performs...apparently MGM owned this group and used this film for crosspromotional purposes. Which pretty much sums up this film...just cashing in before the gravy train dried up. Vaughn and McCallum who usually had a good chemistry together and had high individual appeal seem to be phoning in their appearances...it might have been my imagination but I swear it looked as if they were each wondering if their respective agents had been getting calls lately or whether he should invest in a restaurant.If you are not familiar with the MFU series you should know that Seasons 1  2 of that show were generally good and a few excellent but from Season 3 onward there were serious problems. This movie is from two Season 3 episodes and Season 3 was the nadir of this series.The good episodes of MFU have cleverness fun and some kind of a point to them....but this doesn't and worse it's a doublelength waste of time as opposed to just one misfire of an episode.I DVR'd this last time it was on the TCM cable network it having been a while since I'd seen an MFU episode. Frankly I would have been better off going the library or video rental store and watching another episode.This film is only of interest for diehard UNCLE fans or for college students drinking cheap beer to watch on a Saturday afternoon so they can jeer at it. If you've never seen MFU this is not a good introduction to the series. This is sad seeing as MFU is almost never shown even on cable TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having graduated from a military academy and later joining army ROTC myself it was almost like I was living back at my high school again. Especially due to the fact that I was a company commander my senior year and had my best friends as platoon leaders and XO. I got a much different take on the movie than most of you. It is one that was much more prevalent in the military academy I to than ROTC. Rather than a view of misguided youths I would argue the point that they were misguided I saw the movie as fight between the old and the new. The old conservative ways versus the post Vietnam War era generation. Whether to preserve conservative tradition or to continue with social liberalism. In the movie the fight was about tearing down the academy to build condominiums. In real life where I was it was about turning our military academy into a normal prep school. In my case the fight didn't get violent however like the cadets in the movie I picked the losing side.In the movie I was heart broken that the governor would send troops to the school rather than try and work out a peaceful compromise when he saw the measure that people were willing to go to in order to protect their school. In real life I was very disheartened to see the old cadre of retired military officers get sacked and replaced by soft civilian administrators. It all hit a climax when one of my life's role models a retired USAF Major and our companies tactical officer spoke out against some of the changes being made and got himself sacked. For me that was George C Scott Penn and Cruise were my friends and platoon leaders in my company and the crisis between the old ways and the new ways were very much the same. The movie reached out to me possibly more than any other. It was seeing my teenage self all over again.".

I guess some actors are just destined to rise to the top.George C. Scott also turned in a great believable performance as an old wartime General. However I find it interesting after seeing this movie over 20 years later how it's context has changed for me personally. While in '81 the story was perhaps designed to generate sympathy for the General and his plight I look at his situation today and feel nothing but pity for him as I would for any Shakespearean tragic hero who because of their narrowsightedness could not see the bigger picture. And in this case their consequences caused a chain of events that took on an uncontrollable life of their own. Funny how the years can sometimes dictate understanding and perspective.The previous review mentioned for this flick is 100 bang on.".

Scott and their reaction to the news of the closing of the Academy.Scott announces at the graduation that the next year will be the final year of Bunker Hill. The Board of Trustees is selling off the place for its prime real estate value to be used for condominium development. Certainly an occurrence we've seen all over the country in many places and not something really desirable in many.Cadet Major Timothy Hutton knows he will head the last graduating class at Bunker Hill. He and fellow cadets like Sean Penn and Tom Cruise aren't taking it lying down. They may be military cadets but they've seen and grown up with student protests. Only these students have weapons and are trained in their use. Can you really blame the cadets like Hutton who've actually in fact forgotten that soldiers carry out and don't make policy? I think it was significant that during the course of Taps it's mentioned that George C. Scott served with General Douglas MacArthur who gave him a sword for his service. It's also mentioned that Scott was passed over for promotion an advancement beyond being a brigadier general and was retired comfortably out to pasture at the Academy.Scott's not the same kind of military man you see in Patton. Rather he's a lot like the Patton you see in that television film Patton the Last Days. A man so totally out of his element that when the accident and broken neck occurred he'd lost his will to live.Anyway after a scuffle with some of the town louts who are less than enamored of Bunker Hill's military tradition. A town kid is accidentally killed when he tries to get Scott's military issue pistol and it discharges. In a court of law the man would have been acquitted but Scott answers to a higher law he lives by. That scuffle threatens to close the school even for the last year and the kids seize it. It's a confrontation then between idealistic and wrongheaded youth and the real forces of law enforcement.Ronny Cox contributes a very nice performance as the commanding general of the National Guard trying to keep a lid on the situation. His scenes with the idealistic and obstinate Hutton are the highlight of the film for me.Tom Cruise and Sean Penn got their first real notice in this film right at the start of their respective megacareers. Hutton has a nice followup to his Oscar winning performance from Ordinary People. And George C. Scott is George C. Scott.".

It should be mandatory viewing for anyone planning a military career so that they can really evaluate their reasoning for joining the armed services. It should be especially mandatory for any ROTC cadet in college I'm in such a program so I speak from experience.Everyone involved played excellent roles and made the viewer make it as if they were really caught up in such a situation in real life. It didn't seem to be an acted movie it was just that good. I think that Ronny Cox also put some feeling into his role but if it had to be made in the '90s I'd pick Dale Dye who played brief but great roles as a captain in both Platoon and Casualties of War.Again this movie should get more credit than it has because the movie's themes and issues still haunt us even in this new world order we're supposedly in. Great work to all involved!".

	schema:reviewBody "Even through I didn't watch this... 30 years after it debuted in theaters worldwide in 198182 it's still truly the military film that welcomed us into the Reagan years in the US. It was adapted from the novel Father Sky written in 1979.. but adapted for the early 80s tackling the state of US Military academies and the people who are a great part of them. In this film... it's not about the major US military academies but the minor ones that are being given their own moment.In this case Bunker Hill Military Academy. The film through was filmed in historic Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Wayne Pennsylvania near the famous fields where Washington and his men took camp for the winter in 1777. The academy similar to the Surovov Military Schools in Russia and Belarus as a junior military college trains middle and high school level boys academics character and leadership skills preparing them to become part of the US Army soon as officers in the USMA in West Point and is led by the great George Scott a retired US Army general officer as its Commandant. He's to me my Gen. Patton Ol' Blood and Guts....That movie reminds me of the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolutionary War... the academy got its name from this great battleAt the academy's graduation parade Scott shocked everyone with his announcement by the next year as decided by the school board the academy will be closed and the land where it is located prime real estate. No one is more surprised of this than the next year's cadet commander Timothy Hutton by now a Cadet Major Scott had promoted him the night before leader of next year's seniors and the corps of cadets the last in its history and mentored by the veteran commandant. He's well loved by the cadets here and is truly their leader especially by the cadet officers under him. Also surprised by this bad news are his two fellow cadet officers and best friends CDT CPT Tom Cruise a elite cadet company commander thus the red beret on his uniform and CDT CPT Sean Penn of the cadet cavalry troop and also the executive officer of the corps. The other cadet officers Giancarlo Esposito and Evan Handler cadets Daniel Kimmel John P. Narvin Jr. Brendan Ward and others were also dismayed but as always had hope in Hutton to do something about it at once. They share the same feeling with the Commandant... that when they're still around it will not close down and continue its mandate.At the academy prom that same night a group of town teens came to disturb the occasion outside. When two of the COs suddenly approached them then angrily followed by the other cadets a fight broke out and suddenly Scott came out to intervene when one of the teens stole his pistol and when he had it back it shot one of the teens by accident killing the teen. And after being arrested he later had a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. The result the school board decided it would push on with the closure in a month or two. That made everyone shocked and soon the school would be a virtual fortress and its cadets led by Hutton Cruise and Penn... soldiers on a mission to save this piece of history for good all at the cost of their lives.While on the go for supplies the truck that CDT CPT Esposito drives with some of the cadets Hutton was left behind and had told to the dean and others in the armory about his future plans to prevent the school's closure is stalled and is attacked by the same teens that disturbed the prom but later comes back thanks to Cruise's efforts. Upon returning their weapons and positions are prepared and soon... it's in a state of siege. Soon the police surround the grounds then the parents come in to ask their boys to give in among them Wayne Tippit the Army Master Sergeant who is also Tim's dad In one occasion he tells Hutton that what they are doing is the wrong execution of the right idea and soon... the Army National Guard unit led by Ronny Cox a ANG Colonel who wants the cadets out. Soon he informs them of the commandant's demise and the cadets pay tribute to him at once but later.... things are gonna turn bad.The film follows the rest of their actions very well. It's a well depicted and beautiful film made. It's truly the best military academy film made after over 30 years. Of course who would forget this would be Tim's first after his Oscars achievement Tom's film no. 2 and Sean's debut performance? And also the late George Scott did well here too as the academy commandant. It's very good and it motivates me a lot.Oh and the final scenes... when Cruise is found by Tim and Sean firing a machine gun at the Army National Guardsmen shouting It's beautiful man! BEAUTIFUL! and is later shot dead with his best pal... it's tragic and shocking. One of the film's best moments. As a future US Navy NROTC student I'll gonna love it and I truly recommend watching this. 3 decades after the memory of the cadets killed in the fight for Bunker Hill Military Academy will still be remembered forever. They died for a good cause... and the film illustrates this in a great way.Eternal glory be to all of them who died just like every soldier doing the ultimate sacrifice for the defense of our freedom. I always think of them everyday. Always.".

They died for a good cause... and the film illustrates this in a great way.Eternal glory be to all of them who died just like every soldier doing the ultimate sacrifice for the defense of our freedom. I always think of them everyday. Always.";

When the corps of Bunker Hill Academy is threatened the cadets band together to attempt to save their home. As is seen in certain scenes in the film the reasons behind the actions of cMAJ Morland and his corps are mystifying to people on the outside. Where the State requisition officers see tax payer dollars the cadets see foundation and institution dissolving before them. Parents can not understand why their thirteen year old boy is holding a loaded M16 rifle. The police and National Guardsmen however do understand. This movie really does portray exactly what being a soldier is all about. When push comes to shove the most important thing to a soldier is the man or woman next to him. While cMAJ Morland himself may have been disillusioned with General Baige the rest of the cadets at Bunker Hill Academy fought for each other. This truly is an epic portrayal of the soldier. Through powerful performances by Penn Cruise and Hutton the film is able to show that one's young age is not a prohibiter of understanding of one very important word Honor.".

I'm sure in the TV advertisements the appeal was obvious. Actors near my age and my older brothers' agesthe then cool look of their uniforms and without a doubtthat scene in the the ad where the students are overhead with their guns pointed at the adultsI.E. rebellion. Hard to find a preteen or teenage boy who wouldn't find this kind of thing appealing. In the new Reaganconservative '80s era it was fitting. One's point of view can only describe to that person what this film is all about. Some have felt this film is prowarwhile others like me feel it's th opposite. I find it to be even more than that though. It seemed to me that it's just as I stated above. The naive' appeal of war and weapons to young mindsas well as the parents who send their kids to these kinds of places to shape them up. No offense to those who did attend an academythere are those who actually do get something out of itbut for my own life experience and viewsI'll more than likely never understand what that would be. Self discipline can be taught to one's self just as easily.Anyhowgetting back to the film. As a movie it was quite the intense experience. George C. Scott was great in it but I really wish his character had not been removed from the story. I felt he brought these kids a level measure of control and a wiser voice of reason. Timothy HuttonSean Penn and aside from the younger kidsthe 1718 year old Tom Cruise are all fantastic in their roles. In the case of Penn  Cruise a preview of good things to come for them as actors.Penn is a great friend to Hutton's character and this may seem like a simple role at first but as the story goes on his performance builds on itself with his still very fresh abilities as an actor.Cruise is unsettling but electric as the cadet who likes the power  control he's been trained with just a little too much. Resulting in the climactic scene where he goes triggerhappy with a machine gun near the end of the film. It's beautiful man! is the most remembered line from the whole film.Huttonthe veteran actor of the 3plays a young man who has a more idealistic view of his education at the academy and of the overall meaning. It's more like an elegant party for him and his hanging out with old soldiers. The taking of the academy by the students was handled convincingly enough but the idea that they'd bring in tanks and the real army seemed a bit much. The pressure of that later resulting in a bit of a dissension between Penn  Hutton.The thing that has not set to well with those that have seen this movie is the senseless killing of a boy who's only about 10 or 11 by the military. Even over 27 years laterit still feels like it was not a necessary thing to put in this movie to make the point of what happens to these boys when they end up in a real war. The point was made long before that. It was equally unnerving for me to realize that even kids that age can stop living'.That nearly fatal story choice asidethe film really is great. The best thing one can do before watching is just put aside your left or right views and just watch it as you would any other movie. What I learned years later is not to let myself get so deep into the politics and just keep in mindthat's Hollywood and the filmmakers ideas andor ideals. END".

Some perform predictably while others really shine particularly Brendan Ward as Charlie Auden.The film holds up well after 30 years feeling more like a story SET in the early 80's rather than being burdened by its age. Cinematography is dramatic though not always dynamic and makes GREAT use of the borrowed setting of actual Valley Forge academy.The story is paced well though some may feel it to be kind of slow. This is NOT an action movie and is far from a traditional military movie either. Those who are looking for something along the lines of We Were Soldiers or even the first half of Full Metal Jacket will be very disappointed. Those with a more open mind for classical storytelling will find a surprisingly detailed portrayal of life in a military academy and a deeper story than may be seen on the surface.Atypical for the theme and maybe not for everyone but definitely worth a shot.".

That isn't so in regard to TAPS the great majority of the comments that I've read about it here  and I admit I haven't read them all  are totally on target whether the poster liked or didn't like the message that TAPS had about what goes into the correct training of a military officer and what happens if that training becomes shortsighted.TAPS is an important movie because it is an excellent study into what a soldier IS and what he ISN'T. It shows for example that one preserves one's honor when one goes to war but that the preservation of honor isn't by itself enough to start such a battle. It explores the difference between a true soldier and a death lover as Ronny Cox's character so amply puts it.These are just some of the important issues that TAPS explores about what goes into the making of a soldier and the purpose for starting a war. The movie delves into other important military issues too but the importance of this film lies in its ability to explore them all. An attentive audience member will certainly leave this movie realizing that its messages must be remembered and pondered over.".

The meeting is predictably tense when the educated young Mr. Hall confronts his venomspewing elder Mr. Cayhall about the murders. The next day headlines run proclaiming Adam the grandson who has come to the state to save his grandfather the infamous Ku Klux Klan bomber. While the old man's life lies in the balance Adam's motivation in fighting this battle becomes clear as the story unfolds. Not only does he fight for his grandfather but perhaps for himself as well.

	schema:reviewBody "For me this is the best role of Hackman's career and one of Oscar's most overlooked roles. His character was as revolting cold and repugnantly racist as a human being could be but Hackman played Sam Cayhall as a person with a surprising depth and emotion that although you couldn't exactly like him you find yourself quietly hoping his death penalty will be overturned as he plumbs the depths of his evil deeds and confronts his past. The scene when Fay Dunaway's Lee Cayhall Bowen comes to see Sam in the hours before his execution is as good as it gets. Lee asks if Sam would have killed Joe Lincoln when she was young had she spoken up Sam tells her yes. You KNOW you SEE that he wouldn't have but in seeing the toll that the guilt of a lifetime of believing it was her fault had exacted from his daughter Sam lied. Sam redeemed her sanity in that lie gave her life the peace she never had and in many ways redeemed himself.Although Dunaway is only 11 years younger than Hackman she handily pulls off the role of Cayhall's emotional conflicted and alcoholic daughter Lee. She has spent her life hiding from whom she is both from the community and herself the crimes of her father and the stigma it has brought.Chris O'Donnell is just as good as Sam's grandson Adam Hall who is now a lawyer. Hall's father had changed the family surname to also escape the stigma of being the son of the murdering Klansman Cayhall. Apparently by design Hall works for the firm who handles his grandfather's case although he keeps his grandfather's identity a secret until he requests to take on the final death penalty appeal. Along the way Hall learns the unpleasant reality of who he is the bitter hate and ugliness bred into his grandfather and insight into the truth of why his father had committed suicide when Hall was a young boy.This film although unpleasant in theme is full of stellar performances and by far the most nuanced and conflicted character Gene Hackman has ever played. If you haven't seen The Chamber get it it's worth the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie that you expect to be a courtroom drama actually turns out to be the story of a family and its past as young lawyer Adam Hall Chris O'Donnell finds himself digging through several generations of family skeletons after he takes on the case of his grandfather Sam Cayhall Gene Hackman a racist scumbag found guilty years before of a Mississippi bombing that killed two Jewish children and now set to die in the gas chamber in less than a month unless Adam can find some way of commuting the death sentence.The clear highlight of the movie is Hackman's performance. He was believable in a movie in which he's definitely cast against type. He becomes the epitome of the racist scumbag he's portraying and yet the character's nature is also softened by the writers who introduce uncertainties about Cayhall's level of involvement in the bombing and who raise the possibility that he may be feeling remorse for what happened. Cayhall in the end even does something somewhat noble. His daughter played by Faye Dunaway  who witnessed him murder a black man in an incident years before  has been haunted with guilt believing that if she had let him know that she was present he would never have killed the man in front of her eyes. She feels guilty believing that she's responsible for the man's death and finally asks her father as she visits before his execution whether he would have killed the man if he had known she was there. He says he would have. It sounds like a harsh and cold statement coming from Cayhall and yet he's really telling her that it wasn't her fault and she shouldn't feel guilty over what happened. I found that simple scene very moving  mainly because it seemed to be a lie. His body language seemed to suggest that he wouldn't have killed the man with his daughter watching but he wanted to take away her feelings of guilt.Perhaps though that also serves as the great weakness here  to me at least. Cayhall was a bad guy but there seemed to be attempts to excuse him  especially with the repeated refrain that he had no choice but to become a hateful bigot. His father had been one his father's father and his father as well. How could Cayhall have turned out differently after three generations of hate? The obvious response which was strangely never voiced is that Cayhall's son Adam's father who had ultimately committed suicide apparently out of shame from the family's past turned out differently in spite of the four generations of hatred in the family before him. The whole idea that Cayhall was destined to be a racist because of his upbringing grated on me because of that. Still Hackman's performance was great and Cayhall was an interesting character.Chris O'Donnell was overshadowed by Hackman in this. He was all right as Adam but perhaps lacked a bit of spark that might have brought more life to the movie. The writers made a good decision in not developing a romance between Adam and Nora Lela Rochon. An interracial romance between the racist's grandson and lawyer and the governor's aide might have been an obvious direction to take but it frankly would have been too obvious. The end result though was that Nora was a minor character. Her place in the story seemed illdefined to me. There's a hint of some deep dark secrets from the past that could come back to haunt some of Mississippi's political elite but that never gets developed.Many criticize this because it apparently strays quite liberally from the John Grisham novel on which it's based which I've never read I admit. Well this is a movie. Movies and books are different. You can't just take a novel and make it fit the screen so adaptations don't bother me as long as the end result on film is good. This was a good movie and I appreciated the fact that while Cayhall's character was softened over the course of it there was no real redemption for the character. He played his part in the children's deaths and he paid the price for it. Overall this is pretty good.".

The actions of all politicians reveals how difficult it can be to seek justice. They are always looking sideways. Also the crowd outside the execution site shows how easy it is to stir up mob emotion. Again nicely laid out and captured on film. The film visually translated Grishelm's understanding of Southern culture and politics. I also thought Chris O'Donnell captured the intensity of someone who is confronting his family's past. The camera work which holds on his face assists in helping us to see the quiet determination with which he works. The camera is a good replacement for the interior monologue of fiction!I also liked the flashbacks which help him to comprehend just where his father came from and why suicide might have been a response. This film is timely today in lieu of the polarization of American politics. Scary stuff!".

	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago I read the novel The Chamber by John Grisham and I thought it was a spectacular reading experience. Then in 1996 they released it in the theatres and I was hoping that the outcome would turn out on a positive note just like the novel. Also I was hoping that very talented performers like Chris O'Donnell Gene Hackman and Faye Dunaway would grace the screen like they've done before. However the high expectations were sadly shattered. Nothing exciting happens as opposed to what's in the book there's very little happening here the acting is very wooden and the actors were woefully miscast. On a positive note some stuff from the novel were brought into the movie. So for those who never read the novel or seen the movie I won't give too much away. But those who expected an equally riveting novel to movie adaptation you will be disappointed. One thing that upset me most here is the different characteristics between Adam Hall in the novel and Adam Hall Chris O'Donnell in the movie. In the novel Hall is a typical attorney who's a bit green and does not know what to expect. In the movie he's made like a bigshot who can get by in this case like a piece of cake. Okay I understand we can't cram everything from the novel because then it would take too long and we're not all patient for a three hour movie so I respect that. I think the movie had it's mind on cutting to the chase rather than unravelling the events that led to the scenes. In the end it's just better that you all should just read the book and forget about the film.".

When I saw the movie I didn't find it terrible though not a great movie either. Maybe it was just that many people  myself not included  counted A Time to Kill as one of the best adaptations and dismissed this one.Anyway Gene Hackman makes a pretty ugly Klansman well duh he gets into any character and I'd say that he overshadows Chris O'Donnell who just looks a little out of place in this sort of movie. I can't tell whether or not Faye Dunaway is just there for show. But overall what I like about this movie is that it doesn't lionize Hackman's character but it shows why he became a Klansman  sort of like what Dead Man Walking does with Sean Penn's character. Obviously The Chamber isn't in the same league as that one. But still I think that most people need to reassess this movie. Also starring Robert Prosky Raymond J. Barry Bo Jackson and Lela Rochon.".

	schema:headline " Not a bad concept";
	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching this after I just finished hearing about it. I'll say it's not great but its definitely worth the time to watch.You have a very dramatic story of a murdering bigot's grandson who's a lawyer trying to save his grandfather Gene Hackman from his execution in 28 days. Just from their you know the plot is going to thicken.When I saw this movie had Gene Hackman and Faye Dunaway I said great I love those actors. It's also got Chris O'Donnell OK not a bad actor but does he remind anyone else of Matthew Perry? and it's even got Bo Jackson.I was surprised by a few things. One was that Bo Jackson despite not having many lines was quite good at acting. Another less pleasant was that as much as I love her Faye Dunaway did not do an overly impressive performance. Watch her in Bonnie and Clyde and then compare her to THIS role... you're not even on the same chart. Playing a rich Southern Bell is maybe more difficult for her but she did have a few good scene's playing a drunk. One thing that didn't surprise me was Gene Hackman. Mr. Hackman is undoubtedly a great actor is this movie he made no exception. He definitely needs to give thanks to his make up crew but he certainly delivered the punches. The emotions he showed seemed so powerful like he's really ready to join in a lynching. But he's also prepared not ready but prepared to forgive.Really i think that the only problem with this movies was the scenes without Gene Hackman. The rest of the scenes made everything seem more like a Made for TV movie. The chemistry between Adam Hall Chris O'Donnell and Nora Stark Lela Rochon was played off of more when they WEREN'T together. With better acting this could have been a much better film. But still it was not bad.Kudos to John Grisham for the novel It's a good idea it wasn't played out as well as it could have... But still it's still worth while watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the title The Chamber is meant to be a pun it's a pretty good one. There's the judge's chamber where decisions are made and at the other end the gas chamber where those plans are executed along with the inmate to whom those judgments were passed down.In some ways the title is the niftiest part of the movie. For John Gresham whose intentions are always benign it's a pretty weak story. It shouldn't be with William Goldman doing the adaptation. It's Gresham's most pedantic. Condemned are both racist violence and the death penalty the former more so than the latter.That's the bothersome part of the plot. Okay Gene Hackman does his best with the role of the lifetime KKK bomber who takes the rap for the real killer of the two Jewish children. But he's miscast. Hackman is not an unreflective defiant redneck racist and murderer. JAMES WOODS is that character. Hackman is absolutely firstrate without being a bravura actor when he gets the right role whether it's villainous or heroic but he's never been good with accents and man does this role call for one.At that he gives the strongest performance in the film with support from a couple of seasoned players like Harve Presnell. Gresham's relatively innocent young idealist Chris O'Donnell does not convince. He looks the part alright but his voice and gestures suggest a weakness that the character shouldn't have. And he's the main man. Some of the supporting players like Bo Jackson as Sergeant Packer can't seem to act at all.The climax involves one of those detailed execution scenes I've come to loathe. I don't understand why they're there. In a short cinematic exercise in the early 1940s Orson Welles used the firstperson camera to guide the viewer into a gas chamber. Then in the mid50s there was a detailed execution of Susan Hayward in I Want to Live. Then there was a hiatus for another twenty years or so before these tasteless scenes came back with a vengeance. Here we get to see Gene Hackman gassed to death the foamy spittle dripping from his mouth as he expires. But what does this tell us? That execution is horrifying and painful? What else is new? So what do these scenes tell us that we don't already know? I understand some TV channels are negotiating with Texas to film executions for broadcast. How long before the opportunity to pull the switch is auctioned on eBay? What kind of audience do the writers and directors think they're addressing? The musical score is by Carter Burwell and it's fairly conventional full of deep and ominous chords. He's a talented composer who has done quirkier work in better films like Fargo and The Spanish Prisoner. Judging from the movies that are based on his novels John Gresham is in the notuncommon position of being at odds with the values of the society he grew up in. A lot of other marginalized writers have also been prompted to explain the sins of their culture's past to the rest of us beginning maybe with Nathaniel Hawthorne and running through the Southern giants of American literature and playwriting  Tennessee Williams Faulkner and the rest. Gresham fits the mold and his work is interesting but this is a failed effort. The legal aspects are confusing the characters a bit muddled and the story itself either too simple or too complex depending on how you look at it.".

I will reveal that it has something to do with a murder and the grandfather about to get the gas chamber. I don't think it will spoil anyones enjoyment of the film or vice versa.The problem is that Gene Hackman as the grandfather is such a underwritten character and he is not portrayed enough as the monster he is supposed to be. Yes he is a white supremacist and his own family resented him for it but he comes off much too sympathetic as the plot goes along. He yells and resists at first he mocks his liberal grandson and that's about it.Chris O'Donnell as the grandson doesn't really register either. We know his motivation but we don't really feel his pain of learning where he comes from. Again the script is severely underwritten on his part.Then the worst of all. The daughter played by Faye Dunaway. There is a scene at the end between Hackman and Dunaway that is so false so unintentionally hilarious that I almost shut the film off.The ending is sad but it doesn't have enough emotional power either. Because Hackman has neither been portrayed as a total monster nor has he been portrayed as monster with a heart we could care less if he lives or dies.".

Although according to the trivia Grisham says this is one of the adaptations he likes least I think it still is a very good movie that incorporates these layers and most of the essence in a Grisham story. Of course the book is much more complex much more intense so if you like the movie I can really recommend reading the book.The Chamber is about the young lawyer Adam Hall that returns to his family's roots in Mississippi where one of the family's dark secrets is hidden. His grandfather Sam Cayhall is on death row for a fatal bombing carried out by the Klu Klux Klan scheduled to be executed in just a few days. Adam is his last chance. But Sam is not really cooperative and even though the bombing was in the sixties secrets are very much still in play powerful and dangerous.I think the movie do capture enough of the book to be an intense and suspenseful movie very much thanks to Gene Hackman's acting. Even though I have seen the movie a couple of times read the book I still find it intense. The movie is both durable and stands the test of time. That is the mark of a real good thriller.710".

Usually the prisoner receives a last minute reprieve but not in this case here we join racist redneck Gene Hackman in his last few moments as he is strapped into the eponymous chamber and struggles to hold his breath while the poisonous gas swirls invisibly around him. Foam issues from his mouth as the gas takes effect and you wonder why you had to see that. The only reason I can think of is because the film was made one year after Dead Man Walking.Gene Hackman is as good as you'd expect him to be he must be one  if not the  greatest actors of his generation and he makes young Chris O'Donnell look wholly insipid. To be fair to O'Donnell there isn't that much in his character to grab hold of  the only characteristic he has is the desire to see his grandpappy saved from the chamber. And when the poor lad isn't being acted off the screen by Hackman he has to contend with Faye Dunaway giving one of the better performances of her later career as Hackman's alcoholic daughter who is haunted by the mistaken belief that she may have prevented a murder she witnessed as a child had she not chosen to remain silent at the fateful moment.The Chamber isn't a classic by any measure but it's probably better than its rating on this site might lead you to believe although judging by some of the comments you might enjoy it more if you haven't read the book on which it is based.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gene Hackman does everything but shout I want to live!' in this indictment of the death penalty of the gas chamber of hatred and bigotry of loyalty to disreputable people of grandstanding politicians and judges of family shame and secrets...the list goes on and on. Film begins with a 1967 hatecrime down south attributed to a Klansman charged with the bomb blast that killed two Jewish boys and maimed their father. Fastforward 30 years that Klansman now aged and set to be executed in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 28 days is represented on appeal by the grandson he's never met a young but not incompetent attorney who figures he's his grandfather's only hope. Family loyalty gets the green light here though the reasoning behind the kid's pursuit of this case is tenuous at best. Fans of novelist John Grisham may say the young man's motivation is clear to heal family wounds and to mitigate his secret shame but that only works for a book jacket on the screen with Nwords exploding and hatespeech spewing out of the one lively character it's another matter. When Chris O'Donnell is at the jail being led down hallways and through locked doors to meet racist grizzled old Gene Hackmansharper and saltier than the other Death Row inmates we seeone is apt to get Silence of the Lambs dj vu. Indeed Hackman is a vile cuss who distrusts everybody but as the drama unfoldswherein the attorney and his grandfather learn to work togetherone has to wonder if this is meant to be the heart of the material or is there something else lying in wait to surprise us. Are we supposed to be sympathetic towards Hackman's poisonous hatefilled Sam Cayhall just because he's revealed to have a conscience deep down? Or that he didn't work alone? William Goldman and Chris Reese a pseudonym for Phil Alden Robinson adapted Grisham's book and I'm guessing they weren't clear on how much redemption Sam Cayhall should be shown. It's a movie full of muddled logic nondescript performances save for Hackman and an overacting Faye Dunaway as Hackman's daughter and credibility issues right from the getgo. 12 from ".

Adam has no use for his grandfather but he believes someone else made the bomb and wants to find out what really happened.The movie is based on a John Grisham novel and despite the reviews I thought it was good and powerful mostly thanks to the performance of Gene Hackman.

It's clearly a very low budget film and the visuals are among Rohmer's most nondescript. Also despite it's brevity it drags a bit in places. Still in spite of these flaws it's a worthwhile addition to the Rohmer canon.The film itself is about two male college students. Guillame is the leader here. He is also a real jerk similar to the stereotypical frat boy today. This is the type of person who comes from a privileged background but is still quite ignorant in spite of his advantages. Since he is clearly lacking intelligence but seems affable enough this type of guy gets treated well by people who don't realize that he has just enough cunning to take advantage of their kindness and screw them over. So naturally he uses and abuses everyone around him. This includes his pathetic spineless sidekick Bertrand and their mutual love interestdumping ground Suzanne. The film is narrated by Bertrand who is something of a nonentity.Suzanne is a decent looking girl with a steady job but she doesn't have enough money to attend college full time. Because she is not beautiful and also because of the aforementioned lack of funds she allows herself to be used by Bertrand and Guillame. It's clear she cares more about them than they do about her and she ends up wasting her hard earned money on the boys.The twist here is that eventually Suzanne gets tired of the boys and moves on to better things while they stay the same. Despite coming from a lower social standing she ends equal to them and thus exposes their aimless apathy. Of course Suzanne is not perfect either.

	schema:reviewBody "Part two of Eric Rohmer's ongoing series of stories this one concerns a love triangle of sorts. Bertrand and Guillaume meet Suzanne a young plainlooking woman. Bertrand decides not to pursue her but Guillaume does and once he's made her his he pushes her aside. Angered Suzanne flirts with Bertrand and asks him out in order to make Guillaume jealous. What takes place is a series of events in which both young men take advantage of Suzanne who is somewhat of a mousy character throughout part of Rohmer's plot but who takes charge in the short movie's later half. SUZANNE'S CAREER also concerns a constant in Rohmer's Six Moral Tales theme the man who is attracted to a woman he does not want and idealizes another woman he does want or already is engagedmarried to. Normally the spurned woman is not to the type of the protagonist's liking and the one he is in love with is. Sophie in this story represents that ideal for Bertrand even when to the viewer she appears rather dull and Suzanne has shown a greater personality than originally displayed. Not as talky as LE GENOU DE CLAIRE indeed no movie can be! this one has a little more wit to it even when it's a little flat here and there.".

	schema:reviewBody "Suzanne's Career the second of Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales is an intriguing little drama encircling the lives of three students Bertrand our slightly nave narrator Guillaume a chauvinistic leech and Suzanne an easily manipulated clingy girl whom they take advantage of. In comparison to The Girl at the Monceau Bakery the first moral tale Suzanne's Career is significantly darker better acted but somehow less effective. There's more meat here but something gets lost in translation. It is still a good film but it drags in places and sometimes becomes a little monotonous. If a viewer can get past that though the last fifteen minutes of the film is easily the best part of the entire movie.At the beginning we see Bertrand and Guillaume two young college boys having a conversation with Suzanne a girl whom they've just met. Guillaume decides early on to use the girl manipulate her emotions exploit her in any way he can. And he does so effectively for awhile. Guillaume flirts with other girls in Suzanne's presence talks down to her lives off of her money completely regretless. Throughout the whole thing Bertrand stands by. He is torn between whether or not to go against his friend who he looks up to or to join him and manipulate the girl in order to benefit himself.This is a fairly good film. It is longer than the first moral tale but not quite feature length. The moral dilemma here concerning fair and right treatment of women is very interesting to watch unfold. It takes a little too long to get to where it's going though. The middle drags on for longer than it needed to. There is no question that the two male characters are absolute pigs but watching them act on their chauvinism gets a little old after awhile. However good narration an excellent plot and a good statement about how people should be treated salvage this moral tale. Suzanne's Career is definitely worth the hour.710".

	schema:headline " BEAUTIFUL in the very meaning of this word";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps it ill be better if I live in your heart where the world can't see me. If I'm dead there will be no staying of our love. The novelplay by Alexandre Dumas Fils LA DAME AUX CAMELIAS has attracted a lot of artists. Verdi wrote his opera LA TRAVIATA basing its content on this play. The film industry have also made a lot of adaptations of the play from the period of silent era up till modern times. However if one hears a movie title CAMILLE what usually comes to one's mind is the film by George Cukor with Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor. Why? There is something magical about this version that made it stand a test of time something that helped it be appreciated for almost seven decades. Is it performances cinematography or Garbo's presence that make it so enchanting to watch? The answer is not so easy because the movie is a masterpiece of beauty at multiple levels.The performances are absolutely outstanding. It is difficult to say if Garbo gives her best performance in CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL. I think that it is more a matter of personal preferences. One thing is sure  she does something more than acting. She totally feels the role every movement every gesture is extremely natural as if you were watching reality not a movie. As a result Garbo achieves something really outstanding in CAMILLE some kind of the ultimate masterpiece of performance. Robert Taylor very well fits to the role of Armand Duvall. He manages to stress the most important feature of his role  delicacy and sincerity. Henry Daniell is a perfect choice for Baron De Varville  cruel unemotional cynical and very selfish. I shall never forget the scene when Marguerite plays a lyrical piece on the piano expecting Armand's visit. However it is Baron who comes unexpectedly. While Armand is trying to get to the house Baron plays the piano and Marguerite has to behave as if she wasn't expecting anyone. The scene ends with hysterical laughter of them both and a magnificent acting. Laura Hope Crews also gives a lovely performance as Prudence Duvernoy stressing her frivolity and extravagance. Consider her performance at the party at the mansion. Yet Lionel Barrymore though not given much time on screen is memorable particularly in the scene of his meeting with Marguerite. What a lovely presentation of two different world views! Not a better or a worse view but DIFFERENT views  Marguerite attached to love and emotions and Monsieur Duval to social ties and reputation.The cinematography is superb. Almost each scene has a soul which makes watching the movie a real admiration of beauty. The most memorable decorations are in the scene in a candlelit boudoir filled with delicate lighting and shadows. Marguerite is looking at her reflection in the mirror and suddenly notices Armand from behind. A delicate classic musical piece is being played in the background. UNFORGETTABLE! The film's gorgeous imagery is a very strong point for the movie. Perhaps you will wonder why I praise this movie so much. But if you asked me if I can ever forget CAMILLE my answer would be never because the imagery of this movie and the effect it has on a viewer is endless. How is it possible to forget a beautiful scene of Marguerite's first meeting with Armand? Is it also possible to skip a lovely idyllic pastoral sequence with sheep and flowering trees? How to forget a touching moment when Gaston Marguerite's true friend is putting a beautiful bunch of camellias at her side while she is lying ill in bed? Finally the touching final shot and Marguerite's beautiful words that I entailed at the beginning of my review. These words which purely refer to spiritual love are the last words that Marguerite says. Yes CAMILLE is a masterpiece one of the very few movies that promotes real beauty. It is not only a tearjerker. It is not only a story of love. It is a movie that teaches high respect for precious values in life. 1010!".

	onyx:emotionText "Perhaps it ill be better if I live in your heart where the world can't see me. If I'm dead there will be no staying of our love. The novelplay by Alexandre Dumas Fils LA DAME AUX CAMELIAS has attracted a lot of artists. Verdi wrote his opera LA TRAVIATA basing its content on this play. The film industry have also made a lot of adaptations of the play from the period of silent era up till modern times. However if one hears a movie title CAMILLE what usually comes to one's mind is the film by George Cukor with Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor. Why? There is something magical about this version that made it stand a test of time something that helped it be appreciated for almost seven decades. Is it performances cinematography or Garbo's presence that make it so enchanting to watch? The answer is not so easy because the movie is a masterpiece of beauty at multiple levels.The performances are absolutely outstanding. It is difficult to say if Garbo gives her best performance in CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL. I think that it is more a matter of personal preferences. One thing is sure  she does something more than acting. She totally feels the role every movement every gesture is extremely natural as if you were watching reality not a movie. As a result Garbo achieves something really outstanding in CAMILLE some kind of the ultimate masterpiece of performance. Robert Taylor very well fits to the role of Armand Duvall. He manages to stress the most important feature of his role  delicacy and sincerity. Henry Daniell is a perfect choice for Baron De Varville  cruel unemotional cynical and very selfish. I shall never forget the scene when Marguerite plays a lyrical piece on the piano expecting Armand's visit. However it is Baron who comes unexpectedly. While Armand is trying to get to the house Baron plays the piano and Marguerite has to behave as if she wasn't expecting anyone. The scene ends with hysterical laughter of them both and a magnificent acting. Laura Hope Crews also gives a lovely performance as Prudence Duvernoy stressing her frivolity and extravagance. Consider her performance at the party at the mansion. Yet Lionel Barrymore though not given much time on screen is memorable particularly in the scene of his meeting with Marguerite. What a lovely presentation of two different world views! Not a better or a worse view but DIFFERENT views  Marguerite attached to love and emotions and Monsieur Duval to social ties and reputation.The cinematography is superb. Almost each scene has a soul which makes watching the movie a real admiration of beauty. The most memorable decorations are in the scene in a candlelit boudoir filled with delicate lighting and shadows. Marguerite is looking at her reflection in the mirror and suddenly notices Armand from behind. A delicate classic musical piece is being played in the background. UNFORGETTABLE! The film's gorgeous imagery is a very strong point for the movie. Perhaps you will wonder why I praise this movie so much. But if you asked me if I can ever forget CAMILLE my answer would be never because the imagery of this movie and the effect it has on a viewer is endless. How is it possible to forget a beautiful scene of Marguerite's first meeting with Armand? Is it also possible to skip a lovely idyllic pastoral sequence with sheep and flowering trees? How to forget a touching moment when Gaston Marguerite's true friend is putting a beautiful bunch of camellias at her side while she is lying ill in bed? Finally the touching final shot and Marguerite's beautiful words that I entailed at the beginning of my review. These words which purely refer to spiritual love are the last words that Marguerite says. Yes CAMILLE is a masterpiece one of the very few movies that promotes real beauty. It is not only a tearjerker. It is not only a story of love. It is a movie that teaches high respect for precious values in life. 1010!";

Greta Garbo was the star of the ageany agestill beautiful and absolutely created to act in films. Even in silent films her acting is measured and understated. She never falls prey to exaggeration nor pretense. I think that is the secret to her effectiveness. Allow me an example after accepting money from Baron de Varville for a disguised outing with her lover Armand which the Baron already suspects she kisses him gently on the cheek only to be reviled with a harsh slap from the baron who then departs. The camera moves in on that incomparable face. The head slowly lowers the lips slightly part a low moan expresses the guilt shame and humiliation which momentarily consume her. Then she spies the money clutched tightly in her hand. Recognizing she now has the means to escape with her lover a slight smile emerges reflecting her change of mood and restored joy. It is a scene like no other.As for her costar Robert Taylor was castigated as being too callow for the role. In fact most critics today realize he was exactly what Dumas intended young impressionableand certainly irresistibly gorgeous in his dewy youth. That beauty often caused the young Taylor undeserved venom from the critics. He was a very capable actor and probably set the standard for the contemporary romantic leading man we see even today. Rumors that Garbo dismissed him as unimportant are not true. She liked him very much and was greatly impressed after he sent her mother flowers when they all attended the premiere of CAMILLE in Stockholm.CAMILLE? A great movie with a great cast including the marvelous Henry Daniell whose Baron de Varville is very Jekyll and Hyde. I encourage anyone to see it. It is one of the finest films of the 20th Century.".

Great story and flawless production here boasting perhaps the most shimmering of Greta Garbo's ethereal performances as Marguerita Gautier Camille. Familiar and much filmed story this is nevertheless the best of them all. Matching Garbor is the hopelessly romantic Robert Taylor in his best 30s role. Also good are Lionel Barrymore Henry Daniell and Jessie Ralph as the maid. Great comic relief is provided by Laura Hope Crews Prudenceand Lenore Ulric Olympewhat a pair of vultures! But the center of this gorgeous film is Garbo. She is so frail looking her voice so soft. Garbo plays Marguerite as a frailty incarnate. She never overacts the part as most do with the endless coughing and fainting. One of George Cukor's triumphs. Rex O'Malley and Elizabeth Allan are dull but have small parts. I also spotted Eily Malyon and Zeffie Tilbury and Joan Leslie is listed in the credits. I think this is Garbo's best performance but she lost the Oscar to Luise Rainer for The Good Earth. Also nominated that year Irene Dunne The Awful Truth Barbara Stanwyck Stella Dallas and Janet Gaynor A Star Is Born. Wowhow could you choose just one?".

Marguerite meant to get the attentions of the imperious Baron DeVarville but got Armand's instead. With the revival of tuberculosis as a byproduct of the AIDS virus today's audiences have some idea of the death sentence that Marguerite was under. She's chosen to live for the present without care or worry for tomorrow and tomorrow's bills. Impetuous young Armand thinks he has found the love of his life and so does Marguerite but she realizes at a certain level always that it is too late.The characters as realized by Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor will stay indelibly with you long after viewing Camille. Garbo said the role was a favorite of her's. Her performance in her voice her body and face capture the zest for all the immediate living she has to do.Robert Taylor was quoted as saying that he bettered himself as an actor by just being around Garbo that one couldn't help doing that. As Armand he made such an impression in his period clothes and his romantic lines that he became probably the number one movie heart throb in the nation. George Cukor directed this and said of Taylor that usually the role of Armand is played by middleaged men who look ridiculous saying those same lines. Taylor represented callow romantic youth of the 19th century and the dialog rings true when he says it. Cukor and Taylor worked again together but future teamings were less classical than this.Camille also helped launch the career of British actor Henry Daniell in films as one imperious and snarling villain. The man with the built in disdain in his voice Henry Daniell essayed so many roles as a bad guy his mere appearance on the screen told you who was the villain. DeVarville cold haughty and imperious was THE Daniell part and set a high standard for Daniell that he met many times in his career.Two other players in this you will enjoy Jessie Ralph as Marguerite's maid Nanine and Laura Hope Crews as the world's oldest courtesan. Crews is best remembered as Aunt Pity Pat Hamilton in Gone With the Wind and in Camille it's as if Aunt Pity Pat decided to open a bordello a chic one for the upper classes to be sure.".

You feel for both the male lead Robert Taylor who is quite good and the female Grate Garbo of course who is excellent. That's the whole point. These are two people who are not quite appropriate because they come from different social levels but there is a sense they could make it work if they wanted to.But outside forces get in the way. Chief among them is the man's father who wants to save his son from a marriage that will ruin both husband and wife. This is a key role in the film and a critical if brief 10 minutes or so. The father is played importantly by Lionel Barrymore who does little else int he movie. But here he makes his case to the Garbo with amazing force. It's a great scene even if you wish Garbo would leap up and say no no I'm going to follow my heart.But exactly what happens is what the movie is about. The rules of the culture of the time 1800s France prevent an honest sense of two people marrying out of simple love for one another. In a way that's the whole point of continuing the old Dumas story which has resonated for decades into the Hollywood era. I'm not sure it would work now except as an historical drama. This is set in the period around 1850 and feels legit. Unlike the curious and not bad 1921 silent version which sets it in a 1920s culture this one transports us back to the original. Fair enough! There is a contrived quality to the plot for sure partly because of its origins. While this doesn't ruin the whole enterprise there is a slight feeling of being led along the whole time. Garbo and Taylor are both terrific however and we feel some honesty to their feelings for one another. It's on that basis that the movie works. And it really does even through the over the top drama in the last scene. Moving and beautiful overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great literary romances of the late nineteenth century despite perhaps being presumed today to be models of propriety and principle were more often than not frank tales of adulteresses and prostitutes. When many of these great works were adapted for the screen in the 1930s the most natural choice for a leading lady was often Greta Garbo than whom there was none finer at portraying such fallen women as noble and tragic heroines.Garbo was one of the cinema's great natural performers and in her day was probably the most genuine person to have graced the screen. She brought something to these roles not only because she was dangerously beautiful but also because she was irresistibly human. Even when her character lied to her lover she could make us sympathise with her motives as well as understand why the lead man was so enamoured of her to be taken in. In Camille she brilliantly captures the conflict between Marguerite's strength of character and her physical frailty. Her occasional coughs and lapses into weariness are so neatly understated but in a way that makes us accept that she is fighting against them rather than that they are insignificant.Whether Garbo's professionalism rubbed off on others or whether it was the intensely personal direction of George Cukor Camille also features some superb performances from what could have been a disappointing supporting cast. Lead man Robert Taylor who once described acting as the easiest job in the world was generally little more than a handsome but wooden matine idol and yet here the youngster pulls off his part like a pro. True for the first hour of the picture he is simply a handsome grinning mug but when his character is required to display some emotional depth he steps up to the task. Henry Daniell and Lionel Barrymore were both shameless hams but here they are at their most restrained without losing any of their trademark qualities. When you compare Daniell in Camille to his other performances it's like seeing the real person that a caricature is based on.While the sincerity of the cast certainly helps to give Camille its emotional intensity it is the direction of Cukor which gives it its pace and watchability. Cukor's cinema is all about movement and he has a hundred tricks up his sleeve each using motion to draw our attention or set tone. Take Garbo's big scene with Barrymore. The two of them are essentially just wheeling around a small room but Cukor keeps his camera up fairly close emphasising their almost constant changes in position. This gives an unsettling desperate quality to the scene even giving the impression that Barrymore is chasing Garbo. At other times such rapid change would be distracting especially if the scene contains a lot of important information but Cukor still uses subtle shifts in perception to keep the narrative feeling fresh and meaningful. For example in the lengthy episode at the opera where we meet the principle characters for the first time Cukor uses the fuzzy glow of the stage as a backdrop for the first meeting between Garbo and Taylor and the blandness of the box for the equivalent encounter with Daniell.Both the acting and the direction here are purely cinematic the former glamorous yet honest the latter unobtrusively guiding the audience with the moving image. And yet it takes away none of the integrity of Alexander Dumas fils' novel. And so this final nod is to the hidden hand behind the screen  producer Irving Thalberg. Thalberg's aim was never simply to make a fast buck he wanted to leave high quality product behind him. It seems that pictures like Camille are what he always aspired to  ones that harnessed all the faculties of the medium yet were as prestigious and culturally significant as any classic play or novel. This was among his last productions and he died before it was released but it is undoubtedly a worthy asset to his legacy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Classic romantic drama with the one and only Garbo. She is the tragic Parisian courtesan Margeurite Gaultier slowly dying of consumption yet briefly enlivened by a doomed love affair with Armand Duval Robert Taylor. It all ends in tragedy as Garbo sacrifices her happiness and ultimately her life by spurning Taylor with a lie that she has lost interest in him. Cue one of the greatest deathbed scenes in film history as Garbo dies in a weeping Taylor's arms.I really enjoyed this film. Having read Dumas' novel a few years ago I cried bucketloads I was very impressed with this adaptation. Garbo and Taylor are both perfectly cast. Garbo is at once girlish and worldly sickly yet so alive giddily joyful and tragic. It is a marvellous performance and shows just why the actress is so transcendent. Taylor is also very good not wooden at all as the very handsome naive idealistic and so young Armand. Henry Daniell plays the villainous Baron who wants Garbo for himself. He is very effective in the role yet I've always found Daniell to have a rather sexless quality so its hard to imagine him physically wanting any woman. Laura Hope Crews and Lionel Barrymore are also in supporting roles. The film has some wonderfully romantic dialogue and scenes. The rollicking coarse lifestyle of Margeurite's friends is nicely juxtaposed with the bucolic countryside scenes in which Taylor and Garbo snatch a tiny piece of happiness. Very romantic and very satisfying for the most part even if is a bit slow paced at times.".

	schema:reviewBody "A gorgeously produced romance in the best sense of the term Camille is a prime example of the type of film that causes viewers to lament that they just do not make them like this anymore. Of course how could a film like this be made again? The incomparable Garbo is gone as are director George Cukor producer Irving Thalberg studiomogul Louis B. Mayer the Metro Goldwyn Mayer sound stages and back lot and even the Hollywood studio system.Fortunately the fruits of the old studio system live on and those who love the movies can still relish such gems as Camille. With George Cukor guiding her performance and William Daniels lighting her face Greta Garbo never looked better or had a finer role than Marguerite Gautier. The word luminous is often over used but it is appropriate here to describe how Garbo literally illuminates the screen with her presence throughout the film. From her flirtatious scenes early in the film to her final days where her skin seems to have taken on the translucence of death she dominates the movie.With few exceptions Garbo has little competition on screen. Henry Daniell is outstanding as the Baron de Varville whose villainy is obscured by a gentlemanly veneer and great wealth. Laura Hope Crews shamelessly tries to steal her scenes as the selfish Prudence and Jessie Ralph holds her own as the maid. However while he certainly looks the part Robert Taylor does not have the emotional depth to be a convincing love object for a woman of Garbo's dimensions. The cruel strength of Henry Daniell made him a more equal partner for Garbo than the lovesmitten Robert Taylor. The imbalance was repeated from Garbo's film of the previous year Anna Karenina in which again a strong if overbearing Basil Rathbone matched Garbo in a way that the indecisive Frederic March did not.Despite any small reservations Camille remains a fine example of the best of the Hollywood studio system in its Golden Era. The sumptuous art direction and lavish costumes indicate the high production values of the period for an Alist film for one of MGM's most valuable stars. Well adapted from a literary work by a team of writers that included James Hilton the movie is matchless entertainment. While Camille was likely produced as a woman's film Garbo and Cukor broadened the film's appeal and elevated their work to classic status.".

The extreme melodrama and overacting sat fine with early audiences but today it just seems awfully silly and campy. While Greta Garbo's performance is at times way overthetop my biggest problem actually was the character played by her very ardent suitor Robert Taylor. Despite very little apparent reason he is totally smitten with a woman who is essentially a highpriced prostitute and chases her repeatedly even though she gave every indication through the first half of the movie that she was a heartless skank. As a result Taylor just looked like a very pretty wimpnot the sort of man that anyone in the audience could respect. Only after being lied to and emotionally abused did he finally show some backbonebut by the end of the film this had once again vanished and he was back to being a wimp. I sure would have liked to have Jimmy Cagney handle this rolehe wouldn't have put up with it or chased after Garbo like a mooneyed puppy! Now back to Garbo. While I have always felt that her performances have aged poorly she was so often given scripts that were too formulaic and melodramatic I must admit that the times in the movie when she needed to cry she was incredible. This is especially true in the side shot of her as you see tears almost shooting from her eyesthat is great acting. But then to have her droop around for so much of the film with what appeared to be TB detracted from the overall effort. It just seemed a bit overdone.The same day I saw this film I also saw the silent 1921 version starring Nazimova and Rudolph Valentino. For 1921 this style of film was perfect but even by 1936 it must have caused a few groans among the patrons since the plot was definitely getting very old indeed. The only HUGE improvement in the 1936 film was the role played by Lionel Barrymore as Robert Taylor's dadit was much more sensitive and compelling than the character in the earlier film and did a lot to give the story life.The bottom line is that if you don't particularly care for old movies this movie will probably be very dull and tough viewing. If you love old films you might be able to look past its style and enjoy the pictureat times I could do this but frankly there are just so many better romances out there.".

It's an movie with constantly changing dramatic moods and tones in the movie which just becomes a bit too much for me after a while. I can handle and appreciate heavy dramas but when it's being overly melodramatic it becomes more of an annoyance to me also since it starts making more and more a staged impression.It's a fine looking movie with its sets and costumes and George Cukor of course is more than a capable director. So basically it's a very well made movie but it's story and the way it progressed made me not really like this movie.I guess it's a good story on its own right though also since there are a total of 47 movie versions based on the novel and play La dame aux camlias by Alexandre Dumas fils which is more than any other novel I have ever heard of. It might very well be true that this movie features Greta Garbo's finest performance. It was also her personal personal favorite one. She plays her role with both class and emotion and above all keeps her role real and humane. The best and most powerful and classic moments of the movie all feature her. Her acting still makes this movie worthwhile and an interestingly watchable one.Watch it for Garbo.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

So to try and even make an intelligent critique seems impossible and I will not even try.The film as a whole is a great update on the older 1921 version and far more watchable if you are not a fan of silent films. I am a bit surprised how few adaptations there appear to be given how long the play has existed. Unless they just go under other names to be confusing...There is some talk online about who is better Greta Garbo or Barbara Stanwyck. I am a Stanwyck fan but hey I am not going to say Garbo did a bad job here. She nailed it.".

	schema:headline " Transcendental performance by Greta Garbo";
	schema:reviewBody "Greta Garbo is Camille in the 1936 MGM film directed by George Cukor and also starring Robert Taylor Henry Daniell Lionel Barrymore Laura Hope Crews Jessie Ralph and Rex O'Malley. Based on the Alexandre Dumas fils novelplay LA DAME AUX CAMELIAS it is the often told story of the tubercular Marguerite Gautier a courtesan and the young man Armand Duval with whom she falls in love only to have to give him up so he can fulfill his promise and take a respectable place in society. Verdi based his very famous and constantly done opera La Traviata on the Dumas material. During the film themes from the opera can be heard throughout.Though the libretto of the opera sticks closely to the words spoken by Marguerite and Armand the opera's story is slightly different. One difference is that Armand Alfredo in the opera learns from his father the reason that Marguerite Violetta in the opera gave him up where in this version he doesn't seem to know about it the other is that in the opera Duval Sr. asks Violetta to sacrifice her life with Armand for the sake of Armand's sister who is about to be married.MGM pulled out all the stops for this film the production values are glorious. Adrian's costumes are absolutely magnificent and Garbo is a vision in them. This is Garbo's greatest performance. Though a neurotic shy and not a terribly exciting woman in real life for the book Garbo by Barry Paris I transcribed something like 100 hours of phone conversations she had with art gallery owner Sam Green she had an amazing vivid imagination and could transport herself in performance to create effective characters that are larger than life. Added to that ability is her unique beauty her slim figure and her beautiful speaking voice. She is a perfect Marguerite  vulnerable passionate full of humor generous joyous and melancholy. Marguerite's death scene is classic. Her face is never more beautiful or serene as in those last scenes and even after repeated viewings it tugs at the heart.Garbo is surrounded by an excellent cast including Henry Daniell as the Baron her cruel loverfinancial resource Laura Hope Crews as a loud silly old courtesan Jessie Ralph as Nanine Marguerite's loving caretaker and Rex O'Malley who does a beautiful job as Gaston a gentle and kind friend to both Marguerite and Armand. This role is very small in the opera. It's a much better part here and O'Malley makes a great impression.Lionel Barrymore's performance as Duval Sr. has been criticized as being melodramatic and it's true that he does refer to Marguerite as Margaret but in my opinion he comes off well and restrained in a role that unlike Gaston is actually smaller in the film than it is in the opera.Robert Taylor was 24 or 25 when he played Armand. Like most of the absurdly handsome men in films he was dismissed by critics as a pretty boy who had no acting ability. It isn't true. He handles some sappy lines very well because he says them sincerely and he portrays an innocent and romantic quality in the face of Marguerite's worldly ways. Two things trip him up neither of which is his fault  he's about two or three years away from true handsomeness which would have made him a little less callow in appearance secondly the makeup man really slipped with the pancake the powder and the eyebrow pencil. He's wearing entirely too much makeup which is a distraction and  I mean this is Robert Taylor we're talking about  totally unnecessary. The makeup should have been directed toward making him slightly less beautiful and more handsome. A bigger problem than both of those is that when he's in a scene with Garbo there is very little chemistry between them. As a performer Garbo often stood alone and wasn't what one would call an ensemble player and she rather overpowers him.A gorgeous movie one of the most romantic films of all time starring an enigmatic woman who was a goddess among the Hollywood goddesses. Once World War II hit the types of roles she excelled at would no longer be popular and she would find herself retired at the age of 36 to walk and wander the world no longer in films but never forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "This may truly be one of the most beautiful love stories ever produced for the screen. Greta Garbo was never more beautiful and Robert Taylor was never more magnificent as the tormented lover Armand Duval. Garbo never rose to more convincing heights as this her best role ever. His love for her has no shame even after she leaves him because his father played by Lionel Barrymore tells her she will eventually ruin him if he stays he can't forget her. Henry Danielle as the Baron is sinister and calculating as the jilted lover who she only returns to to make Armand believe her. When Armand confronts Marguerite in the gambling hall and she asks him to please leave before there is a confrontation between him and the Baron he clings to her falling in desperation to her feet begging her to leave with him because his love is pure and un selfish she again rejects him. He is furious and calls everyone in the room to watch him humiliate her throwing all his money in her face. I think this scene is probably the best performance Robert Taylor ever gave in his youth. He is quite striking! The choice of Robert Taylor for the role of Armand was a stroke of genius for Cukor. He exudes the innocence of the character where other actors of more experience would have been lost to the role. There is a sweetness to Armand that makes us believe he could love this woman. Garbos transition from kept woman to a woman in love is believable because of the lack of sophistication of Armands character. I can't think of any other love story that has the staying power of this one. Seventy years after it arrived at theaters it it still the best of all.".

The opera La Traviata also happened to be inspired by the story and I noticed a number of similarities between this film and the opera like the death scene and when Armand insults Margheritethrowing money in her face like in the opera.The cinematography and costumes were gorgeous and an example of French extravagance despite the fact that Camille was made in the 30s. The music especially in Margherite's death scene was so hauntingly touching. Through the music we felt the romance between Armand and Margherite. Also Margherite's death is the most heartrending death ever on screen whether in romance or a biographical drama.The performances were exceptional. Greta Garbo was the movie. The whole movie is worth watching just for her performance which was more than outstanding. This movie was referenced in the 1982 musical Annie which was where I got introduced to the movie. Robert Taylor I usually find a bit dull but I felt a great muchneeded restraint here in possibly his best performance. Everybody else was great as well particularly Lionel Barrymore as Monsieur Duval.In conclusion a beautiful and inspired film so worth watching for Garbo's performance and her character's death. Believe me it is a million times better than most of the rubbishy sentimental romantic dramas out now and that's a fact! 1010. Bethany Cox".

I did find myself marginally distracted by the froufrou costumes and hats on the modernlooking Garbo. Nonetheless it's a mark of her talent that she was able to transcend whatever silliness was strapped on her head and provoke genuine emotion.Garbo plays Marguerite Gautier Dumas's consumptive courtesan to perfection. It is Paris 1847 and Marguerite lives for the moment without care for what tomorrow may bring considering the inevitable death sentence she lives under. As she says When one may not have long to live why shouldn't one have fancies? She lives off of rich men like the Baron de Varville whose attentions she hopes to capture at the theater. Instead she entrances Armand Duval the callow youth whom she dismissively sends for candy before disappearing with the Baron.Nonetheless Duval meets her again three months later and returns to her the handkerchief she had dropped at the theater mentioning humorously he had already eaten the candy. Through his persistence Marguerite despite not believing in love and living the fast glittering life with a succession of men finds herself falling in love with the earnest impressionable Armand. Why can't they run away together be together always Armand asks. He'll take care of her. Marguerite knows that time will be short and uncomfortable at that on Armand's resources. But she lets herself be persuaded gives up the Baron and moves to the country to a house Armand has found for her. When he wants his modest inheritance in order to support her his father the incomparable Lionel Barrymore arrives at the country house in Armand's absence to persuade the dying Marguerite to give his son up for the sake of his future his reputation his family. She says to him Anything I do I do for him. She finally realizes what it means to truly love someone and the scene where she determines to make him hate her is utterly heartbreaking.Armand sees her later at a casino in the company of the Baron and contemptuously pelts her with money for all to see. Betrayed love hurts and Taylor portrays it well.Marguerite abandoned by the Baron becomes progressively more ill coughing in a ladylike fashion languishing amongst her worn silken pillows. Her friend Gaston fills her empty purse with money. Prudence Laura Hope Crews drops by hoping to borrow money from the clearly destitute and dying woman who generously offers whatever is in her purse. Prudence is happy to accept leaving her some francs and swirling out oblivious. Crews most famous for playing the twittery Aunt Pittypat in Gone With The Wind is in her element here her tremendous bosom swelling out of her gowns smoking cigars cackling attending the kind of soirees Aunt Pittypat would have the vapors over.Armand is finally alerted to how desperately ill Marguerite is. She is so happy at the prospect of seeing him she asks her maid to help her brush her hair put some rouge on get into a chair but there's no time for any of that. Armand and Margurite reunite and he holds her in his arms as she takes her dying breath. Perfection! Cukor certainly knew how to wring the emotions.I found Robert Taylor perfect in this role. He looks so young all of his features so round feminine almost whereas Garbo's features are so angular with the lean boyish body common today but not so much then. The physical contrast between them works in the film's favor as a visual representation of the differences in their characters.The supporting players here are also spot on including Lenore Ulric as the emptyheaded conniving Olympe and Henry Daniell as the mean Baron de Varville.Personally my favorite Garbo performance is Ninotchka or Queen Cristina but this one is not to be missed. The part could have been written for Garbo so perfectly did she portray doomed love. The Camille story is seen as somewhat hackneyed today but Garbo and Taylor make it fresh 70 years on.".

	schema:reviewBody "The novelbased Die Katze or The Cat is a German crime thriller from almost 30 years ago. It stars Gtz George and Gudrun Landgrebe who both received German Film Award nominations for their performances as well as Ralf Richter and Heinz Hoenig. Filmmaker Dominik Graf won a German Film Award for his direction. And having seen some of his other works such as the very underwhelming Die geliebten Schwestern I must say this one here does not change my opinion on Graf a bit. It is pretty ridiculous that he is among Germany's most appreciated movie makers at this point. This one here runs for over 110 minutes and tells us the story of a bank heist with two bank robbers inside the building and the man who coordinates the crime outside. In the meantime police are trying to solve the situation without any of the hostages dying while constantly searching for the mastermind outside the bank.The only convincing performance here is unsurprisingly George who is easily the finest from the cast in terms of range. The others only score through charisma if at all. The police and the actors who play them are really very uninteresting here and the action inside the bank also could have needed a lot more pep. It is never edgeofseat material and that is quite an achievement in the negative sense for a bank heist movie. You could definitely call this Dog Day Afternoon gone very bad. Apart from these factors the actions of Landgrebe's character hardly make any sense at all and it seems she was just written the most controversial as possible without having any relation to realism anymore. The embarrassing title of the film isn't helping either. All in all this was pretty much a disappointment and shows that after the really strong 1970s German films in the 1980s were far from their best. Don't watch.".
