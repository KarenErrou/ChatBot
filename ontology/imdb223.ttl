It starts as a charming offbeat account of an extraordinarily ordinary kindergardener in Hong Kong and his his obsessed but loving single mom animated with an eyepopping variety of techniques that convey perfectly the hallucinatory intensity of early childhood. We see Mrs Mc charging through her work day as the heroine of a video game and her cooking showwith every permutation of chicken bun and paper imaginablemust be seen. Soon though it takes shape as a memory picture and deepens and darkens without ever losing its cockeyed playfulness.The visual direction of Alice Mak McDull's creator is exceptional and so is the superb music borrowing heavily from Schubert Schumann and Mozart in a perfect balance of absurdity and tears. At the end the film moves seamlessly into live action bringing its meditations on the end of childhood the disappointments of life and the mysterious possibilities of joy to an openended close. I'm sure that I miss a lot of the humor since I don't know Chinese but the subtitles convey a surprising poetic feel that surely is even stronger in the original. Not for children but don't miss it if you have the chance.".

This movie has been called unfunny but to understand McDull it helps to be able to understand Cantonese and to have visited HK since most of the jokes and the visuals are all about HK anyway. Per se people who have never seen HK or don't speak Cantonese aren't going to find this funny because it's basically an inside joke about life in Hong Kong.All in all the movie's a cute affair nice visuals and they show some really good aspects of HK and some HK culture as well as actual places in the city like the Peak Tram and the MTR etc. The story's fine about a pig growing up and reflecting back on his childhood. It's great for the kids because it's creative enough and the comically foolish McDull will appeal. It's worth watching even if it drags on needlessly.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Thomas Mann but Mario und der Zauberer Mario and the magician is not only one of my personal favorites but possibly one of the best novellas Mann has written. Naturally I was very enthusiastic when I heard that not only was the novel adapted but that KlausMaria Brandauer one of my favorite actors would play the antagonist Cipolla. And I'm sorry to say that I ended up being rather disappointed.Not going to go into the story itself in too much detail changes are that you have already read the book when you're looking for this film and if you haven't I highly recommend you do so before viewing. In essence it's an allegory on fascism itself set in Italy during the early days of Mussolini. The character Cipolla stands as a symbol for fascism andor the various spearheads like Mussolini Hitler but also Stalin.The problem with the production is the director Brandauer himself. Filming his second film Brandauer obviously hasn't yet gotten a firm grip on directing on the media film andor has a hard time finding a transition between film and theatre which is where he as a director is obviously more at home. The film seems less like Mann's psychological realism and more like some magicalrealism that would have befitted an adaptation of a Franz Kafka story. Sadly it doesn't end there. As I mentioned I'm a huge admirer of Brandauer. His performances in films like Mephisto or Oberst Redl are virtually Oscarmaterial. Here Brandauer underplays this poignant figure completely. I would have expected him to overplay the role something along the lines of his role in Hanussen where he also plays a magicianofsorts being likewise set during Nazitimes but Brandauer actually managed to make Cipolla dull and rather boring. Another problem is Julian Sands. Sands is an accomplished actor in it's own rights but whatever prompted Brandauer to cast him as the liberal yet slightly naive German Professor Fuhrmann in the novella he takes the role of a moreorless passive storyteller defies all logical or artistic explanation.Another aspect that murks the picture as a whole the novella is more or less a short story and Mann masterly manages compress his message and beautiful descriptions into relatively limited space. The movie however is a bit more than two hours which eventually feel much longer. Comparing novella to film one cannot help some notice major artistic liberties which Brandauer took with the sourcematerial and again the reasons seem not entirely clear. For example and here come the spoilers in the novel it is Mario Pavel Greco who kisses and eventually shots Cipolla on stage and not Silvestra Calentina Chico who then accidentally shoots Mario instead of the dictatorfigure Cipolla. Once again Brandauer doesn't make clear why that is. There are other alterations and additional scenes which seem to have occurred only to stretch the story.In essence if only the film had been directed by a more capable director like Brandauers erstwhile partner Istvan Szabo or to mention potential German directors Werner Herzog or Volker Schlndorf. Had Brandauer concentrated on playing the character as the demonic demagogue of the novella stuck closer to the sourcematerial and had he reduced unnecessary scenes even if it would have been only a TVmovie there could have truly been some magic in Mario and the magician. As it is it's simply overambitious and considering the source no more than a 510. And please don't get my low rating wrong technically it isn't a bad picture visually as handsome as you'd expect with a budget of roughly 10 Million Euro but it ultimately fails to live up to Mann's story and what it would have deserved.".

The actors and actresses are superb in their roles as well as the direction of the film.

Zeta Gundam is the dark powerful emotional and completely enjoyable follow up to the original 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam TV series. Like it's predecessor the show orbits around conflict between space colonies and the earth that bore them the politics of war and the struggles of a young man growing up in hazardous times. Unlike it's predecessor it is a much darker more violent and serious show.Zeta is not the most innovative shows around but it is certainly one of the most powerful. Some of the scenes are heartbreaking others are uplifting but the 'good guys' certainly have a dark cloud hanging over them the whole time. The animation is very 80s not a bad thing but it is pretty dated. Still for it's time many of the mobile suit battles come across as exciting and dynamic more so than most of the new series and the characters are all distinct so there's no mixing them up because they all look so similar as in many other animes. The plot is topnotch and will keep you interestedbut not at the edge of your setthrough the entire series. The last six episodes are some of the best in Gundam as a whole.Recommended to pretty much everyone but especially Gundam fans Zeta Gundam may be the series finest installment.".

Camille's love interests although similar to Amuro's from the original are interesting characters and aspiring ace Jerid Mesa is thankfully not a copy of Char. A lot of the Titans are pretty despicable villains as well. The mecha designs are pretty nice incorporating a lot of wires into their design. The animation is pretty good considering this was made on a television budget in 1985 and much better than Gundam Wing which was made over decade later. Overall perhaps one of the best Gundam series.

Yesterdays heroes are today's oppressors as the once heroic Earth Federation has degenerated into a nearly fascist ruling party whose iron law is upheld by the Titans an elite taskforce created to quell any form of possible insurrection. Opposing them is A.E.U.G formed by a number of exZEON members including the legendary Char Aznable a secret group of freedom fighters slowly gaining support and power among the colonies. Enter the brash and hot headed Kamille Bidan who during the events of an A.E.U.G attempt to capture some experimental mobile suits lands up piloting the newly developed Gundam MK2. A series of tragedies occur which forces Kamille who already harbors a dislike for the Titans and the Federation and his friends to join up with the A.E.U.G as they make their way to earth.What struck me about this series was how the various players in the war were portrayed. Instead of going for a morally ambiguous stand and make each side seem good in their own way this show is quick to bring out the ugly face of each side ally or enemy it is either you root for the devil or the demon. Even the heroes do some morally questionable things over the course of the story but it all plays into some very well thought out character development.This series focuses more strongly on its main character of Kamille Bidanhis pointofview and how me meets the various different characters as the story advances. Kamille starts off as quite honestly a selfcentered brat with an identity crisis and a dysfunctional family relationship. But his development over the course of the series is heart warming and emotionally engaging as he matures and is given a crash course in growing up and being a responsible soldier. I would not spoil anything here but let us just say that the poor kid experiences quite a good number of deaths especially involving some people close to him. How the characters react to their situations are realistically logical in a style that one would expect from any real life person thrust into that situation and lead up well into their subsequent actions be it a subtle change of attitude or even defecting to the other side. From the inner turmoil of Kamille Bidan to the crazed obsession of Jared Messa. to Quattro Bajena's loss of faith in his leadership capabilities. All of them are equally compelling. The story moves along at an excellent pace with enough twists to keep you coming back for more. It may start off a little slow for the first few episodes mainly just to get all our main cast into place but manages to pick up after that. The episodes never seem to drag and the intrigue just keeps building especially after the introduction of the cyber newtypes and Axis Zeon.Created in 1985 Zeta Gundam's animation is actually quite good for its time. It can hold up to many anime series up to those in the late 1990s thanks to its detailed artwork. The director does use a number of stock footage and repeated scenes especially in battles but he does it in such a way that it is never really obvious the scenes are reused. Little things like using a stock footage in mirrorimage or recoloring the background of a stock footage or even playing with the speed of the animation all helps to mask the reused scenes and animation. A very shrewd bit of directing there that allows the animation to look great while saving on cost. In fact one can argue that the style of the art and animation here lends a very gritty look to the show that goes well with its darker storyline. Thanks to that the action in Zeta Gundam is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Some psychobabble about newtypes and psychic powers near the latest parts of the series may tend to seem far removed from the otherwise realistic feel of Gundam but that is my only gripe here.Personally I enjoyed MOBILE SUIT ZETA GUNDAM very much. With animation beyond its time a dark but highly engaging story and an emotionally identifiable cast with strong characterization it is no wonder many long time Gundam fans regard MOBILE SUIT ZETA GUNDAM as the best Gundam series ever. Totally Beats the crud out of any other modern Gundam series.".

The main complaint is that after such brilliant characterisation of MSG 0079 there is hardly any changes in characters through the series the characters start the series in full view with the exception of Camille and Fa who are the few that actually change in the series. Secondly not everyone will like the animation but anyone whose grown up around the likes of Modern anime and not used to 80's animation it may seem a little out of date.OK the good stuff. The story unlike MSG 0079 the story clearly divides the opposing sides as to who is the good and bad guys. The story then adds some more twists with the introduction of Axis midway into the series. The action scenes are well done and look fantastic even for its age. The music goes really well and makes a change from the JPop that is included in modern Animes. Tomino's stroke of genius however was to include fan favourite Char aka Quattro Baggina as one of the lead good guys although a failure to build of Chars budding Newtype potential from MSG did annoy me.At the end of the day when all the smoke has cleared and all the dust has settled you will love this series it is a masterclass in how Aime's should be made. You will love it for its blatant idea that it doesn't matter if your a minor or a main character if you are in the series your fair game.Gundam as it should be.".

The ride hasn't always been smooth either for Tomino the director or for those of us disappointed at the few flops in amongst this metaseries made up almost entirely of mediocre good and sometimes masterpiece titles. Zeta Gundam is one of these masterpieces.Anybody who's seen the original Gundam won't find it hard to point out why Zeta is even better and by a fair bit too while Mobile Suit Gundam happened mainly on Earth Zeta happens mainly in space which works far better on an artistic level due to the very mechanics of the whole setting and medium even now animation can't quite make Earth look on TV the way it looks in reality but space is for the most part blackness with a few white dots here and there and the occasional planet asteroid black hole satellite space colony and whatever else so it's much easier to make it look convincing and suspension of disbelief is a lot easier for the viewer to pull off when there isn't much disbelief to suspend this goes without saying. Another factor is it does begin as your usual 1 v 1 conflict but then another party enters although if they wanted to bloody both sides they should have entered the war when it began and if they wanted the best conditions for invading Earth they should have waited until the war had ended and then they would not only have surprise but would be unbloodied and that makes things far more interesting. One gripe I have about the original Gundam is that the tension is nearly all false of course a Newtype with a Gundam is going to defeat even an experienced ace but when there's 2 enemies with psychic powers to fight while your side is being hit by 2 enemy forces at the same time now that is tension at its very best. Another reason and this is more subjective is the fact that purple is my favourite colour and the greater use of purple or similar colours is a feast for the eyes. The music is even better whether it be one of the best and most archetypal military songs ever Zeta's Pulse or the soothing English opening or 2nd Japanese opening you will hear some excellent songs. Finally as usual the Japanese dub is fine but the English dub is excellent with the dark nature of this series where a teenage boy literally loses his mind and most of the main cast are killed in the final few episodes plus a defection reflected in the cold qualities of Haman's and Kamille's voices cold but also nice like the winter's air at daybreak.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is probably one of the best anime series ever made and one of the best sequels up there with the likes of The Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight. Everything about this series is great from its darker and more personal story to its characters that we can connect to and grow to like even if we may not like them at first.The story takes place nearly a decade after the events of the original Gundam series. The Earth Federation has grown corrupt and in a twisted irony yesterdays heroes are now today's villains and yesterday's villains are now today's heroes fighting for freedom and independence. Enter teenage prodigy Kamille Bidan who like Amuro is thrust into war ends up growing up the hard way and fights the Titans for the AEUG under the wing of former Zeon pilot Char Aznable himself now going under a different name. Other characters from the original series also show up in either minor or important roles. The story is very well written with much more moral ambiguity especially from the Titian's who are even worse than Zeon taking many twists and turns and leading to its infamous epic conclusion. The character development is very remarkable and subtle making you feel an emotional connection with characters on either side like in real guerrilla warfare despite the fact that the show is animated.The animation for its time still looks great as the animation and art is much less clunky than the original gundam and has more depth especially with the robots but might still look dated to the modern anime viewer. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes anime Gundam or giant robots in general.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is probably one of the best anime series ever made and one of the best sequels up there with the likes of The Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight. Everything about this series is great from its darker and more personal story to its characters that we can connect to and grow to like even if we may not like them at first.The story takes place nearly a decade after the events of the original Gundam series. The Earth Federation has grown corrupt and in a twisted irony yesterdays heroes are now today's villains and yesterday's villains are now today's heroes fighting for freedom and independence. Enter teenage prodigy Kamille Bidan who like Amuro is thrust into war ends up growing up the hard way and fights the Titans for the AEUG under the wing of former Zeon pilot Char Aznable himself now going under a different name.

With the help of a young man Harper he is forced to barricade himself in her apartment. In fact everyone in the apartment complex that overlooks a courtyard is trapped they're only able to communicate with each other by shouting across the courtyard. How the outbreak of zombification started is not known. A special report that conveniently begins as soon as Harper turns on a TV set highlights terrorism as one of the public and news media speculations a German September 11th. To this the authorities respond with ridiculous. So the people in the movie don't really know and neither do we the viewer. But who cares? This is typical of many zombie movies. The important thing is that this is one of the better made ones.The zombies in this movie are aggressive ravenous and know how to hustle for a bite and taste of human flesh. I think it's beginning to dawn on horror movie producers that one could still have some kind of life with the slow zombies since the only way they could catch a healthy man woman or child is by surprise. With these new strain of zombies you're pretty much shut down in your house and really horrified. I mean no work no school no social life. Anyway some of the challenges these trapped people face is to find a way to close the gate to the courtyard below and to navigate the apartment complex to get away from zombies and bring assistance to each other. We all love situations in movies where people are trapped or confined in some place and have to use their courage and ingenuity to survive if they're done well. And it's done well here very entertaining. Don't miss! Love Boloxxxi.".

It only shows on the amount of actors and on the way the script was written. There are a few CGI shots but it's only the apocalypse of Berlin and it worked out fine. The zombies itself are okay in the way they act and are created. But overall it's more a love story than a real zombie flick. Nevertheless the zombies do appear at regular base just when you think that it's going to be boring. There is a bit of red stuff and only in the beginning there is a bite in the neck where it's a little bit gory. Further on the gore is left out. Still by clocking in at 61 minutes it's surely on to have in your zombie collection. A really nice effort by the director and his crew.".

There short and to the point the movie just unfurls after that just sit back and watch the show...Actually the movie Rammbock was rather good. Of course you have to look past it being in German and all. I am saying that because I personally don't think German is a nice sounding language. But the language didn't really prove much of a nuisance to the movie.The story told in Rammbock was appealing and good. It was straight forward and moved on at a brisk pace right from the very beginning. And Marvin Kren the director actually managed to put together a fairly decent zombie movie here and proving it can be done with limited funds as well. And the fact that the movie basically just takes place in a small apartment complex adds some sense of claustrophobia to the movie. And it worked well.The lead actor Michael Fuith playing Michael actually was quite good in this role. I can't say that I have seen any of his work before or that I had even heard of him before this movie. Guess it is fairly obvious that German movies is not that I watch the most of.One thing that I didn't like about the movie was the agile zombies that were running around. I am more of a Romerotype zombie fan wanting zombies to be slow moving and rigid in their movements after all something called Rigor Mortis will set in once you die so you shouldn't be all flexible and able to run around. But for those who like movies such as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later you will definitely like the zombies in this movie. Both 28 Days and 28 Weeks later are awesome movies by the way. Also the ending was a bit too sassy. You saw it coming a mile away and it was quite cheesy. But hey in overall the movie was compelling and thrilling. So this ending can be ignored for the greater picture.For a nonHollywood movie Rammbock actually is a good notch on the zombie genre. If it definitely worth checking out for zombie fans regardless of you liking Romerozombies or the agile zombies. And while you are at it check out the French zombie movie The Horde La Horde it is worth the time as well.".

However I am usually skeptical about zombie movies that come out because they are often terrible due to things like bad makeup poor cinematography terrible script etc. I decided to rent this movie on i Tunes and give it a shot. I am so glad I did. It is only about an hour in length but it proves to be the perfect amount of time to fit everything it needs in. Sometimes filmmakers feel they need to make a movie long to fit in things that prove to be unnecessary in the end. Berlin Undead gives you everything you need in its short time frame and it is more than enough. I would absolutely say that this movie has made its way in among Night of the Living Dead Dawn of the Dead and 28 Weeks Later my favorite zombie films. I'm not going to give plot points away simply because I feel saying anything would spoil the film due to the length. All I need to say is this movie is worth seeing.".

It has all the known ingredients of a good zombie movie that which includes being locked up in a place that has been invaded repeatedly by flocks of zombies having to think of ways to escape with other strangers who just happen to have their own opinions or motives of things the authorities having no presence at all including the army other than short broadcast times either on the TV or the radio where residents have been advised to join the escaping ships out of the main cities and finally a nice faulty leading character who only came to Berlin to reconcile with his ex girlfriend only to find that she has already moved on with one of her new neighbor's son. The movie has a very simple plot with great directing yet its main shortcoming may arise from not adding anything different or new to its storyline as if they have developed a very safe Zombie formula without wanting to risk it with a bit of surprising elements which would have improved the overall plot rather than having everything just pretty much expected and predicted correctly until the end.I personally liked this movie because it overlooked the gore elements which are usually used generally in zombie movies as an easy way to shock and scare without having much care of the development of the characters. Again this movie is definitely a good effort and is worth watching for those who who would enjoy a simple neat yet mildly developed story zombie movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "What I always appreciate in any film but especially one in the zombie genre because it is so rare are believable characters. Characters whose actions are logical even in bizarre situations. And I always appreciate a writer's ability to develop a dramatic plot without relying on characters' moronic decisions to stir trouble. This is seen too rarely in this genre.For anyone wondering whether this is their kind of zombie film I'll try to knock up a short summary with no spoilers.  The plot of Rammbock takes you to the very start of the zombie virus outbreak it begins while the world is still normal. When it happens it happens very suddenly. What follows is of course shock and confusion and the horror of not knowing what is going on then the subsequent eeriness of witnessing the society dissipate through loss of public communication channels following which the characters must come to terms with the weight of the situation and shift their usual priorities and inhibitions to bare survival.You are taken through this process with the protagonists witnessing the first few days of the outbreak and the fragile survival of people trapped in a residential building in the middle of Berlin surrounded by hordes of the violent infected. Although the director decided not to reveal much about anyone's background and past this doesn't stop you from empathising and gradually growing fond of them. At no point are any uninfected characters polarised or dehumanised even the nameless ones.This is the type of zombie film with no overthetop violence and very little gore the accent is on eeriness and tension rather than action and special effects.I would say that as far as the zombie apocalypse topic goes this is one of the more realistic portrayals of how it would look for someone in Europe.If you liked 28 Days Later or Rec you will almost certainly like this one. If you're more of a Resident Evil type of person maybe skip it.".

We basically follow a guy who comes to Berlin to visit his exgirlfriend but runs into a zombie apocalypse and a new friend until he finally finds her. This film only runs for slightly over an hour and this already includes 5 minutes of credits. The two lead actors are known even only to the biggest fans of German cinema from Das weie Band and the previously mentioned Blutgletscher or Michael. And of course Kren's mother is on board again as well. No idea why she gets cast all the time in his films even for some of the biggest characters of the movie as she is certainly not a great actress.This little film here is not only about supernatural events but also has some family drama moments with the background of the reason why the main character comes to Berlin in the first place. It is a bit about love about friendship but none of the areas has been displayed and elaborated on convincingly in my opinion. This is why I thought it was a disappointing watch for the most part. Not recommended and the only really good thing about the film is that it is over pretty quickly. Thumbs down.".

Unfortunately I also found that the dialogue and interactions between characters didn't flow well or sometimes weren't very believable. Overall If you enjoy zombie movies then I'd say you should give it a watch.";

The ending is clearly inspired by Cronenberg's Rabid though in a slightly different way. This isn't a bad little zombie flick. It's relatively short at approximately an hour. And it did seemingly go on to inspire a spin off television series. So there's that. But it was still pretty simple overall...and left me a bit unfulfilled.Nice effort though. 4.5 out of 10.".

The acting was decent and the storyline was about as realistic as any movie of this type could be. I also liked the fact that it introduced two new ideas which I thought have merit and are worth mentioning. First the use of bright flashes of light which cause the zombies to temporarily retreat was quite interesting. Likewise the use of sedatives to slow down the virus in an infected person was also very original. In summation for such a lowbudget film this was surprisingly good. Again though I believe it would have been better if it were 20 to 30 minutes longer. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.".

The details are meticulous the casting firstrate except for a hokey voiceimpersonation of Churchill and the battle sequences marked by accuracy and fine special effects.This otherwise fine film is marred however by the false depiction of one of the major characters Admiral Lutjens commander of the Bismarck.  In the film he is stereotyped as the typical Nazi  a Hitler sycophant careerist and wildeyed fanatic.  This was most certainly not the historical Lutjens who was by no means a Nazi fanatic.  Lutjens was a naval hero from World War I who served out of duty and dedication not Nazi conviction. Lutjens protected Jews under his command and members of his family were in trouble for their antiNazi views.  This is at complete odds with his depiction in Sink the Bismarck which I find inexcusable given that the above information was certainly available to the production.  In fact an accurate depiction of Lutjens would have in my opinion added interest to the plot.Nevertheless Sink the Bismarck is eminently watchable and a fine addition to any war movie collection if you bear in mind the above caveat.".

The details are meticulous the casting firstrate except for a hokey voiceimpersonation of Churchill and the battle sequences marked by accuracy and fine special effects.This otherwise fine film is marred however by the false depiction of one of the major characters Admiral Lutjens commander of the Bismarck.  In the film he is stereotyped as the typical Nazi  a Hitler sycophant careerist and wildeyed fanatic.  This was most certainly not the historical Lutjens who was by no means a Nazi fanatic.  Lutjens was a naval hero from World War I who served out of duty and dedication not Nazi conviction. Lutjens protected Jews under his command and members of his family were in trouble for their antiNazi views.  This is at complete odds with his depiction in Sink the Bismarck which I find inexcusable given that the above information was certainly available to the production.  In fact an accurate depiction of Lutjens would have in my opinion added interest to the plot.Nevertheless Sink the Bismarck is eminently watchable and a fine addition to any war movie collection if you bear in mind the above caveat.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a well crafted and gripping depiction of British attempts to locate and destroy the German battleship Bismarck during World War II. It is told from the viewpoint of sailors aboard vessels from both sides and also the British naval command headquarters. I have little knowledge of naval history so am in no position to comment regarding historical accuracy.Personally I found most compelling the strategy and tension within the Admiralty War Headquarters in London especially the personal depiction of the coordinator of this operation. Kenneth More convincingly plays Captain Jonathan Shepard who lost his own wife earlier in an air raid and has a son who is himself a naval pilot involved in the battle to sink the Bismarck. Shepard's relationship with the lovely but very professional female naval officer Davis is well captured. There is also a moving portrait of Shepard's restrained response to unfolding news regarding his son. Though there is engaging battle drama at sea it's the character portrayal of this stiff upper lip British officer that made the movie for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "For starters this picture was thankfully filmed in black and white.  This is only appropriate for gray colored ships shooting it out in the North Atlantic.  The performers were for the most part convincing.  The movie got a little risky by using a fictional character played by Kenneth More for the lead role and delving a bit into his personal life.  But it didn't get out of hand.  The movie takes just the right amount of time in developing and depicting the important events in the eight day life of the Bismarck.  I got the feeling that I was actually there and watching these events take place.  The movie is essentially accurate based on accounts I have read in books including one by the highest ranking German survivor. The depiction of the destruction of the British battle cruiser Hood was not exactly accurate but I would rank that a minor point.  Getting the ship used in the movie to blow up the same way the Hood would probably have been more trouble than it was worth.  The bottom line is the ship was destroyed and only three crew members survived.This movie is an excellent nononsense portrayal of the short and dramatic life of the legendary German battleship Bismarck.".

	schema:headline " A Fine Story Well Told with few innacuracies";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people criticise this film for the wooden acting but this ignores a vital point. In the period the film is set people were a lot more formal especially in the Royal Navy. Such negative comments are on a par with claims that Shakespearean language is too floral or that George Washington wore a powdered wig. Honestly I cannot accept any such comments. Anyone who's seen the God Awful TV movie The Junction Boys will see much more woodeness.Charting the maiden voyage of the Nazi battleship's Bizmark  her brief career in the Atlantic this film lacks modern details now known about this episode due to the efforts of divers namely information gained from the wreck of the Bizmark itself  investigations of HMS Hood's remains famously blown into pieces by a hit from Bizmark.Also not dealt with is some of the rather more subtle facts of this period. Bizmark is touted as the deadliest warship afloat but this isn't borne out by the facts. The Bizmark chose it's battles very well avoiding conflict with Royal Navy warships that could do it actual damage. She was a commerce raider praying on defenceless merchant ships less powerful warships  fleeing from anything that could do her harm. The fact that she came up against warships that could actually do damage to her was down to the doggedness of the Royal Navy.At first she did prevail but once more due to the opposition she was given. HMS Hood was definitely NOT a good choice for this conflict she was NOT a Battleship she was an old thinly armoured Battle Cruiser  well below the standard of Bizmark her guns were innacurate  her armour wasn't up to the threat she was faced with. The accompanying battleship Prince of Wales was a brand new warship with terrific specifications but was so new she also had teething poblems her firing control wasn't fully calibrated  some of her guns had problems that prevented them from firing  even went into battle against the Bizmark with civilian ship builders on board who were still working on her! Hardly surprising then that Bizmark sank Hood  damaged Prince Of Wales badly. None the less between the two of them they hit Bizmark three times knocking out one of her boilers puncturing her armour so she took on water  leaked fuel a critical turning point in the eventual outcome.When Bizmark was later damaged by aircraft robbing her of her rudders she was unable to run away  finally forced to come up against KG5 HMS King George The Fifth  her support fleet then the truth was revealed. Bizmark was good but against the older less well specified KG5 she lost heavily with enormous loss of life. Bizmark was good but in a fight with comparable forces she was nothing special yes she was outnumbered but by very much older ships.The confususion of this time is clearly shown as Bizmark circled uncontrolably following the air strike so meaning that sightings sent to RN HQ mean that at one point she was thought to be heading away from the battle fleet then towards it.We do see some emotional manipuilation going on an effort to either sustain the narative or arouse hatred in the audience for the enemy so that we are not horrified by the carnage that will soon be unleashed upon them. Royal Navy ships are shown getting sunk that actually didn't even get hit. Also Ark Royal Swordfish aircraft are shown getting shot down when actually all returned intact a fascinating fact the ancient obsolete Swordfish from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal were all the Fleet Air Arm had. The Germans at the time laughed at the cumbersome biplane torpedo bombers but they couldn't hit them! Their anti aircraft guns had predicters on them to track incoming aircraft  hit them but the Swordfish flew so slowly the predicters couldn't compensate  all the shells missed!.Technical details apart the naval action is where the movie excels. For the last time British movie makers were allowed access to a Royal Navy Battleship probably HMS Vanguard the last RN Big Gun warship. Notice how the scenes in the Bizmark  KG5 gun turrets are identical! Well they weren't going to get this footage from the German Kriegsmarine! However notice that the sailors are shown wearing their white anti flash covers correctly for once. They should go over the mouth but rarely do you see this in films.The acting is superb considering the period  the generation they came from. Kenneth Moore plays the part of Cpt Joh  Sheppard co ordianting the show down with Bizmark in the London RN HQ sympathetically portraying the genuine feelings the RN sailors had for the Nazi sailors who'd lost their lives. A comment from a sailor of the time She was the most beautiful ship I'd ever seen  we'd come here to sink her. Later it was known that the German sailors went throught similar moments after sinking the Hood. The final seconds of the film show Moore reluctantly throwing Bizmark's Atlantic battlefield model into the rubbish. Not covered is the abandoning of the surviving Germans by the Royal Navy. It is claimed that this was revenge for the loss of life on the Hood where all but 4 were killed. But Lufftwaffe air attacks against the Royal Naval Forces were a genuine threat as was an attack by German UBoats who did not hesitate to sink any enemy ship no matter what was going on. Basically not stopping to pick up survivors was Standard Operating Procedure whether they were friend or foe something that seems to be forgotten by the German survivors. They blame the Royal Navy but the RN never knew if a UBoat torpedo was on the way headed for their valuable ships. It was ultimately the effects of their Nazi Admiral Doenitz's orders comander of the UBoat packs that lead them to be abandoned.Carl Mohner portrays the Captain of the Bizmark Lindeman with an air of professionalism he isn't seen as a Nazi. He is shown as a good warrior but not a Fascist. Karl Stepanek as Admiral Lutchens is shown as a slightly arrogant puffed up Nazi. There is some truth here but later intelligence releases would explain why Lutchens sent such a long message to Berlin that allowed the British to fix his position so accurately  seal his fate. It wasn't arrogance or a death wish basically he already believed that he had been located by the RN  so had nothing to lose by breaking radio silence he was wrong at that point the RN had no idea where he was. Later historical evidence shows he was rather more complex that a simple Hitler toady.The final battle scenes avoid the brutal carnage later comments from surviving German sailors tesitfy to the impact of 16 inch shells from the Royal Navy as they tore the Bizmark to pieces. Basically they describe how the decks were littered with flesh like a butchers shop as one put it from the crew as they were blown to bits by the Royal Navy shells. Given the hatred the British still had for the Germans in 1960 when this film was made ask my mother who at the time wept for the loss of the Hood  swore at German air armadas that dropped bombs on her this ommision isn't a surprise as is the limits of acceptability at the time.Also not covered is the end game where KG5 pounded Bizmark with broadside after broadside. This is one of the reasons that the Bizmark aquired the legend of strength  invicibility. However any naval tactician of the time would have quickly pointed out a fatal flaw in this part of the action. Getting in close  sending 16 inch shells into Bizmark was NOT the way to sink her the shells would be travelling at a shallow angle  would explode in the upper decks. The proper way to do it is to get further back  send in shots that come in at a plunging angle exploding deep in the ship. She wasn't invincible she was simply tortured.All in all you have to look a very long way to find a similarly finessed work charting Naval Warfare. Battle of the River Plate Midway The Cruel Sea  Tora! Tora! Tora! are about the only examples I can think of. Intrigiungly they are also open to the criticisms levelled at acting standard of Bizmark but seemingly they don't attract the same. Why this is I don't know.Avoid the knee jerk reaction concerning the portrayal of the characters involved  you have a deep fascinating portrayal of one of the most interesting chapters in WW2 Naval History. For similar adventures try the films mentioned above but NOT the fathead 2001 Pearl Harbour remake which makes me want to puke.".

	schema:headline " Sad movie";
	schema:reviewBody "The German battleship Bismark was one of the finest warships ever built. She carried 8 15inch guns and a powerful secondary battery and could make 30 knots.  It wasn't one of the biggest or most powerful battleships ever built.  The Japanese had the Yamato and Mushashi towards the end of the war juggernauts with 18inch cannons.  There's a limit to gigantism of course and in the case of battleships it had to do with whether they could fit physically through the Panama Canal a concern the Japanese had long put behind them.  So the Bismark wasn't the sort of sacred monster that sheer size would make her.  But she LOOKED absolutely great.  Sleek well balanced with her superstructure done the way an architect might have done it not an engineer.  She looked built for speed and endurance too.  For an example of the opposite trend take a look at Rodney or Nelson.  More powerfully armed with 9 16inch guns carried in three turrets all set forward of the superstructure.  Man that is one ugly design.  And more than that Bismarck's crew were highly trained and she was equipped with one of the world's best optical firecontrol systems.  It wasn't just luck that sank the Hood and damaged any smaller ships that go too close it was good shooting.  Her shooting didn't fall off until that final bombardment. Winston Churchill called her a masterpiece of naval construction although not in this movie.  She kept large elements of the fleet pinned down at home simply by sitting in her protected port and being available.I must have seen this movie a dozen times and each time I begin by wondering if I'll be able to sit through it again.  I've got some of the exchanges memorized.  I generally make it though.  It's too good in its own dated way to pass up.  The model work is not bad at all for its time.  The reviewer who said this film called for black and white was correct.  It looks cold and frightening on the North Atlantic.  Almost everything would have been or at least seemed gray even if it had been shot in color.  The peformances are up to professional standards.  More is a different character here from his usual jocular one  frosty demanding and no nonsense.  Until finally overcome with emotion he breaks down in an understated scene.  Dana Wynter his assistant spots him and discreetly leaves him alone.  She's too beautiful to criticize as an actress.  She radiates purity and anima and gently draws More out of his shell.  Naismith is a familiar face as are many of the others.  And there is a running gag in this underground bunker where More is plotting the Bismarck's demise.  Nobody knows what time it is or if they know it's 9 o'clock they don't know if its morning or evening.  Even the Germans aboard the Bismarck are lent some humanity by the script writers. The cadets look like earnest freshfaced kids.  The Captain is a practical man worried about his ship and his crew.  Only Karel Stepanek as Lutjens belongs in another much earlier movie say one made in 1943.  He is well out of the frame established in the rest of the film.  Stricken with awe when he gets a birthday greeting from YouKnowWho.  Some of the dialogue is made up out of necessity.  Who knows what went on on the Bismarck's bridge especially during that last catastrophic shelling?  Back in the bunker Dana Wynter looks down at the wooden models on her chart where a dozen British warships surround the single Bismarck and pound her to pieces.  I don't feel like cheering she says.  Well War is all hell.  Maybe that's why human beings seem to need another one every twenty years or so to remind ourselves.  What a waste of great ships and of good men on both sides.  And an argument could even be made that Bismarck's sister ship the Tirpitz played an even more important part in the war simply by staying put and tying down so many British ships that were needed elsewhere.  Our side wins of course.  Our side almost always wins when we're the side that's funding the movie.  A lot of viewers will expectably feel relief when the threat represented by Bismarck is over but they probably won't feel much like cheering.".

There's a limit to gigantism of course and in the case of battleships it had to do with whether they could fit physically through the Panama Canal a concern the Japanese had long put behind them.  So the Bismark wasn't the sort of sacred monster that sheer size would make her.  But she LOOKED absolutely great.  Sleek well balanced with her superstructure done the way an architect might have done it not an engineer.  She looked built for speed and endurance too.  For an example of the opposite trend take a look at Rodney or Nelson.  More powerfully armed with 9 16inch guns carried in three turrets all set forward of the superstructure.  Man that is one ugly design.  And more than that Bismarck's crew were highly trained and she was equipped with one of the world's best optical firecontrol systems.  It wasn't just luck that sank the Hood and damaged any smaller ships that go too close it was good shooting.  Her shooting didn't fall off until that final bombardment. Winston Churchill called her a masterpiece of naval construction although not in this movie.  She kept large elements of the fleet pinned down at home simply by sitting in her protected port and being available.I must have seen this movie a dozen times and each time I begin by wondering if I'll be able to sit through it again.  I've got some of the exchanges memorized.  I generally make it though.  It's too good in its own dated way to pass up.  The model work is not bad at all for its time.  The reviewer who said this film called for black and white was correct.  It looks cold and frightening on the North Atlantic.  Almost everything would have been or at least seemed gray even if it had been shot in color.  The peformances are up to professional standards.  More is a different character here from his usual jocular one  frosty demanding and no nonsense.  Until finally overcome with emotion he breaks down in an understated scene.  Dana Wynter his assistant spots him and discreetly leaves him alone.  She's too beautiful to criticize as an actress.  She radiates purity and anima and gently draws More out of his shell.  Naismith is a familiar face as are many of the others.  And there is a running gag in this underground bunker where More is plotting the Bismarck's demise.  Nobody knows what time it is or if they know it's 9 o'clock they don't know if its morning or evening.  Even the Germans aboard the Bismarck are lent some humanity by the script writers. The cadets look like earnest freshfaced kids.  The Captain is a practical man worried about his ship and his crew.  Only Karel Stepanek as Lutjens belongs in another much earlier movie say one made in 1943.  He is well out of the frame established in the rest of the film.  Stricken with awe when he gets a birthday greeting from YouKnowWho.  Some of the dialogue is made up out of necessity.  Who knows what went on on the Bismarck's bridge especially during that last catastrophic shelling?  Back in the bunker Dana Wynter looks down at the wooden models on her chart where a dozen British warships surround the single Bismarck and pound her to pieces.  I don't feel like cheering she says.  Well War is all hell.  Maybe that's why human beings seem to need another one every twenty years or so to remind ourselves.  What a waste of great ships and of good men on both sides.  And an argument could even be made that Bismarck's sister ship the Tirpitz played an even more important part in the war simply by staying put and tying down so many British ships that were needed elsewhere.  Our side wins of course.  Our side almost always wins when we're the side that's funding the movie.  A lot of viewers will expectably feel relief when the threat represented by Bismarck is over but they probably won't feel much like cheering.";

As was accurately pointed out by Laurence Naismith playing the First Sea Lord they are committed heavily to the battle raging for Greece to defending the critical base at Malta and to protecting Atlantic convoys from America. So when Hitler turned loose his newest and biggest battleship the Bismarck the Royal Navy had not a whole lot to throw at her. Sink the Bismarck is done in a documentary style with the action taking place on the high seas in the British ships and on the Bismarck. The other part of the drama takes place at the war room at the Admiralty where the fictitious character Kenneth More a captain who had his ship shot out from under him by the German commander who is in charge of the Bismarck. The Bismarck was only out for eight days but in that time she annihilated the British cruiser Hood with all but 3 lost. After that it was a running battle with both planes from the carrier Ark Royal and ship to ship battles with the Prince of Wales the George V and the Dorcestshire before the Bismarck went down in the Atlantic.There is a side personal drama involving Kenneth More whose son is a flier on board the Ark Royal and who is missing. WREN officer Dana Wynter is around to lend a sympathetic ear and there's a bit of a hint that things might get personal with More and Wynter.The Ark Royal planes did some damage and I notice that the planes flown off the Ark Royal were ancient biplanes. They did some damage but didn't sink the Bismarck themselves. Unfortunately some lessons were not learned by the British command and the Prince of Wales and the Repulse were sunk several months later by the Japanese with aerial bombardment when they reported for duty at the British base in Singapore. The British did in fact experiment with carriers as the Ark Royal's contribution in that action and others signifies. I'm willing to bet Mr. Churchill wished he had a few more carriers like the Americans and Japanese did. And I'm also willing to bet he was thanking the Deity the Germans had none.Two things helped popularize the film in America and it did do well on this side of the Atlantic. I remember a packed house when I went to see it in theater back when I was a lad. One was the presence and narration of Edward R. Murrow who as a correspondent for CBS radio reported to America on the Bismarck story and so many others. His more than FDR's was the voice of World War II for the American public.The second was that country singer Johnny Horton had a big selling hit also entitled Sink the Bismarck. Though nary a note of it is heard in this film that song on the charts boosted sales to Sink the Bismarck tremendously. Kind of unusual that an American country singer would choose a British naval action as the subject of a song. But the heroism of all the members of the Royal Navy and even that of the crew of the Bismarck is the stuff legends are made of.".

It begins with the Christening and launching of the impressive German vessel Bismark. The massive battleship which could easily cruise at 30 knots became the pride of Germany and quickly proved her military prowess when encountering the H.M.S. Hood. The Hood was the pride of the British Royal Navy with her Captain and select crew of 1500 men were well seasoned and experienced. Yet on that fateful day of May 24th 1941 the two ships came within 15 miles of each other. After several exchanged salvos the Bismark with her compliment of 8 fifteen inch guns completely destroyed the British ship leaving only three survivors. This disastrous event is but one of the exceptional battle scenes superbly recreated by Howard Lydecker and his special effects crew. To add to the creative storyline are the actors which give this movie a superior realism. Kenneth More as Captain Shepard who along with his naval staff wage war against the Bismark from their underground command post in wartorn London where Edward R.

Carl Mhner is Captain Lindemann the proud Captain of the Bismark with Karel Stepanek playing his immediate superior Admiral Lutjens. Laurence Naismith plays the First Sea Lord.

	schema:reviewBody "In May 1941 the mighty German battleship Bismarck accompanied by the cruiser Prinz Eugen left her home port in the Baltic on a mission to attack British convoys in the North Atlantic. The two ships were intercepted in the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland by the British warships HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales. In the ensuing exchange of fire the Hood was sunk with the loss of all but three of her crew and the Prince of Wales and the Bismarck were both damaged. The German commander Admiral Gnther Ltjens therefore decided to return to a port in occupied France so that the Bismarck could be repaired. The ship was however pursued across the Atlantic by the Royal Navy determined to avenge the loss of the Hood and to neutralise the threat which the Bismarck posed to British shipping. Sink the Bismarck! is made in a semidocumentary style concentrating less upon the actual combatants than upon what have been described as the unsung backroom planners. The documentary effect is enhanced by having the American journalist Ed Murrow repeat some of his wartime radio broadcasts from London. The main character played by Kenneth More is Captain Jonathan Shepard the Admiralty's Chief of Operations responsible for directing the operation from a war room in London. Michael Hordern playing the Admiral leading the hunt for the Bismarck at sea has a much smaller role. Historically this would have been Admiral Sir John Tovey but his name is never given in the film. More was one of those actors who had a fairly small range but who was capable of giving some very good performances within it. He specialised in playing calm imperturbable uppermiddleclass Englishmen or Scotsmen often officers in the armed forces. He could often look out of his depth when he tried to go too far outside this range. Here however he is excellent. Shepard is a fictitious character the film makers insisted in the closing credits that he was not to be identified with Captain Ralph Edwards the real Chief of Operations during this period. More plays him as outwardly a typical stiffupperlip Briton of the era but one who beneath his calm faade is hiding his own personal traumas. His work is physically less dangerous than service at sea would be yet nevertheless extremely stressful emotionally one of Shepard's colleagues unable to cope with the strain has announced that he will resign his job in the operations room to take up a position as commander of a naval vessel. In some ways the film is very accurate the battle scenes were shot using scale models of the actual ships involved. There are a number of historical inaccuracies but I suspect that these are not goofs in the sense of inadvertent errors made through carelessness but deliberate departures from historical fact for the sake of dramatic licence. During the chase the Bismarck sinks a destroyer named HMS Solent no British destroyers were lost in the battle and although there was an HMS Solent during the war it was a submarine not a destroyer. A Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal is shot down although no aircraft were lost in the actual battle. Both these details were added to increase dramatic tension one of the crew of the bomber is Shepard's son Tom and his father must endure an agonising wait for news of his son. Perhaps the greatest departure from historical reality concerns the character of Admiral Ltjens. Karel tpnek plays him as a fanatical Nazi arrogant and absurdly overconfident. Peter Finch had given a much more sympathetic portrayal of a senior German naval officer in Battle of the River Plate four years earlier. He barks at his crew Never forget that you are Nazis! a real Nazi would probably have said Never forget that you are National Socialists! but the truth is that the real Ltjens was not a Nazi at all. He disliked the regime for which he was fighting and contrary to the way he is portrayed here was very pessimistic about the Bismarck's chance of success. Yet in the context of the film tpnek's performance is a good one increasing the dramatic contrast between Ltjens and Shepard both more cautious and more humane. Patriotic wartime epics often based upon true stories were popular in the British cinema during the fifties and sixties so it is not surprising that the hunt for the Bismarck should have furnished the material for a howwewonthewar film. Compared to the high emotions of something like The Dambusters perhaps the greatest true story war film it can at times seem rather cool yet it is still undoubtedly one of Britain's better efforts in the genre due particularly to More's efforts. 710".

Battleships had a hideous graceful sort of massive beauty during their brief heyday at the peak of war technology but went the way of the dinosaur after WWII. Their vulnerabilities are demonstrated in this film as are certain unfortunate but not necessarily erroneous tactical moves by the German Admiral and the Captain of the Bismarck.In case you don't know the story I won't spoil it but an event occurs around the middle of this film that has a sudden awesome shock value that can still cause your jaw to drop. It is perfectly set forth despite the lowtech film techniques available in 1960 the producers do a great job.A deadly serious film about deadly serious heavy subject matter Sink the Bismarck has qualities that hold up and it is worth your viewing time.";

This one tells the tale of the German battleship Bismarck. Bismarck was the first battleship built by Germany since the First World War. Because of several ocean raids made earlier in the war by GRAF SPEE SCHARHORST and GNEISENAU. The British were worried that Bismarck could wreak havoc of the Atlantic convoys.When Bismarck and the cruiser Prinz Eugen made their break to reach the Atlantic the Royal Navy sent every ship they could to hunt them down. First honours went to the German Navy when they sank the star of the R.N. the Hood and heavily damaged the Prince of Wales.Later on Bismarck's luck ran out when a lucky hit with a torpedo dropped by a Swordfish aircraft damaged her steering gear. Unable to escape the rest of the ships in pursuit she went to the bottom under a hail of shells and torpedoes. Prinz Eugen escaped and made it to German held France.The film itself is told from the British headquarters managing the pursuit. Kenneth More plays the officer in charge. He is supported by a slew of British character actors like Geoffery Keen Laurence Naismith Michael Horden and Maurice Denham. Pretty Dana Wynter supplies the female content.Shot is black and white the film features some excellent model work and top notch battle scenes. The director Lewis Gilbert keeps this one moving at a steady pace with nary a slow moment on screen.Even 50 plus years after being made this one stands up very well and is worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent picture dealing with infamous ship including spectacular battle sequences and prestigious main cast helped by a fleet of the best Brit character players . It's one of the last great Brit pictures about warfare naval action and being based on real incidents . British Navy sets out to locate and sink notorious German battleship during WWII in this most stirring account of the quest for the formidable Bismarck . This is the World War II story of the British Navy's effort to defeat Nazi Germany's most powerful warship . This is a splendid British film concerning historic deeds during WWII  the naval battle in the Atlantic Ocean between German battleship and British squadron of various ships  carriers and airplanes . This picture is based on fact  but there have been complaints that is most inaccurate . Magnificent performances from Kenneth More as the withdrawn officer director operations supported by a beautiful as well as interesting Dana Wynter . The main and secondary cast are stunningly incarnated by a magnificent plethora of English actors such as Michael Hordern  Maurice Denham  Michael Goodliffe  Jack Gwillim  Michael Ripper  Bernard Lee  David Hemmings  Ian Hendry  Laurence Naismith  Geoffrey Keen and Esmond Knight who plays the captain of the HMS Prince of Wales actually served as an officer on board her and was injured during the battle. Excellent scale models  though also utilized actual battle footage  according to special effects cameraman L.B. Abbott the miniatures were photographed with spherical  nonanamorphic lenses . This made it easier to force the perspective of the image to make the miniatures appear bigger and further apart. The producers knew that the use of miniatures and explosions would have to look very realistic to be successful  they hired Howard Lydecker one of the legendary Lydecker brothers who were generally considered to be the best special effects team in the industry and they had spent decades perfecting their craft at Republic Pictures. The film contains an evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and white by classic cinematographer Christopher Challis who also photographed 'The battle of the River Plata. The flick was stunningly directed by Lewis Gilbert . The motion picture will appeal to wartime genre buffs and British classic movie fans . Rating  Better than average .The film is based on true events  these are the followings  Bismarck and her sister ship Tirpitz were the largest battleships ever built by Germany and two of the largest built by any European power.In the course of the warship's eightmonth career under its sole commanding officer Capt. Ernst Lindemann Bismarck conducted only one offensive operation in May 1941 codenamed Rheinbung. The ship along with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen was to break into the Atlantic Ocean and raid Allied shipping from North America to Great Britain. The two ships were detected several times off Scandinavia and British naval units were deployed to block their route. At the Battle of the Denmark Strait Bismarck engaged and destroyed the battlecruiser HMS Hood the pride of the Royal Navy and forced the battleship HMS Prince of Wales to retreat Bismarck was hit three times and suffered an oil leak from a ruptured tank. The destruction of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later while heading for the relative safety of occupied France Bismarck was attacked by obsolescent Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning Bismarck was neutralised by a sustained bombardment from a British fleet was scuttled by her crew and sank with heavy loss of life. Most experts agree that the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions".

	schema:reviewBody "Sink the Bismark! 1960A smart steady as she goes WWII film in stately wide screen black and white. There is little to flaw in it and equally little to lift it above its quiet perfection. I don't mean it's a perfect movie but that it manages perfectly to hold its tone from the war rooms to the sea battles from the English side to the German with intelligence and historical accuracy. The terror the large high tech battleship caused is legendary among those who lived through it. It was a symbol of German military and engineering prowess. When it knocked out sank Britain's largest and best ship early in the war it looked invincible. And the prime minister made a point of saying in a key early moment that they had to do whatever it took to sink it. And so risks were taken and more lives lost and until eventually it was sunk.Not to give away the end but this is history and war is serious. As a sign of how the movie remains sombre through it all there was no cheering and really not even a smile among the British when they saw the Bismarck finally go underwater. Which is admirable the stiff upper lip thing but it's also a little unbelievable. Indeed the German boat leaders are constantly shown to be arrogant and cocky worried more about letters from Hitler than the fact they are leaking oil. I suppose it might be true to some extent that the British were all good chaps and determined to win and the Germans were all ruthless and tireless and determined also to win.Such is war.But this is maybe the largest tilt the film makes in the wrong direction. It is filmed with great control and it mixes a little existing footage with the new shooting really seamlessly. The acting is first rate with no heroes in the Hollywood sense just a large cast of focused talent. As for accuracy it seems that scholars find it quite good in the large picture but riddled with little errors including the portrayal of the German captain as a cocky Hitler worshiper. There is some question about whether the Germans scuttled the ship themselves or if it was sunk and there was apparently no Norwegian spy involved. Some of the errors have to do with the use of updated ships for the filming but most of this is too fast to worry about. There is the hinted at turning away after the sinking without picking up Germans in the water and apparently the rescue effort was minimal so a hundred Germans died in the water. Great detail is found at the Wiki entry for the movie as well as the entry for the ship. Another page to pursue is at www.kbismarck.com.The main character Captain Shepard and his son on a navy ship are fictional. The wreck was discovered in 1989 by the same team that discovered the Titanic and James Cameron made a documentary on the ship and its wreckage in 2002.".

Typical of WW2 German warships its tonnagesize was out of proportion to its armament. And armor was not as important as armament once large caliber shells began hitting and exploding any ship's fighting effectiveness plunged.Washington or South Dakota would have sent Bismarck's sistership Tirpitz to the bottom quickly had they ever had a chance to fight her.It is my opinion that British gunnery was the best in the world throughout WW2. Renown was scoring early decisive hits  even a conning tower hit  on Scharnhorst and Gneisenau off Norway in early 1940 which sent SG fleeing. Heavy cruiser Dorsetshire scored an early conning tower hit on the final battle against Bismarck. Heavy cruiser Norfolk scored an early decisive 8 hit on Scharnhorst's fire control off the North Cape Christmas 1943 albeit at the same time getting hit by 11 duds in return. KGVclass Prince of Wales scored on Bismarck significantly and KGVclass Duke of York scored the decisive power plant hit on Scharnhorst at the North Cape.At the same time it should be mentioned that the 14 guns of those KGV class British battleships chronically malfunctioned throughout the war although their fire control was so accurate that the fewer shells still scored sufficient significant hits in their battles.By the way I have an original 1940 Luftwaffe Allied warship recognition book which cites Hood's weakness  biggest ship in the Royal Navy or not  and somewhere I read that Admiral Holland wanted to position battleship Prince of Wales to be Bismarck's first target rather than battle cruiser Hood but the encounter went otherwise.Finally I might mention that in 2012 Airfix models came out with a 11200 Sink the Bismarck set of exquisite tabletop waterline models. Bismarck Prinz Eugen Ark Royal Hood Suffolk and 2 of the Tribal class destroyers are included.

	schema:reviewBody "Sink The Bismarck is an excellent motion picture depicting in historical fiction a great naval battle probably the last true naval battle between capital ships shooting at each other within sight of each other  gun to gun.   The British during a very critical time and in a bad position did sink the Bismarck but not quite as this movie portrays.The first engagement between the Royal Navy and the Bismarck was between HMS Hood an enormous cruiser backed by the brand new Prince Of Wales a King George Fifth class Battleship and the Bismarck accompanied by the heavy cruiser Prince Eugene.   The HMS Hood engaged the Bismarck the largest most powerful with 15 inch guns built at that time.   Within ten minutes the Bismarck had literally blown up the Hood.   Of the Hood's crew of 1400 men there were only three survivors.   It should be noted that while the British considered HMS Hood a major warship she had been built in 1920 and modified many times before her engagement with the DKM Bismarck.   The Hood was actually badly modified for instance she was riding eight inches below her designed water level.   After the Hood blew up the HMS Prince Of Wales took several bad hits including a hit to her bridge and made smoke and disengaged.   The Bismarck was originally discovered and followed by the two British cruisers the Sheffield and the Norfolk using a new but not terribly accurate device radar.   The Bismarck started zig zaging as if avoiding submarines and in two hours stopped and continued in a straight line at which time the two British cruisers lost her.   The Bismarck then dispatched the battle cruiser Prince Eugene to Breast and continued on into the Atlantic to sink British and American convoys.Mostly by deductive reason the British found Bismarck again and this time brought the battleship HMS King George V and the Ark Royal a new aircraft carrier equipped with old biplanes carrying one torpedo each in addition to several more cruisers and destroyers against the Bismarck in the Denmark Straights.   A torpedo from a plane damaged Bismarck's rudder and Bismarck became a practically helpless target for the British capital ships.   After a two hour battle between King George V and her escort the Bismarck was badly damaged with her bridge destroyed including the captain and fleet commander having been killed.  A junior officer ordered the Bismarck's crew to abandon ship.It's only been during the last decade that the sunken Bismarck was found. The British warships did not in fact sink the Bismarck.   She was scuttled to keep the British from capturing her and using her against her builders and owners Germany.   The proof of the scuttling was found in scanning Bismarck's hull which was still completely intact.   The Bismarck still technically belongs to Germany.   Therefore her location has not been specifically revealed to the general public and Germany has so far decided to allow her to remain a grave for those of the crew of the Bismarck who were lost.   Nevertheless the British did Sink The Bismarck.Though in black and white this is a great war movie and does more of less accurately chronicle the last great battle between capital ships of the line battleships which fought it out gun to gun.I highly recommend the motion picture.".

He's your typical Nazi villain bent on destroying the world with his deadly toys. In real life Lutjens despised both Nazi policies and Hitler and was deeply pessimistic about both his mission and the capabilities of his super ship. The film is designed to appeal squarely to WW2 veterans and their wide eyed sons. It captures the skill of British naval gunners at the time the Bismarck may have outgunned and outtonned her opponents but British gunners were notorious for hitting their targets early fast and precisely.

	schema:reviewBody "The Glenn Miller Story is a biographical tribute to a man who is always ranked as one of the great swing bandleaders of the late thirties to middle forties era. It is indeed fortunate that when James Stewart puts a pair of glasses on he does actually look like the real Glenn Miller. I don't know what Helen Miller looked like but I'm sure she was as supportive to her husband as June Allyson was to her screen hubby.The Miller story begins with Stewart and pal Harry Morgan on the road as musicians. Stewart plays a slide trombone and has ideas of how the orchestra should sound as a whole. He spends a lot of time writing arrangements for the entire band. When they're not done right as is graphically shown in a scene when Miller's famous Moonlight Serenade is performed he decides to form his own band.He's still looking for that particular sound that he wants his orchestra to have and he chances on it in one of the more interesting scenes in the film. Swing fans when they hear it will recognize it as the genuine Glenn Miller.One glaring fault for purists though is while the instrumentals are performed nicely the vocal part of the Miller band is left out of the film. For whatever reason singers Ray Eberle Marian Hutton Betty's sisterand most of all Gordon Tex Beneke are not in the film. In fact Chattanooga Choo Choo Beneke's most famous number is performed in the film by Frances Langford as herself.My favorite scene in the film is the nightclub scene in Harlem on the Miller wedding night. June was definitely a patient wife but hey if you got a chance to jam with Louis Armstrong you drop EVERYTHING for that opportunity. Gene Krupa and other top jazz musicians are in that scene with Stewart and Satchmo making it a real treat for jazz aficionados.For American music we are indeed fortunate that Glenn Miller succeeded in his quest for the right sound which is so lovingly captured in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Produced nine years after his death this is Hollywood's obituary of swing era legend Glenn Miller. Essentially a musical told around the story of his struggle to achieve musical stardom. A film that will appeal to all lovers of 1930s swing music and Glenn Miller in particular. A film also for James Stewart fans. Casting the gangling Stewart as Miller was a huge gamble that succeeded if it had failed so would have the film. This success was due to Anthony Mann's undoubted ability as a director. The MannStewart combination had already proved itself but here both were on unfamiliar territory. Mann's fort was the outdoor adventure while Stewart was a prewar light comedy star still trying to find a new identity. Mann had earlier directed Stewart in Winchester '731950and the two were to go on to further success with The Far Country 1954 and The Man from Larramie 1955. He excels himself in bringing out previously unknown talents in Stewart that make this a career best for the Actor. Clad simply in a military raincoat a trombone to his lips and sporting a USAAF officer's peaked cap he requires no further makeup to pass himself off as the wartime Miller. Among the lesser credits is the name of an unknown Henry Mancini but this was to be his big break as at the young age of 22 he was to become an Oscar nominee jointly with Joseph Gershenson for musical scoring. Before joining Universal Mancini had been a piano player and arranger with the postwar Glenn Miller Orchestra by using musicians from this band made up mainly of sidesmen from Miller's own bands Mancini ensured an authentic recreation of the seductive Miller sound that had enchanted teenagers in the years leading up to the war. Regrettably an argument with the Miller Estate prevented the participation of saxophonist Ted Beneke who had earlier led the postwar band and was renowned for his performance of Chattanoga ChooChoo inSunValley Serenade 1941. The fidelity of the sound track of Miller's music won the film an Oscar for best sound recording of a musical. After a ponderous start the film picks up pace in apparent tune with Miller's success until the last reel is a nonstop performance of Miller standards. Miller was supported throughout by his wife Helen sympathetically played by a cuddlesome June Allyson who ceaselessly encouraged him when all seemed to have failed. When news of his death reaches her one immediately feels her sadness in her loss and spontaneously grieves with her. Get your hankies out! A few minor lapses mar an otherwise competent production Miller is incongruously seen in his army raincoat an a glorious summer's day conducting his wartime band at an outdoor concert in England just after Dday while the audience and band are in standard military attire a continuity lapse shows a German flying bomb attack taking place before Dday 6th June whereas the first one did not reach England until the following week. Miller's loss at the peak of popularity flying in advance of his band to make arrangements in Paris for his Christmas concert ensured his enduring fame. As his plane and body were never recovered the mystery of his death has added to the legend. Only in the last decade have military historians been able to piece together his last moments and pinpoint where the plane came down. Whilst crossing the English Channel in dense fog the plane which relied entirely on a compass for navigation wandered off course and entered a prohibited area reserved for returning Allied bombers to drop any left over bombs it was one of these that hit the plane so bringing to its end the life of one Glenn Alton Miller. Anthony Mann's deliberately abrupt end to the film comes as a jolt and dramatically conveys the unexpected loss of the patriotic Miller in his prime  the touch of the Master. A film that has stood the test of time part fact part fiction it will remain the definitive tribute to the man and his music. Good wholesome entertainment for the whole family and a must for Stewart and Miller fans.".

Regardless of any character liberty taken director Anthony Mann crafts a very watchable tale Stewart and the ever watchable June Allyson as Helen Miller ensure it's a very professional piece and I dare anyone to not start tapping their feet to those wonderful tunes but I still think that we are waiting for the definitive Glen Miller picture some 50 odd years later. As for the ending? Well if it's played out as fact then it's a wonderful finale but if the makers shoehorned Little Brown Jug into the end purely for romanticism? Well that could be construed as dangerously sugar coating what should be a sombre ending to the story. 6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the musical biopics I've seen The Glenn Miller Story ranks pretty low. That's not to say it was bad I'm just saying I've enjoyed the others much more. Films like The Five Pennies about Red Nichols Til the Clouds Roll By Jerome Kern or even the more recent 70s Lady Sings the Blues Billie Holiday were much more engaging and memorable to me because those films explored a dramatic conflict in the artist's life. I'm not talking about car chases  explosions I just think a movie should focus on a particular difficulty that the protagonist must face recurring obstacles internal demons or good old artistic pathos. Something to make it seem like there's a point to the struggle.The Glenn Miller Story had no such conflict. Aside from a few money problems early on always solved by hocking his horn at a local pawn shop everything seems to go peachy keen. The whole film is like a gentle sled ride down a bunny slope. This is odd because Glenn's true life story had plenty of drama that could have been brought to the screen. Instead these moments were glossed overalmost as if the filmmakers were purposely trying to avoid any tension or passion. The conclusion was handled so vaguely I had to run over to wikipedia to read what really happened.While I was at wikipedia I learned a whole lot of other interesting things about Glenn Millernone of which warranted more than a 30 second scene in the film. I'm talking about things like Glenn's new sound  how he struggled with it his efforts to revolutionize the military's musical format  the tremendous resistance he encountered from officers  critics and as I mentioned the VERY intriguing conclusion to his career  life. These major points were presented insufficiently in the film. It seemed like the filmmakers chose to focus more on the feelgood scenes like wedding parties happy gigs and the happy couple cooing to each other without ever showing how they fell in love in the first place. I was left in a state of disbelief.It's hard for me to flunk any Jimmy Stewart film so I'll probably try giving it another viewing someday. Maybe it's a good flick for a warm summer day when you don't want too much drama. But for now I prefer the other films I mentioned particularly The Five Pennies which really gives you an appreciation for how hard musicians struggle to reach successand Louis Armstrong vs. Danny Kaye in duelling trumpets is worth the price of admission!Another good biopic which convincingly shows an artist's struggle though fictionalized is Young Man with a Horn with Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall. If you really want a artistic pathos of course go for AMADEUS!".

While there's more to see of their collaborations none of the ones seen are less than good.Biopics are very difficult to get right especially ones of famous people in entertainment i.e. film and music composing singing playing instruments. For example often coming to life when in action whether acting singing composing or playing but some suffer from the biographical elements not faring as good with a tendency to play fast and loose with the facts. There are some great ones some good ones some uneven ones and some hugely problematic ones.Luckily 'The Glenn Miller Story' is one of the neargreat ones. On a musical front it is nothing short of exceptional no complaints there but it was thoroughly enjoyable as a biopic too regardless of it not being a true account and very scratch surface because of not suffering from pacing or tone problems. Stewart is noteperfect in a role that plays to his strengths despite him portraying a big band icon Stewart not only plays Miller with utter conviction but the performance also epitomises everything that Stewart himself is about and what made him such a great actor.'The Glenn Miller Story' when it comes to Mann is very much removed from his darker and more psychological westerns that also star Stewart the films that he's perhaps chiefly famous for but there is not once a sense that he is beyond his comfort zone in an atypical genre for him far from it. To me actually even with a lighter touch much needed without it ever feeling too much it is one of Mann's stronger overall directorial efforts when it comes to his collaborations with Stewart.As said to be expected the music is exceptionally bewitching with all the hits included and it was so wonderful to hear so many classics in one film. This said 'The Glenn Miller Story' does have much more than a great performance and music. As well as June Allyson personifying charm and spunk the supporting cast are just as good with a superb Harry Morgan and cracking appearances from Louis Armstrong Gene Krupa The Modernaires and Frances Langford. The chemistry between Stewart and Allyson is irresistible and 'The Glenn Miller Story' is handsomely mounted and beautifully filmed with lavish use of colour.Scriptwise 'The Glenn Miller Story' a vast majority of the time succeeds with a nice and well balanced dose of humour that makes one feel good and tender sentiment while the story's warm heart and bags of charm more than makes up for any misgivings of it being inaccurate and only scratching the surface. Really liked the characters and felt myself caring for them.My only complaints really are the rather too sudden ending that should have been more sombre and the central relationship being portrayed somewhat too perfectly and sugar coated which does despite the irresistible chemistry mean that parts do fall into saccharineoverboard camp occasionally.In conclusion a neargreat film and it is easy to see why of all Stewart and Mann's collaborations 'The Glenn Miller Story' is generally one of the more fondly remembered ones. 810 Bethany Cox".

So needless to say this man's music has transcended it's appeal to those of that generation when someone 60 years later recognizes and appreciates the unique sound he put together.So with that being said I basically knew nothing about the man's life and certainly could not have predicted the ending of the movie because of that. I know everyone who watched this movie when it came out would have known and so I'm sure it was anticlimatic. But for me it was quite a shock and saddened me greatly.I was very touched by the beautiful love story between Miller and his wife. I think Stewart and Allyson played their roles superbly and had a wonderful and endearing chemistry between the two. I don't know if the details of their courtship were accurate but it's amazing that she would just up and agree to meet and marry him after not seeing or hearing from him for 2 years. If it is true it must mean that 2 people really know when they are right for each other and destined to be together.One scene I found amusing is on their anniversary Mrs. Miller is out shopping. When she gets home she surprises her husband by bringing home a baby! I know they couldn't have children of their own and already had adopted a boy. I just can't imagine someone doing this without there having to be lots of planning both parties signing forms etc.This is a great movie for the characters the superb acting the great music and the appearance of several other musical performers. I especially liked the club scene where Louis Armstrong performs except for the changing colors spinning in across the camera lens  that was distracting.".

He had a kind heart but could be as tough as someone with a heart of ice when he didn't find perfection and he was hard on himself too.He did have a heart of gold. One true story is before he left on the illfated flight he traded trombones with one of the trombonists because Miller's had an ultralight slide and it helped his performer play better.Overall I love this movie but I look at it as a nice fantasy movie with characters whose names happen to be the same as a man whose name and profession in real life closely resembled this lead character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Glenn Miller was a timid man with a pushy wife. At least that is what The Glenn Miller Story a loose biographical look at the latter part of the famed band leader's life would have you believe. And just when did his wife become so ambitious? The filmmakers never really let us know. But not being familiar with the details of Miller's life myself I took this UniversalInternational tale very lightly and did not take the details or lack thereof to heart too much.Old reliable James Stewart plays Miller as we follow his life from his more lean days as a musical hopeful until his untimely death in a World War II plane crash. Along the way we watch as Miller makes successes in his career as well as his budding relationship with college sweetheart and eventual wife HelenJune Allyson. After enduring setbacks in creating his signature sound and his wife's eventual infertility he reaches the pinnacle of his career only to lose his life while participating in America's war effort.Stewart plays Miller convincingly enough if a little boring at times. But Stewart does manage to inject the right amount of sweetness and earnestness to make Miller seem likable and of rootingvalue. Allyson who has never been a favorite of mine warbles her way through the film as if she has a mouth full of marbles. And she never truly brings the character to life to make me see past Allyson just playing a part. The Glenn Miller Story does have its moments though. There are a great few moments of cinematography in a nightclub performance of Louis Armstrong in which various colors of lenses rotate on the camera lens. There is also a touching if underdone scene at the end when a heartbroken Helen listens to Glenn's posthumous performance on the radio. But these great moments are unfortunately weighed down by other notsogreat moments. For instance when Helen finds out she won't be able to have children of her own she seems to take the news as if someone just told her that the Piggly Wiggly stopped carrying her favorite brand of detergent. They never seem to want to delve too deeply into the difficult moments. Nonetheless the movie works. Stewart and a fine supporting cast create a foundation which holds up the good and the bad and Glenn Miller's tale is glossy and engaging if a tad bit uneven at times.".

That is why the sound is so authentic... it was performed by the REAL BAND! Jimmy Stewart is a good keyboard musician but after 2 weeks of practice before filming started his Trombone teacher Ran away screaming. It was at that time they plugged the mouthpiece with lead and he looked and sounded great well he made no sound which was better than he did. If you don't believe me check some of the Jimmy Stewart interviews he did about the movie. I heard it from his mouth on one of the latenight talk shows where they were talking about some of his old movies. Of the Big Band History films the only actor that actually performed for the role is Steve Allen in The Benny Goodman story. Dorseys playing themselves don't count!Brief repeat of my review...

But Karma is a twoway street as anyone who has watched Fred Astaire as dancer Vernon Castle or Petulia Clark as Mrs. Chips may recall. Glenn has solemnly pledged to his wife Helen June Allyson NEVER to let his band play her song Little Brown Jug. Sure enough the minute Glenn feels cocky enough to tempt fate by renouncing this vow he disappears into the Channel's fog.".

This produces the mellow jazz sound that distinguishes the Miller band forevermore. But Karma is a twoway street as anyone who has watched Fred Astaire as dancer Vernon Castle or Petulia Clark as Mrs. Chips may recall. Glenn has solemnly pledged to his wife Helen June Allyson NEVER to let his band play her song Little Brown Jug. Sure enough the minute Glenn feels cocky enough to tempt fate by renouncing this vow he disappears into the Channel's fog.";

The mood of the movie simply progressed with ease and gentleness and at the same time hurled you into a world many never would have thought of. The world of a normal young girl who has to go through an unusual dilemma because both of her parents are deaf and at the same time face the difficulties of life experiencing her own true self. Finding herself turns out to be one of the real challenges in her life because she has to separate herself from her parents and walk down her own path without turning her back on them. She wants to be a musician an idea which her father does not understand or support. Becoming a musician despite the fact that her parents are deaf gives a very clear and pure image of how children tend to disobey their parents and create their own identity. The movie ends without really wrapping up every lose end but it does not spoil it. Nonetheless it gives the movie the perfect ending in which everything that really matters works out. The idea of the movie and the very story has as I have mentioned a very deep and original plot but this movies has more to it than this. Great acting especially from the father great music and is overall greatly directed and written. Good movie with many details. 710".

I personally found the reconciliation scene of Lara's Father and his sister very touching though a bit too quick.This movie encourages people to go and search for their own ideals and ambitions and at the same time let them know that despite every kind of fame and riches in the world nothing can be more important and precious than the love from your own family. Very touching indeed.The music used in this movie is breathtaking as well. Alas that it doesn't have a soundtrack or does it?.".

	schema:headline " A wonderful chance to look into a world you seldom see mentioned in film or on TV";
	schema:reviewBody "Beyond Silence is a film cowritten and directed by Caroline Linkthe same lady responsible for Nowhere Out of Africaa film that won the Best Foreign Language Oscar a few years ago. The story is about a teen who loves music and wishes to go to a music college. Yet oddly her parents are deaf and cannot really enjoy her musicnor do they really understand why this is important to her. The main themes then are understanding and acceptance.I have a rather unique perspective on Beyond Silence and so how I judge it maybe very different from the average viewer. My daughter is deaf and my wife and I are hard of hearing mine is minor and began much more recently. So a film that talks about issues pertaining to a family with deaf and nondeaf family members is naturally something that would appeal to usand it would have many aspects to it that would be more important to us than the average viewer.Here are some things an American deaf audience would probably like to know about the film. First the sign language in this film is sometimes pretty easy to understandGerman sign language is a but more like American sign language than is the British system. Sure a few words here and there were different that's to be expected but some was identical or very similar and you should be able to follow what they are saying if you know American Sign Language. Plus the same issues facing the deaf and hearing family members are the same throughout the world so it won't matter that it takes place in Germany. Second if you watch the film select caption option 2NOT 1. That's because although the German being spoken is translated as is MOST of the sign language when in a few tiny cases people speak English this is NOT captioned if you choose option 1.The film is about a dilemma I know about but have never seen on TV or in film. It's the story of a hearing child who has deaf parentsand there are many complications as a result of this. First the hearing girl is the window to the world for the parents. This tiny kid ends up translating and even doing very adult conversations for the parents because the parents are not skilled at communicating any way other than sign language. And at times the child strongly manipulates her parentstranslating thins in a manner that is best for her but not at times very accurate this is a VERY common problem. It's also a negative for the child however as their needs often become secondary and they are forced to give up much of themselves. It's not surprising then that Clarissa decides to take up musicsomething she can have that uniquely hers and separate from her parents. I thought it was fascinating that she chose the clarinetan instrument deaf parents would have difficulty enjoying had she chosen the bass or drums the parents could have readily enjoyed along with her.The film also brings up a lot of practical information that the typical person would not know. The fact that the parents in their 30s to about 50 in the film would only use sign language and have VERY limited vocal skills might surprise some. What might be more surprising is that the father's own family never really learned to communicate with him!! Sadly only about 10 of the families with deaf kids learn sign languagethe vast majority simply point or leave them out of what is happening. And so when this happens in the movie I wasn't at all surprised but know it would be shocking to many to see family get togethers where NO ONE spoke with the deaf folks except their own child! That's really sad but the norm. And when the father becomes enraged because he is left out you certainly can understand thisthough his family just thinks he's an angry person or make excuses to baby him instead of addressing the problem.As a result of these aspects of the film it's obvious the folks who wrote the film grew up in such a home or know people who struggled with some of these same issues. That's rare as some times I have seen deaf characters it's as if they were written by people who have no idea of the problems they face...or their kids the vast majority of whom are hearing. Sadly however there are no special features to tell you about this the making or the film or why they chose to make it! By the way aside from a brief nude scene you really don't see anything this is good viewing for the family. I would hope nondeaf and deaf audiences alike would enjoy the filmI know I did. It was exceptionally well made and I loved the music. A quality production throughout.As you can see in the film a teachers' conference with the parents where the child translates is a very BAD idea! In the US this often occurs and should call for a schoolprovided interpreter! The same can be said for when the parents were dealing with the bank and their daughter simply interpreted what she wanted to interpret and nothing more!".

	schema:reviewBody "Jenseits der Stille is an almost 20yearold German movie by Caroline Link. This film here scored an Academy Award nomination but lost to the Dutch entry. However 5 years later Link triumphed Nirgendwo in Afrika and she was pretty young back then as in 2015 she is 50 years old. The story here is simply. A girl has deaf parents and helps them with coping in everyday life as good as she can but her ability to hear makes her long for a more meaningful life. She becomes a musician and longs for the support of her family especially her dad's but he cannot really accept and appreciate what his daughter does as he cannot hear it. He says in one scene that he would actually have preferred her to be deaf as well.During these roughly 105 minutes we also meet some other family members and watch how the protagonist has to deal with the loss of a beloved person. The first 40 minutes or so are about the central character's life as a child and how she gets into playing the clarinet. The transformation from girl to woman if you can say that happens during a concert as there is a time jump of roughly 10 years. Sylvie Testud takes over at this point. She won a German Film Award for her performance here. If you have seen Marion Cotillard's Oscar winning turn in La mme you will have come across Testud there as well. That is possibly her most famous movie.Anyway I have to say I enjoyed this film and there is really not much wrong with it. I especially enjoyed the first 45 minutes because the child actress Tatjana Trieb is very good and the writing is excellent there as well when we get to watch how she constantly interprets between her parents and everybody else or helps her mother in watching old romance movies. I did like the ending from an emotional perspective but the reunion between her and her dad could have been even more effective if they had taken a more subtle approach. Even I was thinking that she finally needs to play during the audition instead of constantly talking to her father and ignoring the professors. There is a very successful French movie named La famille Blier out right now and there are really quite a few parallels between these two films. If you saw this new film give the old one Jenseits der Stille a chance as well. You will most likely not be disappointed. Also it has excellent music. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jenseits de Stille can be understood to belong to the genre of films known as social milieu films or in Germany 'problem films'.  These films function as explorations of certain specific cultures or classes and the intricacies and contradictions therein.  For example a social milieu film might examine working class life as such and in tandem with other films of the sort could create an overall filmic representation of the strife of working class existence.  In the case of Jenseits der Stille the milieu that is examined is the Deaf world specifically in Germany.  By following the coming of age of Lara a hearing child of Deaf parents we are led through one woman's experiences with and in the Deaf world.  That the film is also a touching story of family relations and can be seen as a drama a family movie etc. does not exclude it from also functioning in this realm of 'problem film.'  Rather it can be seen to convey information and insight into a broader concept or community through the experiences and insights of one individual. Lara is constructed as a conflicted character even before she receives the fateful clarinet.  As the hearing daughter of Deaf parents she is often placed in interpreting situations and expected to relay messages that surpass her scope as child.  Instances such as her father's colleague's implication that she tell him of the nonexistent Christmas bonus or her role as interpreter at the bank quickly convey the ways in which she is forced to grow old before her time.  She must live in an adult's world and negotiate that world despite her age.  Her parents are characterized as somewhat aloof of the demands that they make on her and her own isolation is foregrounded.  It is only when her aunt fosters her musical interest that Lara begins to find a sense of herself.  These feelings of isolation difficult communication and difference are expressed mainly through Lara although her parents and extended family exhibit them as well. This film presents a great deal of verifiable information about the Deaf community through Lara and her family.  Many Deaf couples give birth to hearing children and conversely the majority of Deaf people are born to hearing parents.  The Christmas dinner and Martin's painful memories emphasize this occurrence.  In this way without the film being didactic or expository in its conveyance of Deafness hearing viewers are still educated as viewers about the very real situations that many Deaf families must negotiate. Obviously the lexical difference of spoken and signed languages plays a large role in the film as well.  This difference becomes important within the film as hearing viewers are attuned to different ways of seeing.  Within the medium of film this is often the goal of filmmakers to create new ways of viewing of reading images.  When this already visual medium is then used to explore yet another visual medium the Deaf world many doors are opened. An example of this is the intimacy between Kai and Martin evident when they lie in bed together and Martin uses Kai's chest for his signing.  A similar scene occurs in Children of a Lesser God as well and both work to convey the shared space.  A different level of intimacy is expressed because the viewer then considers the act of communication through the body rather than just the mouth.  Once this is understood all movement on the screen has the potential to create atmosphere and convey information that far surpasses what a hearing viewer might normally require of a film. Ultimately this film engages with the social milieu of Deaf communities through both presentation and representation.  That is Deafness is represented and explored diegetically while the medium of the film itself also serves to further explore that realm.  Thus Jenseits der Stille also functions to instrumentalize Deafness for the means of understanding image. This is perhaps a pairing of subject and medium that simply cannot be overlooked.".

The story could have been written on the back of a postage stamp but is credited to have taken FOUR people to concoct. The visuals are totally derivative take Alien Outland bits of Blade Runner shove through blender. The acting is abysmal. Not even McDowell can summon up the effort to be interested in his lines and he can usually be counted on to have some fun with his roles.If you do watch this movie after reading the trashing it gets on the IMDb there are some rewards to be got from it. It's one of those movies that lets you sit there and ask yourself questions like What are the teenage whizz kid navigators actually FOR? All they do is say Go faster! or Go up! I mean if the musclebound exprisoner fighter pilots can't work out that crashing into canyon walls in a speeding helicopter is not a good idea then they are even thicker than they look and boy do they look thick  physically as well as mentally. Where did these guys learn to fly?  The Charles Atlas Fight School of dynamic tension?.As it turns out these guys ARE as thick as two short planks because having been told that their lives are in the hands of their teenage navigators they seem to think it's a good idea to anally rape one of them in the shower. Not clever.Other questions you might like to ask yourself include why ALL the doors in this movie give off huge spurts of steam every time they open or close. In fact why does everything in this movie give off great spurts of steam? Everywhere people go on the mining station steam shoots out at them from walls doors ceilings and floor  even unbelievably the cockpit of a shuttle craft. They have steam lines in the cockpits of shuttle craft? Steam powered spaceships? Wow! Welcome to the future! In fact the only place where there is no steam to be seen is in the kitchens the only place you would EXPECT to see it. It's that kind of dumb stupid movie. There must have been at least 3 guys on set whose only job was to fire off fire extinguishers at random  and stoke the smoke machine. There is an awful lot of smoke in this movie.It also has that standard shot of space ship approaching planet. You know the one. Static peaceful planet swimming in space. Suddenly there is ominous music and from the side of the frame comes a metallic something which just keeps on going and going getting bigger and bigger a vast 3 mile long pile of plastic glued together to look like a spaceship on and on it comes until the glowing bits at the back finally come into shot with a sound cue of jet enginey noises. Finally with this movie I worked out what has always bugged me about that shot. If the engines are blasting away like that it means the the ship is accelerating towards the planet. Surely anything having crossed interstellar space would be DEcelerating as it approached its destination. Standard operating procedure for that would mean that the ship should be approaching the planet arse first with its engines going  unless they were blasting out Suckions an as yet undiscovered form of antiacceleratonic particle. Christ I was bored.If for nothing else I will be grateful for this movie for being so vacant of anything worth watching or caring about that it gave me time to think that one out.Worst Line I got fed up with talking to my French fries.".

And this really is no exception while he gets larger budgets and more attention today he could certainly deliver back then as well. This does have a big name... I mean Alexander Kruemmel that's plenty of letters. Just kidding I'm referring to McDowell of course. The acting ranges though this does manage to make Par appear almost charming. I loved seeing Brian Thompson againtwo appearances in Charmed minor role in The Terminator and he's played Klingons what he may lack in range he attempts to make up for in muscle cool to see even if they gave him unflattering facial hair. The FX are great. Dialog is pretty good humorous and can be fairly sharp. The sets are reminiscent of Alien and quite nice. This has guts. There is commentary on the world. The tension is reasonably effective. Arguably there is not a ton of actionwith that said what there is usually is welldone... then again it's 92 minutes sans credits. There is plenty of strong language disturbing content and a little moderate violence in this. I recommend this to anyone looking for a quick easy to get into cheap scifi Bmovie. 510".

Here is my review.Moon 44 is actually a good scifi flick. I won't go into the story because you can get that elsewhere on this site. The movie struck me as a cross between Outland and Brubaker. I think what also struck me is how impressive the production design was. I really felt I was watching a mining station on some far off celestial body. The acting was good and especially from Michael Pare and Brian Thompson. It's a good scifi film that is definitely worth a look!".

You cannot have a SciFi movie without cinematography.I consider the cinematography above average in Moon 44 because the director even though on a short budget was able to create some neat scenery of futuristic earth space ships fighter planes the base itself and etc. This really caught my eye and made me feel like I was in the movie like I was Felix Stone Michael Pare.Now I though this may sound crazy but I have to be able to get into a movie to enjoy it like I enjoyed Blade Runner because of the cinematography. I felt like I was in the movie in Neo Angeles 2019 AD and as the main character. Same thing went for Star Wars and so on.......Even though Moon 44 was done in a foreign country and on a tight budget I consider Moon 44 to be one of my SciFi favorite flicks.

Because everyone involved is a potential suspect it makes the cop's job more difficult. The movie is filled to the brim with bad acting lame dialogue dry characters cheesy special effects even for a 1990 film it looked more like something from 1980 and there is even some homoeroticism thrown in for good measure.

Additionally the company send an internal affairs cop up there as an excon to find out exactly where some missing shuttles have gone up to and therefore Moon 44 begins it's slow soap opera like plot.Your excons including Brian Thompson of Hired to Kill don't sit well with the geeks including that guy from 976EVIL and head of the station Malcolm McDowell of Cyborg 3 The Recycler tries to mediate between them both. Our hero Stone seems to upset just about everybody and is first up to man the defence system which seems to be a toy helicopter driven by Stone with remote help from his allotted geek. This is even more boring than it sounds as we're subjected to really bad special effects involving toy helicopters flying around a canyon and not much else. I'm not one to rag on bad special effects either but there's really not much else going on except for the drama.You've got the cons up against the geeks not helped by one con botting one of the geeks against his will. You've got Brian Thompson versus Stone and Stone versus Maclom McDowell and some Sargeant guy. Add to this that everything looks like the director really really likes Ridley Scott and James Cameron the interiors are all Blade Runner and Alien like complete with evil corporation and you've got a film with plenty of set up and no pay off. The bad guys when they do appear kind of look like Johnny Five if he'd turn to crack cocaine and flew off into space. Moon 44 is a drag from start to finish and I was just waiting for it end which it thankfully does without a single surprise. I can take bad effects and cheap sets but the one thing I do not like in a film is nothing happening. For McDowell fans he's here for about five minutes total and doesn't do much. This film chugs off donkeys for cash. Behind a skip in Shipley. I've just realised that this was directed by a hot shot director! Well the guy that gave us Independence Day at least.".

Neither is it when there's just the bald title printed on the disc and there's no additional material. Still we live in hope...Well what you see is what you get. Don't be fooled by Roland Emerich's name amongst the credits this is truly a Cmovie.The plot goes something like this. Uninhabited worlds in deep space are being mined for minerals. The stuff is then taken away in shuttlecraft to planetary processing plants. This makes the shuttles extremely valuable and somebody is hijacking them. An undercover cop is sent to find out what's going on by joining a prisonteam at the next world most likely to be targeted. That's 'Moon 44'.Like so many of these cheap and not so cheap movies money seems to have been saved by not employing a lighting facility. And everything happens in an often barely discernible gloom  even indoors. The twilight never lifts from the beginning to end making for an extremely dull and claustrophobic experience. Actors are almost all B or Clist and they are doomed to struggle with a script that might be politely described as lacking intelligence. Even the 'big catch' of an ageing Malcolm Macdowell from 'A Clockwork Orange' fame fails to illuminate either the set or the script.There's so many silly things going on as regards the plot that it sometimes appears as if children had drafted it. Macdowell's the bossbaddie on the moon but we never know who he's working for. It's clearly not himself as there's a big battlecruiser turns up to launch an attack on the moon. Where from? Who's in it? Where does it go? Who cares  clearly not Mr Emmerich. Criminals are sent as defence pilots. They fly helicopters along smokefilled canyons. Why? why not gain altitude and be a helluva lot safer? Weapons systems are actually more primitive than those available today. Apaches attack helicopters employ 8 'Hellfire' guided missiles with a range of up to 5 miles. These defenders didn't engage the enemy within 1000 yards.On top of all this there's a testosteronesodden biline about these violent scumoftheearth criminals who are yet still exceptional enough to be qualified helicopter pilots that makes 'Shawshank' seem like a holidaycamp. This is needlessly emphasised by a showerscene rape. Ironically the rapist chooses to rape his landbased navigator the one man upon whom he will have to depend in the foggy valleys and it never occurs to him that this geezer might take revenge. Yes.Bought as a piece of cheap Fridaynight throwaway hokum it was in the charity shop by Saturday afternoon.".

Devlin though has no producing credits here he plays future computer nerd Terry the main assistant to the film's hero Michael Pare. But Emmerich and Devlin must have hit it off and they marched on to several space themed epics.And while there is some film history emerging the film is a great treat. It's made sweet and tasty by an interesting story of greed on a grand scale involving planets and resources with some subtle commentary on prison abuse.There are comic book bad guys and Runyonesque inhabitants but this is some mining planet in some BFE solar system and it needs a little character color to counter the bleak dark existence portrayed on Moon 44.The story continually moves forward and will hold you to the screen for the entire length. The sets are great and used well. And the acting. For the story fantastic.Michael Pare always with that bitter frown frozen to his face is perfect as a disdainful and resentful undercover agent working with convicts. Where is he now? We could use his hero style on today's screen.The surprise is Dean Devlin as the aforementioned computer nerd of the outer solar systems. He plays the role with sarcasm and dry wit to a tee perfect for a nerd in the universe.All the supporting cast is perfect and another surprise is the score it hits and fits and I can't see how anyone wouldn't like this one on a late night. And just for fun see how many cast you can find who played in later EmmerichDevlin films. Enjoy.".

It's made sweet and tasty by an interesting story of greed on a grand scale involving planets and resources with some subtle commentary on prison abuse.There are comic book bad guys and Runyonesque inhabitants but this is some mining planet in some BFE solar system and it needs a little character color to counter the bleak dark existence portrayed on Moon 44.The story continually moves forward and will hold you to the screen for the entire length. The sets are great and used well. And the acting. For the story fantastic.Michael Pare always with that bitter frown frozen to his face is perfect as a disdainful and resentful undercover agent working with convicts. Where is he now? We could use his hero style on today's screen.The surprise is Dean Devlin as the aforementioned computer nerd of the outer solar systems. He plays the role with sarcasm and dry wit to a tee perfect for a nerd in the universe.All the supporting cast is perfect and another surprise is the score it hits and fits and I can't see how anyone wouldn't like this one on a late night. And just for fun see how many cast you can find who played in later EmmerichDevlin films. Enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Revanche. Written and directed by Gtz Spielmann. The look of the film is thoroughly authentic and the Austrian milieu very convincing. Johannes Krisch is fabulous as Alex the peasant brute with a broken heart and an uncontrollable sex drive. Andreas Lust is very good as well as Robert Alex's police officer nemesis. Caught in the middle is Ursula Strauss who plays Susanne Robert's wife.The story starts out in the squalid world of Viennese prostitution at a tacky brothel on the periphery. Alex works for the local prostitution boss and he has fallen in love with one of the Eastern European streetwalkers Tamara played by Irina Potapenko. When Tamara is recruited for a promotion to callgirl she decides instead to run away with Alex. Here the story moves to the countryside where Alex's father lives in a miserable cabin on the outskirts of modern Austrian society. But if the surrounding become simpler the interaction does not as Alex becomes entangled in the lives of the small town police office and his wife.The film is satisfying on many levels. It is a veritable ethnographic study of the interface between postmodern Central European human trafficking and preindustrial Austrian bauern culture. Alex and his father speak to each other in what has been described to me as a rich and authentic peasant dialect rarely represented in film. Not only does it look and sound authentic but the story makes perfect sense too. And that's saying a lot for a European written and directed by film where narrative logic doesn't often get more than cursory consideration. The name revanche has a double meaning in German both revenge and a return match or a second chance and it seems that both of these ideas are being developed throughout the story as characters juggle their need to get even with their desire to secure their own futures. The tragic consequences of their every action lead them further and further down a path not of their own choosing. We get a taste of this feeling of predestination when the camera stops still at a forested point in the road a spot that will take on fatal significance later in the story. Yet if fate controls the characters' destinies it is the strength of willpower that will decide who survives and who will fade into insignificance.Revanche did not get nominated in any categories for the EFA awards in 2008 but it is Austria's entry for the Oscar Foreign Language film nomination in 2009.".

	schema:reviewBody "Revanche is a deliciously gritty neonoir full of surprises so many important ones that it is better not to go into too much detail about the plot. But as important as its clever narrative to the success of the film is its atmosphere which has a contemporary and positively ethnographic precision but builds on the traditional contrast between city and country. And there is another contrast between two couples an excon and a whore and a cop and his wife who works in a shop. The first couple is on the edge of Vienna and the other lives in the country but circumstances bring them together.The action begins with Alex Johannes Krisch and his Ukrainian prostitute girlfriend Tamara Irina Potapenko in Vienna. Spielmann rubs our noses in the scummy world of a whorehouse on the outskirts of town with its Eastern European sex workers and its slimy fat cat boss Konecny Hanno Poeschl for whom Alex works. Tamara speaks pidgin German but she's not dumb and when the boss offers her an upgrade to call girl in a flat she knows it's trouble and resolves to run away with Alex. She owes a big debt and he cooks up the robbery scheme so she can pay it off. He says it's going to work because he has a plan. He says that so many times we become certain it won't. But despite Rothkopf's tidy summary the outcome isn't so simple. The bank robbery isn't botched but it goes badly for Alex and also for a cop named Robert When people go to the city they become either arrogant or scoundrels. He's a scoundrel. So says Hauser Johannes Thanheiser Alex's grandfather an old man failing in health who lives on a small farm. He exists outside the modern world almost completely though he does drive a little old VW Bug. People don't think it's safe for him to still be on the road. When Alex goes to stay with Hauser it seems almost that he's fallen off the map that includes the prostitutes and the scummy underside of Viennese life.Alongside Alex's story is that of the policeman Robert who seems unable to give his wife Susanne Ursula Strauss a baby too bad because they both want one. They live in a nice modern house they've built with help from friends somewhere not too far from Alex's grandfather. In fact Susanne knows him.I'll give you one thing you really are a hell of a worker Hauser tells Alex. Alex hides out after the robbery by staying with his grandfather and cutting up a mountain of firewood. The work instinct unites the two men in spite of everything and Hauser's declining health gives Alex another reason for staying around. He also has revenge in his heart for what's happened to Tamara. But things get complicated people talkand that changes.Revanche builds on coincidence but in ways so rooted in gritty milieu and so gnarly and unexpected they really seem to emerge not from a writer's brainstorm but the downright mind boggling absurdity of real life. The word revanche can mean in German not only revenge but also rematchin short a second chance. If Alex reaches a point where he can work out his salvation with diligence it's much more quirky circumstance that gets him there than any pat change of heart. The satisfaction this film provides is delayed. It comes in the way it simmers and ripens after a viewing.Martin Gschlacht did the excellent cinematography. The acting is strong and convincing including that of the 83yearold Thanheiser. With close to a dozen films under his belt Spielmann who also wrote the screenplay is clearly at the top of his game. It will be a real shame if US theatrical audiences don't get to see Revanche on the big screen.Revanche won the Europa Cinemas Label for best European film at the Berlinale and has other awards including two FIPRESCIs. It was a nominee for the Best Foreign Oscar. Shown as part of the Film Comment Selects series at Lincoln Center New York February 2009. Revanche . . .has just been picked up for North American theatrical and home video distribution by art film distributor Janus and the Criterion Collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the first half hour of Revanche I expected something quite different than how it turned out. Initially the movie reminded me of a Fassbinder film with corrupt and unsavory characters scheming against each other. The scheming ends with a decision by Alex Johannes Krisch a middleaged janitor and gofor at a Vienna brothel to rob a bank in order to pay off the debts of his girlfriend Tamara Irina Potapenko a Ukrainian prostitute. The robbery goes bad in an unexpected way with a policeman shooting at the escape vehicle and accidentally killing Tamara. Alex drives the car to the countryside and abandons it near his grandfather's old and dilapidated farm.Alex moves in with his grandfather Johannes Thanheiser and spends his days cutting and chopping wood for fuel. Repeatedly we see his powerful arms pushing logs against a large circular power saw. His becomes obsessed with work in an effort to overcome the overwhelming anguish and guilt he feels as a result of his girlfriend's death. Alex tries to become an entirely physical person and is sullen and inarticulate in his dealings with others. Other people however refuse to go away. A married woman who lives nearby Susanne Ursula Strauss visits the grandfather encourages him to play his accordion and accompanies him to church.Now things begin to fall into place from the perspective of the viewer though not initially from that of the characters. To some extent director Gtz Spielman's approach is similar to that of Atom Egoyan's. Susanne's husband Robert Andreas Lust is the policeman who accidentally shot and killed Tamara. He and Susanne want to have children but she is unable to get pregnant due to his limitations. He is as distraught as Alex over Tamara's death and does not understand how he could have shot through the car's rear window when he aimed at the tires.Without wanting to be Alex is brought into contact with both Susanne and Robert and gradually reveals his situation to them. Susanne invites him over for sex when her husband is at work perhaps hoping that his physical vitality will enable her to conceive. There are explicit though not pornographic sex scenes both between Alex and Susanne on a kitchen table and earlier in the film and more sweetly between Alex and Tamara in a shower. Alex also encounters Robert as he goes for his daily run and realizes that the policeman is as upset as he is about Tamara's death. Susanne gets pregnant from Alex and swears him to secrecy. Life goes on. Revanche assumes it meaning in German of second chance as well as revenge.This summary does not do justice to the consistent excellence of the film's acting and direction. All of the roles are played in ways that are both believable and continuously revealing. Although there are superficial similarities between Revanche and noir films of the forties and fifties their points of view are very different. In Revanche we see and feel the devastating impact a killing has on essentially decent people.".

The solution to their worries is a bank heist during which Tamara dies after being fatally wounded by a stray bullet from police officer Robert Andreas Lust.

You don't really think about these reservations as you are watching Austrian directorproducerscreenwriter Gtz Spielmann's quietly fascinating film Revanche. The oneword title in French translates to 'revenge.' But this is hardly your usual action thriller though there are anxious suspenseful moments and bank heist involved.Love the film. The storyline and the characters the occurrence of incidents all seem to follow natural development  their own course by design 'divine'. So few dialog and no music score at all just birds chirping sound of raindrops everything naturally delivered. Well the only human music being the accordion played by grandfather Hausner. One man's revengeful thoughts or action just might turn out to be blossoming into another's hopeful joyous beginning of future. Two men hung up on one woman dead both men acquiesced by one woman alive whose optimistic intuition and trustful understanding may bring full circle to the string of events perhaps liken to how nature takes care of itself? The engaging 'fate' element is somehow unbeknown to all parties involved while the audience might marvel at the clues possibly unaware also.As I was quietly watching the film following the story progression I said to myself at one point I hope this is where the film ends and go on no more. The next second the screen did fade to black and the end credits start rolling without any music other than birds chirping can be heard and later on sound of raindrops falling for the rest of the credit roll.What a script! So perfectly directed and such steady subtle performances from the ensemble cast of characters. The four main roles are so solidly portrayed Alex by Johannes Krisch and his girlfriend Tamara by Irina Potapenko Robert the policeman by Andreas Lust and his wife Susanne by Ursula Strauss. A satisfying movie experience it is. I actually appreciate this film more than the winning 2008 Oscar foreign film Departures  well it's different in story layers and 'Departures' encompasses many aspects while Revanche also has its layers of emotions psychological human nature perspectives is delivered 'clean' and focused ever so naturally acceptable of human foibles vulnerability and one woman's life force. A very humanistic film  a MUST SEE.".

Austrian's  official submission for the foreign language category in the 2009  Academy Awards is likely to this reviewer to get the nomination.  Following the lives of two couples a prostitute and a thug a cop and  his wife tragic circumstances converge their lives when a bank robbery  goes awry. Featuring a stand out performance by Tommy Lee Jones  lookalike Johannes Krisch as the thug Alex the man creates tension  when out of frame in the nick of shadows and in front of the camera.  His character of Alex is a tortured soul that the audience is never  sure off his intentions or actions are hidden behind a mask of  serenity. Not satisfied with being a replica of Jones he also gives a  very Tommy Lee Jones nofrills turn that keeps the movie afloat.  Director Gotz Spielman creates tension using sound and extremely  detailed camera setups. Not showoffy in anyway but including two long  one take shots he also uses his DP to infuse the screen with pale and  desaturated color tones for nights scenes and natural lighting for  daylight scenes all used to provide a flat lan on the screen. It  effectively supports the vibe of these revenge melodrama.   What could be hammy in another director's hands becomes poetry in his.  The sound of the ax smashing a block of wood never seemed more  intimate. When a director uses it in such a way that the viewer feels  inside the innards of a man's soul you know the director knows his  stuff.   Intricate and detailed it is consummate from top to bottom. If there  is any qualms with the movie it is in the character of Robert the cop  played by Andreas Lust. His character arc is supposed to mirror Alex  but he never earns the audience's sympathy the way Alex does yet his  story is geared toward such a response. The character is slightly  underwritten and the actor never engages the character the way Johannes  does.  Playing against our expectations to create an ending reminiscent of  Greek tragedy it is a worthy movie experience and the best movie I've  seen in 2008 along with Mike Leigh's Happy go lucky.".

Despite it's too long beginning the film never really lags and keeps your interest with it's slick story from Gschlacht and wonderful cinematography from Gotz Spielmann and a great production design by Maria Gruber. Alex Johannes Krisch has fallen in love with Ukrainian immigrant Tamara Irina Potapenko who works in a brothel where Alex does odd jobs for the underworld brothel owner. In a plan to get out of debt and the control of the brothel Alex hatches a plot to rob a bank in his grandfather's rural village. Alex is forced to assimilate into the village when his plan is botched. With Ursala Strauss as the shopkeeper Susanne and Andreas Lust as her policeman husband Robert this is a good film but would carry a strong R rating for nudity and sexual situations. Fortunately violence is kept at a minimum. I believe this is Austria's official submission to the Oscars for Best Foreign Language film. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend it.".

The ending seemed a bit abrupt but then I thought no this is exactly where it should end because it puts a whole new movie in your head.Other writers here call it neonoir. I think that's a mistake. This is a folk tale about peasants who happen in the beginning to be modernday gangsters pimps and whores in Austria. The beginning of the movie gives absolutely no clue where it is headed. Looks like a crime thriller. Brothel worker dude and his Ukranian prostitute girlfriend plot a bank robbery.The bank robbery is in a rural village and it goes bad in an unexpected way. Robber ends up in village living with his peasant grandfather. He is griefstricken and desperately wants revenge. Revenge as it turns out is no further than a stroll through the woods.The whole plot depends on what seems to be a huge geographic coincidence. So what? It has mythic elements and myths never bothered with the importance of coincidence.Direction  Gotz Spielmann who I understand is a stage director is exceedingly austere. He doesn't like to move the camera. Most scenes are fixed medium shots where characters move around inside a static frame. Every frame counts. American viewers who want fastmoving thrillerstyle camera work will be completely frustrated. Again this is a slowmoving characterdriven folk tale about the outcome of a botched bank robbery if you can imagine such a thing.Acting  Johannes Krisch as Alex is spellbinding. The whole movie depends on his face. What we see on his face drives the whole plot. Kudos also to the rest of the cast.As an American I can recognize that this movie taps into Austrian culture in a way I cannot totally grasp. Peasant culture and probably dialect is doubtless important in ways I cannot fully understand. Are apples a symbol of fertility? Seems to be.I love crime thrillers and can see that the Europeans are taking it in new directions. This is one of the best I've ever seen.".

Spielmann's direction is assured and marked by visual elegance. He doesn't use any flashy camerawork but manages to infuse every frame with a sense of foreboding. The pacing is deliberate about 10 minutes of screen time is devoted to watching Krisch cut wood but it never drags. The Austrian countryside is beautifully shot in this lowkey and rewarding film.".

	schema:headline " Art Imitating Life With Frankness And Honesty";
	schema:reviewBody "When his girlfriend is murdered during a bank robbery escape attempt former convict Alex vows to take revenge on the man who pulled the trigger. Vengeance seems to make perfect sense until he meets his target facetoface.'Revanche' is a film that holds its cards close to its chest. Just when you think you have the story pinned in the first halfhour all hell breaks loose and the film takes a wholly unexpected turn. It is a film that not only challenges you to predict what comes next but one that forces you to decide whether revenge ever makes sense to confront feelings of anguish and make decisions you can live with. In the character of Alex we have a man used to dealing with the rougher side of humanity which has hardened him in order to survive. The loss of his girlfriend Tamara robs him of the only time he allows himself to be someone else at peace with the world. Into this world comes the unassuming presence of Robert a policeman committed to serving the public yet whom has never faced the hardest part of the job taking a life. When Robert is confronted by this reality it is then that we truly learn who he is. This ultimately is what the film is about  throwing ordinary people into life's darkest waters and seeing whether or not they will swim back into the light. Writer and director Gtz Spielmann presents the viewer with a very compelling drama which through its cast of identifiably real characters engages the viewer throughout. The lines may be drawn between those who feel wronged but at no time is it ever easy for the viewer to take sides.This perhaps explains the film's pacing and choice of photography. The basic storyline as described could very easily apply to a fastpaced Hollywood blockbuster trading humanity and intelligence for clich and car chases. Yet in the truer world of grocery shopping and household chores moments of high drama are spaced apart by long periods of calm inactivity leaving people to brood into the small hours over the choices they have made  the perfect environment within which feelings of revenge and misery can blossom. 'Revanche' is paced in such a way with the principal characters having to tend to family and the ordinary demands of life while barely holding themselves together over the losses they have suffered. Yet these are their only opportunities to heal and come to terms with their pain. Spielmann accentuates these sequences with often picturesque long shots within which silence reigns and the magnitude of the suffering seems to pale into comparison with the enormity of the surrounding world.Johannes Krisch who some IMDb readers have intriguingly compared to Robert Carlysle is wellcast as the hardened Alex. He not only looks the part but conveys just the right mix of softness within a wary battleworn shell. Andreas Lust as Robert expertly portrays the policeman whose life collapses beneath him propelling him into a world of anguish and selfdoubt. Credit also goes to Johannes Thanheiser as Alex's grandfather a man for whom life is much the same each day yet this is no reason to complain and Ursula Strauss as Susanne who as Robert's wife must balance her role as supporter in difficult times with her needs as a woman.Ultimately the film leaves the viewer to tie up the loose ends inviting comment on the drama that has unfolded. This is definitely a strong effort from all concerned and a very mature approach to what easily could have been a simplistic action snuff piece. It's art imitating life with frankness and honesty and worthwhile viewing. Actual rating 7 12 stars.".

	schema:headline " Writerdirector's moral relativism dilutes engaging look at Austrian underworld";
	schema:reviewBody "The most striking thing about 'Revanche' is that the first half is so completely different than the second half. The story is set in modernday Austria where the protagonist Alex is working maintenance in a brothel and is in a relationship with Tamara one of the prostitutes there who hails from Ukraine. The opening scene between the 'couple' features a somewhat explicit sexual encounter there are other such steamy sexual encounters later on in the film. Be forewarnedthere are no subtitles in the first two minutes of the film as Tamara is presumably speaking in her native Ukrainian and we're not supposed to understand what she's saying.Up to the midpoint of the film we're treated to a gritty behindthescenes look at the Austrian underworld. Tamara owes her boss Konecny 30000 presumably for arranging her passage to Austria. Tamara is Konecny's 'favorite' at the brothel and wants her to move into one of his own apartments where she can service more upperclass VIP customers. Meanwhile Alex dreams of buying into a pal's business but is significantly short of the 80000 needed as a startup cost. When one of the customers roughs up Tamara Alex intercedes and beats the man up. Realizing his days are numbered at the brothel he spirits Tamara out of he house of ill repute to a seedy hotel where he decides his only solution to the financial mess they're both in is to rob a bank.The midpoint of the film is perhaps the strongest. Alex successfully sticks up the bank but a police officer Robert just happens to come along and questions Tamara who's sitting in the getaway car. When Alex returns to the car and sees Robert he pulls out his unloaded firearm and has the officer lie down on the ground. As Alex drives away with Tamara in the passenger seat Robert violates police procedures and fires at the wheels of the car unfortunately his aim isn't very good and Tamara is hit by one of the bullets and is killed. Robert leaves Tamara's body inside the car and abandons it in a forest.The second half of the movie is much more slowpaced than the first. After Alex takes refuge at grandfather Hausner's farm he settles in performing various chores for the sickly old codger. He steams inside over Tamara's death and blames it on Robert. There are way too many repetitious scenes of Alex chopping wood symbolizing his pentup rage. Coincidentally Robert's wife Susanne a cashier at the local supermarket has befriended Alex's grandfather and often comes over to keep him company. Alex is extremely cold to Susanne since she happens to be married to the man who killed his girlfriend. Susanne has had a recent miscarriage and has been having trouble getting pregnant perhaps this is one factor why she decides to have an affair with Alex. Another may be that she is attracted to 'bad boys'. The climax of the film isn't very exciting but it's a relief. Alex learns that Robert takes a jog in the woods every morning and plans to shoot him. One day he aims his gun at Robert but presumably decides to talk to him first. When they do have their conversation he realizes that Robert is extremely remorseful concerning what happened it should be noted also that Robert was suspended by the police force as 'unfit for duty' and ordered to see a psychologist. Robert's parting words in which he asks why the bank robber decided to involve his girlfriend in the heist makes Alex realize that it was he who really was responsible for his girlfriend's death. He redeems himself by throwing his gun into the lake and promises Susanne that he'll never tell anyone of their affair. In turn he confesses to Susanne that he was the bank robber and presumably their secret is safe with him.While I was disappointed that Revanche did not have a slambang twist ending I was relieved at the same time that Alex did not resort to the ugly act of killing Robert. Certainly a story about an immoral person taking responsibility for his actions and thus redeeming himself in the end is admirable. However directorwriter Gotz Spiellman engages in a strategy of moral relativism to tell his story. In effect Spiellman is saying that 'we're all human and we all make mistakes'. In Spiellman's world people make bad decisions Alex concocts the robbery Tamara goes along with it Robert fires at a vehicle moving away from him in violation of procedures and Susanne commits adultery by having an affair. But Alex's actions are placed on the same level as Susanne despite the fact that he's committed a crime. Even though he robbed the bank without his gun being loaded he still terrorized the bank teller and the customers inside the bank. He should be held accountable but the mere act of showing remorse is enough for Spiellman to forgive him. I am however not as forgiving of the character as its creator. Spiellman 'forgives' Susanne too for her 'transgression' and rewards her by having her get pregnant. But again Susanne's indiscretion is just thatan indiscretion! Alex's 'misstep' is a crime! A better ending would have been to have Alex turn himself in.There are some excellent performances here particularly Ursula Strauss as Susanne whose misguided attraction should be a cautionary tale to all those women attracted to 'bad boys'. If you're willing to put up with the slowpaced second half Revanche is well worth watching. On the other hand don't expect a masterpiece. Revanche gets a little too cozy with the idea that redemption is for just about everybody. Redemption is only acceptable when it's coupled with both remorse and accountability. By giving Alex a 'free pass' at the denouement the film's scenarist misses an opportunity to make a true and impassioned moral stand.".

I don't recall there being any score either so this is quite unusual. The colors are so perfect every shot a painting. And sound I recall the wind over the pond. Powerful emotional resonance.Thanks again.";

That snap judgment is probably as far as you would take it or about as far as you could take it with limited facts. But as this movie illustrates the details of such an incident and its aftermath can be surprising and interesting.The movie starts with Alex and Tamara working in a seedy Vienna brothel. Tamara is an attractive Ukranian and it is easy to see why Alex has fallen for her. The realistic behind the scenes look at the brothel run by a tyrannical pimp was enough for me to understand why Alex and Tamara were desperate to escape and when Alex proposed the bank robbery I could well understand his motivation since it was not going to be easy for either Alex or Tamara to get out of the rather sorry state they were in.What sets this thriller apart is that we get to know all of the main playersAlex Tamara the policeman and his wife and Alex's grandfather as believable people. Their interactions are well motivated and understandable.As the title suggests the movie has important things to say about revenge about snap judgments and false assumptions.I found some of the filming techniques interesting. Early on the camera lingered on certain scenes like a path into some trees or an alleyway that left me puzzled.

I never would have thought I would see this 2009 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language film on a plane.Revanche is an Austrian movie though it could have been made anywhere else. I did not really see any scenery that made it look like Austria at all. It is basically about four people from the city an Ukranian prostitute Tamara Irina Potapenko and her thug boyfriend Alex Johannes Krische and in the countryside an honest cop Robert Andreas Lust and his friendly wife Susanne Ursula Strauss. Unusual circumstances intertwine and complicate the lives of these two couples in crime death guilt and as the title says revenge.The best aspect of this film is its very welldeveloped script at least for the last twothirds of the film. The first onethird building up the relationship of Tamara and Alex was too long and slow and even unnecessary. But when the time comes that Alex hatches his scheme to get the money they need to make their getaway the film gains its necessary accelerating momentum to the very end.For all its merits as a drama this may not be a film for everyone. There are some graphic scenes and dialog as expected with a film that dealt with prostitutes. There are many slow repetitive scenes of Alex and his ailing dad with so many scenes of Alex chopping wood or the dad playing the accordion which can test your patience to watch. As is typical with a lot of European films the actual resolution of the entire problematic situation is left to the audience but I felt that it was still the best way to end.".

Some scenes are pretty brutal but really worth watching to say the least. The director Zhang YiMou told a powerful touching and beautiful story while delivering stunning visual effects as always. All actors from different countries did an amazing job in making so many strong characters in 3 languages not just the American 'priest' but also those prostitutes the boy George all the children Japanese officers and the Chinese 'traitor'. Good movie is like a mirror some people might get upset watching it while others see love for others respect for life and the human spirit of fighting for peace out of tragedy. Each audience's reaction more or less reflects hisher personal value. The storytelling is objective so you can judge for yourself. In front of a masterpiece like this people who ranked it very low deliberately because of stereotypes against China or whatever twisted reason I KNOW YOU EXSIT ON THIS SITE you need to sit down and think what's wrong with yourself no matter how openminded you claim you are. Some say it is a propaganda production. I have to disagree here. Almost everything in this movie is based on real history including how Japanese tortured Chinese war victims how prostitutes stood up to protect other women during the Rape of NanJing as well as how some westerners resided in China at the time helped local Chinese. Anyone who can pick up a few books or do a bit of research on internet knows it. English is not my mother language so I can't write an review with big words like those professional critics do. However this is the first time I feel so moved by a movie that I'd write an English review online to recommend it to viewers outside of China. Simply too good to miss. If any Chinese simply walked out of the cinema cursing Japanese I'd say the movie failed big time. However both times I saw people left quietly some still sobbing and heard them saying how lucky they are to be born in this era and how precious peace is. For that reason I applaud this film. It is what it is. Horrible things happened in history. Hate and anger won't do any good today. Make peace with yourself and move on. Just like what George said in the movie life is precious it is not ours to throw away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zhang Yimou has crafted a beautifully shot and compelling story set inside horrific events. About all I knew of this movie was it was set in 1937 China and starred Christian Bale. Not knowing much allowed me to be completely open to the journey of the characters. This is an emotionally powerful story about people caught in circumstances for which there seems no hope of survival. The Japanese soldiers are shown as barbaric but we do meet an officer who attempts to remain honorable though he must do his duty to his superiors. The violence in the movie is brutal but not graphic or gratuitous. The choices and sacrifices made by the characters never seemed contrived. The arc of Christian Bale's character may seem 'predictable' but it is never false or 'convenient' to the story. All actors are excellent. Because they're foreign to me I had no idea who they are or their other work. At the screening I attended we were introduced to Ni Ni who said this was her first film. She is both beautiful and compelling. I wish her a long career. Yimou through his daughter told us about his journey to make this movie  based on a novel based on real events. He has told an amazing story that will stay with me for a long time.".

This movie comes from a huge and heavy background. My history teacher cried sadly when she gave me the class about the darkest time in Chinese Modern history. For those who give cold comments about the movie I confessed I tried hard to hold my tears next to my wife in the movie theatre.But the moment little George said there is no other way! My salty tears kept rolling out! I hope people respect those victims and stopped saying this piece of history does not exist. There were brave American medicals and priests who risked their lives at that time to keep journals and photo about the crimes.Apart from prejudice I consider that this movie is very controlled in a lot of ways. For many educated Chinese we all read a lot of documentsshort films and photo that were amazingly made by the Japanese soldiers themselves for showing off and promoting a sense of fears at that time. I am glad such scene is made in a very controlled yet enlighting manner. For a Chinese viewer the burden to watch this movie is extremely heavy especially before X'mas. I am glad this story is told in a small angle that reflects part of the whole picture. Apart from the history it is a good film. Those characters are not as complex as the original novel. But as a whole it shows how a normalpowerless person could choose to do in one of the worst moments in modern history. No one is born hero. In war timelife may not worth more than a bullet regardless which social class one is in. This movie tells a good story and I appreciate the making of such a touching film. One buddhish came to my mind a split of thoughts determine heaven or hell.  I would give a 8 because the film is solid and touching. However it certainly is not an entertaining film for X'mas! I also appreciate those Japanese actors in the film. I knew from TV that they returned to the film making without delay after taking care of their families in earthquake!".

Sounds funny at beginning  but it's more easy to bring audience into the story with characters . Zhangyimou's movie are famous for bright colors and nice view since he use to be cameraman. But this movie is so much more than the visual! Color still pretty though the paper shop those QiPao girls makeup  everything is pretty . I guess to ruin the beautiful things defines the tragedy. My friend who watched it before told me do not watched it in the morning  because it will upset you whole day. So I went to cinema in the afternoon and I could sleep until 5 am this morning.

	schema:reviewBody "Watched this movie last night in a packed Beijing cinema on its opening night. First off I would like to say that Christian Bale traces perfectly the path of enlightenment that follows WildWest style bandit obsessed with money becoming priest and fatherfigure in all but religious training. The film is in roughly 50 English 35 Chinese and 15 Japanese so there is a real assimilation of different languages and cultures coming together. However this unfortunately leads to some moments which seem disconcertingly humorous. For example there is one point where a Japanese general confesses to priestfigure Bale that he likes music the triviality of such statement in the midst of massmurder seems absurd enough but it is also delivered in a deadpan way with broken English. I could not help but burst out laughing even though none of the Chinese in the cinema saw any form of humour in it. Indeed I think that as a Westerner watching this film my emotional response is not as visceral as it would be to a Chinese person. That is only natural but it leads to a completely different interpretation of the movie. Some of the murder scenes are brutally horrific to a Chinese person so much so that the wonderful filmography which permeates throughout the movie may not be fully appreciated. The hues are brown and green earthy rugged and militaristic for the most part. Yet there are occasionally beautiful trims of colour the church's stainedglass window the clothes on the washing line left out to dry. A sign no doubt of the beauty of humanity in the midst of dreadful war. It has been suggested this movie is propaganda. I don't know if I entirely agree with that. There is no positive way to spin what was a shameful event in Japan's history and for what it's worth I think that Zhang Yimou delineates well the soldiers occasional insecurity homesickness and humanisation brought on by paranoia and pressure from above. A movie wellworth watching and which I would like to watch for a second time to re establish which moment are intentionally humorous which moments are unintentionally humorous and which moments are tragic. Kudos for Zhang Yimou for tackling such a visited topic That of the Nanjing massacre which a freshness and even more kudos to Christian Bale for stepping up to the plate and giving in a great performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watched The flowers of war on Dec 19 2011 the 2nd day this film was released in mainland China. The movie theater is fully packed. This is the best film directed by Zhang Yimou after Hero in 2002. This is not a surprise because in my opinion all his films after Hero have very awfulterrible screen scripts while this one is based on a well composed novel. The story is about how a dozen of prostitutes saved girl students from uncivilized Japanese soldiers during the NanjingNanking massacre period starting from Dec. 13 1937 lasted for two weeks 300000 murdered 80000 raped. To Chinese this is the saddest and most humiliated moment in the 20th century. The script is not based on true stories painfully the true stories are much worse because there wasn't a savior there's only constant desperation. The characters themselves are well described. The logic flow and mentality transition in this film are not delineated very well. I still gave it 8 out 10 because I think it's due to the limitation of the film's length. As always Mr. Bale is good at acting in this film but definitely not his best character such as those in American Psycho or The Prestige. The two leading actresses are both new face. They'll become very famous in China after this film but I don't think their performances are as impressive as Gong Li who collaborated with Zhang Yimou in many of his early works. Last but not the least there is a 1minute romance scene which I think is the worst part in this film because under such a tragic circumstance it's very unnatural to practice love and it dampens the character buildup in many ways.".

People were in hiding from the Japanese soldiers and here were two groups of people a group of school girls and a group of prostitutes vying for a safe hiding place when they were found by the Japanese invaders it's death that awaits them... One wonders why they had to do this? Why? because there was a war! Then why did Japan start the war? For what? This film made me think. It's obvious starting war is a shortcut to the destruction of humanity. The Japanese government has been denying there were 300000 people killed during the Nanking massacre well  they are not alone similarly there are also those of holocaust denial. With that as a contemporary reality it is a right thing to do to be reminded of this event with movies like this one the Flowers of War so that we could do all we can to prevent another war from coming.".

	schema:headline " Quietly stirring and immensely poignant drama of unlikely heroism and selfsacrificial love";
	schema:reviewBody "Because foreign commentators have not accorded the appropriate significance to the subject of the Japanese occupation of Nanking there is a certain amount of righteous indignation whenever it is raised amongst the Chinese whose ancestors had suffered at the hands of the Nippon invaders way back in 1937. It is therefore quite impossible to expect objectivity from any Chinese treatment on the subject even if it is from internationally acclaimed director and the onceinfant terrible of Chinese cinema Zhang Yimou so the best one can hope for is subtlety with Lu Chuan's earlier box office hit 'City of Life and Death' being an excellent example. Fortunately therefore though Zhang Yimou's take begins on an overtly jingoistic slant it eventually settles for a nuanced approach that exudes the very humanity at the heart of Yan Geling's story becoming a moving and poignant account of heroism and selfsacrifice.Opening with the first of just two battle sequences throughout the whole film Yimou starts off emphasising the heroism of the Chinese soldiers who were outnumbered and outgunned by the invading Japanese troops. Amidst the blatant chestthumping is a pair of convent girls trying to get back to the safety of their Catholic church as well as an American mortician John Miller Christian Bale sent to attend to the last rites of the recently deceased parish priest. While the church's boy warden George Huang Tianyuan and the dozen schoolgirls under his care think that Miller could be their way out of the city he turns out to be anything but well at least in the beginning.Content to remain nonchalant to the plight of the girls Miller instead binges on the communion wine supply in the church's basement and ransacks the church for any money left as payment for his services. Better still when some 13 ladies from the local brothels seek shelter at the church he welcomes them as if elated at the prospect of his own personal harem. But transformation is at the heart of Yimou's tale and even though you know that by the end of the story Miller will rise to the occasion to save the girls the path to that dramatic character turn is still deeply affecting.Kudos to Liu Heng's elegant screen writing whose collaboration with Yimou goes as far back as the latter's 'Ju Dou' for crafting a moving character arc for Miller beginning with an act of admirable courage when Miller puts on the priestly robes one day in a bid to stymie the Japanese from forcing themselves on the underage schoolgirls. Ever so delicately the movie charts his change of heart from a once self centred opportunist to a Fatherly figure looking after both the convent girls and the courtesans and eventually turning into a saviour for the former.Just as skilfully Yimou also charts the transformation of both groups of ladies. At the crux of it is a truly outstanding act of self sacrifice on the part of the courtesans as their egocentricity slowly but surely gives way to empathy and culminates in an extraordinary gesture of courage. We won't spoil this plot point for you suffice to say that Yimou handles it with beautiful restraint and what could easily have been maudlin melodrama is instead cast as an uplifting testament of the common bonds of humanity that unite us all despite our social backgrounds.Yimou's adroit storytelling is complemented with the stirring performances of a topnotch cast. Christian Bale is perfectly cast his usual understated but no less powerful acting creating a compelling character in Miller. It also enables him to blend in nicely with the rest of the massive ensemble despite being the lone Westerner in a cast of Asians. Refusing to monopolise attention on himself or his character he too strikes up great chemistry with his costars Tianyuan and newcomer Ni Ni the latter of which steals the show with her luminous portrayal of Yu Mo the pseudoleader of the courtesans whose radiant beauty masks an equally sharp mind.Evocative too is d.p. Zhao Xiaoding's cinematography which avidly captures both the sobering horrors of war as well as the cautious moments of quiet optimism between the girls. In particularmXiaoding also uses the convent's stained glass as a nice recurring motif to signal the omnipresence of God despite the atrocities and bleakness. And despite boasting none of the gaudy excesses of Yimou's previous big budget extravaganzas a la 'Curse of the Golden Flower' production designer Yohei Tanada deserves credit for the visually intricate designs of both the cathedral as well as the wartorn streets of Nanking.Nonetheless what will likely resonate most at the end of the day are the film's twin messages of courage in the face of fear and humanity in the face of atrocity. Yimou's confident direction also makes for a multifaceted movie that offers various perspectives on the war through its myriad characters while placing Miller Yu Mo and a thirteenyear old convent girl Shu Zhang Xinyi at the heart of it. Don't be deterred by its grim subject matter or its partiality to the matter just as its title suggests there is beauty to be found in the unlikeliest of places and in spite of the inevitable scenes of heartbreak and despair it is a quietly stirring and deeply poignant drama of selfsacrificial love especially meaningful with the impending occasion of Good Friday as a reminder of this highest form of love.www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not really familiar with the details of the Rape of Nanking in the late 1930s. However people from this side of the globe are very familiar with the suffering brought about by the brutal Japanese Imperial Army throughout Asia. In our country many movies have shown Japanese brutality during the World War II. I thought I would be ready for this movie.The Flowers of War tells the story of a roguish American mortician John Miller Christian Bale who was sent to a Catholic churchconvent in Nanking to prepare the body of the priest for burial who was then under siege by the Japanese. When he gets there he found he also needed to take care of a group of convent girls led by the spirited Shu a young caretaker boy George and later a gaggle of exotic prostitutes led by the classy beauty Yu Mo Ni Ni. Everyone will go through a touching lifechanging story arc that will show how even the most unlikely of people can become heroes in extreme adversity.Director Zhang Jimou returns to form in this movie. He was relentless in the first half we are taken through a continuous barbaric carnage perpetrated by the Japanese soldiers. These parts are reminiscent of the frankly violent bloodspurting Saving Private Ryan beach scene. The terror is very palpable. While the scenes of soldiers being shot and killed were hard to watch the several minutes of violence to children was even harder to bear! The second half is more dramatic with a some contrived cheesy moments. The character of the kindhearted Japanese officer Hasegawa was a nice counterbalance to their other heinous acts of atrocity. I also felt the long sequence when a couple of prostitutes sneaking out to retrieve trivial things in their brothel was a rather unnecessary long detour. There will even be a scene that will remind you of Gwyneth Paltrow's body wrap scene in Shakespeare in Love. However when the film reaches its climax everything falls back into place and the noble message is delivered on point. This movie may be difficult to watch because of the scenes of violence but this is worth watching because the story of heroism and redemption was very good welltold and wellexecuted.".

The movie and novel are adapted from the Diary of Minnie Vantrinfrom the files of Nanjing Massacre Minnie is a churchwoman of USA died in 1941. The movie is really tragic but beautiful various goodness and evil of human nature were embodied fully and clearly and exquisitely under the beast of war............I just feel deeply sad and touching. Postscript the performance of Christian Bale is really wonderful. Bale will win his another Oscar by this film.".

The movie and novel are adapted from the Diary of Minnie Vantrinfrom the files of Nanjing Massacre Minnie is a churchwoman of USA died in 1941. The movie is really tragic but beautiful various goodness and evil of human nature were embodied fully and clearly and exquisitely under the beast of war............I just feel deeply sad and touching. Postscript the performance of Christian Bale is really wonderful. Bale will win his another Oscar by this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Flowers of War is a gritty and wellmade film with a story set in a protected area of Nanking during the worst atrocity to occur anywhere in the Pacific war. With sensitivity to a squeamish audience used to the fake horror of B movies you'll see the slaughter of many unarmed civilians and the very brutal rape of the schoolgirls hiding in the Safety Zone but broken into anyway by Japanese soldiers. You'll see gang rapes followed by the immediate and pointless murder of the victims. You will see a supposedly nice Japanese officer who loves music et cetera but will later enslave all 13 schoolgirls for gang rape at a Japanese celebration.What you will NOT see is the true depiction of the horrors inflicted on the civilians of Nanking by the Japanese. No depiction of pregnant girls being raped then cut open and having the fetus stabbed no rapes of little children cut open if that was necessary to effect the rape. No it's all cleaned up or nobody would watch it. Will this account even survive the IMDb review?Witnesses to the Rape of Nanking arewere numerous and diverse. Lots of foreign nationals witnessed the crimes. There is even actual movies taken of the crimes  at the time they were happening.Personally I'm not antiJapanese. World War II was a long time ago and the leadership of Douglas NacArthur following the war changed the Japanese forever. I've visited Japan as a tourist and purchased five Japanese cars. But history is history. The Flowers of War is well worth your time but keep in mind this is the cleanedup version of true and prolonged horror.".

Christian Bale is a mortician who arrives in the besieged city at the height of the battle his mission is to bury the newly deceased Father Ingleman. He ends up taking shelter in a Catholic Church which is a neutral zone during the war. A group of schoolgirls is already living there. Within a short period of time several prostitutes arrive at the church to hide from the rampaging soldiers.Bale is great in the lead as always as commanding a presence as any actor working today and his female counterpart newcomer Ni Ni is someone to watch out for she is beautiful and has a star quality that is undeniable. Although it runs well over two hours I never lost interest and I really cared about what happened to the victims of this sad part of history.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a Chinese. But I have to admit that I am neither a big fan of Zhang nor of the Chinese cinematography. Except for few excellent works I found the recent Chinese film industry willingly or unwillingly distances itself from the audience by making Hollywoodstyle big budget allstar cast but emptycontent and clichplot movies. Where are the Chinese movie makers' ideas? Why did they give up finding stories in Chinese history and instead they chase some intangible scifis to burn some money? Nan Jing is always a sad place to visit and its history during the sinojp war is forever a scar in the Chinese. For Jp an industrialized great power that even beat Russia once must realize that a fast complete annexation of China is nearly impossible the huge resistance and a large area of territory that China possessed was way out of Jp capacity. The astronomical Chinese manpower would outrun every Jp technological advantage and eventually turn the table. So the Jp did one thing they could think of  instill fear and horror in the Chinese and wear their resistance down. War crimes  killing looting and raping could do that and the Jp wanted double of it to get the effect. It is imaginable that the Jp army on one hand would officially blame such behaviors because of their culture of being respectful and polite and on the other hand closed one eye for them perhaps even promoted and encouraged them.That was Jp. Chinese they were victims. Period.An American in China at that time kind of enjoyed immunity from the brutality and had a neutral status.So these summarized the positions of all people in the film. I can speak for myself even though I tried to contain my reaction during the viewing I still have been hit headon by the emotion. It is Chinese Schindler's list. In this case however those women were more the Schindlers than Bale's John don't you think although John also did a great humanitarian deed.Pros of the film. I think first is the story itself. A moving story of those women and girls a realistic account of the jp war crime and a faithful reflection of the fear during the war. True some of the elements in the plot are predictable but not the ending of it. At the end of the day this work is a movie and a movie needs something unpredictable out of clich or Hollywood.Also the structure of the film is very ideal. Enough time is given to elaborate on the substories although in my opinion the ending bit can still be more elaborate.The characters are also very human. They were quite free of the stereotype Chinese film mindset here which I think is the second good thing about this film. To name two things about that free of stereotype they showed selfpreservation the girls the women Mr Meng and more importantly John all have it. You know selfpreservation is generally considered as selfishness and one of the personality weakness according to the modern Chinese ideology which promote the collective greater good is above individual wellbeing. Being selfpreserved at that time is frequently associated with being traitor. And you can expect selfpreservation is rarely seen in Chinese films about sinojp war. That in my opinion is one of the distances I mentioned earlier that the Chinese movie makers created in their patriotically educational movies. That is simply not very human. But I can find it here and that adds up to the credibility of the account.The second one was the women group itself. They are because of their profession always depicted as no soul no feeling full of vanity and selfish in Chinese culture and more they were nonpolitical. This story also quoted one of the mostly quoted Chinese poems in the end to remind us of that last point. The catch of this film is to challenge that opinion. Like in the La Dame aux camlias they have emotions human feelings like you and me they love and hate. It is overkill to discuss whether they should be patriotic and do something about the war. Simply being themselves OK in the film acting like ones they can convince the rest of us already.Second the acting. Christian Bale in my opinion is getting better and better since his Batman the Legend begins. True Liam Neeson is still THE Schindler. But Bale has his shot. John's submission in front of the Jp is very well portrayed by Bale's hard but meanwhile sad face. And Bale also has the eyes to tell those stories when he tried to cover up those women's imminent going to hell event before the girls. In comparison to the similar looking Jonathan Rhys Meyers who also associates himself with sinoculture I think I prefer Bale's a little darker and sadder presence.The women they deserved three hurra both for their characters and for their acting. A piece of information the Chinese generally considers women from the vicinity of Shanghai are mean. I am not saying this is true but it adds to their characters when I looked at them. They were really mean sometimes weren't they? If you think so too you should realize what these 12 actress have done to you   OK some minor cons. Yes the girls and women played their parts well when the horror kicks in. But remember those scenes from Schindler's list? The trembling teeth of the Jewish youth the little girl in the s hole those widely open eyes in the shower room. Few can convey fear in films like Spielberg. Zhang here is on the right track in the right direction but not yet close.Also the young actors and actresses are promising but still have room to perfect their skill. The depiction of fear again still showed some artificiality.Go see it!".

Some prisoners are interred in a prison camp but most of them are led to fire squad  scaffold and others are alive burying.Director deglamorizes war showing true horror and terrible events . It's a staggering evocation of the Chinese Holocausto in Nanjing  as the atrocities and slaughters are depicted matter of factly as byproduct of sheer Japanese evil . The opening graphic depiction the facing off  rampage  ravage is  on its own  magnificent . Spectacular and impressive production but also has its intimate and sensitive moments . As the moving beginning results to be excellent  the developing of the movie regarding invasion China is partially similar to Nanjing! Nanjing! by Chuan Lu and Empire of the sun by Spielberg also starred by Christian Bale and suffering of Chinese people bear remarkable resemblance to these films . This was the second fully Chinesefunded film to have a Hollywood star in the lead  the first one being Inseparable 2011 by Dayyan Eng  played by Kevin Spacey . The starring Christian Bale  and the rest of the cast are excellent with special mention to gorgeous Ni Ni  as the movie is powered by splendid performances in charge of Chinese and Japanese actors who during filming suffered some inevitable discussions . Filmed in perfect as well as glamorous color by cameraman Xiaoding Zhao  reflecting appropriately the grim and rotten environment and colorful interiors from a Chinese church .

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know whether or not you've heard about the Rape of Nanking but everyone should know about it. Having captured the Chinese city Japanese forces committed a near genocide against the population and devastated the city. Zhang Yimou's Jnlng Shsn Chi The Flowers of War in English focuses on a Nanking church where an American Christian Bale takes up residence and then must protect the inhabitants from the occupying forces. The inhabitants are the schoolgirls and also a group of prostitutes. Eventually everyone faces a moral dilemma.There are some very ugly scenes of the occupation. The Japanese occupation of China and Korea has never gotten the attention that the Nazi occupation of Europe has but it was equally brutal as was the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. The main focus here is on the events inside the church but there is ample focus on the atrocities committed by the Japanese. The movie does a very good job in every way. It is always important to tell these stories so that they never happen again. I very much recommend the movie.PS Bale had previously starred in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun about a boy who gets separated from his parents in Japaneseoccupied China. I also recommend that one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Yimou Zhang scores a perfect 10! For someone who is known for the action choreography in his movies such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers Zhang keeps the viewer riveted to the seat through the first 30 minutes or so when Japanese forces run through Chinese the city of Nanking unleashing mayhem and violence.The framing and editing work in tandem to create stunning visuals that convey both the widespread destruction due to the heavy artillery as well as the intense pain and angst of those hit. I could not help but get reminded of movies like Full Metal Jacket 1987 Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line 1998.The scene where young Chinese soldiers run in an inline formation towards an advancing Japanese tank with the hope that the last man in the formation who is a humanbomb will get close enough to the tank and immobilize it is outstanding. This perhaps captures the essence of the story  which is displayed through out the movie by many of its characters  the enduring nature of the human spirit. The lone surviving Chinese soldier forsaking the safety offered by a convent of nuns and going back to take on the wellarmed invaders the decision of the prostitutes to standin for the young and adolescent nuns who are called into the Japanese garrison for a performance at a celebration party and the young errandboy at the nunnery making the choice to step in as a substitute to make up for the count for the choir are some great moments.Zhang gets Christian Bale to show his slow but complete transformation from being a drunken mortician with hedonistic leanings to a determined man who sees the protection of the innocent victims nuns prostitutes and the young boy as his calling.The violence and gore notwithstanding this movie is one emotional rollercoaster that is sure to make you take a pause and think about the casualties of war and the power of keeping up hope when in despair.".

I could not help but get reminded of movies like Full Metal Jacket 1987 Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line 1998.The scene where young Chinese soldiers run in an inline formation towards an advancing Japanese tank with the hope that the last man in the formation who is a humanbomb will get close enough to the tank and immobilize it is outstanding. This perhaps captures the essence of the story  which is displayed through out the movie by many of its characters  the enduring nature of the human spirit. The lone surviving Chinese soldier forsaking the safety offered by a convent of nuns and going back to take on the wellarmed invaders the decision of the prostitutes to standin for the young and adolescent nuns who are called into the Japanese garrison for a performance at a celebration party and the young errandboy at the nunnery making the choice to step in as a substitute to make up for the count for the choir are some great moments.Zhang gets Christian Bale to show his slow but complete transformation from being a drunken mortician with hedonistic leanings to a determined man who sees the protection of the innocent victims nuns prostitutes and the young boy as his calling.The violence and gore notwithstanding this movie is one emotional rollercoaster that is sure to make you take a pause and think about the casualties of war and the power of keeping up hope when in despair.";

I want to point out a very interesting thing and the reason I'm writing these comments. I just read Roger Eberts review and I must say that it offended me. Mr. Ebert used to be the the very best at what he did. The one to go to for determining if you did or didn't want to see a movie. I respected his opinions. Yet... Recently he's lost it. Yes he's been through a lot with his current health and I wish him all the best with this. Regardless his perception of film has obviously slipped away. Firstly for this film he missed the fact that Christian Bales character is NOT a priest. He is a MORTICIAN. This is IMPORTANT! A mortician and a man of god are two totally different things and this is critical in understanding the path his character takes spiritually. He also mentions over and over that a westerner is wasted on the story and that a Chinese priest would have been more appropriate. DID HE WATCH THE MOVIE??? It's the fact that he's a westerner that keeps the Japanese from killing him in the very beginning! If he were Chinese he would be the ENEMY! Just like the previous priest. I'm done preaching from my soap box. Forgive me but when critics are hard on movies and miss the boat it frustrates me. This is a truly disturbing film and at the same time it's beautiful. Give it a chance and trust the storyteller. Your in good hands.".

What greater nightmare then war? or of life in the trenches.And the subtle lines of the characters that suggesting that the evil in the trenches is actually death....that they in fact were actually dead is overwhelming.Everyone seas hell as the thing they are most afraid of and in these soldiers case what terrified them most was the war.So the trench is Purgatory and they are tested judged if u will by the German soldier if they are worthy to be sent to hell which is symbolized by the dark place they descended into or set free allowed into heaven which is symbolized by the ascending run of the main character at the end when called by his colleagues he runs towards the light and out of the trench.";

The flick has an eerie atmosphere wonderfully creepy suspenseful n nicely enhanced by the mud of trenches.

	schema:headline " Pretty Good Morality Tale Set During WW1";
	schema:reviewBody "Well produced morality play set in the trenches of World War 1. A group of ten British soldiers are seemingly lost after a battle and stumble upon a German trench. They kill the remaining Germans save one who appear terrified and concerned with what's in the trenches then what might be coming in namely the British soldiers. As the British squad sets up to hold the trench from what they assume will be an eventual German counterattack strange supernatural things begin to occur. There is a lot to like in Deathwatch. It is clearly a film that was made on the cheap. First time director Michael J. Bassett manages to overcome the low budget and create a fairly realistic WW 1 battlefield. I don't think it ever looks much more then a very elaborate sound stage but a very well crafted and competently manufactured one. Credit has to be given to production designer Aleksandar Denic for the high quality set designs. They really hold their own and enhance the film considerably.The acting is more then adequate. The actors most notably Jamie Bell as the cowardly Shakespeare do a believable job of presenting themselves as British soldiers. Andy Serkis who plays Private Quinn and is probably best known as the voice of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings is a bit over the top as the stereotypical soldier who likes war a little too much. Quinn even collects the scalps of the enemy he's killed and would seem to fit more in a Vietnam War movie then in the Western Front trenches. The rest of the cast is populated with war film staples the uptight captain the common sense sergeant bluecollar corporals etc. The storyline of Deathwatch is a bit jumbled and is why I don't believe it can be considered as either strictly a horror film or war film. It was pretty clear to me that the squad was dead or at least in some Twilight Zone sequence when they stumble upon the British trench. The gas that had originally forced them to don their masks had mysteriously disappeared and as one of the squad notes Why is it suddenly daylight? So clearly something is wrong here. Unfortunately the scary scenes are few and far between throughout the rest of the movie. My gut feeling is that the director just didn't have enough cash to do a lot of the scary special effects that he wanted and relied more on dark visual imagery and the viewer's imagination of what might be off in the distance or just around the corner. And this has a lot to do with why I see the film more as a morality tale set during WW1.The remaining German soldier Friedrich warns them that they all will die. I digress but an interesting plot device in the film is that Friedrich must speak French to Private Shakespeare since Shakespeare speaks no German but does speak French. In any case slowly one by one as these films go the mysterious forces that control the trench they've stumbled upon kill off the soldiers. It leaves Shakespeare alive at the end of the movie presumably because he was nice to the German prisoner. And it is in fact Friedrich who in an odd turn of events allows Shakespeare to leave the trench. From the visuals in this final scene it appears that of the squad it is Shakespeare due to his humanity allowed into Heaven. It's not really clear why. Private Quinn without a doubt is displayed as a contemptible man and Shakespeare is shown as the most humane of the group with the remaining soldiers falling in various places in between. So I could not understand the rules so to speak of this apparent purgatory. The plot is muddled and unclear. Why Shakespeare and not the Captain who made an attempt to stop Quinn from torturing the German soldier? It's conceivable that this purgatory is strictly for Shakespeare to be judged. Possible but unclear given the course Deathwatch takes plot wise. At the very end a new squad of British soldiers enters the trench as Friedrich sits and waits for them.Deathwatch is not a scary film nor is it a particularly compelling war film. It is however an interesting and well produced film with good acting. And it appears that director Michael J. Bassett did a capable job with the resources he had at hand.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was reading several of the reviews on this site as I was watching the movie. I agree with some and disagree with some. There have been several comments regarding the relatively low budget. What's wrong with that? I for one appreciate seeing a movie that is nothing but real actors filling the screen rather than special effects and computergenerated action. I think relatively low budget aspect of not having special effects made it more real. The acting I thought was fine. The only person I recognize being an American was Jamie Bell. He did his usual very good job here. I have absolutely no idea who the rest of the cast is so I was not constrained in believability as several reviewers were who mentioned that when they see one specific actor for example they keep thinking of his role on a television show. With Bell being the only guy I've seen before all the actors were to me able to settle into their roles as WWI soldiers.I agree with a couple reviewers who commented that it was good that it was an allBritish cast. As an American it annoys the hell out of me when Hollywood makes movies that involve characters from other nations and could very easily fill those roles with actors from those nations but instead use American actors with horrible imitation accents or worse yet not even using an accent. Regarding what the movie was really about I like the fact that it was left a little up in the air. This is one of those movies that allows heated debated after viewing it. It is good to have a movie that lets you think for yourself regarding what you just watched rather than having it forcefed to you. I think this was a very good movie one in which a low budget all British cast and completely unknown for an American actors other than Bell all combine to equal an enjoyable viewing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Watch walks a very fine line while taking itself far too seriously especially considering the bleak backdrop of WWI under which the movie is set. I watched this film sheerly under the recommendation of its horrormilitary genre connection to Dog Soldiers. With that said if you are looking for something like Dog Soldiers please do not watch this movie. They are too very different animals.Which isn't to say Death Watch is bad purely on the grounds that it is not Dog Soldiers. Death Watch is a very taunt and atmospheric movie and the surreal and gritty layout of the text make us fear attack from any direction.The film follows a group of British soldiers who capture a German trench and then attempt to hold the trench in the wake of not only an incompetent officer but also a series of inexplicably strange events that push all involved to the edge of sanity. Soon a rookie soldier nicknamed Shakespeare begins to wonder if his squad is being driven insane by isolation and shellshock or something far more sinister.Every man in YCompany seems to have some sort of defining flaw. Shakespeare's flaw seems to be his cowardice. But instead of endearing this character to our own insecurities the filmmakers only succeed in push Shakespeare away from us with his perpetual whininess. No one else is given as much due as Shakespeare. Other characters live and die in a heartbeat without too much grief but Shakespeare seems to be set up to be the emotional weight of the story which the script ironically seems downright afraid to achieve.As mentioned above the movie walks a very fine line. It takes itself at times far too seriously with no real breaks in between for relief and only little more for laughter. Soon the bloody plights of the soldiers are played for cheap thrills and the end result feels more than a little shoddy for exploiting the horror of World War One for such aims.The mystery of the trench never lets up even after the final shot. You leave the movie with an idea of what happened but like most things in this movie very little else. This isn't to say the movie isn't worth seeing  its scary and very moody and a far cry from generic Hollywood horror. But by the same merit this movie isn't something to go out of your war for. Despite all this movie has to offer between atmosphere and suspense there's no real payback in sight at least on the Western Front.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Everyone seems to be linking Deathwatch and The Bunker. The comparison is inevitable. They were released nearly at the same time and they are nearly identical in subject matter. So comparison is warranted. I thought The Bunker was the better of the two but I will save the reasons why for my review of that film. Deathwatch is about a group of British soldiers during World War I who find themselves seemingly trapped in an enemy trench. From viewing the trailer you'd think some unseen evil monster is stalking them. But you'd be wrong. Here's a quote from the back of the box They begin to think there is someone...or some THING in the trench with them. It's not the case. That is always a big problem promising one thing and delivering another. I'm not a big fan of that. Another problem is the characters themselves. They are walking clichs and I don't care for any of them not even our hero Jamie Bell. At the beginning of the movie Bell's character leaves a man to die basically and it's hard to recover from that. I could never get on his side. The story leaves something to be desired. From the moment I saw that the watches had stopped and the compass wasn't working properly I knew where the film was headed. The radio scene solidified it for me. The characters died in battle and this trench is some kind of purgatory. It's nothing we haven't seen before and it's not entirely perfected here. It has some major flaws. Bell's character is the only one allowed to escape because he helped a German soldier who is presumably some kind of afterlife judge. Well that doesn't seem fair to me. There were a few more characters that didn't deserve to die in my view and more factors should be taken into account. If purgatory is anything like that many of us are going to hell. On a positive side the trench set is amazing. There is a good atmosphere created in all that rain and mud. The performances are also not bad. I only knew one actor going in The Lord of the Rings' Andy Serkis and they all did a good job. But like I said I cared nothing for their characters in the end. And I think that is the biggest mistake of this film.".

And I think that is the biggest mistake of this film.";

It was made in 1999 and was set on the eve of the battle of the Somme  a battle that saw the British army lose 20000 soldiers on the first day of battle . It was fairly unconvincing not helped by the fact that the eponymous trench looked like a film set . Not so with Michael J Basset's DEATHWATCH which has a realistic missenscene  so realistic in fact you can taste the mud in your mouth  the rain on your skin and smell the stench of decomposing flesh inside your nose . Anyone think war's a game ? I suggest you watch this movie because it might just change your mind . Just a pity that Basset decided to make a horror movie involving the supernatural because who needs monsters when you see what the human race is capable of The characters are rather clichd but no more so than those seen in THE TRENCH or THE SOMME  2005  and the cast do their best especially Andy Serkis who plays a violent maniac . 10 million people died in the first world war so it's refreshing to see a soldier from that period actually enjoying killing the enemy so much simply down to blind hatred . You think the Jerries and Tommies played football together and drank schnapps every Christmas ? Think again . What really ruins the film is the main story of a supernatural force in the trench alongside the soldiers . It's very confusing and underdeveloped and in places just downright silly  especially that ending In short this is a film that could have been a modern antiwar classic . Basset has made a highly atmospheric film with some very disturbing imagery . It's interesting to note that the scene everyone remembers is the one where the blankets are pulled back  a scene that you feel uncomfortable watching because you just know something like that has happened in real conflicts in the past and will happen in future conflicts . Did we need supernatural damnation when all you have to do is switch on the TV every day to see the human race damned by it's own hand ?".

What really lets this film down though is the lack of historical research. Almost every weapon in the film is an anachronism. Even the soldiers' iconic SMLE rifles have been substituted with Second World War vintage Lee Enfield No4s. Combined with Second World War webbing the effect is of a load of ACF cadets.

However this was not to be the case. Whilst I understand this is Michael Bassett's first foray into the motion picture world and from other interviews I've read this story has been a passion of his for a long time I can't help feeling he bit off a lot more than he could chew. For starters the dialogue inflicted upon the cast was clunky at best and simply unbelievable at worst not being helped by the fact that each of the characters were quite neat cliche'd stereotypes dispite the truely courageous efforts of the cast. Match this to a very unremarkable score I can't recall a single theme from the movie no discernable direction a director of photography that was quite obviously blind and a focus puller that either had arthritis or mistook feet for inches the opening scenes as they approach the trench are testament to this and you're left trying to quantify quite what it is that makes this movie so unbearable.

The computer graphics of the barbed wire whilst cutting edge ten years ago look laughable especially the bodiesdescendingintoground sequence near the end and even the omnipresent rats end up looking as if they've just been plonked into the frame seconds before the camera rolls. If Mr. Bassett had a couple more films under his belt and a decent crew to work with I'm sure I'd have no problems recommending this film. As is it should've been half the length.

	schema:reviewBody "Deathwatch is set during World War 1  starts on 'The Western Front 1917' as a group of British soldiers prepare to go over the top. During the course of the battle several soldiers are separated  become lost as they wander the landscape they stumble across a forward German trench that they capture taking one German soldier Roman Horak as a prisoner. Captain Bramwell Jennings Laurence Fox orders his troops to bed themselves in as they are going to defend the valuable trench until reinforcements arrive. The trench is a godawful place it's strewn with dead mutilated bodies it's filthy  it's generally not a nice place to be. That night Private Barry Starinski Kris Marshall is heard screaming the men find his body wrapped in barbed wire. Private Bradford Hugh O'Conor reaches help over the radio but as time passes  the reinforcements don't arrive bouts of squabbling fighting  arguing break out amongst the men. Paranoia  desperation sets in as they're number begins to dwindle upon questioning the German soldier he says that they will all die  great evil fills the trench...This British German Italian  French coproduction was written  directed by Michael J. Bassett  in my opinion is to be blunt crap. The script is mindnumbingly slow dull  boring. To say Deathwatch concentrates on character development rather than action is an understatement.

The costumes special effects cinematography  general production values are all fine.

	onyx:emotionText "Deathwatch is set during World War 1  starts on 'The Western Front 1917' as a group of British soldiers prepare to go over the top. During the course of the battle several soldiers are separated  become lost as they wander the landscape they stumble across a forward German trench that they capture taking one German soldier Roman Horak as a prisoner. Captain Bramwell Jennings Laurence Fox orders his troops to bed themselves in as they are going to defend the valuable trench until reinforcements arrive. The trench is a godawful place it's strewn with dead mutilated bodies it's filthy  it's generally not a nice place to be. That night Private Barry Starinski Kris Marshall is heard screaming the men find his body wrapped in barbed wire. Private Bradford Hugh O'Conor reaches help over the radio but as time passes  the reinforcements don't arrive bouts of squabbling fighting  arguing break out amongst the men. Paranoia  desperation sets in as they're number begins to dwindle upon questioning the German soldier he says that they will all die  great evil fills the trench...This British German Italian  French coproduction was written  directed by Michael J. Bassett  in my opinion is to be blunt crap. The script is mindnumbingly slow dull  boring. To say Deathwatch concentrates on character development rather than action is an understatement. If it's one thing I can't stand it's a boring film I have better things to do than sit in front of a TV screen watching deeply uninteresting character's have petty arguments amongst themselves I get enough of that at work!.

	schema:reviewBody "When this film showed up on the cable listing I had a sudden urge to see it even though I knew it was probably going to be terrible. The original was such a staple of my childhood yet had such an incomplete ending that I was intensely curious to see what they would do with another sequel. Besides I knew that it could not possibly be worse than The NeverEnding Story II.Boy was I wrong.The NeverEnding Story III has rightly earned its place among IMDb voters as the 79th worst movie of all time. It is so bad that in writing this review I risk making it sound like it's worth watching sort of like Plan Nine from Outer Space. I assure you this film is in no way in the Ed Wood category of being so incompetently done that it becomes enjoyable to watch. Those moviegoers who take pleasure in seeing cinematic disasters should be forewarned about this one lest they never again be able to erase from their memory Rockbiter's gravellyvoiced version of Born to be Wild played in a video sequence early in the film and again during the end credits.No I am not joking.The second film does have its admirers and as much as I hated it I sort of understand where they're coming from. At least that film had a legitimate purpose to tell the second half of the novel which the first film had neglected to do. But now the story is finished so the third film has to make up its own reason for being with an even shabbier budget than that of the second film. So it concocts a story that allows us to see as little of Fantasia as possible. Here a series of magical mishaps causes a bunch of creatures from Fantasia to be transported into the real world. These include Falkor the luck dragon a baby rockbiter about the size of a fountain statue and a talking tree. Falkor who must have gotten a lobotomy sometime between the second and third film will chase after a dragon at a Chinese festival. What we do see of Fantasia makes the place seem a lot smaller than I had ever imagined. Almost all of the scenes there take place in the empress's chamber in the Ivory Tower though there is also one sequence where we get to see Rockbiter's home just what I've always wanted to do! with Mama Rockbiter and of course the previously mentioned Baby Rockbiter sitting in front of a large stone TV set. Needless to say the inhabitants of Fantasia seem to possess quite a bit more knowledge of Earth than they did in the first film. When the gnome describes Bastian as not exactly Arnold Schwarzenegger in the muscle department we're reminded how much more enjoyable the film would probably be if Schwarzenegger were actually in it.The cause of these events is that a gang of school bullies steals the book and discovers that it gives them the power to wreak havoc on the inhabitants of Fantasia. Strangely these modern kids never seem surprised that magic exists. Think how long it took in the first film for even imaginative tenyearold Bastian to become convinced of the book's supernatural qualities. These bullies much older and more concrete never go through such a skeptical period. And later when the Auryn falls into the hands of a teenage girl she treats it with about the same level of awe as if she got hold of her parents' credit card.There are actually some familiar actors in this mess. Mr. Koreander is played by the British character actor Freddie Jones Bastian is played by the kid from Free Willy and the main bully is played by a relatively young Jack Black who now probably would like to do with this film what George Lucas wants to do with the Star Wars Holiday Special.".

What were they thinking when they decided to jazz up the movie with contemporary rock 'n roll???? And most of the movie actually takes place not in the fantasy world but in this world. The characters are especially obnoxious especially the rock baby and suffer from stereotypes. Plus the movie seems to have forgotten a lot of what happened previously  the hero's dad knew about Fantasia so the hero didn't have to hide anything from him  but for some reason the hero keeps the incidents he was involved in a secret. The low point comes where the climax is not solved with magic or intelligence  but with karate. Yes karate.".

Hold on a minute while I go throw up.While it is a clean safe film in terms of subject matter the third NES should never have been made. And I mean NEVER. The first two movies covered all the wondrous things within the original book so I don't understand why this film was made at all. It is just cheesy stupid abysmal and an absolute disgrace to the idea of The Neverending Story.First of all what's going on with this stepsister of Bastian's that has somehow appeared? Wrong wrong. . . Then what happened to good old Falkor? And most of all where is Atreyu? If you are bold enough to see this film that is the one thing you will distinctly notice if you've seen the other two no Atreyu.The boy who played Bastian was not nearly as obnoxious as the actor from the second film but he just doesn't hold a candle to the original actor Barret Oliver. I have only seen this movie once because I was informed of how awful it was and just had to see for myself. It was a waste of my precious time. I hardly remember the plot line or anything important like that because it just didn't stick with me. One gets the impression that this was made as a sort of kidfamilyfriendly approach to The Neverending Story because it is just so simplistic and sacrifices the charm of the original characters and settings for the sake of being funny and entertaining. But trust me it is NOT funny and it is NOT entertaining. Any NES fan worth their salt would be appalled by this film. If however you are not familiar with the Neverending Story see the original 1984 movie and read the book and be contented with that. Do not subject yourself to the torturous nightmare that is the Neverending Story 3 I implore you. As for a star rating out of ten I give this film nothing. Nil. Zip. Nichts.".

I hardly remember the plot line or anything important like that because it just didn't stick with me. One gets the impression that this was made as a sort of kidfamilyfriendly approach to The Neverending Story because it is just so simplistic and sacrifices the charm of the original characters and settings for the sake of being funny and entertaining. But trust me it is NOT funny and it is NOT entertaining. Any NES fan worth their salt would be appalled by this film. If however you are not familiar with the Neverending Story see the original 1984 movie and read the book and be contented with that. Do not subject yourself to the torturous nightmare that is the Neverending Story 3 I implore you. As for a star rating out of ten I give this film nothing. Nil. Zip. Nichts.";

I watched the first Neverending Story when I was 7 or 8 or so it came out in 1984 the year I was born and I was absolutely fascinated with it. A few years later I had the pleasure of watching the second one and although not as good as the first one I have to say it is one of the better movie sequels I have seen the people who comment on it give it too harsh criticism It was still as imaginative and beautiful as the first one and kept all the main characters. I saw the third one in the movie rental part of our grocery store when I was 14 and I got exited. I immediately rented it and brought it home and popped it in our VCR you remember VCR's don't you?. It was not much longer after that that I was popping it out again. NES3 for lack of a better term... sucks. The storyline was as unimaginative and vapid as you could hope for it takes place in the real world and notas the title would have you believein Fantasia and I get the feeling that it is because creating a fantasy world was a little out of their budget. This movie has low budget written all over it. The childlike empress isn't even blond! they get some brunette chick who looks nothing like her to play the role. After the fart jokes and potty humor commenced I just couldn't take it any longer. My advice is don't wast your time and ruin your childhood memories with this piece of refuse.".

After two or three viewings I saw Michael Ende's name in the opening credits and decided to find the book and read it. I can't remember whether I saw NES III before or after I read the book.The book was AMAZING. Probably the best standalone novel I have ever read. But the problem is After you read the book the movies always look worse because it's not like the book. The first movie is basically based on the first half of the book. A few things were changed andor left out but it's still a great movie overall.The second movie is basically based on the second half of the book. A lot of things were changed and a lot of things were left out. This decreased NES II's score a lot but it's still barely an okay movie.Now NES III is based only on the characters of the book. There's Bastian of course but in the book and the previous two movies he doesn't have the attitude anyhow close to getting wild hair. No Atreyu of course which was probably one of the worst decisions made in the making of the movie. According to the first movie Mr. Koreander doesn't like kids. But now he's school librarian which doesn't make sense. Engywook and Urgl returning was probably a good decision but their characterization was ruined when they were reduced to complaining about having to go to the bathroom the whole second half of the movie. The Bark Troll there were bark trolls in the book is not supposed to know enough about the human world to mention Vegas and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bastian should not have been allowed to keep Junior at his house. Either Bastian would have said No way! I'm not taking him to my house! or Junior would have wrecked his house down. Even the Childlike Empress was reduced to an idiot towards the end of the movie. NES III just doesn't have the feel that The Neverending Story was originally designed to have.Positive notes on NES III Well the story was actually okay in my opinion. Jack Black is a likable actor. Mr. Koreander's line The story's not over yet young man is the only time in any of the three movies where it talks about the NeverEnding Story's unendingness. I like seeing the Old Man of Wandering Mountain but it's not the same part as the book. And the biggest positive note I liked it a lot better a few years ago when I wasn't as much of a movie critic as I am now.510".

	schema:reviewBody "OK a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films also really cheap so I picked them up. The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for false advertising because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways the second one is just an alright film a little below average but not terrible. Now something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying.Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has remarried and now Bastian has a new step mother Jane whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school where he has become victim to the Nasties a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia where he is reunited with old friends. However the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes.See normally I like bad films however this was just bad. For God's sake Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster ChuckECheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster who in the first film was the saddest figure a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger he's now 15 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings Born to be Wild. The villain is no longer an entity it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black LOL.There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice stick to the first film it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie We must not give into the Nasty! 110".

Good News Jack Black Played his character very well. Bad News Where do we begin? First of all No atreau Why we don't know. second the empress had BLOND hair. Defenatly not the beautiful girl in the first NES.She also looked very stoned. Bastion was an innocent kid with a big imagination. This one looked clueless. Changing his dead mother to his dead father is the worse most noticeably fault with the story. YOU DO NOT CHANGE THE THE ORIGINAL POINTS OF THE FRANCHISE!!!! Now the fantasia characters. Falcor looked like an anorexic crack head who must of lost all his knowledge with the pipe. We loved the rockbiter in the first film. But in this he shrunk and had a family yes we know his son was in the second. If everyone grew up why didn't didn't the baby? The elves looked horrible. It was good they brought them back but they ruined the concept of them both. The oracle looked nothing like the first film and neither did the ivory tower.stone? They shouldn't started from scratch. The idea of using the real world as a premise was good but the storyline sucked bad. Only Falcor new what the real world looked like. To try to make us believe that the other fantasia characters knew was laughable to say the least.Over all they should burn all copies of this movie and use a memory wipe to make us forget this movie ever existed. If we rated this on a scale of 110 we would give this a 1000.".

	schema:headline " Easily One of the Worst Sequels Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine that you are reading an entertainment magazine like Entertainment Weekly or Rolling Stone and you happen to look in the news section where they give you information about a movie that is in production. It is a children's movie distributed by Miramax who has made dozens of Oscarwinning films over the last 30 years. It has special effects by Cinemagic and the Jim Henson Creature Shop and Jack Black stars in it. You would want to see it right? Well not if it's The NeverEnding Story III.The NeverEnding Story III is disappointing in every sense of the word. It is by far one of the worst sequels ever made and it does a disservice to the book by Michael Ende and the original 1984 film on which it is based My review httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0088323usercomments250.This movie takes characters from the book and creates a new story that is full of plot holes bad puns and very little logic whatsoever. It helps very little that none of the cast members from either of the first two movies were involved in this film.This time Bastian is played by Jason James Richter Free Willy 1993. Although Richter looks like a preteen model he is still harassed by a gang at his new school known as the Nasties or the Nastys whose leader is Slip played by a thenunknown Jack Black.As it turns out Bastian's new school also happens to be where Coreander the owner of the book store in the original story works as a librarian. British actor Freddie Jones plays Coreander in this movie and fans of the original may be disappointed not to see Thomas Hill reprise his role. I don't blame them.Anyway Coreander happened to bring the NeverEnding Story with him to this school library. It's a pretty contrived way to bring the book back into the story after the main character has moved away if you ask me.What's even more contrived is when Bastian hiding from the Nastys retreats into the world of Fantasia only to have Slip retrieve the book realize its powers and try to destroy the world and Bastian. In the book and the first two movies the reader had little to no control over how the NeverEnding Story would be told. How the Nastys get control is never explained anywhere in the movie. The NeverEnding Story being an enchanted book is no excuse to cover up such plot holes.When Bastian realizes he has to reenter the real world to obtain the book and save Fantasia the movie just gets worse. Even with the Oren the token worn around the neck that resembles two snakes Bastian alone can't make it back home. So a number of creatures from Fantasia have to wish with him and be transported into his world for him to save Fantasia.Such a subplot wouldn't be so bad if the supporting characters weren't so annoying and intelligence insulting. There's the RockBiter's baby boy who talks in annoying baby talk that real children under 3 don't use as vernacular an anthropomorphic tree who talks like an old Jewish comedian except not as funny and two gnomes Urgl and Engywook featured in the first movie but played by different actors who have a tired running joke about needing to use the bathroom.Oh yes and who could forget Falcor the luck dragon? In the first two movies Falcor was a hero to Atreyu and Bastian and was the voice of reason in many situations. He also had a voice like Walter Cronkite which made him ever cooler. Here he not only looks different from the previous two films but he's whinier and dumber. When in the real world he mistakes an airplane for a female luck dragon I could only hang my head and wonder Why?.To make matters worse Bastian can't wish the book back after the Nastys stole it because he can't use the Oren to make wishes in the real world. That plot point is well and good and makes a setup for a great conflict that adds to the story. Unfortunately the people who wrote this screenplay forget that plot point and failed to explain why Bastian's stepsister Nicole Melody Kay could make wishes when she had possession of the Oren. Any script reviser could point out these plot holes and it most especially amazes me that filming progressed despite these inconsistencies.It is even more amazing that no one in this movie actually acts poorly. Richter does well in his role despite his voice obviously cracking and no one noticing. I don't bring that point up to be mean. It's just that the filmmakers could have used his voice changing as a good subplot to explain why he's being picked on. But I digress.The point is that everyone involved in this film just could not save the story having so many inconsistencies. By the end the story bears no resemblance to Ende's original book at all. The Fantasia creatures are also too annoying trying too hard to be comic relief and inundating their dialogue with uncharacteristic pop culture references. Case in point the Rock Biter rides his bike while singing Born To Be Wild by Steppenwolf. What were these filmmakers thinking?And you would think that the Jim Henson Creature Shop working on your side would be a valuable asset in this film. In this case none of the recurring characters look like they did in the first two movies the Rock Biter looking like a pintsize version of his predecessor was the biggest disappointment and they weren't strong characters either. They did not live up to Henson's high standards of storytelling and development. If you don't believe me try finding this movie on Muppet Central. You would have had better luck finding this film in a theater that ran it for two weeks back when it was released.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without surprises I was expecting this to be very bad. On one hand I saw no reason to watch this at all. On the other hand I had nothing to do so I decided to watch this just to see how bad it would be.My oh my the many negative comments I read about this movie have all the reason to be. This movie is garbage capable of making any fan of the original blush of shame. Seriously I don't get how in the world did this movie lost its place in the IMDb Bottom 100 because that's where it belongs.This terrible film should have never seen the light of the day. What did they think they were doing? This is not even a shadow of the original. Frankly this is an offense and mockery on the original and a strong one to win a place of honor at the Razzies being the worst of the trilogy.If the 2nd one is already quite bad and a huge mess this one is even worse. It's a movie without reason to exist. Everything is bad in this movie the crude puppets and sceneries the very poor plot all of the characters especially the more than annoying bullies the Nasties and the crappy lines such as a reference to Arnold Schwarzenneger and Jean Claude Van Damme.But that's far from being all. The bullies here are really nasty and way more annoying than the bullies from the original film. Just as bad as this or even worse is that here the bullies have the power over Fantasia!Plus what have they done to good old Falkor? Here he is so ugly and has no personality at all. Here he has nothing to do with the beautiful and happy creature from the 1st film we all love so much. And what's the point of putting Falkor flying next to a Lufthansa plane? Other annoying things are without a doubt the walking tree that also talks... bah I hate that kind of thing! The Rockbiter here is slim and small so much that I didn't realize it was him until the 2nd half of the movie. Here he's got a wife and a son Junior. Can't describe how annoying is the Rockbiter and his family here. And now they've got a television? My goodness what a silly nonsense!The soundtrack is a mistake. I mean the songs themselves are great such as Born to be wild Crash! Boom! Bang! Kiss From a Rose and Games People Play. But these songs aren't for a fantasy movie. As for Fantasia as one can and should expect it hasn't got the magic enchantment and beauty of the original.Jason James Richter although he was a competent actor can't be compared to the charismatic Barret Oliver. Once again the cast is entirely different. None of the characters feel like those of the original at all. They're a joke instead of captivating. Yet there is nothing funny about them or the movie itself. And that thing of Bastian's new family and lifestyle... no comments.The cast the director and all the artists involved in the 1st movie must have had quite a shock with this joke of a movie. This has nothing to do with their masterpiece. They must have laughed out loud about how ridiculous this movie is...".

	onyx:emotionText "Without surprises I was expecting this to be very bad. On one hand I saw no reason to watch this at all. On the other hand I had nothing to do so I decided to watch this just to see how bad it would be.My oh my the many negative comments I read about this movie have all the reason to be. This movie is garbage capable of making any fan of the original blush of shame. Seriously I don't get how in the world did this movie lost its place in the IMDb Bottom 100 because that's where it belongs.This terrible film should have never seen the light of the day. What did they think they were doing? This is not even a shadow of the original. Frankly this is an offense and mockery on the original and a strong one to win a place of honor at the Razzies being the worst of the trilogy.If the 2nd one is already quite bad and a huge mess this one is even worse. It's a movie without reason to exist. Everything is bad in this movie the crude puppets and sceneries the very poor plot all of the characters especially the more than annoying bullies the Nasties and the crappy lines such as a reference to Arnold Schwarzenneger and Jean Claude Van Damme.But that's far from being all. The bullies here are really nasty and way more annoying than the bullies from the original film. Just as bad as this or even worse is that here the bullies have the power over Fantasia!Plus what have they done to good old Falkor? Here he is so ugly and has no personality at all. Here he has nothing to do with the beautiful and happy creature from the 1st film we all love so much. And what's the point of putting Falkor flying next to a Lufthansa plane? Other annoying things are without a doubt the walking tree that also talks... bah I hate that kind of thing! The Rockbiter here is slim and small so much that I didn't realize it was him until the 2nd half of the movie. Here he's got a wife and a son Junior. Can't describe how annoying is the Rockbiter and his family here. And now they've got a television? My goodness what a silly nonsense!The soundtrack is a mistake. I mean the songs themselves are great such as Born to be wild Crash! Boom! Bang! Kiss From a Rose and Games People Play. But these songs aren't for a fantasy movie.

For attending this film and not being from Georgia I heard some positive and some negative feedback from other attendees of the film. Some people had a little struggle of how long the movie was...

I thought I saw enough movies about The Second World War and about The Holocaust in particular. But after watching it I was almost ashamed that I could think like this. It's not like I'm ignorant I just think that movies about war are always too simple  so I prefer to read books rather than watch movies. But this movie is different. I was touched very deeply and I don't regret any second spent on watching it.The script is focused around the characters and maybe that is the strongest part of it. The war is only the background. We see how people can change and how they act when the tension around is almost unbearable. We see the brightest and the darkest side of humanity. And maybe what is most important here we see common people. Without guns without any special abilities  true honest characters with all their doubts needs and desires. Only the circumstances are not common so our characters try to deal with them. The word our characters is not an accident. I felt very close to these characters  bad or good it didn't matter  they were almost naked in their emotions. And I think it's very true in the horror of the war you don't have the time or the strength to hide behind some kind of curtain. No matter to what God we pray what language we speak in the end we are all human  and it's our choice what we make of our humanity.Preferably watch it in the movie theater. Only then it is possible to experience the grand play of lights and the perfect work of the camera. In this movie also this aspect has its strong impact on the viewer.I would say while watching this movie I felt like I was in the very same place as our characters. It's very rare for me to have such feelings so for me it's the best proof that this movie is in some way exceptional. I thought how I would act in situations the characters are in and I'm glad that I haven't been and I hope I never will be.And I keep thinking that I'm very thankful for the creators producers and the whole crew for this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "In Darkness is the true story of a man who saved a dozen Jews in Poland after the Nazi invasion which started World War II put all Jewish people in mortal danger. Much of this film takes place in the sewers under the city of Lvov where our protagonist is a sewer worker. He is the most knowledgeable person in town about the underworld. The world beneath the city is a kind of dark wet hell and Leopold Sucha our tour guide shows his jews around like Ovid guided Dante through the Inferno.In addition to slogging around in unclean waters the cast fights off a lot of rats. Rats are ubiquitous crawling around in most of the scenes. This is not a heartwarming feelgood film. This film succeeds in making the viewer feel very uncomfortable most of the time.As the Nazis begin to close down the Ghetto a few men are seen digging under the floor of their home attempting to create an escape route into the city sewer system. They do so just in the nick of time. The Nazi's are rounding up everyone as their friends and neighbors slide through a narrow hole into the sewer system. As harshly as this film portrays the coldblooded Nazi's the film does not draw sentimental portraits of the victims either. One is hard pressed to find heroism in the victims. Bickering fighting and selfishness surface quickly to create more tension. At times the fights and yelling are at exactly the wrong moment and could doom the group. Caught between Nazi's he doesn't like and the his Jews who he doesn't care much about at first Sucha tries to make extra money by hiding the refugees from the Ghetto and charging them for food and essentials. He is conflicted at first but the unrelenting savageness of the Nazi occupiers eventually turns Sucha toward a more sympathetic view of the people in his care. They do not make it easy. They accuse him of betrayal attempt to kill him and do unspeakable things themselves. It would have been possible to forgive him if he had given up on them but his own decency begins to turn him toward the salvation of his Jews.A reluctant hero he risks his life and takes great risks to keep them safe from Nazis and natural disasters. The movie is complex because there are so many character conflicts so many nationalities and so many languages being spoken. The characters are not black and white good and evil. There are times when the complexity becomes disorienting.Unwise actions of the characters and the sense of danger make you squirm. And well the sewer is a really dark filthy place to live for 14 months. It's difficult to watch but it is worth seeing.".

This is not a war movie and it is only partly a Holocaust story. This is a human story. The memoir of one of the survivors who is portrayed in this film inspired the book which found its way to David then to Hollywood. Any one who sees this or has any connection to the tragedies of the Second World War will be happy that this story was told. It is unique and not like any other film portrayal that I have ever seen. You must have a stomach for seeing what survival is like when portrayed on the silver screen. You will root for some characters bit your nails as events unfold and sigh with relief at numerous occasions. At the end of the film you will have something to talk about with those you watched it with and those you want to recommend it to. See this film and you will be happy that you did.As a side note the presentation of the film at TIFF was on 10th anniversary of 911 and I would think that TIFF organizers chose this evening and this presentation strategically. There was also a special surprise after the movie the survivorwriter of the original memoirs cam to stage to thank those involved and present her grand daughters. It brought tears to the audience. I have never been to a movie premier with so much applause before even when big names like Clooney are in attendance.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a disturbing film that everyone should see. It is based on the true story of a dozen Jews who survived the Holocaust by living for fourteen months in the sewers beneath Lvov Poland from 1944 to 1945. It is also the story of an antiSemitic sewer inspector named Leopold Poldek Socha Robert Wieckiewicz who at first sees helping the Jews as a way to rip them off for what little money they have left but who is transformed into a decent human being trying to help his fellow human beings. One of a tiny handful of humorous scenes comes near the end when one of the Jewish men says to Poldek I don't have any more money. Poldek slips him a wad of cash and says Give this to me on Friday in front of the others. We don't want them to know anything has changed. As he turns and walks away Poldek makes a face that says he can't believe that he just did such a generous thing.The cinematography and lighting in this movie are exceptional. Most of the movie takes place in what is supposed to be a badly lit sewer yet the artificial lighting allows you to see the actors well enough without calling attention to itself.Agnieszka Holland directed this movie. She has an impressive international rsum but I still remember the first movie of hers that I saw Europa Europa another holocaust story I would highly recommend. And it isn't as unrelentingly disturbing as In Darkness. What is disturbing is the atmosphere of doom and the brutality of the Nazis above ground contrasted with the atmosphere of doom and squalor in the dank foulsmelling ratinfested sewer. This is not a modern prettified sewer this sewer is nineteenthcentury or older construction labyrinthine dismal and rank. It is a dangerous place where no one but Poldek can find their way in or out.At one time or another everything goes wrong for the hideaways. A heavy rain fills up the sewer nearly drowning them. Polish collaborators find out they are there and try to turn them in to the Nazis. Poldek nearly gets caught several times trying to bring food and other necessities. Some Jews become tired of hiding and go above ground only to be caught and imprisoned or killed outright.I was able to watch all of this without giving in to despair only because I knew that one of the children must have survived because I saw her on American television several months ago. At the time I think I realized that there was a book about these events but until I saw that this movie was to be shown at the Virginia Film Festival in Charlottesville earlier this month I did not realize it had been made into a movie.".

This happened in what was during the Second World War the Polish town of Lww and today is the Ukrainian town of Lviv.

In any country the film will have some subtitles because the dialogue involves Polish Ukrainian Yiddish and German and of course in Englishspeaking nations the whole thing is subtitled which will limit its appeal to many but it really is a work worth watching. Holland effectively conveys the paralysing fear and utter squalor of life in the sewers and Robert Wieckiewicz as Socha  like the other actors  shows how the unbearable stresses of such situations make people behave in ways both good and bad which are out of character.In Darkness does not have the narrative drive and clear characterisation of Schindler's List but like Spielberg's film it is powerful moviemaking and heartwrenching storytelling.".

	schema:reviewBody "My last day in Savannah I had the the misfortune of having to choose between seeing Lily Tomlin in person at a tributescreening of The Late Show or seeing Agnieszka Holland's baity but promising Holocaust drama In Darkness. I chose the later with the hope that I would see Tomlin somewhere around town. I didn't spot her but I am very pleased with my choice.In Darkness tells the tale of Leopold Socha a Catholic sewer worker in Lvov Poland during the Nazi occupation. Along with his work partner Socha played magnificently by Robert Wieckiewicz has begun breaking into the vacant homes of Jewish citizens that have been moved into the ghetto and stashing their valuables in the sewers for his own personal safekeeping. Meanwhile as the Nazi's began their assault on the ghetto a large group of Jews manage to dig down under their house and into the sewers where they are surprised by Socha just minutes after breaking through. Socha sees an opportunity to make some money and a deal is struck.The audience is introduced to so many characters in the first half hour it can be a bit difficult to know who you really need to focus on. Aside from the obvious lead Socha it soon becomes apparent who the other main players are and you form your attachments appropriately. While you see Socha as a loving husband and hardworking father right off the bat how he takes advantage of the already desperate crowd he finds beneath the city showcases him as a bit less than a hero. Having him forced on you as the unlikely protagonist allows for a great evolution to play out. Wieckiewicz gives us a deeply nuanced turn as he we watch him learn both the impact he has had on those in the darkness and the impact they have had on him.Visually the movie is as dark as the name suggests. At least half of the film takes place in the sewers thus evoking the proper sense of claustrophobia. A couple shots in particular felt nearly iconic to me a woman in vivid blue running through the gray streets of the ghetto during the Nazi raid Socha bringing a little girl up to the surface just enough to poke her head above the street. The production tips closer to minimalistic than lush which works well under Holland's careful direction and in the bleak setting.The movie is very powerful and carries a scholarly tone that should allow it to maintain a presence in the genre for years. As far as the Academy is concerned this is a sure bet for a Best Foreign Language nomination as Poland's submission and a definite contender to take home the trophy. Wieckiewicz would have a place on my ballot as well as considerations for the film in Best Picture and several technical categories. This would be a great film for the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival to add to their lineup.4.5 out of 5 stars.Check out more reviews by Cameron McAllister at Reel Georgia  www.ReelGA.com".

I chose the later with the hope that I would see Tomlin somewhere around town. I didn't spot her but I am very pleased with my choice.In Darkness tells the tale of Leopold Socha a Catholic sewer worker in Lvov Poland during the Nazi occupation. Along with his work partner Socha played magnificently by Robert Wieckiewicz has begun breaking into the vacant homes of Jewish citizens that have been moved into the ghetto and stashing their valuables in the sewers for his own personal safekeeping. Meanwhile as the Nazi's began their assault on the ghetto a large group of Jews manage to dig down under their house and into the sewers where they are surprised by Socha just minutes after breaking through.

He could have gotten 500 zlotys a head for them. The path through the sewers provides the figurative death march for all Jews oppressed in the Holocaust.Not only are the circumstances in the sewer foul and deadly with offal bodies and vermin constant companions but also the madness of the darkness becomes almost too much to bear. Director Agnieszka Holland manages to create a claustrophobic effect as if we all were journeying in a garbage submarine. A similar effect is in Das Boot. Yet figurative light shines through Poldek's antiSemitic eyes as the once amoral profiteer becomes a reluctant but generous benefactor to the almost totally helpless Jews. His unheroic visage and his base life of tending to the sewers while profiteering from the lost add to his remarkably Christian acts under the guise of business. The Jews are transformed as well by shedding their prejudices about Poldek.When the allies liberate those homeless ones the figurative light returns in all its glory. Although this Holocaust story repeats some common tropes about the genre this film goes further to explore the deadening world the Jews had to inhabit in order to survive. The film's episodic rather than thematic approach its narrative reliant on discreet occurrences rather than seamless story makes its over two hours overly long.In Darkness is a powerful statement on man's inhumanity to man and the filmmaker's genius recreating one of the the most difficult stories to tell anymore.".

At a time when antisemitic tendencies are once again beginning to emerge in various European countries it is sobering to be reminded of the consequences of the vicious hatred whipped up by the Nazis in the 30's and 40's.While some might argue that the film is perhaps 20 minutes too long I was not aware of the time passing being thoroughly engrossed in the attempts by a small group of Jews to survive long enough in the sewers to evade capture by either the Germans or the murderous Ukranian police force who did much to assist the Nazis in their elimination of the Jews in Poland. The scenes cut between the dankness of the sewers and the light of the streets above and whenever we are transported up from the dark and into the light as an audience we take gulps of fresh air.I suspect there was some artistic licence employed but the story itself pins you to the seat and the collective sigh when the final message comes up on the screen at the very end is almost palpable.".

Leopold finds himself alone hiding his group even after they run out of money.The obvious holocaust movie comparison is the great 'Schindler's List'. Of course there is similarity between Schindler and Socha. However the characters in this movie seem move gritty. It's more than the grungy sewer location. It is the people's pettiness and ugly racism. It's not just the Germans or the Ukranians or the Poles. It's also the Jews. For most of the movie the motives are not highminded. Fear and the survival instincts hold sway. The eventual idealism comes not as a single revelation as Schindler riding his horse watching the ghetto be liquidated. It comes in a series of steps that moves forward and backwards. More than once Socha almost abandons his Jews and almost as many times Socha is about to be killed by his Jews. This is more gritty and compelling in a different way. Socha is a hero almost by chance but it is his humanity overcoming his fears that is the true story. He is no mover and shaker. He is a blue collar grunt and he risks the little that he had for the sake of strangers. Filming in the narrow confines of the sewer set does limit the visual scale. It doesn't always provide the best views.".

Although we witness great suffering on screen the viewer isn't drawn in except perhaps in the desperate infanticide scene.

	schema:reviewBody "In Darkness is aptly titled. This film is incredibly dark both in a lighting sense and its subject matter. Based on the book In the Sewers of Lvov a Heroic Story of Survival from the Holocaust In Darkness joins a long line of films which document Jewish ghettos during World War II. The story follows an individual group of Jews who evade the Nazis once the ghetto massacre begins. The group dug a hole from one of their small apartments which leads down into the murky mess of the Lvov Poland sewers.The resident lord of the sewers is Lvov's sewer inspector Leopold Socha Robert Wieckiewicz. He is a blue collar worker who is just trying to get through the German occupation as best he can. Along with his assistant Socha ransacks houses formerly occupied by Jews to steal whatever he can and sell the stolen goods to help support his wife Wanda Kinga Preis and his young daughter. One day while working in the sewer Socha comes upon a group of Jews who have just completed digging a hole from the Jewish ghetto into the sewer. Socha has no love for Jewish people but he has no direct animosity either. In exchange for a hefty sum of cash Socha agrees to keep mum about the hole and if the time comes will help a small number of them evade the Nazis and find good hiding spots.Naturally the storming of the ghetto comes sooner than expected. The scene of the intheknow Jews who attempt to flee into the sewer is ridiculous. They fight among themselves on who should go first physically stuff those into the hole who do not want to go and in a completely absurd aside a wife and her daughter refuse to escape with them because her husband has been cheating on her. Socha is true to his monetarily purchased word and leads this infighting rabble to an out of the way location in the sewer.The sewer maze is an impressive set design with the disgusting atmosphere to match. It is incredibly dark dirty rat infested cold and full of unimaginable pestilence. However compared to the massacre occurring right above their heads the sewer is safe. Unfortunately the sewer will not accommodate the amount of people in their group. Socha says he can only safely hide 10 of them and in a brutal scene the financier and leader of the group choose those 10. The others are left to their own volition. The group's leaders are the strong and able Mundek Benno Furrmann and the financier Ignacy Chiger Herbert Knaup.The Nazis and their Polish sympathizers know there are Jews hiding out in the sewers some residents can smell boiled onions coming up through their toilets. There is a bounty for whoever turns them in and if Socha is caught he will be shot right along with the captured Jews. The rest of In Darkness is a series of scenes of infighting amongst the Jews who are cramped in very tight and disgusting quarters and infighting between Socha and his wife and Socha and his assistant who is sometimes in on the scheme.These seemingly unending episodes of fighting and sniping become truly tedious after awhile. Scene after scene of this eventually gets under the audience's skin and they welcome the eventual ending after its 145 minute run time. Breaths of fresh air are provided by Mr. Chiger's two children who are a welcome respite from the malicious adults in the room and Socha's gradual metamorphosis from a financially motivated shelter provider to a man who realizes he has a soul which cares about these human beings.The cinematography and art direction of these sewers are really remarkable as is the contrast in lighting between the action which takes place above ground opposed to the events happening underneath. Unfortunately the script does not match the shadowy miseenscene and In Darkness suffers for it. This Polish film earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film but it is clear why it did not win. The muddled sequence of events and unending episodic turmoil morphs from a troubling World War II story to one of near irritation. A more adept script would have catapulted this film to much more notoriety than it is receiving now. There are a multitude of other World War II films to enjoy do not waste your time on this one.".

Scene after scene of this eventually gets under the audience's skin and they welcome the eventual ending after its 145 minute run time. Breaths of fresh air are provided by Mr. Chiger's two children who are a welcome respite from the malicious adults in the room and Socha's gradual metamorphosis from a financially motivated shelter provider to a man who realizes he has a soul which cares about these human beings.The cinematography and art direction of these sewers are really remarkable as is the contrast in lighting between the action which takes place above ground opposed to the events happening underneath. Unfortunately the script does not match the shadowy miseenscene and In Darkness suffers for it. This Polish film earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film but it is clear why it did not win. The muddled sequence of events and unending episodic turmoil morphs from a troubling World War II story to one of near irritation. A more adept script would have catapulted this film to much more notoriety than it is receiving now. There are a multitude of other World War II films to enjoy do not waste your time on this one.";

	schema:headline " YES  See In Darkness  Even If You've Seen Other Holocaust Movies!";
	schema:reviewBody "So many Holocaust movies Schindler's List The Reader Shoah Europa Europa. I knew In Darkness would be frightening depressing and disturbing. So I didn't want to watch In Darkness. Big mistake. In Darkness is a masterpiece. It's better than Schindler's List. Yes it is disturbing to watch but it is great art and great art even as it moves us to tears rewards us. You already know about the horrors of the Holocaust. The gift of In Darkness is that it transports the viewer to a better realm where the best of humanity shines in the worst darkness we humans have produced. That best of humanity is not just Socha the rescuer but the filmmakers who through their art tell the world Socha's story. In Darkness has a verisimilitude indeed a darkness that other Holocaust films do not. No one in this movie would look appropriate placed on a pedestal. Everyone here  Jews and rescuers  is a deeply flawed human being. The Jews hiding in the sewers look and act the way people hiding in sewers would look  filthy hungry and bedraggled they are sometimes petty jealous and vengeful. The film is dark and claustrophobic. The Nazis are not sexy and thrilling. They are murderous scum. Not only do characters speak Polish Yiddish German Ukrainian and Russian where appropriate they also spoke Balak a dialect typical of Poles living in Lwow. Krystyna Chiger who survived the sewer said she found the film so real it was hard to watch. None of the actors are well known outside of Poland or Germany so I was able to invest in them as the characters they were playing in a way that I could never invest in Schindler's List which of course featured big stars I'd seen in other films  Ralph Fiennes the handsome lover from The English Patient was suddenly giving an Oscarbait performance as a fat Nazi Ben Kingsley was no longer Gandhi but a Jew in a concentration camp. Robert Wieckiewicz as Leopold Socha gives one of the very best most absorbing most believable film performances I have ever seen. Wieckiewicz is utterly believable as a petty thief who makes one right choice that leads him onto a path that awakens his soul. He starts out as a rough guy an opportunist who isn't ready to be as cruel as life invites him to be. The Nazis are paying bonuses to anyone who turns in Jews. Socha already a petty criminal who had initially helped Jews for money could have made the choice to hand Jews over to the Nazis for even more money. He didn't. He decided to do the next kind thing. And the next. And the next. And he becomes of the most moving heroic people you will ever see on screen. If Socha's entirely believable transformation doesn't make you cry  you are tougher than I am. Benno Furmann is especially memorable as Mundek Margulies one of the Jews who escapes to the sewers. Furmann has pale blue eyes that shine out intensely in the dark sewer scenes communicating outrage sorrow panic and caged macho. The tense dynamic between him and Socha electrifies their scenes. Theirs is a malemale relationship utterly beyond what any current Hollywood buddy movie could hope to portray. Kinga Preis is quietly moving as Wanda Socha Leopold's plump and freckled earthgoddess wife. Maria Schrader as one of the Jewish women in hiding adds poignancy without doing anything showy. Michal Zurawski as Bortnik a Ukrainian who does the dirty work for the Nazis is very handsome sickening and terrifying. You can see that Socha could have turned out like his old friend Bortnik. But somehow he didn't. Why? Because Bortnik was Ukrainian not Polish  and thus treated differently by the Nazis? Because Bortnik was more handsome? We don't know. We just get the sense that before he made the one choice that set him on a path that would turn him into a beast Bortnik was probably much like his old pal Socha. In Darkness is a feature film not history lesson or a documentary but for this viewer it dramatized aspects of the Holocaust and of humanity that other Holocaust films have failed to adequately address or to address at all.I've never seen a film that brought home to me so vividly the mass killings of Poles that Nazis carried out. Of course I know about these killings but as Joseph Stalin allegedly said One death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic. In Darkness depicts a mass hanging of randomly selected Polish civilians killed in retaliation for the death of a German. This scene was orchestrated in such a way that it grabbed me as dry statistics on the page never have. In Darkness defies revisionist histories of World War Two that insist that Poles did nothing to help Jews and that Poles were enjoying the high life during the Nazi occupation. In Darkness makes clear  Nazis treated Poles with special brutality. Dramatic tension is never lost even as the viewer learns something he would never learn from something like Schindler's List. In Darkness focuses on a Pole who rescued Jews. This defies popular uses of the Brute Polak stereotype to rewrite World War Two history. Never for one minute though does In Darkness stop being a big involving tense moviemovie. You care about the characters. You are swept along by the action. You hold your breath during scenes of suspense. You root for success. You tear up when things go wrong. After all that has gone before the final scene as humble as it is is overwhelming. This is just a great film. See it.".

Schindler's List covered a much wider span all above ground with a longer time frame as well and yet failed miserably as it chose to tone down A LOT of what could have happened in reality given the weight of the situation. I expected more from it as it is not even realistically outstanding to some of the other commendable Holocaustrelated work of art. This film focuses not on the atrocities in the surface but more on the intricate details in its core matter  things happening underground. Roughly half of the film happens inside the sewers but with enough details that reminded me of Hunger even though the dire situation were not fullfledged in my opinion.We not only get to know of the conflicts between the hero his nonJew community against the Jews but also the conflicting portrayal of the Jews themselves who are not all onedimensional characters unlike in some other movies i.e. not overly depressed or in a state of hopelessness they actually hate each other some of them are annoying traitors greedy etc.I too believe things are pretty toned down as well in this film as living under the sewers in such a situation where the water rendered unusable the stench unbearable augmented by the stench of corpses absence of light hygiene and proneness to diseasesfatal accidents could easily cause multiple levels of discord and unwanted psychological behaviors.I have read that the director deviated from the real account a little as some of the characters 'killed' are actually survivors today. But in a way maybe it is for the better as the film is already disturbing enough.Also some of the scenes done above ground are a little bit unnatural...hence I could not grant a rating above 7 stars.

	schema:reviewBody "Like 'Schindler's List' 'In Darkness' is told from the perspective of the survivors. And since there were so few survivors of the Holocaust it's been said that such a perspective gives the wrong impression about what the Holocaust was all about. Are we to draw a message of hope when hope was extinguished in the vast majority of cases? In other words the survivors were the exception to the rule. Still it's through the perceptions of the survivors that we can gain an inkling of what the Holocaust was about. Veteran director Agnieszka Holland wisely made the decision to film 'In Darkness' in the native languages of the characters. Hence its verisimilitude feels superior to such English language films as Schindler's List. Most critics agree that Leopold Socha the petty thief and sewer worker who saved the lives of 11 Jews who spent over a year in the sewers of Lvov Poland now Lviv Ukraine is a complicated well scripted character. When we first meet him he's completely surprised when his wife Wanda informs him that Jesus was Jewish. What's more his comment Give a Jew a finger and he'll take your arm is pretty typical of many of his fellow countrymen at the time. Socha may harbor some basic prejudices but what motivates him is pure profit. Hence he has no problem risking his own life as long as there's the potential for significant financial remuneration.Similarly the Jewish characters are hardly depicted as saints either. Janek chooses his mistress Chaja over his wife and children when he enters the sewers. We meet Mundek a hustler who we see early on get punched in the face by a Polish man who's angry for selling him a counterfeit watch. Klara is seen beating her younger sister Mania who wants to return to the ghetto with the full knowledge that the Germans are in the process of wiping out her neighbors on the streets above. More less than stellar behavior emerges including Janek having sex with his mistress while the other survivors can see and hear them in their beds and Janek and a compatriot abandoning the group and leaving Chaja who ends up concealing her pregnancy and then smothering her baby.Some critics felt 'In Darkness' employed too many underdeveloped 'stock' characters where only Janek turns out be the true 'villain' amongst the sewer dwellers. Even Mundek adopts the heroic mantle when he leaves the sewers to search for Klara's missing sister. And the Chigers with their two cute kids prove to be closest to saintliness in the depiction of the Jewish victims here. Nonetheless I would argue that the characterizations of Socha's 'Jews' are less important than the film's plot which moves along like a suspense thriller not only educating us about the mechanics of the Holocaust but conveying the sheer terror which the survivors experienced.The film's exposition neatly provides us with a series of iconic images that set the stage for more and more horrors to come. After Socha and his partner Saczepek burglarize the German officer's home and make their escape they can't avoid catching a glimpse of a group of naked Jewish women being forced to run through the forest at the behest of German soldiers pointing machine guns at them gunshots are heard and we see all the women lying dead in a field. Next cut to the ghetto where German soldiers cut and tear off the beard of a religious Jew who screams in pain. Even more importantly we're introduced to Socha's exprison buddy Bortnik now a member of a Ukrainian militia collaborating with the Nazis. The film makes the important point that in the Eastern European countries often members of the local populace were directly responsible for doing the Germans' dirty work.Perhaps the most disturbing scene is the liquidation of the ghetto. Holland brilliantly conveys the horror first from Socha and Saczepek's perspective. As they run through the sewers we can hear the machine gun blasts and screams of terror from above. Only then does the camera shift upward as if we've penetrated through to the street and we're able to see what's going on above. Holland then focuses on Klara running to find her childrenshe only has time to catch glimpses behind her as various people have already been killed or are in the process of being mowed down.What will grip you about 'In Darkness' is how the stakes are continually raised from scene to scene Socha's 'Sophie's Choice' decision to save only 11 people Socha almost being mistaken for a Jew by Ukrainian militiamen and saved by Bortnik Mania's disappearance Bortnik informing Socha about the smell of onions in a toilet and then almost finding Socha's group Socha finding the other group dead Janek's breakdown Mr. Chiger's revelation about the jewelry Janek leaving the group Mundek choking Socha Mundek and Socha killing the German Socha finding the children which which leads to his transformation Socha finding Sczepek hanged following the German's reprisals the discovery by the Polish man of Socha's group and how he moves them to a new location Mundek almost getting killed by the German officer and then sneaking into the work camp Choja killing her baby The flood and Socha's final confrontation with Bortnik leading to the arrival of the Russians and the group's liberation.Not everything works in the film. For example how does Socha happen to be in the right place and the right time twice? at the very moment Mundek is discovered by the German soldier and when he also overhears the Polish man screaming about how he's found Jews in the sewer.The cast is quite strong including Robert Wieckiewicz who's completely believable as the tough and bigoted sewer worker turned righteous Gentile. Being halfCatholic and halfJewish director Holland has sympathy for all the victims here but never sugarcoats reality. 'In Darkness' is a disturbing film which needs to be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Darkness was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar for 2012 and you can rightly assume it's a very good movie. The only real problems with it are that there already are many movies about the Holocaust and the film's theme is a bit like that you'll find in films like The Shop on Main Street and Schindler's List. But it is well worth your time.The film is based on a true story that happened in the town of Lvov Poland during WWII. A group of Jews in the ghetto knew that the end was near and in a desperate move they tunneled into the sewer system. However it was a confusing maze and they wouldn't have had a prayer of finding their way through the system. However a sewer worker and parttime thief finds the folks and agrees to help themif they pay! Leopold Socha initially had no interest in these Jewshe just wanted the money. However as the film progresses it becomes obvious that he's grown to care about these people and often risks his life to save them. A small group of Jews he keeps hidden in the sewer for 14 monthsmuch of the film is about this small group.The film is compelling with very good acting and direction. I was amazed to see how horrible film conditions werewith lots of slogging through mucky water and dirty. It must have been a very uncomfortable shoot and I was impressed with the detailshow it really looked as if they were filming in the sewers. Fascinating.".

Persecuted on all sides by Germans Poles and Ukrainian Nazicollaborators there is nowhere to look but below the manholes into the waste and ratinfested sewers running below the city of Lvov. Polish sewer worker Leopold Socha and his friend Sczcepek are willing to give refuge to the Jews as a means of supplementing their income. It's risky as discovery would mean certain death for them and their families as well. Director Agnieszka Holland screenwriter David F.

The Darkness encompasses the ignorance sadism and blind hatred of the era as well as the subterranean world in which a handful of people cling to life. Robert Wieckiewicz gives a great performance as Socha. A simple man he is reticent to question the authorities or commonly held prejudices. The supporting cast is excellent including Weronika Rosati as a woman who's concealing a secret that could jeopardize all their lives and Agnieszka Grochowska as Klara who loses her younger sister when she flees the sewers. Based on Robert Marshall's book In the Sewers of Lvov this is tough stuff and a powerful indictment of our capacity for cruelty and hypocrisy.".

In Darkness W ciemnosci directed by Agnieszka Holland is the true story of a sewer worker that saves the lives of a group of Jews. Leopold Socha Robert Wieckiewicz is a Pole living in Lwow now called Lviv and part of Ukraine in Nazi occupied Poland. He doesn't go out of his way to become a hero but rather he stumbles on the opportunity to make money hiding Jews in the sewers he knows so well.Lwow has a rich history for both Poles and Jews that spans many centuries while today both of these groups are only small minorities with a mix of ethnicities including Ukrainians coexisting peacefully before the war. With the conflict running its course selfinterest and survival are the two primary motivations most people are left with. Leopold risks not only his own life but also that of his entire family by assisting the survival of anyone Jewish. The Germans meted out a quick punishment of death to the Poles who tired any heroics. Both the group of Jews and Leopold have some reservations and distrust in each other but as time goes on their business arrangement turns into much more.In Darkness doesn't spare us the brutal events of war and will be quite shocking for some viewers. I would say the film is inappropriate for children for a number of reasons and the squeamish may also find it hard to watch. However the violence isn't gratuitous as it only adds to what really went on. The realism is also enhanced by the fact that several languages are used in this movie including Polish Yiddish German and Ukrainian.No other subject has received as much attention in Polish cinema as World War II. Some say these films acted as a catharsis for the whole country after it witnessed so many horrors. While this still may hold true these movies also educate their audiences to history many are unaware of. While In Darkness doesn't try to overload us with historical facts or dates as it subtlety informs us of how life was like in Nazi occupied Poland. We get a good look at the chaotic and brutal way of life people had to endue and come away with an appreciation that things should never be that away again.".

Marshall dedicated his book to the memory of Leopold Socha a former criminal who became a Ukrainian sewer worker and made it his life's atonement to save a few Jews out of the murdered millions. Tragically soon after he was able to bring his Jews back to daylight Socha was killed in an accident. This extraordinary story has been adapted for the screen by David F.

The actors who portray the Jews  adults and children  are equally superb. The cinematography is by Jolanta Dylewska and the spare but touching musical score is by Antoni Lazarkiewicz.Though Holland takes us through the terror and misery these people suffered she adds at the end of the film some facts that are appalling. In addition to offering the numbers of the Jews slaughtered during the war and the eventual division of lands and homes destroyed by the Nazis she adds some facts that are heartwarming such as in 1978 Socha and his wife were awarded the title Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel.This is a very powerful film brilliant in every aspect and one that deserves very wide attention to the peoples of the world.

This was a time historically when the women were a greater driving force in the social and economic rebuilding of the nation than were the men who were both lacking in credibility following the horrors and the mess of the years past and somewhat dazed by what the nation had just been through. As she builds that life and in so doing helps to rebuild the nation however she finds that she may have sacrificed too much.It is a movie worth watching in order to gain some understanding of what life was like in Germany from 1945 to roughly 1970. Rainer Fassbinder makes use of images in places which show the transition of German society from broken ruins to economic superpower the changing status of women in German society over that time period the changing attitudes both within Germany and from outside toward Germany and the sacrifices that women were prepared to make in order to build the Germany that they ultimately did. It also asks though if the singleminded pursuit of rebuilding the nation economically and materially did not take too much out of the nation and the people in other areas.I enjoyed the movie and am happy to recommend it.".

No sugar coating just pure unadulterated truth as seen through the rearview mirror of people who have lived the horrors and survived into new tomorrows. A true gem of a film!";

While climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband Hermann her man and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him for their future happy life together.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS This is without a doubt the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. Film starts out with Maria Schygulla and Hermann Braun Klaus Lowitsch just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancerprostitute in a club that caters to American GI's and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill Greg Eagles and they start to see one another on a steady basis. Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door. He hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out. The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald Ivan Desny who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job. Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her. Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get over everything that Maria has done since he has been locked up.SPOILER ALERTOne day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they're marriage even though they have been married for some time now. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it.There are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths. Like in all Fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn Germany but as Maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white. The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of Maria. Fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in Germany at that time. Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla wasn't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke. I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Maria purposely left the gas on. Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad. This is only speculation and if you think I'm wrong please email me. I think she was overly excited by Hermann being home and left it on by accident Remember her putting on a dress for no reason?. Then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing. Thats the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes its by accident. But I think the reason for Fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate. In his view Maria can't have it both ways. A fascinating film.".

It seems to me that if one views the characters as representatives of some of the major world views obtaining during the reconstruction period one sees a few of the many different human reactions there can be to such an experience Many feel burned out and can't feel hope any longer others like Maria feel there is at least money and position to be gained under the new dispensation some simply don't care others try to feed off the experience without contributing and so on and so forth.It also occurred to me that at age 60 I may be in a position to appreciate this film more and certainly to be more understanding of and sympathetic with the characterstypes portrayed.  I found each of them to have an important story to tell whether it was a good story or not.  And the character of the Black US Army Sergeant while tragic at the end was itself an essay in human relations that has to embarrass most Americans  the fleeting moments when he and Maria found joy and pleasant times together were just wonderful to behold and an indictment of our sad history in that regard.View it and see what you think!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Marriage of Maria Braun 1979 was the first part of director Rainer Werner Fassbinder's celebrated trilogy of films that looked specifically at the period following the end of the Second World War and in particular the sociopolitical and economic rebirth of Germany following the Wirtschaftswunder. All three films in the trilogy look at these situations through the eyes of a strongwilled arrogant and determined femaleprotagonist who strives against all odds to achieve the kind of lifestyle that she has always desired but once she does finds herself still feeling empty and lacking in spirit. The characters in these films come to represent Fassbinder's own feelings about the Germany of this particular period whilst simultaneously acting as an allegorical portrayal and deeper interpretation of the qualities and characteristics of the country itself.Fassbinder opens this richly political film not with a scene of screaming polemic but with a bust of action and a sense of jarring confusion. Using staccato editing techniques and elaborate visual compositions that obscure and fragment large portions of the frame in much the same way as his earlier films  such as The Merchant of Four Seasons 1972 Fox and his Friends 1974 and Mother Kusters' Trip to Heaven 1975 but with the harsher more Brechtian inspired sense of deliberate distraction found in later films like The Third Generation 1979 and In a Year of 13 Moons 1978  Fassbinder is able to take us completely off guard creating a misleading sense of what the film might be whilst simultaneously developing a number of themes and motifs that will reoccur throughout. The scene in question captures the wedding of our central character Maria to the soontobe shipped off soldier Herrmann Braun as a procession of falling bombs destroy the small chapel and the surrounding area of their village. It is to this day one of the most startling opening sequences from any of Fassbinder's work with the wartime iconography use of ironic onscreen intertitles freezeframes and the continual punctuation of loud explosions and jarring cuts in the editing all grabbing our attention right from the off.From this set up Fassbinder uses the situation to explore the eventual ideas of faith loyalty and betrayal incorporating an early subplot in which Maria  who earnestly believes that her husband has been killed in battle  begins a passionate relationship with one of the American G.I.s who hangs out at the bar where she works. The notions that arise from this set up are the same notions and themes that will be fleshed out in the films that would follow with the external similarities of plot and location being found in the next film Lola 1981 whilst the internal angst and ideas of loneliness and despair can be found in the final film Veronika Voss 1982. Following the return of her husband and his subsequent incarceration Maria begins her odyssey into selfpreservation and economic rebirth by exploiting her surroundings and the offers of others  no matter how seemingly suspect  in order to secure herself a more comfortable future that we know is ultimately unattainable.Lola the second film in the trilogy which took its inspiration from Josef Von Sternberg's The Blue Angel 1930 would eventually look at how that same sense of opportunism greed and determination can be used for more selfish reasons sowing the seeds of tragedy and eventual air of blind exploitation that would come full circle with the third film Veronika Voss. Veronika Voss exists in very much the same cinematic universe as the two other films that formed the backbone of what would eventually become known as the BRD trilogy though Fassbinder himself had often talked of plans to make more films in a similar vein  analysing postwar German history through to the present day  but was unable to continue the theme due to his untimely death in June of 1982. Regardless The Marriage of Maria Braun skilfully establishes the ideas that would go towards forming the dramatic nucleus of these two subsequent works depicting the sense of determination and the sheer triumph of will that went towards rebuilding Germany from the ashes of the Second World War through the eyes of a resolute young woman willing to push her own emotional stability to breaking point in order to secure a better future for her and her incarcerated husband.To me it is startling to think that Fassbinder could begin something as obviously political and large of scale as the film in question only a few months after having completed the incredibly personal and controversial In a Year of 13 Moons and the similarly controversial but very much satirical The Third Generation with the entire look feel and evocative period recreation of The Marriage of Maria Braun seeming lightyears away from the harsh unglamorous and unflinching depictions of late 1970's Frankfurt and Berlin with their various homosexual and pseudoradical subcultures. There are continual overlapping themes to tie them all together but at times it really does feel like the work of a completely different filmmaker almost as if Fassbinder had a shadowy alterego who made painfully honest and personal films alongside his more largescale and popular works. Not to say that this doesn't have its personal moments and of course there is still that ending with its ironic and almost melodramatic mark of devastation and the almost subversive sense of mocking satire that is something that only Fassbinder could pull off.The Marriage of Maria Braun is without question one of the highpoint of Fassbinder's alltoo brief career and one of the crowning achievements of the onceradical New German Cinema movement. It remains along with the other two films of the BRD trilogy  a fitting testament to his enormous talent and underappreciated genius not only as a director of actors and a communicator of ideas but as a serious filmmaker with a peerless grasp of editing design music and cinematography.".

She says of the two men the American soldier and poor old and sick Oswald that she's fond of them and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and soulsearching husband Hermann sends from Canada after being released from prison. She's casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce but understand where she's coming from and going all the way.Fassbinder employs this inherent contradiction and moments with Maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama for example Hermann walking in on the jubilant and halfnaked Maria and GI is just about a masterpiece of a scene with Maria's reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he's there let alone alive while sticking to his guns as a director of such highminded technique with a storyline that should be predictable. But it isn't really. It's like one big metaphor for a country that after the war couldn't really move on to normalcy. A few times Fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background and we see Maria walking around her family house hustle and bustle going on around her and the radio speaks of a divided Germany of things still very unsettled of a disarray. Maybe the only way to cope is excess or maybe that's just my interpretation of it.It's hard to tell really under Schygulla's stare face and eyes anyway. It's such an incredible performance really one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an oldtime Hollywood female star while with the downanddirty ethic of a girl of the streets. Most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband where she stars in one of those superlustful black lingerie pieces and high heels and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it. That's almost the essence of what Maria is and Schygulla wonderfully gets it down a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her sometimes in a single sentence. This is what Fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his trilogy while I might overall prefer Veronika Voss as a masterpiece Maria Braun is perhaps just as good as a character study of what makes a woman tick and tock with almost nothing to lose.".

	schema:headline " An Allegory of Germany";
	schema:reviewBody "The Marriage of Maria Braun tells the story of postwar Germany as seen by a young woman the title character Maria Braun. The film opens in 1943 with Maria's marriage to a soldier named Hermann Braun. After only a day spent together Hermann must return to his unit and is later posted as missing presumed dead on the Russian front. After the war we find Maria like most Germans during this period living in desperate poverty but she finds work as a bar hostess and believing her husband to be dead becomes the lover of Bill a black soldier with the American occupation forces who helps to support her financially. At least Bill is supposed to be American but whoever wrote his dialogue seems to have been more familiar with British than with American English. He makes far more frequent use of the expletive bloody than any American I have come across. Subsequent developments involve Hermann's unexpected return to Germany after being held in a Soviet prison camp his imprisonment for the killing of Bill a crime actually committed by Maria herself and Maria's life as the mistress of Karl a wealthy industrialist.The French film critic Jean de Baroncelli saw Maria Braun as an allegory of Germany a character that wears flashy and expensive clothes but has lost her soul. There is certainly some truth in this comparison but I felt it might perhaps be more accurate to say that it is the marriage of Maria and Hermann which is an allegory of the plight of Germany during the Cold War years. When the film was made in the late seventies the country had been partitioned between East and West ever since the end of World War II more than thirty years earlier and hopes of reunification seemed destined to remain unfulfilled. Few people in 1979 could have predicted that the Berlin Wall would fall in only ten years time. Maria who sells herself to an American for nylon stockings and cigarettes and is later seduced by a capitalist can therefore be seen as symbolising the flashy and prosperous if rather soulless West Germany while Hermann held prisoner by the Soviets represents the Communist East.The director Rainer Werner Fassbinder was one of the leading members of the New German Cinema group of auteurs of the late sixties seventies and eighties. He had the reputation of being an arthouse director but this film is one of his more approachable works. Despite numerous clashes between Fassbinder and his collaborators clashes which led to an acrimonious lawsuit which was to continue even after the director's death it was both a critical and a commercial success in West Germany and despite its political subtext was also shown in cinemas in the East.Many European films from the Cold War years have since lost much of their relevance but this one still remains watchable today. The lovely Hanna Schygulla who had earlier appeared in some of Fassbinder's other films such as Effi Briest succeeds in making Maria a brilliantly realised character and in persuading us of the central truth of the film namely that whatever her relationships with Bill and Karl it is Hermann who is really her true love and that in her heart she stays true to him. She reminds us that The Marriage of Maria Braun is not just a film about postwar Germany and certainly not just a film about politics but also a human drama with a very human character at its centre. 610".

	schema:headline " The Marriage of Maria Braun. To be just as cold as required";
	schema:reviewBody "The Marriage of Maria Braun MMB is about a German girl Maria getting married to a German soldier Herman Braun just at the ending of the war. After being married for half a day and a night Herman is send to the front again. To make ends meet Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. She got word that Herman died at the front and things develop between her and the American soldier. Herman walks in on them in bed and after a confrontation between him and the American Maria killed the American. Herman admits to the murder ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. The country is in shambles one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette. There are food shortages. It is in short a time of survival of the fittest. Basically this film projects Maria's attitudes  those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances as a metaphor for Germany's loss of soul after they lost the war and how it proceeds to rebuild itself. For example Maria has the following conversation with a peddler played by Fassbinder himself the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that Kleist burns out to quickly it does not provide enough heat for the cold. The peddler answers That's another way to look at it. Right now it's probably the correct way. Maria meets a FrenchGerman business man Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment. She decides to get involve with Karl You're not having an affair with me I'm having an affair with you. She also takes responsibility in the company and after a while has the complete trust of the firm. When Karl says I suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle she replies I prefer making miracles  then wait for them. In her own words she has become the Mata Hari of the economic miracle.In a lot of Fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms see Freud in other words he liked pointing his camera at the bullsht the false social mechanisms the pretending. The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology. For example she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point I need someone to sleep with. As Fassbinder said the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society. He also remarked that his films are anti emotional. I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant apparently frequently visited by Hitler himself. Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side as if Maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore. Karl says I have to tell myself over and over that I love life. Maria replies That's life isn't it. As if we signed a contract to enjoy life. And then we go out to eat and talk about food. I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships to never submit completely to anyone. And why would you if the central matter of most of his films is about What love becomes in this society  a commodity an instrument of power a weapon.It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war  with these clothing essentially the wrong period. What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great. But Fassbinder was not interested in perfection. Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project. Since he completed films approximately 4 a year the way other people rolled cigarettes it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes. Peter Marthesheimer who wrote most of the script mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park overnight. Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria. Mostly she just stares bluntly into the camera. In Maria's own words It is a bad time for emotions. But I like it like that. There are different opinions about the end. After Karl died of a hart attack Herman finally shows up. Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison to become human again. After the testament is delivered made out to her and Herman in half Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette and blow her and Herman up. For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. At the same time she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. She felt as if she had outlived herself.".

For example Maria has the following conversation with a peddler played by Fassbinder himself the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that Kleist burns out to quickly it does not provide enough heat for the cold. The peddler answers That's another way to look at it. Right now it's probably the correct way. Maria meets a FrenchGerman business man Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment. She decides to get involve with Karl You're not having an affair with me I'm having an affair with you. She also takes responsibility in the company and after a while has the complete trust of the firm. When Karl says I suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle she replies I prefer making miracles  then wait for them. In her own words she has become the Mata Hari of the economic miracle.In a lot of Fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms see Freud in other words he liked pointing his camera at the bullsht the false social mechanisms the pretending. The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology. For example she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point I need someone to sleep with. As Fassbinder said the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society. He also remarked that his films are anti emotional. I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant apparently frequently visited by Hitler himself. Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side as if Maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore. Karl says I have to tell myself over and over that I love life. Maria replies That's life isn't it. As if we signed a contract to enjoy life. And then we go out to eat and talk about food. I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships to never submit completely to anyone. And why would you if the central matter of most of his films is about What love becomes in this society  a commodity an instrument of power a weapon.It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war  with these clothing essentially the wrong period. What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great. But Fassbinder was not interested in perfection. Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project. Since he completed films approximately 4 a year the way other people rolled cigarettes it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes. Peter Marthesheimer who wrote most of the script mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park overnight. Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria. Mostly she just stares bluntly into the camera. In Maria's own words It is a bad time for emotions. But I like it like that. There are different opinions about the end. After Karl died of a hart attack Herman finally shows up. Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison to become human again. After the testament is delivered made out to her and Herman in half Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette and blow her and Herman up. For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. At the same time she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. She felt as if she had outlived herself.";

The madness depicted in this one seen is really dependent on the sound. The sound of machine gun fire and bombing raid siren the baby crying and Beethoven playing in the background becomes the intensity and emotion that Maria feels but cannot or will not express. The sounds from this opening scene can also act as narratives paralleling Maria's dreadful life. I find it interesting that the baby's cry is the only sign of young people in the entire film.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Marriage of Maria Braun' is German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder's bestknown and most financially successful movie and it's not hard to see why it's a big event a tour de force. This melodrama tells the story of an audacious beautiful woman who puts her survival instinct to use during the early postwar era when capitalist West Germany arose from the ashes. The film begins as she's getting married amidst the chaos of the last day of World War II in 1945 and much of what follows has to do with the peculiar way in which she devotes herself to her absent yet somehow always present idealized husband. The character of Maria is fascinating as a person but it also serves as an allegory for Germany during this period of reconstruction now generally referred to as the economic miracle Wirtschaftswunder. Hanna Shygulla gives a perfect performance as the gorgeous and strongwilled Maria. She and Fassbinder were close and had worked together in many plays and films including 'The Bitter Tears of Eva Von Kant' in 1972. By the time they made 'The Marriage of Maria Braun' in 1979 four years had passed since their last collaboration so they both regarded it as a special reunion. To me the film is a testament of the director's nostalgia and adoration for his diva. He was infamously difficult with many of his actors and actresses yet is said to have treated Shygulla with a special kind of tenderness and I believe it shows here. Fassbinder was openly gay but married twice. His relationships with his first wife Ingrid Caven and Moroccan male lover El Hedi Ben Salem both important actors in his films are known to have been especially tempestuous. This pattern of lovehate may reflect on some of the characters in his work. He was accused perhaps unfairly by some feminists of being misogynistic and by some gay critics of being homophobic. I haven't watched enough of his films to have an opinion on this. But I sense there's a very particular mixed energy projected onto the character of Maria Braun who is both hero and antihero someone who has an admirable tenacity to overcome adversity yet is willing to prostitute herself and stop at nothing in order to accomplish her goals. It's this complexity that makes the film interesting. Nothing here is easily spelled out as right or wrong.'The Marriage of Maria Braun' is the first part of Fassbinder's BRD Bundesrepublik Deutschland trilogy along with 'Veronica Voss' 1982 and 'Lola' 1981 which is made available as a set by the Criterion Collection. 'Veronica Voss' was filmed last but is meant to be viewed as the second part of the trilogy.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER The Marriage of Maria BraunFassbinderThey weren't kidding when they said the movie would be rated R by American standards.  The movie definitely had some twists to it also.  In the beginning Maria was happy.  Her and her husband had just gotten married right before he was sent away.  She spent everyday looking for him to get off the train.  When Betti's husband told her that Hermann was dead it didn't take her long to find someone new but she never forgot him in her mind.  The day he comes home and finds her about to sleep with another black man she chooses to show her devotion to Herman by hitting Bill over the head with a bottle until he falls on the bed.She clearly takes after her mother when it comes to men.  She goes home for her mom's birthday and Maria meets her mom's new good acquaintance' while she's there.  Maria definitely goes from one man to the other with ease. She has no problem talking to Hermann in prison and then going to Mr. Oswald's arms right after.  Maria has very extreme emotions.  She goes from being calm and mysterious at work to loud and advasive when Oswald calls. She is very outgoing in my opinion.  She goes in for a job interview and tells the man that he won't need anyone else after he hires her she tells Oswald she'll never marry him but she'll be his mistress for the time being. Maria yells at her mother when her mom tries to give her advice and there are many other situations where I wasn't expecting a reaction like the way she did.The ending was also interesting.  She lights her first cigarette on the stove and turns the stove off.  Then she and Hermann both undress until the door bell rings.  She excuses herself to go and get dressed they show her running water across her arm she then lights another cigarette and purposefully leaves the stove on.  Atleast I think she left the stove on purposefully this time.  She clearly knew to turn off the stove especially after she did it right the first time.  I didn't understand why she ran water over her arm though.  Obviously Fassbinder wanted to foreshadow that she was going to try and kill herself but she seemed very happy at the time.  She and Hermann were together again Oswald was gone and she had his money.  I wasn't expecting the ending to be so sudden or so dramatic. The interesting thing about the ending was that first they showed her running the water on her arm hinting that she wanted to kill herself.  At the end she killed herself and Hermann also.  I wonder if she was planning on doing that the whole time.  Clearly no one knew about her plans to kill herself and it had never crossed my mind that the movie would end that way before the ending scene.  Although after doing my research on Fassbinder I should have expected something like that to happen at the end.  I did like the movie because it was interesting to me.  I enjoy shock value in movies also because the can keep your attention.  I was also happy that I got to see one of Fassbinder's movies because I think it could help me understand the information I have been reading on him.".

The filmmaker is very dispassionate about attempting to convince you one way or the other if it was a possession or a woman's psychological breakdown and I find that most appealing. The US version also tried to ride the fence in a sense but it was more obvious which side it picked as there were many horror movie moments not present in this version. The acting was universally GREAT and all actors were so very convincing in their roles. It will be interesting to see how American audiences that venture out to see this version accept it It will NOT be the hit that Emily Rose was here as this will be considered an art film in America and I doubt will be widely released. Look for it in the US and check it out!".

It would have been very easy to show the mother as a cruel an twisted woman but instead you could empathise with her she thought she was doing the best for her daughter and that made the whole thing more tragic but also more real and beautiful.To me the central message of the film was that life however short is something to celebrate. The girl makes references to St Katarina who only lived a short time but did many wonderful things. She may not have escaped her strict and cruel mother for long but at least she did it and had a wonderful time for a while.I kept having to tell myself they were actors. The depiction of the girl's first kiss at college was unlike any other I've seen. They captured the clumsiness and true feeling of the situation perfectly.And finally the soundtrack  you'd think that deep purple wrote 'Anthem' for this film. Earlier we see her dancing ecstatically to the track when she's finally free at college and then we later see the relevance when it's used to play out at the end of the film.I'm not sure I'll ever see a better film that this and I recommend it to anyone who occasionally likes to be moved by a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Requiem works for many reasonsan intelligent script understated direction a somewhat verite camera stylebut most of all it works because of Sandra Huller. For all of Michaela's exceptionalism at no point could I doubt this character. As a recovering Catholic myself I'm sensitive to the role religion especially Catholicism plays in people's lives and Huller in my opinion creates the real thing implicit faith that needs neither to advertise nor to apologize. Michaela's faith isn't about doctrine or rules but the meaning of lifemore specifically about living the meaning of one's own life including its less attractive implications. Her faith makes her vulnerable to the devil or if you prefer to her imagination that the devil is messing with her but her faith also endows her growing suffering and her eventual death which she clearly foresees note her reference to martyrdom in one of the last scenes with an abundance of the same meaning that has sustained her life. She is peaceful at the end I must walk my path to the end. That may be hard for a nonreligious person to understand but to someone raised on stories of the great saints as Michaela was it makes perfect sense. It is even something to be grateful for.Requiem pulls off a bit of cinematic legerdemain in making Michaela a relatively open nonfanatical nonprudish woman in spite of the depth of her faith. Her reallife original Anneliese Michel wasn't much like that. She was a very conservative Catholic deeply opposed to the liberalization then occurring in the Catholic church after the Vatican Council. Her death and the subsequent trial of her parents and the exorcists forced a kind of confrontation at least in Germany between Catholic traditionalism which has an entirely literal belief in spiritual realities and regards demonic possession and exorcism as established facts and ecclesiastical modernism which is embarrassed by such medieval notions and therefore preferred to take the position that Michel was merely mentally disturbed. And if she were did she suffer any the less? Was her faith any less meaningful to her? Traditionalists regard Michel her parents and the exorcists as martyrs to a modernist church disloyal to its Christian past and Michel's grave is today a pilgrimage site primarily for conservative Catholics. You'd never guess any of this from Requiem's very sympathetic treatment of her story.".

Along the semester Michaela befriends her former high school mate Hanna Imhof Anna Blomeier that forces her to seek medical assistance and falls in love for the student of chemistry Stefan Weiser Nicholas Reinke.

When she has an intense breakdown her mother together with priest Borchert decide to exorcise her with tragic consequences. Requiem is an impressive dramatic movie about the fight between religion and science. In accordance with the introduction of this film the story would be based on a true event. The acting is wonderful giving credibility to the plot and the dialogs and characters present a great discussion between the dogmatic religion and reason. Michaela is very well developed and it is easy to understand her confused state of mind since she had a repressed and overprotected upbringing. Hannah represents the logic and the reason Marianne and priest Borchert represent the backward and dogmatic side of the church Karl and priest Landauer represent the inbetween these two sides. Requiem is not a pleasant or entertaining feature but highly recommended for fans of a powerful drama with magnificent acting and the excellent German cinema. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Requiem".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen both The Exorcism of Emily Rose and this one and found Requiem to be far better and realistic than the other. Emily Rose in my opinion was supposed to be commercial Hollywood film. It lulled me to sleep whereas Requiem kept me interested during its entirety. The chief reason for this being the phenomenal performance by the lead actress.The direction of the film is great as well since it clearly allows the viewers to form their own decision whether the girl is possessed or schizophrenic. Viewers make their decisions based on which side of the faith they lie. It runs a bit slow but is an excellent psychodrama devoid of any gratuitous scary scenes.So overall in case you like scary stuff watch Emily Rose which is not such a great scary movie either. However if you like psychological dramas and do not wish to watch movies that make you jump out of your seat watch this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie doesn't have a clear message. Instead the title requiem really shows what this is about looking at a person's life in every aspect of it. So the storytelling has to be much more from a distant viewpoint. Some may call this documentarystyle as it seems to show a real social case study. Personally it reminded me a little bit of the early Scorseses style of moviemaking e.g. taxi driver neutral viewpoint but still subtle messages within and finally the big clash in the ending when all strings of the story developed throughout the movie come together. For me this is the best way of doing such a movie. First everything feels so normal as you watch the movie. In the end extreme situations begin to develop. Because you know the context even it is a really extreme situation it seems to be not at all inexplicable but very real which it actually was. I could personally feel the helplessness with this situation because I could not blame anybody in the movie there was not a side who did anything wrong on purpose. All are just human beings who are presented perfectly and believable through very good acting. The final shot of the girl's face with background organ music expresses many feelings I have about the movie.All in all it is a very good movie but of course it still does not feel as great as some of the best movies of the time. 9 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "To be frank I completely disagree with the above critique. I found this film quite moving and very sad  I still can't stop thinking about.I thought the way it was shot moved it along fairly nicely and was thankfully fairly anti Hollywood which was a nice relief. Of course most Americans will probably not enjoy it because it's too subtle nothing explodes and they actually have to think for a change rather than being told how to feel. If Hollywood had done this film it would have been all moody lighting scary music and SFX  it would have been just another badly done version of The Exorcist which I think is also a great film. I think what I found the most interesting was that because this film was done in such an understated manner you could actually understand what Michaella was going through in a much more realistic believable manner. There is a beautiful scene where near the end of the film Michaella's boyfriend takes her to her parents house because she is in such a bad state. She is soon surrounded by her parents and two priest all praying and chanting at her trying to exorcise her demons  her boyfriend steps away as he really doesn't know where to put himself or what to do as he watches the chanting  he looks like he is witnessing the dark ages of superstition all completely anachronistic to the time he lives in. Documentary style was a great choice  there were no true good or bad guys. And Michaella truly believed that she was possessed. So in a really strange way it was more an analysis of faith and belief. At the end of the day she her family and the creepy priest all absolutely believed that she was possessed therefore she was. Was that a good or bad thing considering that nowadays most people barely believe anything at all? Maybe she did fight an epic battle against demons for our souls like Saint Margarita  can anyone prove otherwise?".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard nothing of the true story on which this was based beforehand but the opening lines indicate that this is really not a strict presentation but a jumping off point. That's fine because movies in general are very poor at rendering true events. It is really a character study using events as a springboard.Note this has spoilers coming up. The movie is presented in a stark almost documentary style. It presents us with a young woman who is torn between two worldsthe one she has known and its obligations and restrictions and comforts and the world she is about to know with its freedoms and excitement and scariness. She leaves the small town for life as a young adult in a university. We see her starting out and wonder if she can cope. She gets made fun of somewhat on the first day of class for example. But she does cope and starts to really come into her own. Doing well in class having friends and a first love. But her illness comes into the fore once again and eventually kills any hope of independence.Personally I'm not religious and that may color my take but this film seems to strongly suggest religion as folly. It doesn't beat you over the head with it but it's there. She suffers from epilepsy and the film mentions the prospect of psychogenic psychosis as being the cause of her delusions. The same physical abnormalities in the brain that cause epilepsy can also cause damage to the part that senses reality and sense of self. Someone raised in a strict religious household can easily interpret this as signs of God or the Devil or whatever. At the time medications were pretty much hit or miss and so it seemed cruelly hopeless to sufferers who kept getting a 'miss'. It wasn't as clearly understood then either.The film succeeds in showing what well meaning but clueless people can do when they yield to superstition. The main character's best friend a beautiful friendship! really represents the opposing view. She keeps trying to take her to a hospital and tells her these visions are due to another cause but alas religion has an answer to every rational impulse. It's also interesting that her episodes occur in times of greater stress especially her parents visiting or being scolded by her mother.The casting for this movie is fantastic. Every actor large and small played their role perfectly a rare feat. From the virtuoso performance of Sandra Huller to every side character like her character's sister. The only thing keeping this from a ten the ending was unsettled. Too abrupt seemed unnatural somehow.".

It is closer to something Lars Von Trier might have done ten years ago. The words you will see most often used to describe it are subtle and understated. It is very effective at showing what it might have really been like to be a young girl with this affliction. It does not sensationalize or exploit Michaela but rather uses her story to make us think about how faith affects us among other things.I thought it was extremely well done. I was just in the mood for something else when I happened to watch it. I had seen Emily Rose and thought this would be a more psychological retelling of those events but it is a completely different side of the story.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the story of a young college girl who is emotionally disturbedand perhaps possessed. The story follows her during her first semester in college and ends rather abruptly when priests get involved and begin the rite of exorcism.REQUIEM and THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE are both based on the same real life case that involved a German girl named Anneliese Michel. Both stories are rather loosely based on the actual case as names and other details have been changed. In addition THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE and REQUIEM have different focuses and I think if at all possible you should see bothas both view the story from very different points of view.EMILY ROSE focuses much more on the problem behavior that might indicate the girl was indeed possessed. In addition it deals a lot with the aftermaththe trial for negligent homicide that actually occurred when the priests involved with the case were tried for her death.REQUIEM focuses on a less supernatural story. While Michaela i.e. Emily or Anneliese showed some behaviors that would seem like possession most of her behaviors were more consistent with the diagnosis of schizophrenia and the epilepsy was talked about as something that preceded the possession. Additionally the story ended well before the American versionwith only a brief paragraph flashed across the screen to tell what happened during the last years of her life.EMILY ROSE is stronger with conveying a mood of sadness and terror. Additionally the story seems much more complete. REQUIEM on the other hand is more realistic and easier to believe but the ending seems very abrupt and less satisfying. Plus in the German version the priests seem much more like idiots.Overall both films were about equally goodjust different. One thing I liked about both is that they left the whole angle of demonic possession unansweredthough I think the German one pointed more to a logical psychiatric answer instead of the supernatural.".

Schmid catches the atmosphere of the 70s in Bavaria extraordinary well maybe due to the fact that he grew up in a small catholic town himself. Requiem is full of love for its characters even for those who seem not to deserve this love at first. Schmid never chooses the easy way he knows that there are more sides to every character and every story. Someone else would have made a film that only blames religion but this film doesn't make fun of the religious nature of their characters.

Startles blood eerie music ghosts phantoms zombies vampires demons psychopaths etc. Requiem has none of this but again centers around the true story of a girl that went down in history as one of the world's first publicized account of an exorcism.The film doesn't quite get to this point like in Emily Rose but instead is the story of how she got there. Also the film never takes the audiences hand at any given point in time. Something ALL exorcism films do. Even Excorcism of Emily Rose which tried to be subjective with the trial didn't pull of what this film did with grace. I'm sorry but when you show a girl bend completely in half speak in tongues and go black in the eyes questioning whether or not Emily was just having an epileptic fit went out the window there.But Emily Rose was a great horrifying cinematic experience don't get me wrong. I just appreciate it when filmmakers tackle such a difficult subject and don't give in to the conventions they know will get them the large audiences.Requiem is a great film. If you're in the mood for a film rent it. You won't be disappointed. If you want a horror flick which I have to have myself from time to time pass on it. I recommend The Entity not quite a possession film but a great ghost story based on a true case that gets overlooked quite a bit.Peace and keep watching films".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler alertBrilliant portrayal of the fatal damage done by the misguided belief that a serious mental illness coupled with epilepsy is not physical or psychological but rather is demonic and must be exorcised. As an atheist I found it extremely difficult to watch the damage being done by the religious people around the young woman. Well acted and drives the point home of the folly of religion gone too far. This film is based on a real life case that of Anneliese Michel of Bavaria. The film The Exorcist was based on the same case. In real life the Priests attempted 12 exorcisms on Anneliese only stopping because she died in her parent's home of exhaustion. Thankfully there was justice in that her parents were convicted of manslaughter. The acting was top notch and the camera work miesenscene and editing all added to a real life feel to the movie. Kind of like a Lars von Trier film. I think this film is truly aptly named Requiem. It is a testament to a life sadly wasted to the folly of religious belief gone too far.".

She aspires to be a teacher but she comes from a devout religious Catholic family in a small village. She delayed her education since she suffers from epilepsy but I think undiagnosed mental illness. She has seen doctors and been in hospitals for tests. Despite her obvious illness she chooses to fight back the voices and visions. She gets to have a boyfriend Stefan and becomes close friends with a fellow student Hanna who also came from the same town as she did. Her tight knit family and the two priests still want to help Michaela through the darkest hours. Still it's a tragic film with sad consequences.

	schema:reviewBody "I was hesitant to watch Requium at first because I dislike horror movies. The US version based on the same reallife story was pretty gruesome I heard. But when an uncut version came on the telly I tried a bit liked it and kept watching until the end.Sandra Huller sorry my English alphabet cannot make the two dots thing is an amazing actor in my view. I always believed her. She evoked so many things at once a girl from the early 1970s a first year university student and a damaged and fragile soul trying to cope with what must have seemed a living hell for her. That last bit the hell bit wasn't always pleasant to contemplate in this film. But Huller's performance made it vivid and real for me.I went online and found photos of the real girl from Germany and what she looked like at that time. Unbelievably horrid! Evidently whatever really happened the poor thing suffered horrendous pain and damage. Huller subtly brought that out without creating a melodrama.Another facet of this that changed for me after viewing the movie was the Roman Catholic priests involved. When I first heard the encapsulated version to the effect that a young German girl was killed at the hands of priests who believed her to be possessed I formed an impression of ignorant cruel and rather stupid peasants. Upon seeing the movie however I began to see how even loving people her parents and the priests could possibly have been lead down a slippery slope. Doesn't mean they weren't a bit naive or even ignorant but hardly cruel. They all meant well. The real girl had epilepsy and that with complications was what lead to her death. It did not seem to be neglect on her family's or church's part.On the other hand... we'll never know will we?".

So when you see what is going on here to this girl leaving for college and struggling with some kind of mental disorder you not only feel for the character. You are astonished about a culture that still has room for this. The portrayal of mental illness has transformed enormously in the history of movies partly because psychology has changed too from Freud and Jung to now. Even looking at the last few minutes of Psycho which everyone conveniently forgets you see that arch confidence and inaccuracy of midcentury psychology. And now in 2011 we know how to treat epilepsy the purported disorder of the main character and even schizophrenia likely an additional problem judging by the symptoms with some level of control. But this movie is set between the two around 1971 and so with hindsight we are shocked and frustrated by the people around our main character showing either a get over it attitude of a more deadly god will intervene kind of attitude. Neither was a good thing.And yet this woman played with unusual conviction and brilliant by Sandra Huller is all about trying to survive. Because of her upbringing she interprets some events as God rejecting her she can't reach her rosary beads during one epileptic fit and of course this leads to priests and to the priests thinking they know how to possibly cure the poor girl. Eventually real life exorcisms are performed and in a weird synchronicity a realworld version of the 1973 American film The Exorcist.This one is German and instead of making everything strange it makes everything universal. We sometimes think of religious extremism as an American trait but in fact it is everywhere. This version gives it a Roman Catholic overtone and yet grounds in the the real world where priests are rather ordinary folk. not mythic brooding types though the younger priest here is vaguely a German Damien. The original The Exorcist it turns out was based on a German Lutheran not Catholic boy yet another small echo of one movie to the other.The comparisons can go too far for sure. This is a modern movie in what is one thread of contemporary European filmmakingunderstated realist tautly filmed issue based movies many of them from Denmark or Germany. It's a great complement to what is being made here in the U.S. with a different flair for dialog and sometimes a more elaborate production sense. This is not small budget but it is straight ahead and almost bare bones in its approach thoughtfully made and edited. And pertinent now in the sense that fanaticism in any form is to be questioned before it's too late.".

It was shot on various locations in BadenWrttemberg in southwestern Germany premiered In competition at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival in 2006 and was produced by HansChristian Schmid. It tells the story about Michaela Klingler a 21yearold epileptic woman who lives with her strict catholic parents and her younger sister Helga. Though Michaela's mother Marianne expresses her worries about her daughter's condition Michaela is determined to take up her teaching studies after having lived at home for one year and lately having functioned well without her medication.

Happy to get away from her life with her parents Michaela continues her studies and befriends university students Hanna and Stefan. Michaela doesn't tell her new friends about her condition and tries her best to conceal it but all of the sudden her epileptic seizures becomes worse and she begins to hear voices. Afraid that anyone she tells it to will think she has gone mad Michaela keeps it to herself but as the voices grows increasingly troublesome she begins to believe that she is possessed by demons and decides to contact a priest. Acutely and engagingly directed by HansChristian Schmid in a documentarylike style this invariably gripping German production which is set in the early 1970s and based on a true story about a woman who underwent several exorcisms draws an incisive portrayal of a young woman's difficult relationship with her parents and her afflicting battle against her unpredictable condition which has her trapped in a limbolike state.

This harrowing and cogently narrated story is impelled and reinforced by the heartrending and emphatic acting performance by German actress Sandra Hller in her complicated and first major role and the fine supporting acting performances by German actor Burghart Klaussner and German actress Imogen Kogge. A poignant horror drama which gained among numerous other awards the Silver Bear for Best Actress Sandra Hller and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival in 2006 and the award for Best Actress Sandra Hller Best Film and the Jose Luis Guarner Critic Award at the 39th StigesCatalonian International Film Festival in 2006.".

The exorcism of Emily Rose was a masterpiece the exorcist was a good attempt according to that era and the last exorcism was a total wastage of time.Well to my view this film requiem has done things so well and calculated that I felt impressed. There were no SFX but film still kept me grabbing till the end. This is the beauty of a film that you are involved in it without adding some value added things.The film shows a girl who was possessed and is thought to be epileptic. I was waiting for some ghosts or demonic appearances in it but they didn't and in my view this was another victory to the director that he didn't add some useless material and kept the viewers indulged in the topic. I would highly recommend this film as this was another of great films to watch.".

Even camera movement is adjusted to it sudden zooms handheld camera work and nearly no music added. Acting performances are interesting and mostly convincing. Although this will help you through the film in an interesting way it is not enough to make it a good film...I have been looking for the conflict in this film and I have been looking for the central message of the director. They are there alright but I have not experienced a single moment of being sucked into or swept out of the movie. I think it would be far more shocking to read actual facts about the girl to whom this happened for real than to watch this fictive movie that misses its clue.".

But by then who really cared? At the end of the film I realized that they had focused on the wrong thing in this story when they show a written epilogue that says something like After performing several dozen exorcisms on Michaela she ended up dying a few months later. THAT was the most interesting and compelling part of the story and all they did was mention it at the end without showing any of it? It would be like watching The Sixth Sense and having it fade out after the little boy helped to show that the mother was poisoning her little girl which is how she really died. And then after the fade out we would see an epilogue on the screen that said Bruce Willis was actually already dead so he therefore was a ghost.".

	schema:headline " Birth hour for one of Germany's most successful actresses these days";
	schema:reviewBody "Requiem is a German movie from 2006 so it has its 10th anniversary this year. It runs for approximately 90 minutes and was directed by HansChristian Schmid one of Germany's most successful filmmakers in the last two decades. The writer is Bernd Lange and you can say that this is definitely a contender for his most known work. And Requiem is also the very first full feature performance for actress Sandra Hller who was in her late 20s at this point. Hller recently made the headlines with Toni Erdmann in which she played the main character's daughter and this film we have here from a decade ago is how it all began. It was a big breakthrough just like for Diehl in 23 another Schmid film as she won a German Film Award for her portrayal and so did supporting actress Imogen Kogge the mother. Supporting actor Burghart Klauner the father was only nominated this time.This movie is the story of a young woman who is living her life in awe of God due to her education and upbringing and things get really complicated if she is confronted with the modern not Godfearing life at all when she becomes a regular student who aspires to become a teacher. What makes things even more complicated is the fact that her health is steadily getting worse and the people she trusts suspect that it has to do with her being somewhat possessed by the devil. The result is something that can almost be called a German version of The Exorcist. We do not see that much of the ways they try to cure her but we read it at the very end and also see one very memorable scene in which Hller goes all in with acting as possessed and evil as possible when her parents come to see her. The film certainly takes a dark turn in the second half and it was much darker than I expected. So I am a bit surprised that the film received so much awards recognition and that it did not go under the radar like for example Kreuzweg did a film with a somewhat similar subject at least in terms of the German Film Awards. And while I prefer the other film I just mentioned I still think Requiem is worth checking out. A thumbsup from me but not one that is as enthusiastic as I hoped it would be.".
