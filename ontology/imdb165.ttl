	schema:headline " Again very little of Chekhov";
	schema:reviewBody "When I recently compared Country Life with Uncle Vanya The Chekhov play from which it was loosely derived the connection was at least tangible. Margaretha von Trotta's Italian version of Three Sisters contains so little of the original as to be barely recognizable.  True there are still three sisters and a brother each unfulfilled in their various ways but the Chekhovian leitmotiv of wanting to be somewhere else is never mentioned so that the main idea behind the play is missing.  So forget Chekhov  at least there is a very fine filmed version by Laurence Olivier.  Von Trotta's Three Sisters therefore has to stand as something completely different on its own terms.  In actual fact it rather wobbles.  This is one of those respectable European arthouse movies with a few big names such as Fanny Ardant and Greta Scacchi to help it along.  Its settings a baroque university building and a misty flat landscape with sparsely planted trees give it a classy look.  Its score string music rather classically poised with just a hint of romanticism also contributes to the respectable aura. It all adds up to what a friend of mine delightfully dubbed the Laura Ashley school of cinema.  Three Sisters is worthy nice to look at but ultimately rather dull.  Only one character engaged my sympathy  the brother who is obliged to abandon his chance of a music career at the behest of his selfish wife and go into banking which he detests.  I thought him a dope at first but felt like cheering when he finally rounds on her.  For one brief scene this rather uninteresting film suddenly springs to life but too late to prevent it from sinking is its inertia.".

This is one of them tells us how music changes life and how life enriches music.I love folk music and the Brazil music is a major factor when I picked up this DVD. It does have a great number pieces of beautiful music flowing through the movie which are far beyond most of the musical movies I've ever seen. Moreover it is a good drama at the same time. The emotions the feelings the lives of all characters are well expressed.Go see it whenever and wherever you can find it.

	schema:headline " Selfglorifying clich biopic disguised as uplifting moral lesson";
	schema:reviewBody "2 Filhos de Francisco is based on the real ragstoriches life story minus the objectionable bits  it's supposed to function as a fairytale of the most commercially successful Brazilian singing duo of the last decade Zez di CamargoLuciano. They grew up in dire poverty in a shack in middleofnowhere rural Gois Brazilian Midwest and made it big in the 1990s having sold 20 million records since with their popsertanejo songs similar to U.S. pop CountryWestern and just as mellow and repetitive. The film is centered on Francisco their ironwilled kind hearted semiliterate but highly ambitious businesswise landsharer father who obsessively pushes his preteen sons Mirosmar later called Zez and Emival to selflearn to sing and play sertanejo music as the only possible way to escape poverty. The family overcomes all odds and tragic events  including the boys' lack of natural talent and proper education musical or otherwise Emival's death in a car accident later replaced in the duo by younger brother Luciano the sleazywithaheartofgold musical agent the record company's insensitive exec etc  to finally be blessed with glory fame and fortune in So Paulo but not before squeezing every tear out of sobbing audiences.2 Filhos... is the highest grossing Brazilian film in the last 20 years approx. 5.5 million viewers. Not really surprising  sertanejocaipira culture has always been extremely lucrative in Brazil. Late actor Mazzaropi made dozens of recordbreaking hits from the 1950s to the 1980s and remains the 2nd alltime Brazilian boxoffice movie star the 1st is Renato Arago. Great Brazilian filmmaker Nelson Pereira dos Santos Rio 40 Graus Vidas Secas had one of his biggest commercial hits with Na Estrada da Vida the model for 2 Filhos... based on the real life of sertanejo duo Z RicoMilionrio who played themselves. Sertanejo has been the most popular musical genre in many regions of Brazil for decades and its stars are some of the richest Brazilian entertainers. Besides it was coproduced by ZezLuciano themselves why play humble? distributed by Globo Filmes subsidiary of the most powerful Brazilian media corporation TV Globo with substantial financing from a huge private bank and Brazil's biggest oil company inyourface merchandising inserts galore.EVERY biopic clich is thrown in by firsttime screenwriters Carolina Kotscho and Patrcia Andrade with help from veteran Domingos de Oliveira as script doctor keeping things appallingly predictable  every scene screams formula!. The direction and visual treatment is professionally accomplished  after all firsttime director Breno Silveira is an awardwinning DP and publicity director. The film is made to match the popular lexicon of Brazilian soapoperas dialog performances and TV ads visually. Its ambition is to upgrade sertanejo culture to mainstream the filmmakers want ZezLuciano's audiences to be in awe with the film's classy dignified treatment of pop sertanejo culture but they ALSO want people who DON'T like ZezLuciano to watch it as they summon MPB stars Caetano Veloso Maria Bethnia and even rock stars Nando Reis to sing sertanejo songs in the soundtrack. ZezLuciano want to go legit to be granted a sort of cultural validation that musical critics and bourgeois elites never gave them but when you're THAT rich who cares? 2 Filhos... has its big share of miseryindex just as in Hollywood biopics poverty ignorance prejudice tragic events misunderstandings etc minus sex violence smoking booze drugs and good music. And whereas in the Hollywood biopic the star is blessed with extraordinary musical talents think Billie Holliday Tina Ray Charlie Parker... the Camargos are selfreportedly limited their success is based on sheer persistence hard work willpower and...the Brazilian knackjeitinho brasileiro the father buys phone tokens and convinces his friends and workmates to call radio stations in order to upchart his sons' song!. Music is not dealt with as art or the expression of the soul it's a way of dribbling famine a good reason as any by the way. 2 Filhos... is NOT about being blessed with special musical gifts it's about licitly escaping poverty any way you can in a country that leads the world's statistics in the gap between the rich and the poor. 2 Filhos is the self esteem booster for the average Brazilian citizen of 2005 disillusioned by the huge political corruption scandals perpetrated by top government acolytes of Brazil's first bluecollar left wing President Lula who symptomatically is a big fan of the duo and hired them to sing in his Presidential campaign.At the end of 2 Filhos... the real Zez  his face stiff with botox though he's just past 40  drives back to his childhood shack in his expensive car his eyes get moist as he says I've never been never as happy as I was here back then the money doesn't bring happiness routine only rich people believe in. This scene symbolizes the film's ambiguous nature. It's a commercial product designed to make millions in tickets and records disguised as a morally uplifting lesson. It's a self glorification enterprise disguised as a homage to the stars' father and the believein yourdreamsbst. Well some of us won't buy the poor uneducated but happy and we're just like you only with tons of cash patronizing stuff. The film's greatest appeal is its greatest fraud making the audience believe it could be you or me up there no need to go to school learn your art properly or even speak plurals correctly! As realistic as winning the lottery 5 minutes after the movie's over you get this annoying feeling  hey THEY're the ones with loads of cash and YOU've just made them even richer!!!!  o amooooorrrMy vote 3 stars out of 10  1 for Caetano Veloso Maria Bethnia's sublime rendition of Tristeza do Jeca in the closing credits 1 for Dablio MoreiraMarcos Henrique's engaging performances as young Mirosmar and Emival and 1 for Cludia Kopke's ontarget costumes the only unglamorous feature in this falsely humble film that can't hide its cashhunting selfglorifying essence.".

Besides it was coproduced by ZezLuciano themselves why play humble? distributed by Globo Filmes subsidiary of the most powerful Brazilian media corporation TV Globo with substantial financing from a huge private bank and Brazil's biggest oil company inyourface merchandising inserts galore.EVERY biopic clich is thrown in by firsttime screenwriters Carolina Kotscho and Patrcia Andrade with help from veteran Domingos de Oliveira as script doctor keeping things appallingly predictable  every scene screams formula!. The direction and visual treatment is professionally accomplished  after all firsttime director Breno Silveira is an awardwinning DP and publicity director. The film is made to match the popular lexicon of Brazilian soapoperas dialog performances and TV ads visually. Its ambition is to upgrade sertanejo culture to mainstream the filmmakers want ZezLuciano's audiences to be in awe with the film's classy dignified treatment of pop sertanejo culture but they ALSO want people who DON'T like ZezLuciano to watch it as they summon MPB stars Caetano Veloso Maria Bethnia and even rock stars Nando Reis to sing sertanejo songs in the soundtrack. ZezLuciano want to go legit to be granted a sort of cultural validation that musical critics and bourgeois elites never gave them but when you're THAT rich who cares? 2 Filhos... has its big share of miseryindex just as in Hollywood biopics poverty ignorance prejudice tragic events misunderstandings etc minus sex violence smoking booze drugs and good music. And whereas in the Hollywood biopic the star is blessed with extraordinary musical talents think Billie Holliday Tina Ray Charlie Parker... the Camargos are selfreportedly limited their success is based on sheer persistence hard work willpower and...the Brazilian knackjeitinho brasileiro the father buys phone tokens and convinces his friends and workmates to call radio stations in order to upchart his sons' song!. Music is not dealt with as art or the expression of the soul it's a way of dribbling famine a good reason as any by the way. 2 Filhos... is NOT about being blessed with special musical gifts it's about licitly escaping poverty any way you can in a country that leads the world's statistics in the gap between the rich and the poor. 2 Filhos is the self esteem booster for the average Brazilian citizen of 2005 disillusioned by the huge political corruption scandals perpetrated by top government acolytes of Brazil's first bluecollar left wing President Lula who symptomatically is a big fan of the duo and hired them to sing in his Presidential campaign.At the end of 2 Filhos... the real Zez  his face stiff with botox though he's just past 40  drives back to his childhood shack in his expensive car his eyes get moist as he says I've never been never as happy as I was here back then the money doesn't bring happiness routine only rich people believe in. This scene symbolizes the film's ambiguous nature. It's a commercial product designed to make millions in tickets and records disguised as a morally uplifting lesson. It's a self glorification enterprise disguised as a homage to the stars' father and the believein yourdreamsbst. Well some of us won't buy the poor uneducated but happy and we're just like you only with tons of cash patronizing stuff. The film's greatest appeal is its greatest fraud making the audience believe it could be you or me up there no need to go to school learn your art properly or even speak plurals correctly! As realistic as winning the lottery 5 minutes after the movie's over you get this annoying feeling  hey THEY're the ones with loads of cash and YOU've just made them even richer!!!!  o amooooorrrMy vote 3 stars out of 10  1 for Caetano Veloso Maria Bethnia's sublime rendition of Tristeza do Jeca in the closing credits 1 for Dablio MoreiraMarcos Henrique's engaging performances as young Mirosmar and Emival and 1 for Cludia Kopke's ontarget costumes the only unglamorous feature in this falsely humble film that can't hide its cashhunting selfglorifying essence.";

If you want to know how is the real Brazilian soul watch this movie. There is prejudice against country music like in the USA. Parts of upper class e high middle class here think that country music is tacky. See the movie made me understand what this kind of music means to people that makes it and listen to it. It's only a different taste. There are lots of classic regional song from Brazil that other countries don't know different from samba or Bossa Nova. I hope its deserve attention in other countries too. The film is getting the first place in box office for 10 weeks about 5 million saw it. The Incredibles is the second became the most viewed this year and it's our foreignlanguage Oscar contender. Its also a huge success with critics. Zeze Di Camargo  Luciano have sold more than 22 million CDs in Brazil.".

The tough life of Zeze di Camargo and his family and the dream of his father Francisco are wonderfully pictured in this film and it is a true good example that we should never forget our dreams no matter how distant or impossible they might seem to be. The expressive performance of the boy Dablio Moreira was very impressive and ngelo Antnio's role and performances are very powerful.

All of this against the contrasting backdrop of the beautiful scenery electric atmosphere and depressing slums of Brazil and the intoxicating beauty of the music make for a very pleasant movie experience. But it is the performances of Dablio Moreira and Marcos Henrique as Young MirosmarZez Di Camargo and his brother Emival that elevate the film to a different level. Though I somehow doubt it I hope that these two talented young performers gained the accolades and financial rewards that their outstanding performances merited. What I do know is that in the Young Artists Awards 2006 Dablio and Marcos jointly won the award for Best Performance in an International Feature Film  Leading Young Performer in the face of very stiff competition.Having watched the DVD several times I purchased a CD of the movie soundtrack but I was hugely disappointed! There is absolutely nothing of Dablio Moreira and Marcos Henrique to be heard and I must admit that I was far more moved by their rendition of the music than that of Zez di Camargo and Luciano. I am nothing short of amazed that there has still been no International release of a DVD. It's a beautiful movie and anyone believing that it would have no appeal outside of its native Brazil must be crazy!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a funny business reviewing movies. These days when internalized emotions and emotional detachment are favored over straightforward sentimentality it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings.Soon after completing jury duties at the 58th Berlinale I managed to catch Yoji Yamada's Kabei.After the screening I watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall wateryeyed men women and reviewers alike. Even the director of the Berlinale obviously a hardened viewer of cinema confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarter's way into this unashamedly sentimental experience.But what really surprised me were the reviews that came after. Despite being ineffably moved by the film many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally noncommittal in their writing. Apparently post weeping they had put on their thinking cap and consequently missed out on what I felt was the genius about Kabei.Allow me to explain.Set in prewar Japan the story of Kabei revolves around one writer's family and their fate therein after he is held in jail for what was described as thought crimes against the Imperial will. Through a series of protracted emotional scenes Yamada gets us familiar with the man his loyal wife and two daughters as well as three side charactersthe man's pretty young sister a bumbling exstudent and a cad of an uncle  all come to help the family cope with their plight in the absence of the man of the house.The story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict. This of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event.In other words although you learn to love the family and their helpers and sympathize with their unfortunate situation you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending.However two hours into the film don't worry Yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along he slaps you with what I can only describe as the sting. All that you have assumed to be what the story was aboutan innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters  now suddenly points to one of the family helpers. Someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate.At this point something curious happened in the theatre I was in. Everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition.My word! I muttered under my breath. It struck me then that Kabei in the final analysis was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war. It was in fact a cunning examination of one common human foible How little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us.Now the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid but lacked innovation. That's what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap I guess. With Kabei I believe Yoji Yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity. A wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the Torasan series and later in Tasogare Sebei.After lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema.This to me is the most effective cinematic tool of all. One which avoids detection but affects you deeply. And proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of Kleenex thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousandseater cinema hall.Now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about. Human emotions. Pure and simple.".

The film begins with Kayo Nogami's husband a respected intellectual who teaches at the University writing an article protesting the war with China. Seeing this as a betrayal the Japanese government brutally arrests him in front of his family for a thought crime. Yamada is best known for directing a trilogy of Samurai films especially The Twilight Samurai which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and won an unprecedented 12 Japanese Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Actor Best Actress and Best Screenplay written by Yamada. His later films remind me of Akira Kurosawa not just for their Samurai themes but for their sensitivity and deep humanity and Kabei is no exception. Born in 1931 Yamada would have been about the age of the youngest daughter Teryu who narrates the story as an older woman looking back. After Tobei is imprisoned his wife Kayo played by the beautiful Sayuri Yoshinaga struggles to provide for her family including two daughters aged around six and twelve I would guess. This exquisitely filmed movie follows the mother's heroic efforts with only a few sympathetic supporters to survive in a completely hostile environment. Kabei has been called dark for the harsh treatment Kayo and her daughters receive but Yamada's tender depiction of the family and Yoshinaga's astonishing performance lift it from tragedy to triumph. Usually a younger actor progressively plays an older one but in this film Yoshinaga around 65 when she made Kabei starts out playing a young mother!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Kabei Our Mother";
	schema:reviewBody "My introduction into Yoji Yamada's cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor. I had enjoyed all three films and looking at the prolific veteran director's filmography I think it'll take me a very long while to watch all his films especially the Torasan series. Needless to say when Kabei Our Mother has finally reached our shores I jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to Mothers everywhere celebrating their innate love for their children.Based on the autobiography of Teruyo Nogami Kabei  Our Mother tells of a close knit family of four  Mother Kayo Kabei Sayuri Yoshinaga Father Shigeru Tobei Mitsugoro Bando eldest daughter Hatsu Mirai Shida and youngest child Teru Miku Sato. From the get go their lives would be changed forever when Shigeru gets arrested under the Peace Preservation Law for his morally controversial writings against the nation set in the late 30s where Japan had begun their crusade in China and thereafter their participation in WWII.So begins Kabei's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family and the frequent difficult meetings with her husband behind bars. Help comes from relatives especially on Shigeru's side since Kabei's own dad had adopted an I told you so attitude with her choice of spouse. Shigeru's one time student Yama arthouse buffs should recognize Tadanobu Asano here provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children and Kabei's sister in law Hisako Rei Dan from Hiroshima which I believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline.While the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom and in a distant relationship with their dad what I enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in Japan. It's against the historical backdrop of Japan's push to regional dominance and there are characters here that don't mask those ambitions even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands. This is something I rarely see in Japanese films being that frank in their discussion of that era and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort.The actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles be they the veterans or the child actors. Actress Sayuri Yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances while Mirai Shida and Miku Sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise. Each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough or fill your heart with Joy should they be celebrating. Before long you'll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family thanks to the primary cast's powerful performances with Yoji Yamada coaxing some really natural performances from the kids.Kabei  Our Mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotions it seeks from the audience. There are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect with every scene not being wasted and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across be it compassion or love.Aside from the very abrupt ending I had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more despite its more than 2 hours runtime Kabei Our Mother comes highly recommended and you'll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis. Just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you'd probably have taken for granted.".

	onyx:emotionText "My introduction into Yoji Yamada's cinematic world is through his famed and recent Samurai Trilogy with The Twilight Samurai The Hidden Blade and Love and Honor. I had enjoyed all three films and looking at the prolific veteran director's filmography I think it'll take me a very long while to watch all his films especially the Torasan series. Needless to say when Kabei Our Mother has finally reached our shores I jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to Mothers everywhere celebrating their innate love for their children.Based on the autobiography of Teruyo Nogami Kabei  Our Mother tells of a close knit family of four  Mother Kayo Kabei Sayuri Yoshinaga Father Shigeru Tobei Mitsugoro Bando eldest daughter Hatsu Mirai Shida and youngest child Teru Miku Sato. From the get go their lives would be changed forever when Shigeru gets arrested under the Peace Preservation Law for his morally controversial writings against the nation set in the late 30s where Japan had begun their crusade in China and thereafter their participation in WWII.So begins Kabei's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family and the frequent difficult meetings with her husband behind bars. Help comes from relatives especially on Shigeru's side since Kabei's own dad had adopted an I told you so attitude with her choice of spouse. Shigeru's one time student Yama arthouse buffs should recognize Tadanobu Asano here provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children and Kabei's sister in law Hisako Rei Dan from Hiroshima which I believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline.While the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom and in a distant relationship with their dad what I enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in Japan. It's against the historical backdrop of Japan's push to regional dominance and there are characters here that don't mask those ambitions even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands. This is something I rarely see in Japanese films being that frank in their discussion of that era and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort.The actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles be they the veterans or the child actors. Actress Sayuri Yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances while Mirai Shida and Miku Sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise.

	schema:headline " A Sublime Beauty!";
	schema:reviewBody "Kabei Our Mother 2008 is a poetic and sublime beauty from Japan. A real weeper! I had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from Netflix. Am I glad I did! In many ways this film reminded me of the old style of Japanese classic filmmaking from the 1940's and 1950's that I've come to love so much such as seen in Yasujiro Ozu pictures  the title credits even begin in the same way with the Japanese letters characters in red against neutral color burlap material. I immediately thought this director loves Ozu. The same style was used too mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes. Even a couple of pillow shots as Roger Ebert calls them. The strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another.The story follows the lives of a Japanese family before and during and after World War Two. The mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father a University professor is arrested for antiwar sympathies. He's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease. Meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls. He begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls. But war starts and he's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell. Will they ever express their love for one another? Will he ever return from the war? There is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress Sayuri Yoshinaga. She's almost a Madonna type she's so beautiful! Big soulful eyes and flawless skin. The actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is Tadanobu Asano. What a sensitive performance. There is no macho in him at all he's gentle and kind. I'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies. I think I'll check to see what's available for them. The two little child actresses are wonderful too.The film is just released on NTSC DVD for American audiences with very easy to read English subtitles. I gave it a 10 out of 10 on the IMDb. I cried almost as much as with the Japanese film classic TwentyFour Eyes 1954. Don't miss this film!".

Well the plot was close to what I imagined it would be but I can't say enough about the wonderful acting. Especially of Kabei Sayuri Yoshinaga and the kids. Even bumbling Ichi the Killer was passable and provided some levity to an otherwise pretty depressing movie. The hot aunt was very easy on the eyes and the old lecher of an uncle was also pretty hilarious. My one complaint was that Sayuri looked a bit old to play the part she looked more like a grandma but her acting was impeccable. I won't write about the plot since the other reviewers have practically revealed everything but the overall pace was good and the directing not heavy handed. The movie looked a little lowbudget at times but I can't fault the movie for that. Must see on Netflix if you're a subscriber. Prepare the tissues since IMO it's impossible to cry if you're a normal human watching this flick.".

Yoshinaga Sayuri possibly the most decorated stillactive actress in Japan will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well. It was Asano Tadanobu though who delivered the most impressive performance perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in.Films with prewar setting is not my thing but thanks to wonderful directing and acting I was totally absorbed by the story. Also it wasn't a farleft nonsense like Yuunagi no Machi Sakura no Kuni and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a slow moving movie that can get the audiences immersed in a Japanese family and the stuff they go through during 1940's when japan decides to invade other nations. Although the family this movie focuses on is very normal and there is nothing that really makes them stand out all that much. The characters are very believable and sometimes I didn't feel I was watching acting. But real people go about their daily lives. This movie doesn't have a direct plot but it focuses on the wife Kabei and what she does for her family when her honorable husband gets arrested for his freedom of thought. There is some messages in this movie about how unethical laws are better than no laws. Maybe to some degree that is true but I have been screwed over by the law and sometimes I get the feeling it's just not right. Although that is life it effects good people in a negative way while the bad ones gets away. And laws are suppose to be just but even today it's far from it sometimes. And that is one of the aspects that is covered in this movie. But most of the character in this movie is dislikable except Kabei to some degree even if she comes off really mundane despite her circumstances her husband and Yamazaki ToruTadanobu Asano is the only characters that are likable. Most of the others are nationalistic and narrow minded people that still thought during the 1940's that their emperor is some kind of divine god. And that they are the chosen ones to conquer everything else in their path. And this movie does a pretty good job of showing the arrogance of some people during that era and how they lacked ethics but filled with false pride. It was kinda difficult to feel compassion for the Japanese families in that era while watching this flick since they had it alright during that era and their struggles are irrelevant because the Japanese government brought it upon themselves at that time. By invading and raping innocent women in other nations and also bombing vessels that they really shouldn't have. while torturing and enslaving many others. While a lot of the Japanese people supported it although some probably didn't know exactly what was going on. So the struggles the main family in this movie face just seemed like a walk in the park. Just being honest. So the constant complaining from the family members seemed irrelevant at times. Like when the daughters complains about their bad mannered uncle or going to school or being slightly hungry. Yeah that is what kids complain about but at least they weren't beaten up for learning Japanese starved to death treated as a test subject or raped. What happened is what happened. But since the youngsters didn't know what was really going on there is a bit of sympathy for those characters. Now if this movie took place in present time with the Japanese family presented in the movie it would be more effective when it comes to bringing out compassion. The main family is likable for the most part although nothing really stands out about them much. But I did like how this movie doesn't try to take sides but show a realistic portrayal of how some people in japan acted during that era. While showing the good and the bad like everywhere else in the world. While also showing the motives even if it's positive or negative which is a more humanistic realistic portrayal and direction. And how hate can lead to suffering and devastation even if it's not entirely a war movie. But shows how suffering can happen in their own nation even while invading others. Although this movie is about 2 hours long it felt really long though because of the realism and how it just seemed way too normal sometimes. I can understand how some audiences would be immersed with this movie because of the realism or bored to tears because of it. The last few minutes is a slight bit of a tear jerker and striking I guess because of the realistic build up.7.510".

Yamada has a subtle and quiet voice which he usually uses well. Kabei Our Mother seemed like it came from a different director altogether. Set out like a series of memoirs the film relied heavily on an intrusive narration and episodic structure. I never felt at ease or intrigued by the films pace. There were segments I enjoyed most involving Asano who kept his emotions in the open without making them obvious. The end was also very melodramatic with screaming and crying forcing their way in. It was all very 'bitty' but each individual 'bit' had something to enjoy.".

A common cinematic genre sometimes referred to as Shomin Geki home drama. In this version Director Youji Yamada offers up a story containing all the ingredients for a fine melodrama except one energized direction. This weary film renders viewer attempts to identify and tearup empathize with photo play characters a decidedly uphill slog. It also makes for characters that often come across as two dimensionalwith the notable exceptions of child actresses Mirai Shida and Miku Satou who as daughters energetically and delightfully steal every scene they are in! Scene narration apparently by a nowgrown daughter is sporadic and seems extraneous. Narration accompanying the closing credits is trivial drivel but now spoken by a male actor! A voice from beyond the grave perhaps? Score consists of mostly Faux opera singing by a woman with piano accompaniment. Overdone it quickly becomes an annoying distraction and ends up sounding more like screeching or strangulation! than singing. Cinematography semiwide screen color is good. Interior design is fine but exteriors except for beach scenes look soundstage phony. Kabei  means wallboard or wall decoration in literal translation. Might be your guide when deciding whether to spend 133 minutes of your time watching this movie. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

His acting is great even if in the beginning it feels sometimes overacted. Why do I think it a boring film? I haven't read the book but I'm convinced it's very interesting and moving at the same time. You probably can imagine every scene being told by Tiziano in all its colours. In the movie this doesn't work because you see those beautiful sceneries of Tuscany not letting room for your own fantasy to develop pictures in your mind. Somehow the movie feels like the pages just being filmed one by one. A pity the film wasn't done in Italian it would have been so much more authentic. In addition obviously Elio Germano Folco spoke his text in Italian being dubbed over in German which kind of feels strange because his lips speak the Italian words which don't match the German text in movement. If you like Bruno Ganz and the not worn out pictures of Tuscany go and watch the movie if not go for some other movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Transpositions of books to the screen are always difficult and partial being the evocative power of the written word so distant from the directness and evidence of the visual image. Still more difficult it is when the book is a collection of thoughts and reflections passed by a father shortly before dying to his son during some openair dialogues. Tiziano Terzani has been a highly committed Italian journalist who worked for 30 years for a German daily as a correspondent in eastern countries in hot spots of Vietnam under war and China under Mao who after discovering of suffering from cancer devoted himself to the study and the practice of oriental spirituality spending some solitary time in the Himalaya and finally coming back to his homeplace to spend his final days enriched and enlivened by a strong sense of inner peace. In the movie all his professional life is only taken for granted and focus is laid on the spiritual and human depth he has reached throughout his life. This may be a choice of adherence to the book but this is also the weakest and most unconvincing aspect of the picture because whereas the book affords each reader the necessary individual time and space to reflect upon each single page and phrase the movie which has the need to give as much as possible a comprehensive idea of a human soul in a reasonable time run results in a kind of forced concentration of reflections quotations opinions ranging from Chinese Marxism to a universal communion between man and nature with many topics inbetween. Interesting and deep topics indeed but which sound too much too methodically in sequence in order to communicate as much as possible information about the man but without the necessary time to assimilate them. In the end the movie instead of communicating peace of mind and soul conveys an urgency of passing information. And even if Bruno Ganz proves perfect in his interpretation some pathos in his prepacked dialogues with his son is missing and I found it difficult to empathize with him and his accounts. There are probably books that refuse cinema transpositions simply because demanding time pauses reflection going back and forward that cinema cannot obviously allow to the viewer. I think that the book La fine  il mio inizio belongs to this category its intrinsic nature would make any transposition however good and structured always inadequate recognizing the written word as its only appropriate means of expression.".

The landscapes of Toscana and especially of Orsigna near Pistoia are really surprising. The last scene at the top of the mountain is unexpected. The son Folco has made a difficult and long job also because the book is a great remember of his father but the results of the book and indirectly of the movie are excellent. At the end my comment is a bit subjective because for me Tiziano is unrepeatable but I would invite everybody to read the book of Terzani.

It's also best to watch this film late at night with the lights off and especially with a snow storm outside.  Give it a chance and this film will creep up on you. Hopefully it will come to DVD soon.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I think about R.Polanski the first thing coming to my mind is  the master of fear and horror and I knew it that Fearless vampire Killers is rare example of comedy by this great director. Yeah I was worried before seeing this movie not as much about geting it but more so about simple thing  could this movie be entertaining for 21st Century Boy.First thing that striked me was beautiful music by Komeda. I was in total awe. The music was scary but at the same time so light and funny  just like for a good fair story. And then the beautiful winter scenery that was so fake  almost cartooning. Few minutes into the movie and I could say that's what I call movie poetry. The story is so simple. The old bat researcher professor Abronsius and his assistant Alfred go to a remote Transylvanian village looking for vampires. They stay in house where no one speaks about vampires but the garlic is hanging everywhere. Simplistic story is so right for this movie because acting scenery music cinematography are all in top shape here. For composition I think this is one of the best movie done by Polanski next to Tenant for sure.And this movie is also a rare occasion to see Polanski in comedic role. He and Brach make unforgettable duo. I was totally entertain when in came to comedy in this movie but the thing that surprise me the most was the action factor. There is one scene that is great example of that  when Polanski character is looking through keyhole and is so scared of what he see that his face is screaming terror. It's sure funny but in a way madscary too. And when I think about this movie  this scene sums it up for me.Its very funny but little outdated movie. For me one a few really cinematic fairy tales that keeps magic all the way to the end. Its up there with Repulsion Tenant and Tess when in comes to greatest work of this director. And just think about brilliant ending so funny so mad. It's a shame Polanski hasn't made another comedy. Don't get me started with Pirates  the most unfunny movie in history. But Fearless Vampire Killers  is movie magic  pure and simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love Roman Polanski's The Fearless Vampire Killers which is surprising to me now because for most of my life I thought it was dreadful.  I missed the original release back in 1967 but I was only eight years old then and the version released in the U.S. was a truncated travesty of what Polanski intended.  I've read that the movie was considered an almost complete fiasco because the executive producer Martin Ransohoff best known for The Beverly Hillbillies wanted a very different film and cut 16 minutes out of Polanski's 107 minute cut inserted a short cartoon before the titles so people would know it was supposed to be a comedy Ransohoff thought Polanski botched it that badly and even redubbed some of the actors.  He also added the awful tag line to the title Or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are in My Neck.  This must have been the version I saw on TV in the early seventies and thought so terrible.  Thankfully this abomination doesn't seem to be in circulation anymore.  However despite its flaws The Fearless Vampire Killers gained a cult following over the years to a degree due to the morbid fascination with the murder of Sharon Tate but also because the movie is really very good.  Paramount's Robert Evans recognized this back in '67 and thought Polanski the right director for Rosemary's Baby.  He was right and the success of that film showed Hollywood what a master of the language of film Polanski is.In 1983 MGMUA Home Video released Polanski's original cut on cassette and on laserdisc remember those?.  On laserdisc it was letterboxed so you could enjoy the full Panavision frame and included the alternate main title sequences from the bastardized version as an extra.  For some reason though I wasn't a fan of the film I thought this was a disc I had to get but after I first viewed it I wondered if I hadn't wasted my money.  I still couldn't see what was so great about it.  However I didn't get rid of the disc and over the past nine years I've viewed the movie several times.  I can't remember when I started to appreciate it but now The Fearless Vampire Killers is one of my favorite movies.Right from the main title sequence this film is really quite wonderful. Christopher Komeda's score is weird and haunting.  The dayfornight shots of the snowy countryside are a bit distracting but kind of fit the fairy tale quality of the film's isolated late 19th century Transylvanian winter never land.  The movie is extremely wellmounted with wonderful sets especially the vampires' castle.  All the performances are excellent.  Jack MacGowran's Professor Abronsius is an absolutely incredible characterization unlike anything else MacGowran ever did on film.  The same is true of Alfie Bass' Yoine Shagal possibly the world's first Jewish vampire and a terrible lecher.  Sharon Tate was probably never lovelier than in this movie and Roman Polanski is very good as Alfred in fact amazing when you consider he was also directing.  It is a tour de force on his part.  Finally Ferdy Mayne's Count Von Krolock is a king vampire equal to any screen Dracula while Iain Quarrier is also appropriately creepy as his gay vampire son Herbert.Like the drinking of blood I would imagine! appreciation of The Fearless Vampire Killers is very much an acquired taste.  I don't know what to say to those that don't like it except Why don't you try watching it again? It might grow on you as it did me.  This movie also has one of the best onesheet posters from the sixties with art by Frank Frazetta.  I hope this movie comes to DVD soon especially with commentary by Polanski but I've read that MGM considers the elements in need of restoration so it may be a while.  However it should look great when it does get to DVD.  I can't wait.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's sad to say whenever people ask me for a good vampire movie one I do recommend is The Fearless Vampire Killers they always look at me and ask What's that?. But the 3 people I've shown it too loved it and I think that has got to say something about this great vampire classic. Writer director and costar Roman Polanski made the first real vampire spoof and what a great movie! If you think about today's spoofs everything is always a reference to something that's in pop culture. This movie is just pure comedy taking what was so typical at the time of the weary travelers who happen upon a creepy castle with the even creepier host yet act completely oblivious when strange things happen. Instead how about we have two vampire slayers one who is calm and experienced vs. the inexperienced and nervous? While we're at it why not add a ball into the mix? Dancing vampires it just doesn't get any better than this.In the heart of Transylvania Professor Abronsius and his apprentice Alfred are on the hunt for vampires. Abronsius is old and withering and barely able to survive the cold ride through the wintry forests while Alfred is bumbling and introverted. The two hunters come to a small Eastern European town seemingly at the end of a long search for signs of vampires. The two stay at a local inn full of angstridden townspeople who perform strange rituals to fend off an unseen evil. Whilst staying at the inn Alfred develops a fondness for Sarah the daughter of the tavern keeper Yoine Shagal. After witnessing Sarah being kidnapped by the local vampire lord Count von Krolock the two follow his snow trail leading them to Krolock's ominous castle in the snowblanketed hills nearby. They break into the castle but are trapped by the Count's hunchback servant Koukol. Despite misgivings Abronsius and Alfred accept the Count's invitation to stay in his ramshackle Gothic castle where Alfred spends the night fitfully. After finding Sarah the next day they come up with a plan to destroy the count and save Sarah but with a midnight ball in the mix of vampires the plans might be a bit harder than they realized.I think one of the funniest scenes in film history is when Roman Polanski is being chased by Count Krolock's feminine vampire son Herbert. The seduction scene before that was too funny but let's add Roman running around in a circle oblivious that he did just go around in a circle and runs right back into Herbert! The comedic timing was just gold! Sharon Tate is also in this film and she is just beautiful you could see how Roman would fall in love with her on and off screen so easily. It's really sad that we lost her so young and so tragically you see the talent that could have been. I also love Jack MacGowran he's calm exterior to Roman's scaredy cat routine was the perfect balance the film needed. I nearly die laughing each time I see the scene where they are in the Count's bedroom about to stake him but Jack gets stuck in the window and Roman chickens out on killing the count. He has to go around the castle to pull Jack out but gets distracted by Sharon Tate and when he finally realizes that he left Jack in the same room with blood sucking vampires he just reeks with the Oops! face. The ballroom scene is so memorable again the comedic timing is great. Another thing about this film is that it also has some great scares in it too some great make up effects with the Count. I highly recommend this film I've been watching it since I was a little girl I still love watching it all these years later and can't wait to show it to others as well.1010".

Dancing vampires it just doesn't get any better than this.In the heart of Transylvania Professor Abronsius and his apprentice Alfred are on the hunt for vampires. Abronsius is old and withering and barely able to survive the cold ride through the wintry forests while Alfred is bumbling and introverted. The two hunters come to a small Eastern European town seemingly at the end of a long search for signs of vampires. The two stay at a local inn full of angstridden townspeople who perform strange rituals to fend off an unseen evil. Whilst staying at the inn Alfred develops a fondness for Sarah the daughter of the tavern keeper Yoine Shagal. After witnessing Sarah being kidnapped by the local vampire lord Count von Krolock the two follow his snow trail leading them to Krolock's ominous castle in the snowblanketed hills nearby. They break into the castle but are trapped by the Count's hunchback servant Koukol. Despite misgivings Abronsius and Alfred accept the Count's invitation to stay in his ramshackle Gothic castle where Alfred spends the night fitfully. After finding Sarah the next day they come up with a plan to destroy the count and save Sarah but with a midnight ball in the mix of vampires the plans might be a bit harder than they realized.I think one of the funniest scenes in film history is when Roman Polanski is being chased by Count Krolock's feminine vampire son Herbert. The seduction scene before that was too funny but let's add Roman running around in a circle oblivious that he did just go around in a circle and runs right back into Herbert! The comedic timing was just gold! Sharon Tate is also in this film and she is just beautiful you could see how Roman would fall in love with her on and off screen so easily. It's really sad that we lost her so young and so tragically you see the talent that could have been. I also love Jack MacGowran he's calm exterior to Roman's scaredy cat routine was the perfect balance the film needed. I nearly die laughing each time I see the scene where they are in the Count's bedroom about to stake him but Jack gets stuck in the window and Roman chickens out on killing the count. He has to go around the castle to pull Jack out but gets distracted by Sharon Tate and when he finally realizes that he left Jack in the same room with blood sucking vampires he just reeks with the Oops! face. The ballroom scene is so memorable again the comedic timing is great. Another thing about this film is that it also has some great scares in it too some great make up effects with the Count. I highly recommend this film I've been watching it since I was a little girl I still love watching it all these years later and can't wait to show it to others as well.1010";

If you should take the effort of watching this entire picture you will come to the conclusion that Polanski has made a masterpiece. Special notes should be taken for the musical score. Such a clich but unmissable for this picture. This is a classic horror movie with a perfect ambient atmosphere that suites the movie perfectly! Today the teenagers are growing up with vampire movies like blade and underworld. But these are not to be called horror movies. There is little or no atmosphere just pocket fillers for the movie makers. For classic and Gothic atmosphere you cannot do any better then The fearless vampire killers For those of you who have become curious enjoy!!".

	schema:reviewBody "TCM ran The Fearless Vampire Killers TFVK the same night that METV ran the Star Trek Amok Time the Spock ponfarr kill Spock episode. Both productions are from basically the same year. It is interesting to see both products on the same night. The TV show episode is memorable and the TFVK hardly ever is seen. The answer as to why this is is in the script. The Star Trek episode in classic 1967 TV for all the warts in looking at it back through time TFVK is as boring as they come.It is asserted that TFVK is a satire of the Hammer Vampire movies. In my life I have seen and enjoyed the Hammer Vampire movies. I had never seen TFVK until now. It took all my might to sit through TFVK to say that I had watched it so that I will never watch it again. As far as satire goes the film is just lame.Futurama has the episode of Why Must I Be a Crustacean in love? which is a satire of Amok Time. The episode is hilarious. Young Frankenstein YF is a satire of Frankenstein movies. YF is hilarious. TFVK is just flat out boring.While watching TFVK a memory came of reading Joseph Heller's Something Happened which is a 400 page book that should be retitled Nothing Happened. At the end of a viewing of TFVK the feeling was that Nothing Happened after slogging through a lengthy tomeviewing.Sharon Tate may look very hot in some of the scenes but the scenes are very brief and far and few between. The rest of the movie is filled with a lot of unintelligible jargon spewed by characters who follow The Idiot Principle of writing. In the Idiot Principle of writing the characters continue to say and do things that are more stupid than the last thing they did because that is supposedly funny and is the only way to move the plot forward. TFVK follows this conceit in a boring manner until a really stupid climax and denouement occurs.Some have made mention that all that is missing is Benny Hill music. One can see that as the film plays out and it would only have made the movie better to take a direct Benny Hill approach. It would have at least been a little bit more entertaining.Arnold Schwarzenegger said in an interview about The Last Action Hero that everyone read the script and thought it was great. Then we made the movie and watched and realized My God...this is awful! And now we have to go out and sell it! I suspect those that made and bankrolled TFVK probably experienced similar feelings after the created and watched TFVK. It just isn't really that good.".

This one is a considerably more commercial offering. It's effectively a parody of the British Hammer horror films that had been very popular up to this point. So its cultural references were fairly mainstream in the 60's. Set in the 19th century it's about a professor and his assistant who travel to Eastern Europe seeking vampires. Before long they find themselves at the castle of the mysterious Count von Krolock.The problem I have with this film is fairly straightforward  I don't find it very funny. The humour is very broad and present throughout. It ranges from the clever a Jewish vampire who is unafraid of a crucifix to the lowbrow lots of slapstick. It's occasionally amusing but rarely properly funny. So this is a bit of a problem in a film that is first and foremost a comedy. On the plus side it does look pretty with nice snowbound landscapes and a Gothic castle to look at. The vampire's ball is also very good. But for me the single best aspect of Dance of the Vampires is easily Sharon Tate. She is achingly beautiful and provides a very welcome sensuality to proceedings. Her horrible murder two years later at the hands of the Manson Family clearly robbed the film world of someone quite considerable.".

I also thought that Polanski's direction was too showy for a comedy. But as the film went on the comic moments began to build. And the showy direction ceased seeming showy and began to seem wonderful. If you find yourself not laughing a lot it's understandable. Just sit back and enjoy Polanski's amazing direction. And the laughs although to many they may seem too few those that there are are enormous. I'd also like to praise the actors including Roman Polanski himself. The set design especially in the castle is more than amazing. It's simply beautiful. The film has a few slow spots and the end is particularly disappointing. Polanski himself would probably be angry at me for rejecting his ending but it's not the finale that I object to so much as the weak climax. The suspense yes suspense is plentiful in this comedy was building so well during that climactic sequence and it doesn't pay off.And I really don't want to give too much away because everything is best experienced freshly I hadn't even heard of this film before I saw that it was to be on TCM but man watch out for the dance scene. I LOVE Chinatown but I think from the three Polanski films that I've seen that that scene is his crowning achievement. 910.".

	schema:headline " AboveAverage Vampire Spoof";
	schema:reviewBody "Two incompetent vampire hunters Professor Abronsius Jack MacGowran of Doctor Zhivago and his bumbling assistant Alfred Roman Polanski of Rush Hour 3 venture to a remote village in Eastern Europe so they can substantiate the existence of vampires. The Fearless Vampire Killers or Pardon Me But Your Teeth are in my Neck is a spoof of vampire chillers in general and specifically Hammer horror movies. Mind you this qualifies as a traditional vampire movie. The vampires display fangs cast no reflection in mirrors and spend their days in their coffins. Although the film generated a lot of coin in Europe it flopped in America and MGM didn't help matters when they reedited it so drastically that director Roman Polanski disowned it. Polanski penned the screenplay with his Repulsion collaborator Grard Brach. Wilfrid Shingleton's production designs are firstrate. Nevertheless Polanski and his collaborators scare up a lot of atmosphere in this 107 minute sendup of bloodsuckers. Blue Max lenser Douglas Slocombe's widescreen cinematography contributes to the air of suspense that Polanski generates. The Fearless Vampire Killers is one of those rare films that you could watch in the dead of an incandescent summer and contract chills from its wintercovered surroundings.The narrator sets the ominous but amusing tone of this sophisticated parody That night penetrating deep into the heart of Transylvania Professor Abronsius was unaware that he was on the point of reaching the goal of his mysterious investigations. In the course of which he had journeyed throughout Central Europe for years accompanied by his one and only faithful disciple Alfred. A scholar and scientist whose genius was unappreciated Abronsius had given up all to devote himself body and soul to what was to him a sacred mission. He had even lost his chair at Knigsberg University where for a long time his colleagues used to refer to him as The Nut. Along the way angry dogs attack our hapless heroes and the elderly whitehaired professor arrives at an inn frozen to the bone. Jewish innkeeper Shagal Alfie Bass of Alfie thaws out the professor after everybody chimes in with a remedy to thaw him out. The first thing that Abronsius notices is string of garlic dangling from the ceiling. As far as he is concerned Abronsius has found vampires and he plans to stay. When Shagal shows Abronsius and Alfred to their room he forgets that his bodacious redhaired daughter Sarah Sharon Tate is luxuriating in their bathtub. He promises Abronsius and Alfred that they will have use of the bathroom tomorrow. Shagal whips his daughter for constantly using the tub to bathe in and she informs Alfred later that she got into the habit of washing regularly in school.Naturally when Abronsius inquires Shagal and his townsfolk dismiss vampires as nothing more than superstitious shenanigans. Later the professor spots a hunchback Koukol Terry Downes of A Study in Terror and sends Alfred off to follow the deformed fellow. Alfred doesn't get far especially after the hunchback appears to dine on dog. At the inn Shagal likes to slip out of bed late at night and sneak up to bundle up with Magda the Maid Fiona Lewis of Otley but Shagal's wife Rebecca Jessie Robins of Billy Liar has her suspicions. She tries to catch him in the act but clobbers the inquisitive Abronsius by mistake. He never learns who struck. Ironically Shagal manages to conceal himself and his vast bulk behind the door in Magda's room. Sarah pays the price of bathing one time too often and she is cavorting in bubbles when the skylight opens and Count von Krolock Ferdy Mayne of Where Eagles Dare descends in his regal Bela Lugosi cloak and takes a bite out of her beautiful throat. Shagal goes off to avenge Sarah and comes back dead and drained. Meanwhile Alfred has become infatuated with Sarah and Abronsius and he set off for the Count's castle to rescue her. When they blunder into the castle the vampire patriarch awaits them and has rooms prepared for them.You can tell that this vampire spoof is different when a nubile young lady tries to ward off a thirsty vampire with a crucifix and the vampire dismisses her efforts with a chuckle because he is Jewish Oy hev you got the wrong vampire! The ironic ending is a big plus too.".

But that doesn't mean that it's worth watching now.  The score is sound the cinematography competent but the pace is so plodding that it's almost intolerable.  Scene after scene drags on and on and every link is the same two buffoons doing a comedy farce tiptoe walk or comedy farce skiing or comedy farce falling down stairs.Speaking of which it's about as funny as being smashed in the face with a brick. Just an average common dull brick.  That is unless you find it amusing that Jewish vampires say Oy vey! a lot and gabble in mockYiddish. Laugh?  I nearly did.Actually that's a lie.  I didn't come close.  Perhaps if I'd seen it before I hit puberty I might view it somewhat differently but viewed in the cold light of adulthood this is a dreadful confused mess of a film burdened with a sloppy script and sparse insipid dialog.Avoid at all costs.  You'll never got those 107 minutes of your life back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well since I'm reviewing films set in Romaniain preparation for my trip that do not feature Dracula it was inevitable I would wind up reviewing this infamous Roman Polanskidirected horrorcomedy but with Polanski in the news as of late I felt I may as well cut to the chase plus it would be nice to review something intentionally funny for a change. Granted Polanski has made scarier films than this'The Tenant'and funnier onesI shamelessly admit I've always had a softspot for 'Pirates' and truth be told the film itself is something of a mixed bag and certainly doesn't deserve Ken Hanke's description as 'Polanski's greatest film' heck as a parody of Hammer films I'd say that the 'Family Matters' Halloween special with Urkel as a vampire hunter was more successful than this film! But it's definitely something no fan of either Polanski or genre films should avoid regardless of your personal feelings about Polanski.The plot is fairly simple stuff two vampire hunters named AbronsiusJack MacGowran AlfredPolanski himself investigate kidnappings in a snowbound Transylvanian villageAbaraham Van Helsing  Simon Belmont must have been on vacation and then decide to infiltrate the castle of the sinister Count Von KrolockFerdy Mayneafter a village girlSharon Tate looking so lovely you almost feel like crying knowing what would happen to her in real lifeis kidnapped by him. Being that this is a comedy it goes without saying that our two heroes are a few transfusions short of a blood vesselI'm going to kill myself for that joke and after ending up in the castle and losing their weapons 'hilarity' ensues.Truth be told as typically excellent as this work is from a younger Polanski he pretty much fails at creating an effective comedy so much as he succeeds at creating a lighthearted horror film. The jokes fall as flat as the characters do when they trip over coffins and much of the Senile old professor who has lost his mind but rambles on anyway humor that comprises Abronsius's shtickbesides getting frozen stuck and berating Alfred is obviously too subtle for MacGowran to handle. That said the film still manages to be quite amusing with three laughoutloud hilarious sequences such as when a Jewish vampire is confronted with a crossThat's where my heading quote for this review comes from a later sequence where Alfred drops his weapons bag and it rolls down hill and keeps rolling for several minutes till it's out of frameMatt Groening clearly was inspired by this gag for a 'Simpsons' episode where Homer falls down a gorge in a similar manner. Then there's the scene where Alfred almost falls victim to Krolock's gay son HerbertIan Quarrier. It may be a very homophobic sequence but it's funny as hell so much so that one wishes Quarrier was given an expanded roleHe may well have had one the film is supposedly extensively cut.Polanski has shown himself to be a talented actor as well as director but he falls flat in this he's just too distant to come off as the goofy nebbish his character was intended to beRoger Corman regulars Jonathan Haze or Dick Miller would have been better. As Abronsius MacGowran clearly isn't suited to 'dialogue humor' but he's excellent when it comes to physical comedy ranging from subtle body languagewatch him cut up his foodto outrageous slapstick. He would have made an excellent silent comedian. Sharon Tate has little to do but look pretty but she does that well. Alfie Bass is great as Shagal a lecherous innkeeper turned vampire. It's clear that he was patterned after 'Groper' from Reeve's 'The She Beast' that I reviewed a few days ago. Ferdy Mayne gives an excellent performance as Krolock he is genuinely menacing but also in his supreme confidence and surface politeness quite a likable villain certainly much more compelling than the heroes. His performance is good enough that it could carry a serious horror film. Ian Quarrier as I said steals the show in his small role. Clearly Alucard from the Castlevania gamesnotably 'Symphony of the Night'was modeled after him appearancewise.If certainly not Polanski's best film I must say that it is definitely one of his bestlooking films. The sets and cinematography are breathtaking. I sure hope Transylvania is this scenic when I visit. Also for a comedy the film has a genuinely eerie atmosphere. The creepy chanting music that plays when evil is lurking about is certainly more effective than the bombastic scores of Hammer films. The many scenes of silence help give the film a creepy surreal feel. Perhaps had this film been made in the 'dialogueless but not silent' style of Dreyer's 'Vampyr' it would have worked better both as horror and as comedy. The highlight of the scares is a 'vampire ball' where even the slapstick scenes cannot kill the ominous vibe of seeing walking corpses dancing elegantly the breeze blowing in from the ocean as I watched this from my back porch certainly enhanced the mood. It's one of the most disturbing parodies of aristocracy I have ever seen. The ending is also surprisingly downbeat. The influence of 1961's 'Blood  Roses' and Hammer's 'Kiss of the Vampire' can clearly be felt. The relationship of Alfred  Abronsius seems to have been patterned after that of Hans  Baron Frankenstein from 'Evil of Frankenstein'1964. I may not have enjoyed this as much as the other films I've reviewed this month but I still enjoyed the hell out of it. Don't miss it You will find yourself transfixed by the snowy atmosphere and faux elegance.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to love the U.S.A. title to this movie The Fearless Vampire Killers or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are In My NeckI will say this for the 1960s it had mostly crap movies but it had some of the best film titles ever i.e. Dr. Strangelove or How I learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.  Sadly outside of gaping at the beautiful Sharon Tate there wasn't much to enjoy after the opening title. Most of the film is downright silly with sophomoric humor. I love a good satire but this isn't one. A satire on vampire films sounds good but the writers were inept on this screenplay. You can't bore people to death in the beginning and then hope they stay with you. Too much time goes by before any action occurs in this film.Even more sad of course is what happened to Tate not long after this movie was released butchered by the Manson gang. Out of respect for her I won't continue on describing how disappointed you will be if you think you're in for entertainment by watching this overrated Bmovie schlock".

	onyx:emotionText "You have to love the U.S.A. title to this movie The Fearless Vampire Killers or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are In My NeckI will say this for the 1960s it had mostly crap movies but it had some of the best film titles ever i.e. Dr. Strangelove or How I learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb.  Sadly outside of gaping at the beautiful Sharon Tate there wasn't much to enjoy after the opening title. Most of the film is downright silly with sophomoric humor. I love a good satire but this isn't one. A satire on vampire films sounds good but the writers were inept on this screenplay. You can't bore people to death in the beginning and then hope they stay with you. Too much time goes by before any action occurs in this film.Even more sad of course is what happened to Tate not long after this movie was released butchered by the Manson gang. Out of respect for her I won't continue on describing how disappointed you will be if you think you're in for entertainment by watching this overrated Bmovie schlock";

	schema:reviewBody "... but here he isn't quite there yet.This vampire spoof never really gets off the ground despite director Roman Polanski's best efforts. Cute opening credits get the viewer's hopes up for a farce. But the film is a mix of subtle spoof and occasional scares and they just don't mix well. The film inspires the occasional smile or laugh. I liked the cinematography the sets and of course Sharon but I thought there could have been a lot more jokes written into it. There seemed to be a lack of dialogue overall. The film finally gets moving in the last 40 minutes and a few scenes attain slapstick comedy heights most notably the scene in which Ian Quarrier's vampire makes a pass at Roman Polanski's vampire hunter. If the whole film was this funny it would have been an undisputed classic. Instead it is just a mild disappointment.It's recently been on Turner Classic Movies but until that time I remember seeing it last in the summer of 1976 on TV in the middle of the night during the summer between finishing high school and starting college. My younger sister and I stayed up to watch it and I remembered being somewhat bored with it at the time and after giving it a chance recently I was still somewhat bored. Back in 1976 I asked my sister why did we both stay up to watch this? We both had to admit that it was because Sharon Tate was in it neither of us had ever seen anything she had been in and ultimately our curiosity was born from the famous Manson murder cases and how she died. I just remember sitting there at age 18 looking at that beautiful young lady and her husband to be Mr. Polanski who was to suffer the most tragic of losses and thinking someday you'll both be famous but you don't want to know why.".

The legend of the Boogeyman does exist it is called BichoPapo but its location is not specified and certainly is not necessarily in a closet. However the story is very empty without explanation and with an awful and ridiculous conclusion. In the DVD there is a not good alternate ending but better and better than the released conclusion. The scary effects and the music score are the best this movie can offer. Boogeyman is watchable not a masterpiece of the genre but also not among the worst horror movies as commented by some users.

Its EVERYTHING BAD in a horror movie and makes us feel cheated insulted and burned. Its the kind of movie that LOOKS like something we'd be interested in. The trailer showed a pretty creepy scene a slow walk to a front door of a Gothicstyle Victorian farmhouse a scary hand on the door. The stuff of childhood nightmares and imaginings. Additionally the movie had a lot going for it  a spookyashell soundtrack a seriously creepy Gothic farmhouse which even oldhouse fanatics might shudder at being alone in at night. Smalltown stagnation and isolation. Unhelpful country people who just don't like outsiders. The stuff of moody haunting atmospheres. But rather than play on a slow spooky dreamlike ambiance the house the terrors the memories of the lost dad and his murderabduction we get a woosh of distracting angles and wild camera swoops and flashes of light that are neither realistic nor scary. The eerie soundtrack is constantly interrupted by flashes of light and noise that are supposed to 'scare' but show nothing and only interrupt the brooding atmosphere. And what is the Boogeyman in this movie anyway? Balled lightning? An explosion of distorted computeranimated birds? a malfunctioning transmitted cartoon image of the grim reaper? Hard to tell. Bad computer animation spoils the image. We can't even imagine. We certainly do NOT see any Boogeyman. Not the guy with the creepy hand on the door in the trailer. If we see anything at all it's like video game graphics distorted by a glitch in the imagery. C'mon producers  GIVE US THE BOOGEYMAN. Not videogenic mess.The Boogeyman must be a CHARACTER we can see  preferably something that talks or has some other habit that frightens us. Freddy Krueger Jeepers Creepers the Tall Man on Phantasm Reverend Henry Kane on Poltergeist or the chauffeur on Burnt Offerings who is too thin and tall and has a freaky inappropriate grin and piercing stare  are Boogeymen. Jason Voorhees Michael Myers and Leatherface are perhaps another type of boogyman but their agenda is less frightening because they exist merely to killRather than being killed or abducted by the boogeyman which we see in the trailerwe instead see people being bounced around the walls of rooms and hallways like rubber balls. Just one impact at this overdone velocity would kill a person instantly but here we see people bounce around the walls and get back up unharmed to 'fight.' and see victims instantly wrapped in saran rap etc. On and on it goes.Directors producers please take note. It just doesn't work. Things that move faster than the eye can see are not scary. Cheap computer graphic effects don't work. Loud startling noises are a cheap substitute for brooding horror or shocking terror and don't work. The true 'Boogeyman' archetype that really scares the crap out of us is a slow menacing presence. We may only get glimpses of him or he may torment us from the closet or under the bed as in Poltergiest or he may come a'calling like a traveling salesman or road menace. True Boogeymen must be seen in closets we see him in the mirror on closet doors we see him hanging like a scarecrow or hanging from a noose like a kite caught in a tree. They come uninvited to take what they want they can appear out of nowhere and can seem to disappear just as fast they usually have personalities and voices that creep us out no matter how many years pass they are invincible and they like for you to learn of their invincibility as you try to fight them off. They love to torment and terrorize their victims before killingabductingsoul eatingdragging them off to hell or whatever they do. True boogeymen may have some weaknesses. In better horror movies and nightmares they can sometimes temporarily be resisted or staved off by certain psychological or spiritual disciplines or religious rituals but they cannot really be destroyed. At best they may leave us to find an easier target but they usually get what they want.I was not impressed at all with this movie I'm even more disgusted by the fact that they had a lot of good actorssetstechnologies to work with. For instance the character of Franny Roberts Skye McCole Bartusiak a mysterious attractive but oddly troubled twelvishyearold girl who seems to know what's going on was by far a more interesting character in this film than the 'Boogeyman.' In fact she was the most interesting character in the movie weirdly sad melancholy yet somewhat a tomboy  like a lost childhood friend we forgot about and kinda miss. Why wasn't she given a bigger role?And the protagonist Tim Barry Watson did a pretty convincing act of being legitimately scared and haunted by a childhood memory. They Tim and the little girl Franny should have been the ones together to thwart or vanquish the boogeyman.' Not the guy and the excrush 'Kate.' Remember the boogeyman should be a menacing presence a collector of souls a tormentor who plays games with his victims before taking them away. Boogeymen may have vulnerabilities but cannot really be destroyed. Please no more computeranimated lightning explosions and MTV to represent the boogeyman.Most of all the Boogeyman needs to be a character and not just be bad graphics aflashing. The boogeyman needs a voice and creepy antics. He is an abductor of souls the tormentor of children he is somewhat invincible but can be driven away and always takes his helpless victims to a fate worse than hell.Remember this.".

CUPBOARDS!!!!! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. This is apparently due to some childhood trauma that occurs in the opening scene but to be honest I'm not sure exactly what happened cos the sequence looked like it was shot and edited by an epileptic who had taken an amphetamine overdose. It seems to have become accepted in Hollywood that the best way to make a scary movie is to direct it like a Britney spears music video... admittedly thats pretty terrifying but not if youCast bland wooden actors... Base all your scares on tired haunted house clich's The wardrobe scene was one of the most poorly executed horror sequences I've ever seen void of tension void of style and the pay off is so lame even a black cat hissing and jumping on him would have been preferable... Layer the most annoyingly intrusive score over everything... Make no attempt at narrative cohesion... Drench the final scene in childish CGI...If this film had contained even a shred of lightheartedness about it I might have found it tolerable but everything about it was so pofaced and serious I find it hard to believe anyone could enjoy this film on any level. It's almost impossible to relate to any of the characters mainly because they are so miserable and unlikeable and as a result it's impossible to CARE whether they livediedisappearget snatched by a stupid purple comic book character.I recommend that anyone who is remotely considering seeing this film does not do so for their own well being and the sake of their souls... Don't become like me! Don't become a bitter purple CGI freak who hides in cupboards thinking about how much he wants to flame this film on every website on the internet... I hate this film!

Layer the most annoyingly intrusive score over everything... Make no attempt at narrative cohesion... Drench the final scene in childish CGI...If this film had contained even a shred of lightheartedness about it I might have found it tolerable but everything about it was so pofaced and serious I find it hard to believe anyone could enjoy this film on any level. It's almost impossible to relate to any of the characters mainly because they are so miserable and unlikeable and as a result it's impossible to CARE whether they livediedisappearget snatched by a stupid purple comic book character.I recommend that anyone who is remotely considering seeing this film does not do so for their own well being and the sake of their souls... Don't become like me! Don't become a bitter purple CGI freak who hides in cupboards thinking about how much he wants to flame this film on every website on the internet... I hate this film! AAARGH!";

The last few years have been a golden age for modestly budgeted fright flicks.

I walked away from that film rather disappointed but my confusion paled in comparison to the slackjawed bewilderment that consumed me during Boogeyman.The film's opening sequence features a man being ravaged by an unseen monster while his son observes helplessly. Fifteen years later we discover that Tim Barry Watson has never properly dealt with his father's sudden grisly death. After learning that his mother has passed away Tim returns home for her funeral. While in town he decides to face his fears by staying overnight in his unusually creepy boyhood home.A series of muddled incomplete ideas figure their way into the plot but ultimately the story is nonsensical and just plain stupid. As with most recent horror films Boogeyman provides no real terror and instead attempts to startle the viewer by adding abrupt loud noises to the soundtrack.

	schema:reviewBody "Pros An enjoyable take on the boogeyman we fear as children. Nice Raimiesque shock editing.Cons Terribly incoherent storyline. Bad acting.Spoilers follow.Boogeyman takes the mythos of the monster in the closet and the monster under the bed or as seen in the film above the dropped ceiling panels and gives it a bit of a spin. Tim our protagonist is a little boy when the story begins. He's in bed on a scary night and the shadows are playing tricks on him. Or are they? Was that a hooded man standing in his room? No it's just his jacket slung over a chair back. But wait did it move? He turns on the light and sure enough the jacket is now strangely on the floor. He makes enough noise in his fear that his dad comes in to check.This is a nice beginning as director Kay nicely captures the feelings many of us had when we were little. Afraid of the dark. Able to read all sorts of looming danger into dim sights and faint sounds. And then finally a parent coming in to dispel all the notions.Then the story breaks the rules. The boogeyman is real pulls dad into the closet and takes him away! Oh and they weren't really faint sounds. This is a very loud house. It creaks and groans like a ship. Kay is not subtle with the sounds for shock value either as sudden screeching and hissing will jolt you out of your seat. Yeah it's a cheap way to deliver a shock but it worked.Tim is traumatized and we cut to 15 years later. He's never gotten over the ordeal. He has no closets in his apartment and has even removed the doors from the cabinets. Somehow though he's managed to score both a really mint '67 Mustang and a hot rich blonde dyed girlfriend. That's pretty impressive since he doesn't show many qualities. Tim really doesn't do much in the movie other than mumble and give looooooong silent looks of concern.At his hot girlfriend's house he has a vision of his mother Lucy Lawless telling him to look at her. I didn't understand this and it was never really explained. In fact there were a lot of disconnected plot lines and loose ends in the movie. Noting multiple writers I'm guessing this was not a concerted effort but instead went through a lot of patching and overhauls.Anywho he knows something is wrong and sure enough even as he is explicitly stating that something is wrong his Uncle Mike calls. His mom is dead. Well Tim has gone along with what his psychiatrists have told him that there is no boogeyman that his dad left them for no reason etc. But he darn well knows that the boogeyman is not only real but apparently powerful enough to kill Xena the Warrior Princess. If the official cause of death for Xena was mentioned in the movie I missed it. But her face was covered with unnatural scarring. So I'm guessing the boogeyman did it.Not only does he return for his mom's funeral but also decides to face his fears and stay in the house. Facing the boogeyman is a theme that the movie sticks in front of us several times. Tim turns out to be rather reluctant to do so and actually ends up boarding all the closet doors shut at one point.While at home he reconnects with a childhood friend who seems to have pined for him and perhaps him for her as well. Like so many plot points this was incredibly vague and seemed to be another subplot shoehorned in from one of the many revisions. His hot girlfriend also shows up unannounced having driven to see him. Both of these ladies are due for a visit from the boogeyman.He also finds a little girl hiding in the tool shed. She explains that she lives nearby and leaves her backpack. He discovers lots of missing posters of children. The children from the poster suddenly appear to him in another vision all crowded around looking perfectly healthy unlike his mom and calm. They did all grasp at him though so that must mean something dire.There are some incomplete segments that follow involving his hot girlfriend being taken by the boogeyman from a motel room. His childhood friend almost getting the same. And the little girl turning out to have been abducted in 1985 when she takes him to a house where another man lived who also tried to face the boogeyman.Oh and the boogeyman hiding spots closets beds dropped ceilings are also portals.We're not sure who lives and dies since his hot girlfriend was clearly seen alive at some point and still struggling. This may have been a time warp though since he left a blood smear on the bathtub which was not there when he first noticed her missing was there when he went back with the childhood friend but just made when he struggled If that sounds confusing so is the movie.Another neat concept to me was revealed at the end where it seems the boogeyman is able to manifest himself through those same familiar items that take on a more sinister image in the dark. By destroying the items Tim was able to destroy the boogeyman.Not all plot points will be resolved but the movie is a fun ride. Relaxed and expecting a bad movie I got an enjoyable thrill. Slow pacing and a muddled story made the experience uneven.I wasn't familiar with Kay but noted during the movie how much he had picked up from Raimi particularly his Evil Dead style closeups and pans. Then during the credits it looked like the Xena crew with Raimi and Rapert Chloe Smith Joseph LoDuca etc. so that made sense.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to this movie i will now be taking a break from movies of this CC crap calibre.Unlike most of my adventures finding a crappy horror movie i didn't rent this 'movie' because i was attracted by the sleek graphics on the cover and i sure as heck didn't buy it because of the innovative title. Actually to this day i am still wondering why why why God why?!Concerning the storyline  this has to be one of the most shallow movies i have ever seen and i'm not talking about end at the swimming pool shalllow i'm talking about that drip in the bottom of your coffeetea mug that you can never get out.On with my review The movie starts by introducing the main character as a young boy in bed at night he is scared because of something  the boogeyman i presume or CGIman as i like to call him. Anyway his dad comes in to calm him and reassure him that 'there is no such thing as the boogeyman'yes he really says that line. Then he get's pulled into his son's closet by some wind or something. The movie then skips 15 years to him as a midtwenty year old man. He is fairly successful as i understand  he has a hot girlfriend and a hot car. The only thing that isn't hot is the fact that he manages to find everything scary. I mean everything. I thought it would just be closets  logically as his dad was took into one by CGIman 15 years ago but it's everything. Every 10 seconds he suddenly stops walking and turns to stare at a random object with a worried but confused look upon his face like he's a little scared but at the same time wondering if he has left his macaroni burning on the stove. It's quite amusing at first but after around 100 times it becomes a little irritating.The scariest moment in the movie is when he is driving his car and a bird flies into the window. The best and funniest part is straight after the bird incident when he stops his car gets out and just stands there to stare at the road looking quite upset and moved by the bird's death?!

	onyx:emotionText "Thanks to this movie i will now be taking a break from movies of this CC crap calibre.Unlike most of my adventures finding a crappy horror movie i didn't rent this 'movie' because i was attracted by the sleek graphics on the cover and i sure as heck didn't buy it because of the innovative title. Actually to this day i am still wondering why why why God why?!Concerning the storyline  this has to be one of the most shallow movies i have ever seen and i'm not talking about end at the swimming pool shalllow i'm talking about that drip in the bottom of your coffeetea mug that you can never get out.On with my review The movie starts by introducing the main character as a young boy in bed at night he is scared because of something  the boogeyman i presume or CGIman as i like to call him. Anyway his dad comes in to calm him and reassure him that 'there is no such thing as the boogeyman'yes he really says that line. Then he get's pulled into his son's closet by some wind or something. The movie then skips 15 years to him as a midtwenty year old man. He is fairly successful as i understand  he has a hot girlfriend and a hot car. The only thing that isn't hot is the fact that he manages to find everything scary. I mean everything. I thought it would just be closets  logically as his dad was took into one by CGIman 15 years ago but it's everything. Every 10 seconds he suddenly stops walking and turns to stare at a random object with a worried but confused look upon his face like he's a little scared but at the same time wondering if he has left his macaroni burning on the stove. It's quite amusing at first but after around 100 times it becomes a little irritating.The scariest moment in the movie is when he is driving his car and a bird flies into the window. The best and funniest part is straight after the bird incident when he stops his car gets out and just stands there to stare at the road looking quite upset and moved by the bird's death?! Then his mother dies so he decides to do what anyone would do who is scared of everything  he goes to stay at his childhood house  where his father diedgot pulled into a closet. He then meets a childhood friend who is randomly in need of some ice they then talk about his mothers death where she says 'sorry about your mom' he responds with 'me too' and she replies with 'how about that ice then?' sweet girl!Toward the end of the movie the guy is obviously under the illusion he is in 'narnia' and proceeds to walk through the back of the closet in his old house into a hotel room a few miles away? Then his girlfriend disappears and then his uncle so he just presumes the boogeyman took them...well what other possible explanation could there be?  well plenty actually  maybe taking the dog for a walk or trying to find the movie director so they can persuade him that it is a lame movie and they should stop filming now.The ending is not a firework spectacular finale but then again i didn't expect one after watching 90 minutes of monkey poo.

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Jensen Barry Watson is deathly afraid of the boogeyman. After the boogeyman appears to take away his dad one night he's sent to live with his uncle. Years later after he's moved away he must return home due to a family tragedy and once again it's time to face his childhood fears head on.In many ways Boogeyman exists solely as a sequence of buildups to shock or scare scenes. While some people might argue that a large percentage of the horror genre is based on that I would disagree but there's not room to explain why here. Boogeyman at least makes its goals more obvious in its unusual and slightly repetitive extremes of pacing. That may sound a bit negative but director Stephen T. Kay fairly well achieves what he set out to do. This is an effective film for its aspirations. Much of the film is paced very slowly. Whereas some films such as Hide and Seek 2005 are slowerpaced because they have realist drama inclinations Boogeyman only slows down to provide a contrast to its monster attack scenes the idea being that the dissimilarity in tone will amplify the attack scenes. It works better than it should for such a thinly veiled technique partially because the slow sections tend to be artistically interesting rather than boring. A lot of them are odd pregnant pauses which naturally create a tension because of dramatic anticipation. Occasionally they are extremely poetic and surreal as is the plot in general.When the frenetic material comes along the contrast can provide a shock but on the negative side most of the attack scenes are filmed and edited a bit too spastically with jerky camera motions and split second cuts. It can be a bit too quick and blurry for my tastes and reminded me of a similar technique used in Darkness Falls 2003. There are also some plot similarities to that film. In both films the convulsive editing occasionally succeeds but just as often doesn't.But Boogeyman is otherwise loaded with praiseworthy cinematography. Although the leaningtowardsmonotone bluetinted look may be getting a bit clichd it effectively creates a mood for the film. Better are a number of unusual shots and angles inspired by producer Sam Raimi. A cockeyed backwards tracking shot down a hallway is extremely effective. This film has the most organic use of intentionally blurry shots that I've seen in some time. There is an Argentolike shot taking us inside a mechanism a lock on a door. The film would be worth a view on this aspect alone.However the story is intriguing enough. Viewers not used to the abandonment of linear logical plot lines where everything is explained may be uncomfortable with the film but if you watch it expecting something more along the lines of a recording of an extended nightmare you'll find it more enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the more surreal aspects. The style is closer to European and Asian horror films than traditional American films. As is typical in those films multiple explanations of the horror behind the Boogeyman are possible and are neither specified nor spelled out for the viewer. You have to think if you want to explore possible explanations of the film just as you'd have to think to interpret a nightmare.Among the many interpretations possible are that the film is largely a depiction of the main character's fears so it's more of a personification of them than a literal series of events in the outside world that the main character is responsible for misdeeds and the villain of the film is a kind of split personality and much of the action is again a depiction of what's going on in the main character's mind that the villain is a literal manifestation created from the main character's fears which has taken on a life of its own that the villain is from a supernaturalparanormal world wherein other kinds of paranormal creatures can also exist and interact with and influence both the natural and supernaturalparanormal world. Any and all of those interpretations could also be layered so that the film is multifaceted. What writer Eric Kripke and Stephen T. Kay actually intended is not the point. The point is for the viewer to provide their own interpretation if they wish. I love that kind of ambiguity in films. There is also at least one subtext reading possible where Boogeyman is primarily about familial relationships especially those surrounding child rearing. Each character in the film has a different kind of relationship with their parents and each character's personality seems almost an inevitable product of parental influence. This determines their eventual fate and in some cases the personalities branch out to many other people irrevocably affecting their lives or deaths.".

Not to mention the countless other horror atrocities that have gone directly to videoDVD.To be fair the Amityville remake was technically better than the original and the newer Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a pretty good time waster with some genuine thrills. Even some straighttovideo releases such as Dead Birds and Toolbox Murders had their moments but they were not on the same level as some of the earlier classics such as Black Christmas Halloween The Shining The Exorcist Poltergeist Suspiria The Changeling The Howling An American Werewolf In London... you get my point? Judging by Hollywood's recent track record I'm getting the impression that today's filmmaker's really don't give a darn about the horror genre. Which is a shame because there are millions of horror film fans out there just waiting for that one horror masterpiece.The wait will continue because BOOGEYMAN isn't it. As a matter of fact this film has got to be the worst horror film of the last 10 years.The film stars a very stiff Barry Watson whom I believe has no facial muscles since his expression does not seem to change for the duration of this film who plays a traumatized magazine editor who returns to his childhood home to confront his childhood fear the CGI created title character. Sounds interesting? It really isn't. Maybe with a different cast different script and a different director this may have been worth the while but everything about this film is bottomofthe barrel. The entire adult cast including Lucy Lawless is stiff and uninspired. The child protagonist Skye McCole Bartusiak doesn't fare any better. I never thought the day would come that I'd utter these unfortunate words Dakota Fanning where are you?As for the Boogeyman himself once he's revealed to the viewer he is as frightening as Gonzo from The Muppet Show. But wait even the muppets have more depth more character than this flat dreary onedimensional entity created using someone's laptop.There is an obscure lowbudget early 80's horror film called The Boogeyman starring the lifeless I am sensing a trend here Suzanne Love and the always creepy John Carradine. Although it is no masterpiece and the film suffers greatly from it's obvious lowbudget and bad acting it is still a lot more entertaining and creative than this stinker. Boogeyman2005 has nothing to recommend it. There's not one memorable scene or character. Even as a Bmovie this fails.If it's thrills chills and action you're looking for then watch an episode of Iron ChefAmerica and thank me later.Highly not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boogeyman was an awful piece of cinema. I had a hunch before I saw it but i thought it would at least provide enough action andor entertainment to keep me happily occupied like Darkness Falls did. Who knew my low expectations would be so let down? Boogeyman is the most terribly directed horror movie i've ever seen. I've never felt so humiliated by a movie. As a horror fan I go into most movies expecting a couple of cheap jump scenes but at least a genuine fright or two after a few minutes of being kept on the edge of my seat. Boogeyman shat all over this theory. For example out of nowhere this loud ass music would blast me awake show me a 2 second slide show of a dead child and green scary eyes and then continue as normal as if it didn't happen. As this tactic was repeated several times I began to become really frustrated. The scenes were totally pointless! The quick cuts came out of nowhere and were forgotten in subseconds. By the third or fourth time it happened I wasn't evenly remotely scared.I could also rant about the acting or the lack there of but come on we are talking about a nosubstance horror movie here. This isn't The Ring or a movie that contains heavy characterizations. So I won't spend much time on it other than saying it was craptacular as one should expect.The special effects were downright terrible. I've seen better in video games for PSone especially during the climax. Then again we the audience aren't the best judges of special effects at the end because o yeah you can't make out a goddamn thing that is happening! All the sudden characters are flying through the air and there are flashes of purple lightning. Even Hollow man makes an appearance i think.Anyway from a fan of horror movies  including Darkness Falls  I'm warning you don't see this movie! I am giving Boogeyman a 210 for the only two things I liked about it. First was an effective seen involving a bunch of dead children and second was a great jump scene that involves Barry Watson's dead mother.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Barry Watson must return to his childhood home and confront the visions that have terrified him his whole life. When he gets there the evil forces behind the visions are given another chance to get their hands on him.The story sounds a lot like Darkness Falls from a few years back. That film was pretty disappointing but it was pretty stylish. Boogeyman is more or less the same. It offers a few decent scares and it is pretty stylish. However the film is kind of a joke using cheap tactics to scare it's audience. The attempted scares are all cheap loud noises which might make you jump if you watch the movie in a theater full of girls. There were maybe a few scenes that did scare me. Like the first fifteen minutes or so are pretty creepy but then the film falls back into generic land. It rates a three on the horror scale.The acting isn't as bad as one would expect. Barry Watson gives a decent performance but he isn't good enough to truly save the film. Emily Deschanel also gives a decent performance nothing special. Lucy Lawless has a small role and she makes the most out of it. Skye McCole Bartusiak offers the worst performance and her character is pretty pointless. Director Stephen T. Kay can't really build up suspense well. All he does is film the main character scaring himself to death and it all becomes a bit silly after awhile.A big problem with the film is the script. It's very poor and it doesn't make a lot of sense. The ending is especially random and nothing is explained at all. The reason why the story is weak is because of the very short running time. 85 minutes is too short to tell a real effective story with this type of material. If they had bothered to write a decent story with decent scares then the movie would have been a lot better. However they didn't and Boogeyman ends up being a ridiculous and disappointing horror film. In the end while better than The Grudge this lame horror film is still not really worth watching.

We are treated to a decent scene at the beginning where Tim is a child and witnesses his father being taken by the evil Boogeyman. The entire movie is basically Tim running from the dark similar to Darkness Falls in a way.Boogeyman does do some things right however. For instance it makes you wait until nearly the end to see the Boogeyman face to face but this is very anticlimatic. You never get a clear look and when you do it looks like a human painted black. Not much to it there. The feel of the movie was great with the eery sound effects of the wind whistling and the house always creaking. In surround sound this has quite a creepy effect but when it is nonstop and in every location it becomes tiresome. Other than a few scenes that are designed to make you jump there is not much else to this movie. The ending leaves you less than satisfied and not even sure what just happened. I give 4.5 of 10 stars.".

That's the biggest bullpoo I ever heard. Well sure pokemon is mainly for young people but I did enjoy the movie for an 18 year old guy.Well back to the movie. The movie is great. I've seen the movie in Dutch first because I'm used to the Dutch voices and they sound better to me. The way Mewtwo's voice was used it was as if Mewtwo was really in your head. But you'll need Dolby Surround for that experience. Also the way the movie reffered back to the series perfect. I mean if you haven't seen the series then that's okey but don't look weird if you don't understand certain events and jokes and such.The most unique thing is that this Pokemon movie really shows how much the Pokemon can care for their trainer.  ENDING HINT  You can mostly see it near the end of the movie.Pokemon The First Movie is probably the first movie that succeeded on following up their series successfull. It may not be a great movie but it sure was fun to look at.".

Like when I saw it when I was 8 or 9 years old originally at the cinema all the kids enjoyed it including myself whilst the adults were just snoring away! They didn't even give it a chance! As of writing this review at the age of 19 the movie is still OK in my opinion. The sequel was better but I think Mewtwo was pretty cool in it and its not that long either so don't just completely bash it just because it has the name Pokemon on it. Season 1 of Pokemon was awesome and I wasn't even a huge fan of the anime! Finish it first and sure there are some plot holes in it but hey I still think the movie is entertaining. Overall a 610 at best as a teenadult but that means its passable.".

I had always hated some of the animated TV shows that came on television more specifically Cartoon Network except for a small amount and Pokmon was one of the exceptions in the small amount. Soon when they came out with the movie I was actually impatient to see it! It of course was some time ago when I was still somewhat little but I would still be dying to see it if they made it nowadays and would be just as pumped up about it. When I did see it I thought the film was true to the show and did an excellent job at conquering what it set out to do and that was entertain fans and be fun all around! It wasn't like any other kind of animated movie in it's genre as many think it is just a runofthemill letdown. I thought it had a really interesting theme and I was amazed at how they were able to pull off such an exciting and fun kids movie without destroying the originality of the TV show and without the use of lame jokes like toilet humor though I mean there were still some jokes and lines that could be considered extremely lame unless you just accept it for what it's worth which I did and without the use of inane curse words that parents would find insulting nowadays if you understand what I mean. Yes there is fighting which cancels out the heart and soul the show and movies try to set out but still in the end it tells kids that fighting isn't the answer and kids eventually grow up knowing that Pokmon aren't real so they shouldn't have to copy their actions. I say these things only because most critics condemn this film for those reasons. Oh well Pokmon The First Movie I must say really isn't even the best of the Pokmon movies it's actually my second favorite but it was still very excellent and worth the time to watch with great battle sequences superb characters and an effective plot and message. This film is great people need to lighten up and enjoy it for what it was...".

	schema:headline " This is a wonderful moving film that everyone should see!";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a nearly 17 year old girl and therefore I am not the targeted audience for this film. However as soon as my little brother introduced me to the world of Pokemon I fell in love. And what's not to love? The TV show is smart funny sweet and at times touching I sobbed during Goodbye Pikachu and Bye bye Butterfree. There are plenty of characters for both girls and boys to identify with which are something I think a lot of cartoonsvideo gamescomic books lack these days and it teaches good morals. So needless to say I was thrilled to go see Pokemon the first movie Mewtwo Strikes Back and today my Momwho's also a huge Pokemon fan at age 47 and little brother and I went to the theater.I was surprised to find the place was packed with a lot of boys who looked like they were at least in their late teens or early 20s. But of course there were plenty younger kids and parents there as well. My Mom and brother who's 12 btw had seen the Japanese subtitled version of the film and had warned me that it was going to be a rather dark plot and that it was sad... But I didn't expect what actually happened at all.The first half an hour or so is taken up but a short and very cute film called Pikachu's Summer Vacation which I became absorbed in as the 3 year old a few rows back! Of course it helped that my favourite Pokemon Jigglypuff had a part in it!Moving on the feature film Mewtwo Strikes Back started out in a very dramatic Batmanish way and I don't think that the younger kids in the audience were ready for that. The next part of the film which introduces us to Ash Misty Brock and their Pokemon happens in a much lighter tone  like the show usually is but that doesn't last for long. Soon afterwards our heroes along with some other trainers are invited to a battle with someone described as the world's toughest trainer.Now for those of you who've never seen Pokemon or know little about it one of the important things to remember is that these are NOT war like battles and the object is not to kill anyone's Pokemon. What Pokemon battles are is more like a karate match where they fight for sport until one of them is K.O'd or fainted as they say in the video game. They never fight for the sake of fighting they fight because it helps the Pokemon become stronger.One of the things that I really loved about the trainers that were invited to this ultimate battle is that they really did love their pokemon and they cared for them as one should with any living being. A lot of people tend to ignore this aspect of Pokemon and consider it to be a marketing scheme because of the tag line Gotta Catch 'em All but in truth it is not that way at all. On the show and in the game although not in the movie Ash's rival trainer Gary is obsessed with the act of catching as many pokemon as possible...And that's a trait to be looked down upon. Although Ash doesn't have as many Pokemon as Gary he cares for the ones he does have and treats them as his best friends and that's why he's the hero and Gary is not.The new Pokemon in the film Mewtwo does not understand that many of the trainers love their Pokemon because he was created by scientists for their own benefit and he has a strong hatred for humans because of this.Once the characters had entered the Castle where this battle was to take place the film became a lot darker and action packed. In turn many of the little kids who were there started screaming  but that's understandable I mean I was freaked out by some of the things that happened! Also the intensity becomes a lot greater.Never fear though Ash being the brave person he is comes through and saves the day  with the help of the pokemon and teaches Mewtwo that it isn't the life that you're given that makes you who you are but rather it's what you choose to do with it.I am a person who tries very hard never to cry in public places which include movie theaters no matter how sad I am. But with the Pokemon movie I just couldn't hold back and spent the last halfhour of it crying my eyes out! Honestly it touched me on a level that few movies have been able to.The only complaint I have about it is that the soundtrack was made in extremely poor taste. I've been into Pokemon for about 2 years now and I must say that with the exception of 3 songs on that album the rest had NOTHING to do with the meaning of Pokemon or the film! It wasn't the fact that the type of music and the artists that were on the album are not really my style... But it was rather that the songs were very sexual and I think it's INSANE to put songs about giving it to you among other things on an album that's aimed for children! Especially when there's nothing even remotely related to that subject involved in anything Pokemon!".

But thats OK. Names are not important.I liked the way Mewtwo kept saying Where am I? Who am I?. He said it so often it was the first phrase I learned in Japanese. I concluded that both would come in handy should I ever find myself lost in Japan.Later as my Anime horizons expanded and a animeobsessive friend of mine taught me some basic phrases and found I could recognise a lot of what was said. The vocabulary is fairly simple its a good movie to practise your Japanese on. And finally the most impressive thing I found. Upon reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstein I kept noticing similarities. Of course many many things are different but the basic themes are there who asked to create me?

	schema:reviewBody "As far as Japanese Anime in America goes this was an excellent movie. This was a typical scifi plot about man's need to control nature. The animation was decent and 10 times better than ScoobyDoo. The Pokmon just added the cuteness aspect present in all Japanese anime.As a movie for children I thought the beginning was very violent. They may not have shown actual violent scenes but then neither did the ATeam. As for the ending kids who live a sheltered life are in for a surprise. My friend had to do some fancy explaining to his young children about what really happened in the movie. Hey Pokmon tears are better than Dragon Balls any day.Also parents should watch Pokmon with their kids on TV before taking them to the movie. The movie will be a lot more enjoyable if you understand the characters. The movie has little characterplot development because it is all done in the series. Typical for anime movies this one did not affect the series storyline in anyway.Finally if you just love to watch Pokmon in action then Pikachu's Vacation is made for you. Reminded me of Charlie Brown shows in that you never saw the faces of any humans just their talking feet. Pokmon is probably so popular with children because the language that Pokmon speak is universal. Adults have a hard time understanding Pokmon language because they rely too much on what is spoken and not how it is spoken. Pokmon speak with emotion something every child understands. The few bits of dialoge added to the short feature were probably more for the adults in the audience than the children themselves.Pika pika pipika pipikachu!".

	schema:headline " some might call me childlike for still having a soft spot for Pokemon. I prefer the term youngatheart.";
	schema:reviewBody "When I took the time to track down and watch both Pokemon The First Movie and Pokemon the Movie 2000 for the first time in years my feelings were swamped with joyous nostalgia tracing back to my younger years. There were times I felt I should have grown up in Japan because all of my favorite media products came from that great island nation. Godzilla and Pokemon. Those were my two obsessions. Yes I was one of millions from around the globe who collected the trading cards and checked in on the television show and played the videogames I still have a soft spot for the N64 game Pokemon Stadium and watched the movies when they popped up here in the U.S. Pokemon continued to ride strong in my interests until after a while when they created more than 151 little fighting monsters and things just bogged down to the point where they were excessively juvenile and just dumb. It was the same syndrome that momentarily struck Godzilla in the 70s. The king of the monsters recovered but Pokemon didn't. It sank away for me and many and although Pokemon is still around and still fairly popular with the younger generation it no longer has the cult status it once ruled with.But just because I am no longer swamped with obsession does not mean I cannot still feel the joy of this innocent little saga looking back on it as an adult. Yes before you question me I still enjoy the Pokemon movie. In fact I enjoy both of them especially Pokemon 2000. But this review concerns the first one released in 1999. For those who do not know there are a lot of Pokemon but one in particular called Mew is the strongest of them all. One day some fiddling scientists clone from Mew's DNA a newer stronger beast called Mewtwo a psychic creature infuriated by how Pokemon seem to have become slaves to humans. And very slowly he begins to set up a trap to restore Pokemon to what he feels is their rightful place in the world at the top. Once again we rendezvous with our heroes as the narrator calls them from the TV show. There's Ash Ketchum Misty Brock and of course the little lightningsurged rodent Pikachu. After a prologue revolving around Mewtwo we dive in with them.There is a lot of advertisement in Pokemon The First Movie. It is very much a merchandise exploitation to further the interest of kids in the cards games and series. But kids endorse these sort of things.

I also enjoy twists in the story such as how one of Ash's Pokemon a dragonlike thing called Charizard refuses to obey its master. There's personality in the Pokemon in Mewtwo and especially in Pikachu who dare I say it is actually kind of adorable as far as animated imaginary animals are concerned. There is a lot of personality in this little rodent especially in the eyes which are wellanimated and in its voice. There's also a trio of bumbling villains two rockstar wouldbe secret agents and their talking cat Meowth who have some very funny moments as they try to make a good impression for their boss by kidnapping Pikachu.

A movie adaptation needs to push the boundaries and expand rather than just use the same material at greater pacing. That's why I personally prefer Pokemon 2000 because it does what I mentioned.That's all I have to say in a bad manner.I know I will have a lot of insulting comments thrown in my direction but I see nothing wrong with number one having liked Pokemon in my youth and number two still mildly enjoying Pokemon as an adult looking back on a time when I was more innocent more openminded and more willing to accept things that were outside of what we were supposed to like and not like.

	onyx:emotionText "When I took the time to track down and watch both Pokemon The First Movie and Pokemon the Movie 2000 for the first time in years my feelings were swamped with joyous nostalgia tracing back to my younger years. There were times I felt I should have grown up in Japan because all of my favorite media products came from that great island nation. Godzilla and Pokemon. Those were my two obsessions. Yes I was one of millions from around the globe who collected the trading cards and checked in on the television show and played the videogames I still have a soft spot for the N64 game Pokemon Stadium and watched the movies when they popped up here in the U.S. Pokemon continued to ride strong in my interests until after a while when they created more than 151 little fighting monsters and things just bogged down to the point where they were excessively juvenile and just dumb. It was the same syndrome that momentarily struck Godzilla in the 70s. The king of the monsters recovered but Pokemon didn't. It sank away for me and many and although Pokemon is still around and still fairly popular with the younger generation it no longer has the cult status it once ruled with.But just because I am no longer swamped with obsession does not mean I cannot still feel the joy of this innocent little saga looking back on it as an adult. Yes before you question me I still enjoy the Pokemon movie. In fact I enjoy both of them especially Pokemon 2000. But this review concerns the first one released in 1999. For those who do not know there are a lot of Pokemon but one in particular called Mew is the strongest of them all. One day some fiddling scientists clone from Mew's DNA a newer stronger beast called Mewtwo a psychic creature infuriated by how Pokemon seem to have become slaves to humans. And very slowly he begins to set up a trap to restore Pokemon to what he feels is their rightful place in the world at the top. Once again we rendezvous with our heroes as the narrator calls them from the TV show. There's Ash Ketchum Misty Brock and of course the little lightningsurged rodent Pikachu. After a prologue revolving around Mewtwo we dive in with them.There is a lot of advertisement in Pokemon The First Movie. It is very much a merchandise exploitation to further the interest of kids in the cards games and series. But kids endorse these sort of things. I know because I remember I did when I was eight or so and saw the movie for the first time. I mean what kid wouldn't like to have an army of monsters at his command and be able to duke them out with other monsters? It's like having Godzilla and Mothra and Rodan at your command.What I really liked about Pokemon The First Movie then and now is that like Godzilla it's innocent and goodhearted fun.

Even so the American version is not that bad except for the soundtrack of course... M2M Oo. Also this is not a good old Evil versus Good guys movie.. if you pay attention to the story somewhat distorted by the Americans againyou will see that Mewtwo is just a confused guy who didn't want to be evil after all he realizes that his life is more important than superfluous things like being a clone or black  or whatever lol... anyway ... i just wanna say that the 3.2 rating of this movie is COMPLETELY unfair.".

For those of you who can't follow the story even if you have tried you must understand that this show was not made to make sense to adults. Childhood is required to make sense of this show. I don't think Charles Darwin could follow this show and it deals with evolution. The only adults that understand it were the ones who had watched it when they were kids. So my point is you should look at this show with a child's innocent perspective and you may get something out of it other than noise. albiet it may not be a philosophical lesson but it will be something.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first Pokemon movie is as expected the first of a long line of animated films based on the anime cartoon. For those who do not know what Pokemon is it is a popular franchise originating from Japan starting as a video game series but expanding into a cartoon and a several spinoff movies. The first movie is an exceptional film tribute to the series although some of the later films do top this. The movie's plot is very basic if one can get past all the amazing effects and characters. The original number of Pokemon is 151 but this movie introduces 150 and 151  Mewtwo and Mew. Mewtwo is a clone Pokemon created from the DNA of Mew and is generally the strongest Pokemon in the world. After being used as a lab rat and a weapon by humans Mewtwo becomes vengeful on the world believing humans and Pokemon living together can never work out. And so he plots to destroy the world through a lightning storm and replace all lifeforms with Pokemon clones. However the cartoon's heroes Ash Ketchum and his electric mouse buddy Pikachu are there to save the day along with the strongest Pokemon from the first generation. The film ends with a brief tragedy and then Mewtwo simply erases the memories of all the characters in the film so they forget everything.I did enjoy the film but a couple of things did surprise me. The cartoon and the movies are licensed by 4Kids a dubbing company known for apparently destroying anime with their heavy editing to the shows. However the movie seemed to be left alone apart from the English voice actors. The film had a large amount of physical violence including about a minute and a half montage of poor Pikachu being repeatedly slapped by his crying clone. From the 4Kids shows I have seen violence has been kept to a minimum but I suppose this movie was left alone due to it being part of the plot. Some Pokemon names were wrong although the editors said this was done deliberately. Overall this film was generally good but a bit too violent for Pokemon's standards.".

It's also a lonesome mediation on the nature of trust and the complexity of human relationships with a tragic punchline and a strong sense of alienation running throughout.Deeply melancholy loaded with ravishingly beautiful imagery and haunting performances from the two gifted leads Anita Mui and the evermesmerising Lesley Cheung Rouge is an unforgettable understated and utterly unique piece of filmmaking.

It was directed by Miguel Alexandre and written by Annette Hess and the fact that both were already fairly experienced back then may trick you into expecting more from this film than you should. The poster as well as the pretentious title implying a strong female performance during tumultuous historic times and the name of lead actress Veronica Ferres should tell anybody who just knows a little bit about German film what to expect here pseudo important crap acting that is as onedimensional and cringeworthy as the character was written and by no means a film that makes any kind of historic impact whatsoever. Needless to say the movie also takes itself so seriously that you would think the filmmakers thought they were coming up with something epic creative and brilliant. This is exactly that kind of movie that tricks the easily entertained into believing Veronica Ferres had any talent pulling off a performance like that. The opposite is the case and the other reviewer is 100 correct that Ferres' facial acting is restricted to a maximum of 2 face expressions both puffy for 180 minutes approximately and it is a complete mystery to me why she is having any kind of success and why even today a brilliant filmmaker like Werner Herzog casts her as lead. I just don't get it. She is just as bad and onedimensional as the likes of Furtwngler Thomalla Neubauer and others maybe Berben too. Then again some consider these talented too but there all is lost obviously. Back to this film here there is not a lot to say about the plot. It will only teach something to those who don't know one bit about German history so yes on the one hand it is a film appealing to the stupid on the other hand I doubt they'd even want to watch this here. And when I say that this film is based on real events the stupid can't hold back in their approach how good and important it is while in fact it is even more shameful what they made of the story of a woman whose fight for her children really could have served as the material for a touching film and not a mess like this one here. On a little sidenote the kids here are played by Ehrich and Schlott two young actress and among the rising stars of her generation today both really stunning too but that's needless to say. They are really not a problem here. The 2 key issues are Ferres and the script but these are gigantic dealbreakers for the negative side. One pretty safe approach to see that a film like this sucks is if it gets a Rosamunde Pilcher romance story line because we all want the protagonist to be happy of course. But at the same time we shall never forget she is such a dedicated mother that her kids come first. Ugh. I have to stop now before I really have to throw up. Terrible film here don't watch and those who gave awards attention to it should be the only ones more ashamed than those who made this film.".

The reason why I wrote this one here is possibly the worst is because it is the one that features Wilson Gonzales Ochsenknecht the most. He is a definite contender for worst German actor right now and I am absolutely sure that he would not have a career without his famous dad. Jimi Blue is not much better but Wilson Gonzales is cringeworthy in absolutely every scene he is in. They did better with having him as a very small supporting character in the first three films. Joachim Masannek is the writer and director again and the difference between this film and the other is that the wild kids face two different enemy football teams this time. That is probably also why this movie is much longer than films 13. Add to that a story of jealousy involving the Ochsenknecht boys and you have a runtime not too far away from two hours anymore.Nobody other than Uwe Ochsenknecht is known in the cast anymore which is actually really bad looking at other German kids movies with stellar casts and performances. But what would you expect if the filmmaker behind this puts all his children into all these films. Favoritism of the worst kind. The costumes are pretty horrible too and the football action that was initially the core of these movies has become only a subplot by now. Also it is funny how they said in the third film that they are too old for the whole wild boys thing and yet they made two more films afterward. Cash cow alert. Quality is irrelevant by now. It's only making as much money as possible with these sequels. The only positive thing you could say is that this movie is not worse than the previous one but sadly the only reason is that they were all utter crap already as well. The music is bad Bananafishbones have delivered extremely terrible songs for all 5 films the football action is completely unrealistic rubbish and the whole motorbike riding is as pretentious as it gets. These five films are a definite contender for worst movie franchise of all times. Stay away.".

Young Thlmann a soldier against his will would like to join the expanding conflict on the side of his comrades in Hamburg. As the revolution becomes threatened by the betrayal of the rightwing Social Democrats and the splintering of the working class he nevertheless tries unremittingly to unite the workers. The reactionaries grow ever stronger and the neediness of ordinary people multiplies. In this dire situation the Hamburg police commissioner would like to block the unloading of a ship full of provisions that were sent from Petrograd as a message of solidarity. But Thlmann prevails in unloading it. The high point and conclusion of the first part of the Thlmann films is established at the Hamburg Uprising in October 1923.";

	schema:headline " Thlmann  Founding Father of German Communism";
	schema:reviewBody "This film can only be appreciated if one knows its background. It was made in this curious country the GDR and Ernst Thlmann was the leader of the German communist party before the Second World War. In fact Thlmann was seen by the GDRelite as something of a founding father perhaps in the same way as the Americans admire Washington or Lincoln. Just like the carving of the first American presidents in rock so one finds megalomaniac statues of Thlmann in the former GDR. This was of course a bit much for the common people but the film had a relative success perhaps also because bus loads of school children and personnel clubs were driven for free to the cinemas  try that with YOUR boss!. Somehow the people in the GDR saw that the roots of communism lie in humanism. Even now most people in the former GDR think of their past as indeed living in a dictatorship but not in a wrong state. Just look at for instance the realistic touching and much loved film Paul und Paula. In addition it should be kept in mind that Thlmann was active in the same political organization as the much mourned Rosa Luxemburg. On the other hand he was also associated with Walter Ulbricht who started his career in the GDR as a Stalinist. Thlmann had already been put in a Nazi jail by the time that the cruelties of Stalin reached their climax. The film Ernst Thlmann portrays in 2 DVDs! his life and death in a realistic way but with extreme willingness. Political films are commonly biased in both east and west and the communist system has always been to weak to endure criticism from within. The story is therefore a straigthforward historic epic poem in which the actors do a good job. It is all realism you get what you see and there are no hidden meanings false bottoms or other bourgeois deceptions. There is nothing wrong with that. Of course the film can not conceal the violent nature of the communist party and her destabilizing effect on the Republic of Weimar. In fact it does not even try since the bringing about of the revolution and the fall of capitalism is the ultimate goal of Leninism and thus seen as a virtue. The viewer should also bear in mind that in the roaring twenties the Comintern had already become an instrument for the protection of Soviet interests. The revolutionary climate died around 1920. Whereas the proletarian resistance against the fascist Kapp Putsch 1920 was justified and successful this was not longer the case for the ensuing Ruhr uprising by the communists in 1921. By that time the socialdemocrats and the trade unions had already abandoned the armed resistance against the German military. The Ruhr uprising against the disarmament of the workers was without chance and ordered by the Comintern with the Soviet president Lenin behind it as driving force mainly to weaken the German neighbour. The script has no room for such criticism or even doubts. If Thlmann has ever made a mistake it is certainly not visible in this movie. For some strange reason the personal glorification of the leaders has always been typical in communist countries. They were probably supposed to represent the human goodness and be the ultimate example for the common people. With Thlmann this turned out to be especially easy after his eventual murder by the Hitler fascists. If one is able to feel empathy and to accept the rather unusual ideological perspective then the viewer is rewarded with a nice impression of the Republic of Weimar and the rise and establishment of Nazism.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful satire of banking systems and mindless consumerism";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is clearly a clever subtle satire of banking systems. The tag line is the premise of the movie When You're 100000 In Debt It's Your Problem. When You're 1000000 In Debt... It's The Bank's. Now in 2010 we're seeing that if banks owe many billions of dollars then it is the taxpayer's problem. Rosalie's problem has recently become a problem for all of us. This problem is not only limited to one country or banking system. Rosalie is not a heroine she is the personification of consumerism gone outofcontrol and a banking system that enables it. The movie really provides an underlying warning message. It should be required watching for anyone who wants to understand why things can easily go wrong in any banking system. Although I first saw this movie in the early 1990s I think it will make most sense to people now in 2010!".

The mere spetacle of Germans in rural Arkansas is reason enough to see this fun little film.

Rosalie dances blissfully along throughout the film under the illusion that credit and buying things is the reason for existence. Of course this is precisely the design that corporate America has for us assenting duped citizens. But Percy Aldon the director does not hold contempt for Rosalie in fact she remains likable to the end of the film even as perhaps because she bilks her creditors repeatedly. Warning do not try this at home! And up to the end she appears to get away with it. Is she crazy? No more than most Americans as loaded down with debt as most of us are. Rosalie's husband played by the late Brad Davis is the goofiest of all what strange brainwaves was he channeling when he acting this role? And Judge Reinhold is fun as Rosalie's befuddled priest. I can't think of too many films that deserve DVD reissue more than this one. One day we may all look back at this neglected film as small and quirky as it is and see it as prophetic a major explication of our nation's debtor woes. But I hope I'm wrong that we Americans suddenly begin to eschew debt make it taboo and wake up to smell the roses. As Wordsworth wrote The world is too much with us.".

The film's light humor and plot makes for delightful viewing as long as the viewer understands this is an indie film shot with a small budget. It's definitely worth watching.

It maintains the acute acting and psychological fullness of a biopic aided by a fantastic performance by Miller while being in keeping with the Hollywood highs and lows aspects of great sports movies.Those not interested in sport should not be put off by thinking this will be a typically superficial or one dimensional sports film. But those sporty types will also find plenty to satisfy them.As a big cycling fan I was already well aware of the Obree story and I can assure people that is every bit as incredible if not more so than is shown in the film. Naturally the constraints of a film mean that the Obree story is cut short and we don't see how the Superman position was banned or Obree's subsequent depressions especially after his brother died indeed his brother is completely missing from the film. But by choosing to limit the time scale it describes it allows time for greater detail particularly in investigated his relationship with the priest and Obree's wife.Equally the film doesn't embellish the truth a great deal in order to increase the drama. Indeed the world record attempts are incredibly understated as they should be. Obree was never well known in Britain despite being very popular on the continent. As a result the film isn't filled with cheering crowds but rather focuses the isolation he experienced within Scotland in spite of his amazing achievements.".

It does take liberties with the Obree story as anyone who has read his book will notice but these are generally fairly minor and do not detract from dramatic piece. The acting is universally great as you would expect from actors of the stature of Brian Cox Stephen Berkoff etc and Johnny Lee Miller does a superb job as tortured genius Graeme Obree.

I followed Graemes career closely and remember vividly seeing his triumphs on the news. I knew about some of the issues he had to face in his life the adversity that he had to overcome time and time again. Sitting down in a PACKED movie theatre in Christchurch NZ I felt tremendously proud of him and emailed home straight away to pass on that message that if he still has any doubts today then I wanted him to know that on the other side of the world he packed a theatre out and the chances are that if he packed a theatre in tiny Christchurch then he will have done so in Wellington Auckland Sydney Melbourne etc. Cycling is pretty popular here in the Southern Hemisphere and there were young kids in the audience who held him up as a hero. His honesty in writing his autobiography and allowing this film to be made no holds barred is truly an inspiration because it shows that if he can make it become world champion twice break the hour record twice without the major sponsorship and million pound technology of his contemparies then so can they the young lads starting out. Graeme you were an inspiration and you still are to MANY MANY people. And you have earned the admiration of many many people not only with your genius designs but with your honesty in facing your demons and confronting them head on. I know the Obree family continue to be very proud of you but ultimately you can be immensely proud of yourself and everything you have achieved. If the Cycling fraternity were to ever appoint an ambassador for the sport to get youngsters more interested in it  it really should be you. Watching the movie was painful at times but ultimately I came out of the theatre very very proud and I wish you and your family all the best for the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is great but the movie itself is a bit rough. Directed by a TV director it often seems rough in its continuity. But in spite of that it is a very worthwhile movie of a great true story.Jonny Lee Miller is Graeme Obree Glasgow road biker who finds the reality of making ends meet. His bicycle shop is not making money so he is forced to close it and work as a bike messenger. Not so coincidentally my oldest son a competitive biker in his 20s in the late 1990s also worked as a bike messenger in a large city. Obree had some difficulties as a boy mainly because his dad was in law enforcement. Some of the older larger bullies who had shady dads would abuse young Obree and in one scene holding him down as they urinated on him. But he never told on them instead held it inside which contributed to his bouts of depression as an adult. Billy Boyd of 'LOTR' fame plays fellow bike messenger Malky who becomes Obree's manager when Obree decides to break the records for the onehour interval around a velodrome track.

	onyx:emotionText "The story is great but the movie itself is a bit rough. Directed by a TV director it often seems rough in its continuity. But in spite of that it is a very worthwhile movie of a great true story.Jonny Lee Miller is Graeme Obree Glasgow road biker who finds the reality of making ends meet. His bicycle shop is not making money so he is forced to close it and work as a bike messenger. Not so coincidentally my oldest son a competitive biker in his 20s in the late 1990s also worked as a bike messenger in a large city. Obree had some difficulties as a boy mainly because his dad was in law enforcement. Some of the older larger bullies who had shady dads would abuse young Obree and in one scene holding him down as they urinated on him. But he never told on them instead held it inside which contributed to his bouts of depression as an adult. Billy Boyd of 'LOTR' fame plays fellow bike messenger Malky who becomes Obree's manager when Obree decides to break the records for the onehour interval around a velodrome track. This was in 19931994 and Obree inspired from different sources designs and builds his own bike with radical new features. A good movie about the triumph of the human spirit amidst difficulty and controversy.";

I've preordered the DVD  but this is the very definition of big screen cinema entertainment.In the late night screening I was lucky to have a whole row to myself  so no one witnessed my emotional gasps or the times during the races when I was literally shaking with excitement.I loved the way that Graeme's struggle with manic depression is given respectful depth  especially since his illness was an integral part of what drove him obsessively to achieve. Too few films deal effectively with the stress and reality of being bipolar. We need to see that he is loved respected and supported as living with a mental illness but also that he can accept polite active intervention.This is a remarkable story  extremely well told. Full praise to all of the cast  especially Jonny Lee Miller who looks and lives the part and to Brian Cox one of Britain's greatest dramatic actors see The Lost Language Of Cranes.We're told by other reviewers that the film is a more than adequate precis of Graeme's story so I'm very much looking forward to reading his book.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Flying Scotsman";
	schema:reviewBody "The Flying Scotsman is a formula sports biographical movie based on the book written by a champion cyclist Graeme Obree. As with sports biopics like Cinderella Man and The World's Fastest Indian Scotsman tells the story of the underdog's triumph against himself and his adversaries through innovation in technique technology and of course perseverance sprinkled with grit and determination. But of course like A Beautiful Mind there are inner demons that have to be worked out before assailing to the summit.Graeme Obree Jonny Lee Miller is a bike enthusiast who works as a courier and owns a bike shop. Life's pretty plain until he inspires to break an aged old World Hour record for longest distanced pedalled on a bicycle. But record breaking is an expensive ambition and he realizes that aerodynamics will play an important factor. What I liked about the movie is to witness his keen observation and experimentation at work to design the perfect sports bike and riding techniques which some of us would have observed on television in the 90s.Thus the movie begins charting the ups and downs of his career starting with his built from scratch and from spare washing machine parts bike affectionately called The Old Faithful. It's something that man and machine when united seamlessly is able to go the distance. But of course what I also liked is perhaps the stereotypical boardroom suits of the powers that be who are dead set in making life difficult for Obree introducing absurd rules regulations and terms in order to upset the spirit of innovation and maintain their absolute control over the sport.There are some moments which seem to mar the movie despite understanding that they have to be introduced to give our on screen character more than one dimension. Struggling with injustice from the past affected Obree's EQ but a good support structure in his wife Anne Laura Fraser manager Malky Billy Boyd and good adviser Douglas Brian Cox it makes a constant reminder that no man is an island and that with good people supporting and believing in you that's one of life's greatest gifts.The theme track is excellent in itself but unfortunately none can replace the contemporary classic theme composed by Vangelis from Chariots of Fire. Recommended movie despite its formula if you're in need for some perk up when you're feeling down and low about yourself.".

It's something that man and machine when united seamlessly is able to go the distance. But of course what I also liked is perhaps the stereotypical boardroom suits of the powers that be who are dead set in making life difficult for Obree introducing absurd rules regulations and terms in order to upset the spirit of innovation and maintain their absolute control over the sport.There are some moments which seem to mar the movie despite understanding that they have to be introduced to give our on screen character more than one dimension. Struggling with injustice from the past affected Obree's EQ but a good support structure in his wife Anne Laura Fraser manager Malky Billy Boyd and good adviser Douglas Brian Cox it makes a constant reminder that no man is an island and that with good people supporting and believing in you that's one of life's greatest gifts.The theme track is excellent in itself but unfortunately none can replace the contemporary classic theme composed by Vangelis from Chariots of Fire. Recommended movie despite its formula if you're in need for some perk up when you're feeling down and low about yourself.";

TFS is a tribute to Obree's superhuman determination and physicallimitsdefying accomplishments. Its an inspiring work of cinema and did well in showing the viewers what Obree had to go through on his arduous journey.For me this movie could have been so much more. There were some high points but some factors just pulled the movie down. The highlight of this movie were a few aspects of the direction by Douglas Mackinnon. The plot was honest  all about the protagonist Graeme Obree. Obree's personal characteristics  his ingredients for success were aptly on display  raw grit determination stubborn hardheaded persevering the hours  hours of practice the unending sweat. The small things were nicely shown  race to earn that extra 100 bucks orange  sugar sandwich to provide his body more sugar banana principle for measuring the distance between legs his exercise routine. Douglas Mackinnon was successful in showing these various aspects of Obree's life and bringing it all together for the viewer. A small mention here to the background music especially in the first half. Whenever that specific instrumental music was played it brought about a sense of hope and the thought that either Obree will come up with a new idea or something magical from Obree would follow. Pumped up the tempo !But the same direction  maybe sheer laziness at it left me asking for more. I would have liked it better if more time was spent on the primary two things which were different about Obree  cycle and his position. After all these two things were instrumental for Obree's success. I needed to understand that how can a bicycle made from washing machine parts compete with a bike made by a computer and costed half a million? Though I would not have understood the technicalities but if the laws of physics as applied on Obree's bike were explained in the movie in layman's language it would have added to the AWE factor. I still don't know why  how Obree arrived at his first cycling position and then to the superman position was it just the box in the fridge?Another low point in the movie and directionscreenplay was the lack of time spent on building up Obree's character. Obree's mental health status could have been delved into in a better  detailed manner. Would have given the viewer a better perspective as to why he tried to commit suicide. I could just guess that his championship loss coupled with his disturbed frame of mind owing to his childhood bullymemories led him to end his life. The contrast of the character puzzled me  on one hand this guy had superhuman grit and perseverance and on the other hand he was easily disturbed when his childhood bully now an adult insults him on the loss of championship.Jonny Lee Miller was a revelation in the movie. He aptly portrayed what Obree had to go through to achieve what he did. I am sure he could have handled a much more complex Obree's character. Summary  TFS was a good watch. It wasn't exactly an underdog story but Obree had to fight for all his achievements. All such stories have a feelgood factor attached to them and when all the cinematic aspects come together to create a good piece of cinema it leaves the viewer with a nice sense of the protagonist's achievement. TFS had some good parts but sadly it wasn't inspirational. I think the confusion was whether the team wanted to make a sports movie or good dramatic cinema. It came close to both. 7 out of 10 for me.".

So we don't see a Pearl Harbour Hollywood flick but a picture that shows how it really might have been  flying a plane during war. There are no clichs just a portrait of a hero that did not even want to be one. And the cruelty and absurdity of war itself as even the main protagonist has to learn. The ending is also well done and not cheesy or over the top. Apart from that the film did not really grab me I enjoyed watching but was seldomly thrilled or emotionally moved. Maybe some of the characters were simply a little too flat. Also the film jumps at times and leaves out some interesting battle scenes I had the impression they did it to keep the VFX work down..

	schema:headline " A Potentially Fine Film Ruined by Dismal Script Writing";
	schema:reviewBody "The real Von Richthofen story is one which needed no embellishment or silly and false added padding to have the makings of a great movie. Sadly the writers of this military melodrama had an agenda and used Von Richthofen's fame to try and sell it. A German written film it clearly demonstrates just how far the Germans as a people have truly changed in their attitudes towards the military and war. To use Von Richthofen one of their greatest national heroes as a vessel to literally preach antiwar sentiment was a crime against the man his ideals his way of life and the legacy he left to history.The film itself is visually pleasing and has some wonderful sets and scenes that are well choreographed acted and filmed. To be honest if one were to watch this film without any sound it would be much more enjoyable. It's really only the script that falls painfully and pathetically flat.The mockup aircraft and replicas used for the ground and airfield backgrounds are stunning and realistic even if some are inaccurately painted. For any aviation or military history buff they alone are well worth watching the movie for. Overall the most interesting and pertinent aspects of Von Richthofen's flying career are glossed over in barely noticed passing or ignored entirely. Unless you are acquainted with his history in detail some of those small nods to reality will be missed or misunderstood by the casual viewer. Major Lanoe Hawker screaming like a mad banshee in battle is an appalling treatment of that beloved and gentlemanly British officer. What were the writers and director thinking??? The CGI Computer Generated Imagery is solid though the planes fly too fast and make many maneuvers which are far from the flight physics reality of the time. As is often the case with CGI the artistsdesigners and CGI directors go way overboard in the number of objects depicted on the screen. Far too many planes and observation balloons are involved in the overly busy battle scenes. When will they learn that more is not better? The acting is for the most part by relative unknowns at least in the USA Joseph Finnes being the lone exception. Regardless most of the actors truly shine despite the dismal script they had to work from. Matthias Schweighofer who plays Baron Manfred Von Richthofen is literally perfect for the part and plays it very very well again despite the horrible script he was forced to impart. Regardless of that scripts bile and drivel he does an outstanding job delivering it. What he could have done with a real script of Von Richthofen's life would have been a film masterpiece. Sadly we'll never know. The other pilots of his Squadron Jasta also come through the awful script with flying colors pun intended. Voss Wolff and the others all give strong if undeveloped supporting performances. The character of nurse and Von Richtofen's movie love interest Kate Otersdorf is wildly over blown and is included only as another vessel for the writers to push their antiwar message. Very few Von Richtofen biographies give any women in his life more than a passing mention. Here she is simply a brutally abused and excessively used plot device. Once again the writers fail the real and much more interesting story by inventing one to suit their agenda.I was initially going to give this film 6 out of 10 stars. Then a later scene in which nurse Otersdorf lectures Von Richthofen in a field hospital on morals and class distinction assaulted my ears. Somebody please get an axe so this film can be edited properly... 10 Stars for appearancecinematography acting and the planes. Unfortunately minus 6 Stars for the pretentious idiots who thought they were film writers.In short if your going to do a significant film about a historical figure and time period use the social attitudes of the time. Use the facts and tell it as it was. Don't turn history inside out to prove some currently popular social attitude. That isn't history. It's a travesty and a tragic disservice to the truth and the memory of those who made that history.".

	onyx:emotionText "The real Von Richthofen story is one which needed no embellishment or silly and false added padding to have the makings of a great movie. Sadly the writers of this military melodrama had an agenda and used Von Richthofen's fame to try and sell it. A German written film it clearly demonstrates just how far the Germans as a people have truly changed in their attitudes towards the military and war. To use Von Richthofen one of their greatest national heroes as a vessel to literally preach antiwar sentiment was a crime against the man his ideals his way of life and the legacy he left to history.The film itself is visually pleasing and has some wonderful sets and scenes that are well choreographed acted and filmed. To be honest if one were to watch this film without any sound it would be much more enjoyable. It's really only the script that falls painfully and pathetically flat.The mockup aircraft and replicas used for the ground and airfield backgrounds are stunning and realistic even if some are inaccurately painted. For any aviation or military history buff they alone are well worth watching the movie for. Overall the most interesting and pertinent aspects of Von Richthofen's flying career are glossed over in barely noticed passing or ignored entirely. Unless you are acquainted with his history in detail some of those small nods to reality will be missed or misunderstood by the casual viewer. Major Lanoe Hawker screaming like a mad banshee in battle is an appalling treatment of that beloved and gentlemanly British officer. What were the writers and director thinking??? The CGI Computer Generated Imagery is solid though the planes fly too fast and make many maneuvers which are far from the flight physics reality of the time. As is often the case with CGI the artistsdesigners and CGI directors go way overboard in the number of objects depicted on the screen. Far too many planes and observation balloons are involved in the overly busy battle scenes. When will they learn that more is not better? The acting is for the most part by relative unknowns at least in the USA Joseph Finnes being the lone exception. Regardless most of the actors truly shine despite the dismal script they had to work from.

For 2 years I felt like a child on Christmass eve. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this movie. In spite of the negative reviews I imported the DVD to South Africa at great cost. I was going to see it come hell or high water. I picked it up from the post office rushed home popped it in the DVD player and I couldn't believe my eyes. I feel robbed. Utterly robbed! I feel like going to the film makers and forcing them to do it over. I WANT MY RED BARON MOVIE!All this movie is is a jump from one dramatic speech to another. And if you want to make a movie with just long dramatic dialog you need actors who can pull it off. The acting in this movie is as bad as it gets. And the award for worst actor in the movie goes to... drumroll Volker Bruch for playing Lothar Von Richthofen! Basically everyone was bad. Mathias Schweighofer Volker Bruch and Lena Headey tries too hard. They act as if they are acting. Even Joseph Fiennes who I have a great deal of respect for couldn't pull it off. Especially the Canadian accent. The only actor who didn't look like he was acting was Til Schweiger but a 46 year old playing a 20 year old? More on that later.Acting aside lets look at the real Manfred Von Richthofen vs the movie one. The real one didn't dream of becoming a pilot as it is told in the movie. He joined the air service because the cavalrywhere he started the war was fast becoming obsolete. He only wanted to do his part in the war effort. In the movie he loves flying in real life his aircraft was just a platform for his guns. He didn't do aerobatics and frowned upon pilotslike his brother who did. He always looked respectable and made other officers button up their tunics if they were undone. In the movie he walks around with unbuttoned tunics and stretched jerseys. He didn't go to whorehouses like in the movie he didn't shoot down Roy Brown twice there is no evidence of a relationship between Manfred  Kate Otersdorf that here is the basis of the movie. In the movie Lanoe hawker flies a Bristol fighter in real life he flew a DH2 in his last dogfighta machine obsolete by then. And the list goes on.CG effects. Nicely done but unrealistic. Af Albatrosses could fly like that they would be shooting down F22's over Afganistan. Those planes were built from wood and fabric and would disintegrate if they were flown like in the move. And it seems the movie makers didn't have the money to do complete dogfight scenes because a fight just starts then they jump to a speech again.The movie also jumps from scene to scene so much that no one who doesn't know the basic history of the Red Baron would understand what is going on.What market did they aim for when making this movie? Its not a family movie its too boring and complicated. Action movie? Not much action. Aviation movie? Not much flying. Biographical film? Too much fiction. Drama? Love story? Yes but why use the Red Baron to make a love story? Why not cowboys talking to horses or poor coal miners? What should they have done? They should have told his story. He was a soldier who wanted to do his part in the war. He was the highest scoring ace of WW1 who awarded himself cups for his victories until Germany ran out of silver.He wanted to be the best. His career was greatly influencedby Oswald Boelce who is mentioned twice in the movie only. He was there when Boelce died. They should have shown the BoelceVon Richtoven relationship. Werner Voss a 20 year old pilotnot 46 was his main rival for top aceand good friend who died in one of the most impressive dogfights of the war. They should have shown the dogfight. They should have shown the Baron's last flight. They basically took all that was interesting about this man and made sure that it was left out of the movie.All in all the writers would have a great career in Soap operas as well as the actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're an aviation fan you're going to love this movie. The aerial scenes of World War I era biplanes in action are truly astounding.The lead role of the Baron is played by Matthias Schweighfer whose boyish good looks and magnetic smile are fully exploited to make the Red Baron impossible to dislike. The character of the Baron is portrayed as a young man of high principals who struggles to reconcile his humanity in the completely inhumane circumstances of war. He is torn between his sense of duty to his country and it's megalomaniac leadership and his conscience. Now I don't know if any of that is actually true but it makes for a touching story nonetheless.Overwhelmingly I was aware that the makers of this movie wanted to transmit the message that Germans are not the stereotype so often portrayed in war movies as either emotionless autobots of death and destruction or blood thirsty hums. Is this done in an effort to raise public opinion of Germans it is a German production by the way or because audiences are growing intolerant of stereotyping and it's injurious evil nature. I can't say I'd like to believe the latter but you'll certainly find the Baron and his fellow pilots all endearing characters and you'll be saddened when most of them meet their maker in the course of the story.The writer  director Nikolai Mllerschn isn't very loyal to historical facts in many respects. I was particularly disturbed by the portrayal of the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm as a warmongering protagonist and Paul Von Hindenburg as a foolish smiling fat man. However in order for the character of the Baron to shine so brightly the Baron needed dark forces to nobly resist and therefore these men were transformed to serve that purpose. I strongly advise the viewer not to expect to get a history lesson from his movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that I won't go into detail about all the historical inaccuracies there are just too many of them.They're just one of the many big disappointments n the The Red Baron. Perhaps the biggest flaw is the script which doesn't really have a story to tell. What were they thinking when they based the whole script around the tired old soldier meets beautiful nurse with a heart of gold who opens his eyes to the carnage around himconvention? Von Richthofen was not an ignorant man. Historical records show that he did see the appalling conditions in the trenches firsthand so he wasn't oblivious to the fact that war is an ugly business. But He was also a man of his time and most of all a careersoldier and a Prussian aristocrat. Do the filmmakers really think that a man of his background would tell Ludendorff and Hindenburg the war was unwinnable and they should just stop it? Or that he would get cocky with the Kaiser? On a similar note Richthofen like most people of his time certainly did see the airwar as a chivalrous endeavor. However He also knew that his task was to destroy enemy planes. He was glad when he could bring an opponent down alive and shake his hand but he was certainly not a pacifist fighterpilot. In fact It was common practice at the time to aim for the pilot because due to the construction of WW1planes and due to the weapons they used that was the surest and quickest way to get a kill.All of this is quite easily explained The film was written in the 21st century with 21st century values and morales and the atrocities of NaziGermany in WW2 in mind. You can almost feel the need of the author to squeeze in the War is bad!message wherever possible. That's not at all how people in Europe thought in the days of WW1.My second big gripe is the choice of actionsequences. Being something of an aviationnut I could tell you from the top of my head which real life events in von Richthofen's life would have to be in a film about him.1. His relationship to Boelcke and Boelcke's death. This was the guy who practically invented the rules of aircombat Dicta Boelcke rules which largely still apply today. Plus Boelcke was von Richthofen's mentor and the guy who saw the young Baron's potential early on.2. von Richthofen's duel with Hawker. One of the classic dogfights of all time. It supposedly lasted for several minutes and featured two combatants who were evenly matched. How can you not have that duel in the picture?3. Werner Voss' death. Again One of the alltimegreats when it comes to aerial combat. Voss fought an entire elitesquadron of the RFC and damaged all of their planes before he was finally shot down.4. von Richthofen's head injury and the effect it had on his behavior. A lot of experts believe that the brain damage he suffered from that wound led to him ignoring one of his elementary rules in his final dogfight. He got fixated on his target followed him to the deck and over into British territory leading to his death by MGfire from the ground.5. The Baron's death itself.All of those were only hinted at in the film  that's like making a film like Gladiator without once showing actual gladiatorial combat.The film is not without some strong points however The CGIdogfights do look convincing and the setdesign and costumes are pretty much spoton. Watch it for those points alone but don't expect an historically accurate depiction of von Richthofen's life. He along with all the other characters is not fleshed out one bit so in the end we don't really care who lives and dies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite an ending that can't help but make the viewer feel a little cheated this film is a success on many levels. Only a little historical inaccuracy which while certainly not a problem for most films but is almost demanded in a biopic is a noticeable flaw.Also while perhaps not as gritty as one would like to see in a modern film the ambiance of the film feels very right. The viewer is seldom distracted by the realization that one is seeing CGI. The set decoration and costuming are rich and look accurate. The photography is excellent although there is some mixing of exposure which is sometimes distracting. There is quite a bit of floating camerawork in establishing shots which adds a little playful interest almost as if one is watching from a small biplane buzzing through the scene.The performances are understated although the dialog does feel a little sparse at times.Viewers who are hoping to experience another version of the exuberant athleticism of Flyboys from the German perspective may be underwhelmed by this film but I found it most satisfying especially in its restraint in delivering its antiwar message.".

Only a little historical inaccuracy which while certainly not a problem for most films but is almost demanded in a biopic is a noticeable flaw.Also while perhaps not as gritty as one would like to see in a modern film the ambiance of the film feels very right.

Having read a great deal of information about von Richthofen I was excited to see a 'biographical' pic was in the making having seen it I'd have preferred if it hadn't been made at all.While I don't pretend to be an expert on film making techniques I reckon I could have put together a more coherent story. Early on it jumps all over the place with little explanation of what is happening and significant moments in the 'real' story of the Red Baron are given a 30 second scene. As with other reviews I think there was scope for much more aerial combat to be included given this is what the story of Red Baron is actually about!! But more than that historically the film is just awful. About the only things they got right was that his name was Manfred and his plane was painted red pretty much everything else particularly in terms of what is known of his personality is so far off the mark it's not a joke. The love story is a load of old tripe based on a single photograph and historical speculation the depictions of most of the other characters in particular his Brother are WAY off and many things such as the frequent contact between Brown and Richthofen are just made up and completely unrealistic.I don't know what the intent of the film makers was but the result was a wildly inaccurate film that if anything provides a misleading 'biography' of a significant figure in history. The real story of the Red Baron would have provided a far more interesting film while this load of old plonk is almost disrespectful to the man.Rent something else instead.".

I really disappointed and with great sadness I see another opportunity go by to finally produce a quality movie about a German hero reaching a big audience.Historical correctness is a virtue of German movies so sets costumes planes and such were as I imagined them. But how can you tell a story about Manfred von Richthofen and his fellow pilot without putting Hermann Goering into the picture? Duh.The story is told too quickly it jumps from scene to scene sometimes you don't even realize it does. You lose track quickly and you are basically looking at loosely appended scenes.I wanted to see amazing plane dog fighting. This is one thing you can expect from a Red Baron movie made in 2008. CGI has no limits in that regards. Well this Red Baron movie is more one bla bla scene after the other filled with a few CGI plane fights. Most depressed yes totally crashed I was when Richthofens last flight was up  it was not shown at all!!! Nothing nada! And this last flight and the shooting down of the Baron is the most controversial discussed event in his legend. And it was not Mr. Brown from Canada who shot him down as was lately convincingly explained. But hey why bother to put a single bit of film into this. He landed his plane clean and without a scratch even though deadly wounded. No we're not showing any of that. He was buried with highest military honors by the French army  the enemy who had the highest respect for him. No we're not showing any of that. Duh.And what the heck are Lena Headey and Joseph Fiennes doing there. Joseph was probably hired for a few minutes of appearance just to borrow a know name to the movie. Shame on you. Lena to me extremely attractive so don't misunderwstand me is totally misplaced as the nurse Richthofen was dating. Heck Richthofen was 20 years old and with Matthias Schweighoefer playing the role of the Baron she was more looking like his mother. Great beauty does not automatically fit in every movie.What I expected was the storytelling and effects mix of the movie Flyboys mixed with the true story of Manfred von Richthofen specifically including the important persons and events. This movie here fails badly. Let the German historians go to Hollywood and try aagin please...".

And ..those pacifist message the Baron constantly delivered!!give me a break!! The Baron was a professional soldier  not warconscript and he himself said everything else was nonsense other than shooting down an enemy in dogfight..He was certainly not as bloodthirsty and aggressive as Berthold  but certainly not the one depicted in the movieeither.

Such a small point might not be considered important but if you want realism it immediately destroys any trust in the script writer and director. Roy Brown is given an important part. Roy Brown happened to be part of the dogfight in which Von Richthoven died. Technically it was impossible for Brown to have shot Von Richthoven down when modern analysis is made. There is little doubt he was shot down by machine gun fire with one bullet in his right side. But the truth is that most of this script is absolute rubbish. Von Richtoven had been to a Prussian Officer's School and would never have looked like the lout portrayed here. He comes across as an immature boy. He was not that nor was his brother. The tonality is of a director who wants to make a aerial combat picture and make money not caring about his subject. He doesn't. The graphics are awful on a par with all else. I'm surprised this film has not been condemned by many in Germany. It is an insult to the spirit of the German military machine in the first world war.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of this production and saw the stills I was very excited. Using CGIthey were able to use mock ups of the actual types of aircraft used at the time and the actors used were roughly the same age as the actual pilots  19 through 25ish. MvR was two weeks shy of his 26th when he died. Up until now WWI aviation films used far too modern of aircraft and too ancient of actor to play the parts.The film 'Memphis Belle' also had similar promise but both films die in their scripts and directorial indiscretions.My background is that I belong to a group known as the League of WWI Aviation Historians.Here are just some of the problems1. The love affair depicted never happened. The nurse was a caretaker type and only two only appeared in a posed newspaper photo on the hospital grounds 2. MvR never met Roy Brown. Never had a tea after a dog fight and talked about big issues. Roy Brown did not shoot MvR down it was an Australian infantry gunner. In reality both should not have been in combat MvR with his head would and Brown with his ulcer would have been grounded in WWII. 3. Joseph Feinnes as Brown flying with dark granny glasses? While maybe a comic book fashion statement would not have stayed on and would not have protected the eyes. 4. Just like 'Flyboys' the CGI on the aircraft was terrible all zoom zoom and acrobatics that were well beyond the performance envelope of the time. While by 1917 these aircraft were typically fighting at 1 to 2 miles in altitude and at the best low altitude speed for the German Albatros was 105 mph. Nonsupercharged propeller driven aircraft lose performance at altitude as the air gets thinner. 5. The big dog fights were not common the ideal way to take out your opponent was to sneak up and shoot him before he saw you. As the British ace Alfred Ball once lamented We are just assassins. I do not recall any of M v Richthofen's combats as large combats with dozens of aircraft in the melee. Most of his kills were singularly taking out the photographic reconnaissance aircraft which provided information to the opposing army. 6. The attitudes and speeches of the characters reflect modern PC attitudes. They do not reflect those of a Prussian youth born in the 1890's. 7. The markings on most of the aircraft were not at all correct. The German aircraft in the film were festooned with bright personal markings many were actually French WWI squadron markings! The real aircraft in the German First Fighter Group Squadrons 4 6 10  11 had simple markings and perhaps colored tails to denote the pilot's identity along with the squadron markings 4 a black ribbon 6 black and white tail stripes 10 Yellow nose 11 red nose. The reason for the markings was that there were no plane to plane voice radios and the flight commander had to be able to identify who was flying what airplane. The German national emblems on the aircraft were also done wrong the 'iron crosses' should have been straight on the ends not stylistically bowed in.They get an F for historical Accuracy a B for Properties paint schemes deprived them of an A and scenery a D for the script and a C for the acting.".

This is a story of Manfred Von Richthofen The famous Red Baron a flying ace during WW1 that gives a true perspective of the nobility approach to air war during that time so unlike the wars that followed...although sometimes loosely factually based it held true to The Knights of the sky theme This idealism of course was dramatically contrasted by great dynamic dialogue involving romance between the pilot and a well opposed reality grounded nurse. This was not a propaganda or pro war film at all nor a documentary but a really good interpretation of the times that were. On a technical note there were only a few scenes through the eagerness to create on computer actual air battle action that seemed at times a little too cluttered where the flying formations were a little too close and too fast moving for the time and the air craft In an effort they tried to fit it all in the screen but in this case less and slower would have been better. Still these scenes could've been left out and this would have still been a great movie. Overall this was well worth my viewing time.".

NOT EVEN IF YOU'RE AN AIR COMBAT FAN.The airtoair combat is glossed over and simply is there to give the von Richthofen character an opening for some emoangst.After watching this film you'd think that von Richthofen met Roy Brown twice before Brown shot down von Richthofen. Didn't happen. Just more chances to tug on heart strings.This could have been a good film. If there was too much for a 2hour film you could have done it like Patton only showing the part of Patton's life from Battle of the Kasserine Pass 1942 through the war's end 1945.The WRONG thing to do was to put the names of von Richthofen's associates on slips of paper in a box and pull them out one at a time and then write 15seconds in the script for the ones that tumbled out. But whatever you do don't put Hermann Gring's name in the hat. You would be able to provide total revisionist history if it were shown that Gring was part of the flying circus.Then add a love affair and a fictional Jewish character with everybody caring about everything and WHOOPS there's a movie! Then at the end of the movie when the characters are all being wrapped up you can't read 50 of the onscreen print. I was cheated.So this was a total WASTE OF CELLULOID.

Towards the end they use a story telling technique not employed much in the last few decades. Rather than attempting to depict the final climactic battle where Richthofen dies they simply fade to black for a few seconds and pick up several weeks later. I find that films that use your imagination rather than the director's are much more effective. I would have to agree here.

I want the soundtrack too as some of the songs were amazing. Also the female singer in the 2nd club scene was amazing if she isn't a real singer she should be. She has an amazing voice. My favourite part of the film.. well i don't know its all really funny stuff. I watched it with my boyfriend he agreed on the soundtrack and the humour. I would recommend this film to all ages.

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Tablitz's 'Breakin' All the Rules' has some genuinely funny moments. It's not a classic but most of it is quite enjoyable. It sticks to the main point. I liked the idea that the main character is a man who's writing a selfhelp book about broken relationships. Usually such characters are played by women so this felt fresh and cool. The problem is that some of the jokes lose their touch as they are too stretched out but the confusion and mistaken identity bits were quite funny. The film highly depends on its cast. Jamie Foxx is a natural performer where comedy is concerned thus here is no exception. The cute Gabrielle Union is decent but she doesn't convince in the sequences where Nicky's angry. Moreover the chemistry between her and Foxx seems more as though they are friends rather than two people who are strongly attracted to each other. Jennifer Esposito springs a surprise as a semidominatrix seductress. Morris Chestnut does not impress and Peter MacNicol is alright. Bianca Lawson provides a few chuckles as the bitchy girlfriend. Overall this isn't among the funniest movies but it may be worth giving a chance on a relaxed evening. For me the most hilarious sequences were Helen's irritation with Quincy's dog and what Quincy does to 'solve' the problem the party sequence where all 6 of the lead cast come together for a showdown Nicky and Mr. Lynch...and there are a few more.".

	schema:headline " Foxx is on his way!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I never really had much to say in the way of Jamie Foxx prior to his recent break out in roles ie. Collateral and although I haven't seen it yet I have no doubt his performance in Ray will further my opinions of him. He's a great character actor and possibly on his way to being the caliber of such great African American performers as Denzel Washington and Will Smith. His role in Collateral was scene stealing and up against Tom Cruise's Oscar worth performance it was a challenge but he impressed me. Then comes this fun little romantic comedy. A very different change of pace for Foxx but he pulls it off flawlessly in a amusing and fun to watch film. Breakin All The Rules is about an editor turned author who is dumped by his model girlfriend Bianca Lawson and during his fit of depression ends up writing a guide to breaking up with people...the right way. His cousin and best friend played perfectly by Morris Chestnut is a womanizer who doesn't believe in these rules until he sees them in action. The book makes Quincy famous but unlucky in love until he meets the perfect woman in a case of mistaken identity and falls for her. It just so happens she is the latest girlfriend of his cousin who is also in love with her.The comedy in this film relies heavily on the old formula of mistaken identities and mix ups in happenings reminds me of the old Three's Company episodes. The film also relies heavily on the personalities of the characters. The womanizer the nice misunderstood main character guy the stuck up model ex girlfriend the perfect woman and the other supporting characters make the film brilliant. The film is full of former TV sitcom actors which perhaps makes sense being it does play out like an episode of a sitcom but really what is wrong with that? Peter MacNichol of Ally McBeal fame plays his usual character but always fun to watch. He's the perfect blend of superiority while being completely inferior. Leading lady played by Gabrielle Union goes with both Foxx and Chestnut's character and she does a great job. Previously seen as her role on Friends I was never fond of her although I liked her character in 10 Things I Hate About You and she's had some other great roles. She was perfect for her role in this film. Jennifer Esposito makes a fun little addition to the cast as the slightly psycho girlfriendfiance of MacNichol's character. The cast just works so well together and the film is written in such a way that you can't help but enjoy it's simplicity. I enjoy what everyone on the message board calls Black Cinema but this is one of the best because it's still very mainstream without losing the culture. Overall this is a fun film to check out a Saturday night it's not too heavy but is satisfying and clich'd which sometimes is a good thing.710".

	onyx:emotionText "I never really had much to say in the way of Jamie Foxx prior to his recent break out in roles ie. Collateral and although I haven't seen it yet I have no doubt his performance in Ray will further my opinions of him. He's a great character actor and possibly on his way to being the caliber of such great African American performers as Denzel Washington and Will Smith. His role in Collateral was scene stealing and up against Tom Cruise's Oscar worth performance it was a challenge but he impressed me. Then comes this fun little romantic comedy. A very different change of pace for Foxx but he pulls it off flawlessly in a amusing and fun to watch film. Breakin All The Rules is about an editor turned author who is dumped by his model girlfriend Bianca Lawson and during his fit of depression ends up writing a guide to breaking up with people...the right way. His cousin and best friend played perfectly by Morris Chestnut is a womanizer who doesn't believe in these rules until he sees them in action. The book makes Quincy famous but unlucky in love until he meets the perfect woman in a case of mistaken identity and falls for her. It just so happens she is the latest girlfriend of his cousin who is also in love with her.The comedy in this film relies heavily on the old formula of mistaken identities and mix ups in happenings reminds me of the old Three's Company episodes. The film also relies heavily on the personalities of the characters. The womanizer the nice misunderstood main character guy the stuck up model ex girlfriend the perfect woman and the other supporting characters make the film brilliant. The film is full of former TV sitcom actors which perhaps makes sense being it does play out like an episode of a sitcom but really what is wrong with that? Peter MacNichol of Ally McBeal fame plays his usual character but always fun to watch. He's the perfect blend of superiority while being completely inferior. Leading lady played by Gabrielle Union goes with both Foxx and Chestnut's character and she does a great job. Previously seen as her role on Friends I was never fond of her although I liked her character in 10 Things I Hate About You and she's had some other great roles. She was perfect for her role in this film. Jennifer Esposito makes a fun little addition to the cast as the slightly psycho girlfriendfiance of MacNichol's character. The cast just works so well together and the film is written in such a way that you can't help but enjoy it's simplicity. I enjoy what everyone on the message board calls Black Cinema but this is one of the best because it's still very mainstream without losing the culture.

	schema:reviewBody "Jamie Foxx stars as a guy just dumped by his fianc who ends up writing a best selling book about how to dump significant others. Along the way there are mistaken identities gender and racial stereotypes and a decided lack of comedy and wit. Gabrielle Union serves as the eye candy object of Foxx's affections by mistake when he's sent to dump her by his player cousin Morris Chestnut who specializes in booty calls that expire after three months. Due to a very subtle change in her appearance Foxx doesn't recognize her as the person he's supposed to give the message to and a romance between him and Union ensues.Parallel to this story there is a subplot involving advicegiving to Peter MacNicol who is trying to rid himself of golddigging Jennifer Esposito. Kudos to the director for trying to make a comedy with black lead actors that are not all urban stereotypes. However there are other tired routines that are apparent in the film. The black male player the dirty old white man the dog joke that runs throughout the film etc. The laughs are few and far between and rely more on the aforementioned devices and ones similar to them instead of actual sophisticated writing and character development. The film is rather formulaic and without further plot developments beyond my opening comments of this review becomes static to the viewer. This is another disappointing unsophisticated comedy with too few laughs on any level.  of 4 stars.".

Along the way there are mistaken identities gender and racial stereotypes and a decided lack of comedy and wit. Gabrielle Union serves as the eye candy object of Foxx's affections by mistake when he's sent to dump her by his player cousin Morris Chestnut who specializes in booty calls that expire after three months. Due to a very subtle change in her appearance Foxx doesn't recognize her as the person he's supposed to give the message to and a romance between him and Union ensues.Parallel to this story there is a subplot involving advicegiving to Peter MacNicol who is trying to rid himself of golddigging Jennifer Esposito. Kudos to the director for trying to make a comedy with black lead actors that are not all urban stereotypes. However there are other tired routines that are apparent in the film. The black male player the dirty old white man the dog joke that runs throughout the film etc. The laughs are few and far between and rely more on the aforementioned devices and ones similar to them instead of actual sophisticated writing and character development. The film is rather formulaic and without further plot developments beyond my opening comments of this review becomes static to the viewer. This is another disappointing unsophisticated comedy with too few laughs on any level.  of 4 stars.";

GABRIELLE UNION is dating Morris Chestnut's character and through a whole bunch of drama Jamie Foxx meets up with her not knowing she is the same girl his cousin was dating.Overall a decently entertaining movie.

The romantic side of the story seems to take over the original premise of this film  Foxx becoming a millionaire off his book The Breakup Handbook is more the spark for the idea behind the movie. Foxx gives advice to his friends on how to break up or why their girlfriends will break up with them and throughout the film a huge disaster is just waiting to happen.

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest I really enjoyed this movie. Breakin All the Rules is one of those captivating romantic comedies which no one knows who anybody else is and where the protagonist gets his comeuppance in the end. And that's not a terrible thing unless the plot is good which it is. This movie has to offer us a compelling story and brilliant dialogue. Granted this is a far cry from Jamie Foxx's best movie of 2004 you can't compete this movie to Ray or Collateral but it is still a movie to enjoy. Jamie Foxx is one of the top performers in the entertainment industry. He is effective in both comedy and drama and he could tackle any role that is thrown at him. He is that versatile. Foxx stars as Los Angeles Magazine Executive Quincy Watson. He is also joined by his cousin Evan Morris Chestnut. Watson's boss Phillip Peter MacNicol promotes him to a job where he's assigned to fire people. If that's not bad enough on the day he proposes to his girlfriend she unceremoniously dumps him. This upsets him to the point where he resigns from his job claiming that there's a thin line between those two connections. He puts his writing experience to good use as he goes on to write a handbook giving advice on how to breakup with your loved ones. The book becomes a bestseller and his former boss Phillip seeks advice on how to breakup with his current girlfriend Rita Jennifer Esposito who's nothing more than a golddigging harlot to put it in better words. Then Evan gets the notion that his girlfriend Nicky Gabrielle Union is fading out on him and informs Quincy to meet him at a secretive place to tell everything about her. Quincy never met Nicky before and when last she saw Nicky he had a new do making her look like Halle Berry. Quincy converses with her like she was a different person and the two commence into a relationship. Rita frustrated that Quincy's trying to break up with Phillip breaks into his house only to find Evan there and she sleeps with him but she thinks she's with Quincy as a ploy to stop trying to breakup her relationship with Phillip. And so mistaken identity manifests itself.I'm sure it was concocted numerous times before but Breakin All the Rules pulls this off flawlessly. At the beginning of his book Quincy reads excerpts from his book and the advice he gives to his loyal readers. It's a real treat and an eyeopener and the witty dialogue is handled with absolute care. Sure it didn't fare at the box office and faded to obscurity after a while but the DVD was a rocket buster. This movie was one of the better formula comedies that exceeds that dreadful New York Minute this is a break from highprofile action movies that came out at the time like Troy The Day After Tomorrow and Van Helsing.".

I hadn't heard much about it so I watched it and was quite surprised at how enjoyable it was. Since then I have seen the movie about ten more times at least and still get a kick out of it.Tremors is basically a landlocked variation on 'Jaws' and those 1950s giant bug movies the isolated town of Perfection Nevada population 16 finds itself under seige by four monstrous subterranean wormlike creatures that hunt by sensing vibrations in the ground. The plot revolves around the townspeople trying to outwit and escape the creatures dubbed 'Graboids' which are tearing the town out from under them.What really makes the movie work is the characters all of them come across as real people trapped in an insane situation and all have a lot of charisma even though the film doesn't have tons of character development. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a hoot as a pair of lowrent handymen who become reluctant heroes. The byplay between the two is a lot of fun.Usually movies like this revolve around stupid people doing stupid things just to raise the body count. Tremors is different the characters react believably and do smart things to try and escape andor kill the Graboids. The creatures too are also fairly smart and are not just mindless eating machines with no brains.Given its premise Tremors is not a gory or violent film although it has a couple of minor gross bits and has a very good sense of humor. The filmmakers are aware of their farfetched premise a couple of key questions go unanswered but they treat it with respect and a certain amount of affection.Tremors didn't have much life in theaters but has become something of a 'Midnight Movie' on home video with definite cult possibilities. Check it out and don't be surprised if you end up buying it.".

The plot revolves around the townspeople trying to outwit and escape the creatures dubbed 'Graboids' which are tearing the town out from under them.What really makes the movie work is the characters all of them come across as real people trapped in an insane situation and all have a lot of charisma even though the film doesn't have tons of character development. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a hoot as a pair of lowrent handymen who become reluctant heroes. The byplay between the two is a lot of fun.Usually movies like this revolve around stupid people doing stupid things just to raise the body count. Tremors is different the characters react believably and do smart things to try and escape andor kill the Graboids. The creatures too are also fairly smart and are not just mindless eating machines with no brains.Given its premise Tremors is not a gory or violent film although it has a couple of minor gross bits and has a very good sense of humor. The filmmakers are aware of their farfetched premise a couple of key questions go unanswered but they treat it with respect and a certain amount of affection.Tremors didn't have much life in theaters but has become something of a 'Midnight Movie' on home video with definite cult possibilities. Check it out and don't be surprised if you end up buying it.";

It doesn't exactly inspire confidence does it? But if you put your prejudices aside you'll find that this is a surprisingly enjoyable good old fashioned monster movie. There is humour here sure but thankfully the movie doesn't go for a camp tongue in cheek parody style something for me that almost never works. The movies real strength is the perfect casting of Kevin Bacon 'Diner' and Fred Ward 'Henry And June' as the small town handymen turned reluctant heroes. They are supported by the left field but inspired casting of 'Family Ties' Michael Gross and country singer Reba McEntire as a couple of gung ho survivalists. 'Tremors' succeeds in what it sets out to be an exciting and wonderfully entertaining bgrade horror thriller. A lot of fun and highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Genre fans and casual moviegoers will find lots of things to love in Tremors possibly the best horrorcomedy ever made.";
	schema:reviewBody " 12 out of  Tremors is often described by many to be a cult classic which is odd.  The fact is cult films usually have a quirky quality to them that separate them from the usual Hollywoodchurned machine.  Take ReAnimator for example or even the recent Ravenous both of which have oddities and bloody quirks that average viewers might find repellant.  But Tremors isn't the slightest bit offbeat.  It's made in full Hollywoodstyle with a predictably happy ending to boot.  So what makes it a cult classic?  Could it be that it's successful in mixing almost every genre into the proceedings or that it's great entertainment that simply didn't get the box office reception it deserved?  Perhaps both because this is one movie that always puts a smile on my face and simultaneously gets my pulsepounding every time I watch it. The plot is similar to that of the monster films of the old days. Valentine Mckee Kevin Bacon and Earl Bassett Fred Ward are two handymen trapped in the small town of Perfection Nevada.  They have dreams of making it big but their ambitious goals always seem out of reach.  Just when they do decide to finally leave the discovery of dead bodies both human and animal keep them there for just a while longer.  There's also the road which has been blocked by a large boulder. On hand to study some strange seismic activity is Rhonda Finn Carter a grad student who helps Mckee and Bassett come to the realization that both the deaths and the odd vibrations in the ground are connected.  It turns out to be the work of giant 30foot worms four of them to be exact and they trap the townspeople of Perfection in their homes including gunhappy WWIIIprepared couple Burt and Heather Gummer Michael Gross and Reba Mcentire.  The rest of the film becomes a desperate scramble to outsmart the worms and get out of the town alive.The first thing that's noticable about Tremors is probably how it's obviously inspired by 50's monster flicks.  The great thing though is that Tremors plays itself as a comedy preferring laughs over scares a wise decision since if the film took itself seriously it would have been a major detriment.  The laughs aren't cheap either as they result from witty dialogue and new twists on the monster subgenre.  The great chemistry between Bacon and Ward brings the most humor to the film.  Playing best friends with little education but plenty of smarts these are two performances that are a hoot to watch.  It'd be great to see them in another film together again too bad it didn't happen in Tremors 2. But in addition to the laughs there's also the action which is frenetic and exciting.  Director Ron Underwood gives the film a lightning pace and the 95 minutes seems to just roll by.  The fun action consists of a lot of running and get off the ground moments.   For the last 45 minutes Tremors is almost full of nonstop excitement and it's surprising to see that the action never gets tiresome nor dull for a single moment.  The movie isn't scary or frightening at all but with suspense and thrills this sharp who cares Besides being scary is hardly the film's intent.?It's nice to see that this movie is not particularly gory or full of gratuitous violence.  While I do enjoy gory violence when it fits the style and tone it wouldn't have been welcome here and the lighthearted feel that permeates Tremors is a crucial reason to its success there's no unneccessary unpleasantness and it also proves that the movie creates genuine excitement without resorting to splashing blood all over the screen. Because of this it easily reaches out to a larger amount of viewers making it a movie that's just as easily accessible for fans of say screwball comeides as it is for action lovers. Since the movie is PG13 there are still a couple of moments of semigraphic violence but nothing objectionable to someone 10 years or older.The special effects are fun with the worms as the film's showpiece. Thankfully there's no overdone CGI and the worms are actually wellrendered and convincing.  But I must say I was a little misled seeing how it is the worms don't actually look like the one on the video box cover which actually looks cooler.  But never mind that I'm wondering how the director managed to pull off so many scenes of the creatures popping out from underground.  I mean given the fact that this is a goofy monster movie it couldn't have been given a very big budget.  I also love those worm POV shots particularly the ones that actually feature the camera wading through the dirt. S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock's script is clever without being particulary intelligent or distinguished.  This isn't a brilliant film by a long shot but it goes to show that some writers who just want to write a fun script can actually get the job done.  It's a little odd to note that all of Wilson and Maddock's other screenplays with maybe the exception of Tremors' own sequels have been pretty bad culminating to the debacle known as Wild Wild West.  Unlike that film and the others they've written this one isn't soulless. But it's not the action and the laughs that put this film above so many countless movies of the genre.  It is after all the characters that make this film as highly entertaining as it is.  As said before Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward's chemistry is natural and they deliver some of their best acting in their careers.  It's actually a shame that Ward never reached the same heights of stardom as Bacon he sure as hell had the charisma and acting skill for it.  Also very good is Finn Carter as Rhonda and it's also a little unfortunate her career hasn't gone far since this.  She and Bacon also have some nice chemistry which further establishes this movie as one that also works partially as a romance a good feat considering it's not even striving to be one.  The other standouts are Michael Gross and Reba Mcentire as the guntoting couple.  Their performances are a lot of fun and there's a hilarious scene involving the two of them trying to kill one of the giant worms in their basement. Tremors wasn't much of a box office success but has since gone on to have a strong life on video to the point where it even inspired other knowingly goofy creature features such as Anaconda Lake Placid Deep Blue Sea and Deep Rising of these three only Rising comes to mind as a must see.  None of them managed to reach the heights of Tremors perhaps because their characters weren't as likable and memorable thus leaving this film as the one all future monster films will be compared to.  The film's also got its own sequels the first of which I remember as being pretty fun but certainly inferior.  Tremors 3 I have yet to see but it's one I'm looking forward to.".

They seemed to have chased an old man up a power line where he died of thirst then they take out a farmer and his livestock and then they take out these two working on the side of the road.

We have unique and rather intimidating monstersas well as a very unique cast of characters to battle them.While Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward may be listed as the leadsI think that Michael Gross practically steals the entire show.While it isn't flawlessit certainly is entertaining enough.I would recommend it to any fan of 1950's B horror films.It is well worth the rental and would be a good addition to anyone's library.".

	schema:reviewBody "VIBRATING SPOILERSThis is a great movie and a fun ride. They went back to the basics and came out with one of my alltime favorite flicks.There are two ways to make a good monster movie slowpaced and suspenseful or fastpaced and surprising. Tremors definitely opts for the latter method. The producers also managed to assemble an excellent cast all of whom establish their invidual characters with admirable clarity. Only Mindy the young girl comes off as kind of a cipher. Plus with the exception of Kevin Bacon and Michael Gross they all look like REAL people.The spotlight gets shared out pretty equally among the cast as well. One particularly nice touch was the fact that our two main heroes weren't the only people in town who have any competency at all. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon DO carry the movie but it's more because of the great screen chemistry between them. Miguel has the better ideas and Burt contributes more to the actual destruction of the monsters.While Tremors never really 'cheats' the audience i.e. sets up a situation and then doesn't deliver the movie does vary teasingly from the expected. One of the aspects I enjoy most about showing this film to firsttime viewers  aside from the the pride I take in indoctrinating new members to the Cult of the Graboid  is how the movie fools them about things like who gets eaten and who doesn't and how the worms actually operated.My one bullsht call is the Cat loader. Any operator with any kind of experience could have used the loader bucket to lever the tractor up and out of the pit it fell into and that impact wouldn't have knocked out the engine. Whether they could have pulled themselves out before the Graboids yanked them off the tractor is less certain Every time I see the scene of Burt Gummer falling from the loader to the ground I cringe and think there's a stuntman with two broken ankles.I also could have used more Victor Wong and less Reba McEntire. She's just hard to listen to as an actress. As little as she contributes after Burt and Heather shoot up the Graboid in their basement they could have fed HER to the monsters and let Walter Chang survive.Ah well. YOU try telling a Graboid who it can't eat.Oh and I love Val  Earl's truck. I think it's a late60s Jeep J10 Warrior. Absolutely indestructible.".

The plot revolves around the townspeople trying to outwit and escape the creatures dubbed 'Graboids' which are tearing the town out from under them.What really makes the movie work is the characters all of them come across as real people trapped in an insane situation and all have a lot of charisma even though the film doesn't have tons of character development. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a hoot as a pair of lowrent handymen who become reluctant heroes. The byplay between the two is a lot of fun.Usually movies like this revolve around stupid people doing stupid things just to raise the body count. Tremors is different the characters react believably and do smart things to try and escape andor kill the Graboids. The creatures too are also fairly smart and are not just mindless eating machines with no brains.Given its premise Tremors is not a gory or violent film although it has a couple of minor gross bits and has a very good sense of humor. The filmmakers are aware of their farfetched premise a couple of key questions go unanswered but they treat it with respect and a certain amount of affection.".

Much of the delight in watching Tremors derives from the rib poking guy fun that Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward have when working their scenes. And the fun starts early. In the second scene of the film our erstwhile outofpocket handymen Val Bacon and Earl Ward are constructing a barbed wire cattle fence. Kevin Bacon an obvious non handyman takes 10 strokes to hammer a nail into the fencepost. This apparently amuses Fred Ward a true life handyman who watches Kevin nearly botch the job. As Kevin walks away Fred does an impromptu eyeball inspection of the fencepost and then turns to give Kevin an I can't believe it look that surely made for some afterscene razzing over beers. If you're a late comer to Tremors break out a couple of cold ones and watch it for more of the acting which isn't acting that makes this film so damned good and so much more than monster eats man.

	schema:headline " A Great Movie! Truly one of a kind...";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a winner one of the best of the '90s for its type.  It managed well to mix the best of being a throwback to '50s horror Bmovies with some new concepts.The concept of the big unknown horror come to menace us decent folk is an old theme that gets a retread here.  A lot of the best stuff from the '50s treatment of this kind of story remains but it's all seen through a modern and earnest perspective.  And at the same time it still mixes witty humor without insulting the audience or its characters.The realistic approach to this movie is the winner.  Basically this movie asks What if giant worms really did come to menace some dustbowl podunk in the middle of Nevada?  The scientistbabe is the only slightly sketchy touch but it still works.  We don't get too much scientific mumbojumbo to detract from the flow we don't get people acting either like superheroes or terrified victims we don't get told too much or too little.  The characters act as what we can expect very well could be people facing a bizarre and alien threat as best they can.That is the '50s style of this movie people thrust into an encounter with the bizarre who use their native human intellect and resourcefulness to win. And unlike many '50s films such as The Thing from Another World we don't have trained professional soldiers or knowitall scientists to save the day but the actual varied and honest inhabitants of a nowhere desert town with all their commonness vulgarity and faults being pushed to tap their inner resources and combine their strengths.  That's the message of this film that human beings everywhere whatever their usual station in life possess a nascent native and evolved instinct towards surviving by their wits and joining together against a threat exactly as we did when we had to compete with bigger stronger and more naturally dangerous predators for food.  In this respect it ranks with Deliverance or The Edge in retelling this theme of humanity thrust back into the jungle.The mix of characters and their interplay is done in a honest believable and humorous way.  We don't have any gross stereotypes or exaggerations here.  Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon's characters have a lot of fun as a pair of working buddies who josh and joke around but who prove a winning team still retaining their ways in the fold.  Fred Ward comes to bloom as a natural planner and leader while Kevin Bacon demonstrates quickthinking and bravery. The other characters the pretty seismologist stuck away from the college the survivalists played by Michael Gross and Reba McIntyre the prankloving teenager and the rest all fit into the same.  They don't change their ways and don't really need to in their fight but instead contribute their own strengths.  While this movie comes across as horror in one respect and comedy in the other it contains a remarkable amount of frankness.The monsters too in this film are realistically for fantastical monsters treated.  They are big bad dangerous previously unknown and can suck you right down into the ground before you know it.  But they aren't magical they aren't unstoppable and they are far from infallible.  Although they do have some intelligence they can be outsmarted and beaten by the dangerous prey they've come to get.  This is realistic treated them as very dangerous and strange but not invincible animals.I appreciated the treatment of these sorts of people the kind of people Hollywood in other respects might look down on.  The survivalist couple with a hundred bigbore guns are the real test here.  In other films especially nowadays these sorts of people would be portrayed as dangerous wackos or gunnuts talking about blowing things up or black helicopters or whatever.  While they don't try to gussy up or smooth over the characters any you can still see them as a little paranoid and obsessive they serve an important addition to the cast and definitely come across as the sort of people you would want to have around in an emergency.  This is a realistic and unbiased treatment.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was an NRA member or two on the writing staff.One of my favorite scenes in this movie you may want to skip over this paragraph if you haven't seen it one that I regard as iconoclastic is the scene where the survivalist couple fight off one of the worms coming in to their survival basement.  Backed to the wall they draw on the dozens of guns they have around eventually grabbing for a big old doublebarrelled elephant rifle to just desperately shoot the thing as many times as they can.  In most films you would expect that the humans would lose.  In most films our puny human weapons are no match for the monster and the humans who try to fight either are forced to run or they are quickly overtaken and eaten and you expect in this scene that this is what's about to happen. But here the humans just stand their ground and pour on fire furiously and they win.  They don't get eaten they don't flee for their lives there's no sudden deusexmachina that comes to save them at the last minute no superscientist from the local college who invents a destructoray to kill the monster.  It's inherently simple and yet it's something you don't see much in movies like this our stalwart earthman ways overcoming the terror from elsewhere.If you have the chance I highly recommend renting this movie.  It's a real diamond in the rough.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was a winner one of the best of the '90s for its type.  It managed well to mix the best of being a throwback to '50s horror Bmovies with some new concepts.The concept of the big unknown horror come to menace us decent folk is an old theme that gets a retread here.  A lot of the best stuff from the '50s treatment of this kind of story remains but it's all seen through a modern and earnest perspective.  And at the same time it still mixes witty humor without insulting the audience or its characters.The realistic approach to this movie is the winner.  Basically this movie asks What if giant worms really did come to menace some dustbowl podunk in the middle of Nevada?  The scientistbabe is the only slightly sketchy touch but it still works.  We don't get too much scientific mumbojumbo to detract from the flow we don't get people acting either like superheroes or terrified victims we don't get told too much or too little.  The characters act as what we can expect very well could be people facing a bizarre and alien threat as best they can.That is the '50s style of this movie people thrust into an encounter with the bizarre who use their native human intellect and resourcefulness to win.

The acting is excellent with very convincing attitude. This is an excellent buddy movie with a lot of humor in it which I cannot help but laugh every time they get into a sarcastic speal. The supporting cast was excellent and very believable. The special effects were top notch with no CGI used. These creatures were all practical using full scale puppets or miniatures. We can thank the good special effects wizards that did this movie including Dennis Stotak Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr who all have an impressive resume. There is one blue screen shot used and still everything was real just used to a backdrop in a scene. The dialog was great and it was sold excellent by the actors. The movie ends with no need for a sequel however three more become created. It's its own story and characters with no clich's tying to any other characters out there for the time. The timing and direction was great. It did create good suspense and terror at times which didn't take away from its humor. It is a great movie which should have more love than it has. This is a movie you can watch time and again because it is good entertainment and has a touch of many genre's for viewing pleasure. I give this a 10 out of 10 because it still has stood time for me as a great movie with few flaws and much much entertainment value. A must own in my opinion.".

It's not as selfaware as Scream and actually not a parody as such but in a sense it's in a similar vein. Maybe closer to Galaxy Quest actually. Whatever they sure make it exactly right.It's simply supposed to be 90 mins of sit back and enjoy fun and it sure manages that real good.As the foundation you've got a really great script with lots of witty and mean dialouge and simply great moments as findig that original up in a powerline mast having starved to death rather than go down or finding a car buried in the sand with the lights still on. The direction is perfect as is most of Ron Underwood's movies being able to switch between the good fun and really turn on the scary parts when needed. It's fun all the time but at the same time makes you sit on the edge of the seat at times.What makes the movie tho is the spirit. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon along with all the rest of the actors seems to have a really great time doing it and it shows on the screen.This is a movie that's.. well.. simply right all the way.. unless you try taking it too seriously".

It's about a group of natives of a small isolated town defend themselves against strange underground creatures which are killing them one by one. Sounds cheesy right?Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward really brings an entertaining and perfect chemistry on the screen. They're badass type and toughasnails personalities were extraordinary and as you watch them throughout the film the more you enjoy this flick. The other casts did a fine job as well. You were kind of rooting for them to survive and not to be eaten by graboids. The graboids looks kinda' cheesy yet scary. The point of view of the graboids using the point of view of a single camera looks even more scarier as it hunts down for its next victim.This movie makes me laugh makes me terrified makes me want to bite my fingernails and even makes me want to be careful when I'm standing on the ground and trying not to make a sound. Overall Tremors is a fun film and a fun ride. Watch this on a lazy weekend or whatever. I will give this movie a score of 9.".

The script is good and the acting good too. For a horror movie it was well thoughtout and well directed. How many horror movies have good acting in them these days?

I think it was because the tone was sharp for this kind of material. The filmmakers had more of a budget than something like a Japanese Godzilla movie and the actors including people like Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are not taking a s so to speak they're not there just to collect a paycheck or if they are they hide ir so well that you don't notice.The pacing is what keeps things tense and breakneck. The premise is simple underground worms chase and hunt down townspeople in the tiny Perfection Nevada. There's enough character in the setups with these people first though with Bacon and Ward as laborers and with the townspeople Michael Gross and Victor Wong get some ample screentime and it helps that the filmmakers spend just enough time in the first tenfifteen minutes so that we can care enough about them while also making them fairly comic characters.This is a fun movie. It doesn't have much pretension or things in the way to make it draw too much attention to it being art. It's a killerworms movie that gets some buildup early on for the what these worms are  first it's snakes and then it's the GIANT worm that's attached to everything and then when it gets going. And the special effects mostly hold up well with everything being practical effects. If you are inundated with CGI and don't remember a time when effects got to be MADE not simply on a computer with things moving quickly underground at people and shooting out of the ground with guns blazing at it and with gore flying everywhere. It's glorious work by talented craftsmen.So watch it knowing that it's funny wild and made with energy and some clever characters a couple being gun nuts plus Reba McEntire!".

It's a killerworms movie that gets some buildup early on for the what these worms are  first it's snakes and then it's the GIANT worm that's attached to everything and then when it gets going. And the special effects mostly hold up well with everything being practical effects. If you are inundated with CGI and don't remember a time when effects got to be MADE not simply on a computer with things moving quickly underground at people and shooting out of the ground with guns blazing at it and with gore flying everywhere. It's glorious work by talented craftsmen.So watch it knowing that it's funny wild and made with energy and some clever characters a couple being gun nuts plus Reba McEntire!";

It has some good scifi action plenty of comedy thanks to the two bumbling leads a rather unique and horrific creature design and this film resembles a mini disaster movie and that is a good thing. I also liked how this film is not flatout horror. Sure there are some chills but there is enough action and comedy to combat the horror elements of the film.Ron Underwood's film is about these two men named Val and Earl who are out working in a isolated town called Perfection located in Nevada. Things go awry when these mysterious snakelike creatures emerge from the depths to terrify the inhabitants and now escape is made impossible.I thought the acting was pretty good. Kevin Bacon does a solid job as Val and likewise Fred Ward for Earl. They both show excellent chemistry with each other. Their performances are in part why this film works. Despite being in moments of horror I like how they try to be funny and most of the time it works.Overall Tremors is a solid Bmovie that delivers on its promise of a good time. This is the kind of film that made 90's cinema so good. It's not designed to be an awardworthy film although the film does have many good reviews. But this film is meant to entertain just like many films of the 90's were made for. A movie that has plenty of screams but also plenty of laughs.My Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "The words 'adapted from a novel by Honore de Balzac' would suggest to most cinemagoers an example of French heritage cinema like the excellent version of his 'Le Colonel Chabert' made with Gerard Depardieu in the early nineties. Although Balzac is often claimed by the French as their greatest novelist he has not captured the imagination of the AngloSaxon reading or cinemagoing public in the same way as some of his compatriots such as Hugo Verne Flaubert or Dumas. Apart from 'Cousin Bette' I am not aware of any other Englishlanguage feature films based on his works.The story is set in the Paris of the 1840s. Bette Fischer is a middleaged spinster who works as a theatrical costumer. She is not welloff financially and lives in a sparselyfurnished apartment although she has more elevated social connections her cousin Adeline who dies at the beginning of the film was married to the influential Baron Hulot. Bette however had little love for Adeline as she was jealous of her cousin's beauty and of her marriage to a successful man. She falls in love with Count Wenceslas Steinbock a young Polish sculptor who lives in the same apartment block but loses her sweetheart to Adeline's pretty young daughter Hortense. Bette's dislike of the Hulot family now turns to hatred and she plots her revenge. She forms an alliance with Jenny Cadine an opera singercumcourtesan and a former mistress of the Baron who has given her up in accordance with his wife's dying wishes. Jenny with Bette's encouragement tries to ruin the happiness of the young couple by seducing Wenceslas away from Hortense. Those who are familiar with Balzac's novel will realise from the above summary that the film does not stick closely to its plot. Adeline for example dies at the very end of the novel not at the beginning. The real villainess of the novel is not Jenny who plays only a minor part or even Bette who is portrayed as pitiable as well as spiteful but Valerie Marneffe the scheming hypocritical golddigging and thoroughly corrupt middleclass housewife who becomes the mistress of Hulot Wenceslas and several other men. Valerie does not appear in the film at all nor do Hulot's other mistresses. The film concentrates on the relationships between Bette Wenceslas Hortense and Jenny Hulot a major figure in the book becomes less important in the film. The ending of the film in particular seems unsatisfactory. There is a confused attempt to tie the story of the Hulot family in with the revolution of 1848 an event that had not even taken place when the novel was written in 1846. This was probably inspired by the standard school textbook idea that the French Revolution represented a corrupt aristocracy getting its just deserts but this interpretation seems to confuse the events of 1848 with those of 1789 and it is not one that is likely to have appealed to the conservative monarchist Balzac. The replacement of the constitutional monarchy of the amiable 'Roi Citoyen' LouisPhilippe with the regime of the unscrupulous adventurer Napoleon III was not the most glorious episode in French history.Like some other reviewers I felt that some of the roles were miscast. Jessica Lange even in her late forties was far too attractive for the role of the driedup embittered spinster Bette. Balzac chose the name because of its similarity to the French word 'bete' meaning 'beast'. Bette's driving force is sexual jealousy of the beauty of other women particularly of Adeline and Hortense but Miss Lange's character is not a woman who would need to feel jealous of anyone. Kelly Macdonald's Hortense seemed too insipid. Hugh Laurie in his late thirties at the time the film was made was far too young for the role of Hulot. The character envisaged by Balzac was probably in his sixties and the father of two adult children. Hortense has an elder brother Victorin. Laurie better known in Britain as a comedian than as an actor plays Hulot as a largely comic figure whereas in the novel he is a tragic one a distinguished public servant ruined by his sexual passions and his financial improvidence. The book forms part of the sequence of novels which Balzac intended as a close examination of French society and to which he gave the title of 'La Comedy Humaine'. Despite this title most of the individual novels 'La Cousine Bette' among them are deeply serious rather than humorous but the filmmakers here seem to treat the story as a black comedy. On the whole in fact this approach works well. The story moves along at a brisk pace helped on its way by some witty songs. The title of one of these 'Love is the Master You are the Slave' is perhaps the best encapsulation one could wish for of the film in a single phrase most of the characters are enslaved by their sexual desires. Jessica Lange may be physically wrong for the part but she nevertheless throws herself into her role with gusto and makes a splendidly hissable pantomime villainess. Elisabeth Shue's singing voice is not really strong enough to make her convincing as an opera singer but she is well able to convey Jenny's seductive charms. Unlike some I found no difficulty with the fact that Bette and Jenny had American accents both after all were originally peasant girls from AlsaceLorraine Bette's surname implies that her native language is probably German rather than French and would not have spoken French with the Parisian accents of the other characters. There are some good performances in minor roles Toby Stephens makes a suitably dull and priggish Victorin a man who is the complete antithesis of his father and Bob Hoskins is in superb form as the greasy businessman Crevel. The name is derived from 'crever' meaning to burst and Hoskins's Crevel is a man positively bursting with his own selfimportance. The film may take liberties with Balzac but on the whole it is an enjoyable one which works reasonably well in its own right. 610".

	schema:headline " A terrible violation of genius.";
	schema:reviewBody "The closing credits on this movie rolled more than an hour ago. I still feel soiled.The only good thing about director Des McAnuff's version of Cousin Bette is Jessica Lange's excellent turn as Bette that misunderstood underestimated old maid hiding her lifelong rage and jealousy beneath a mask of family loyalty.In all other respects this adaptation is execrable. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr should be banned from ever penning any more literary adaptations.Balzac's Cousin Bette was a masterpiece an eternal condemnation of the selfishness of vice achieved through a portrayal of depravity's destruction of virtue. The cinematic version is a mediocre daytime drama in petticoats.The power of the original novel derives from Balzac's use of fascinatingly unforgettably tragically human characters to illuminate his pitiless moral that virtue nine times out of ten will fall to the knife in the back of vice. That moral is played out through the characters. And from the pure pious and eternally forgiving Adeline Hulot a wife willing to forgive and forget more than two decades of her adored husband's infidelity all the way down to the Jewish courtesan Josepha at once a shameless golddigger a great artist and at heart a kind woman every player in Balzac's grand tragedy plays an irreplaceable part and illuminates an unalterable truth. And it is with the writers' treatment of those characters that McAnuff's Cousin Bette first fails.The greatest tragedy of the novel lies in the gradual abandonment and destruction of the saintly Adeline Hulot. After closing her eyes to two decades of infidelity she slowly falls from her position into terrible poverty and neglectone of those illuminations of the destruction of virtue by vice which gives the novel its power. Siefert and Tarr seem not to have grasped this essential point of the source material. Instead of having to deal with the difficulty of a great beauty thrown into the gutter they have taken the easy way out by killing her off within the first five minutes of the novel. And this without even bothering to pay lip service to the beauty and charm of the woman whose success is the fuel for the fire of Bette's vengefulness. Without Adeline's presence and influence Bette's envy is pointless. But what else could one expect from screenwriters this illiterate?Next Siefert and Tarr erased the most fascinating character of the original novel that of Valerie Marneffe the middleclass civil servant's wife who is the cause of all of the novel's misfortunes. Valerie was a far more fascinating character than her cinematic replacement the actress and whore Jenny Cadine. Madame Marneffe's hypocrisythe truth of her whore's heart disguised by the outward appearance of a virtuous wifeand the complications of her avarice and passion provided a large part of the entertainment and insight of the novel. Again Siefert and Tarr have avoided the difficulty of bringing such a multifaceted character to life simply by cutting her out altogether.

	onyx:emotionText "The closing credits on this movie rolled more than an hour ago. I still feel soiled.The only good thing about director Des McAnuff's version of Cousin Bette is Jessica Lange's excellent turn as Bette that misunderstood underestimated old maid hiding her lifelong rage and jealousy beneath a mask of family loyalty.In all other respects this adaptation is execrable. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr should be banned from ever penning any more literary adaptations.Balzac's Cousin Bette was a masterpiece an eternal condemnation of the selfishness of vice achieved through a portrayal of depravity's destruction of virtue. The cinematic version is a mediocre daytime drama in petticoats.The power of the original novel derives from Balzac's use of fascinatingly unforgettably tragically human characters to illuminate his pitiless moral that virtue nine times out of ten will fall to the knife in the back of vice. That moral is played out through the characters. And from the pure pious and eternally forgiving Adeline Hulot a wife willing to forgive and forget more than two decades of her adored husband's infidelity all the way down to the Jewish courtesan Josepha at once a shameless golddigger a great artist and at heart a kind woman every player in Balzac's grand tragedy plays an irreplaceable part and illuminates an unalterable truth. And it is with the writers' treatment of those characters that McAnuff's Cousin Bette first fails.The greatest tragedy of the novel lies in the gradual abandonment and destruction of the saintly Adeline Hulot. After closing her eyes to two decades of infidelity she slowly falls from her position into terrible poverty and neglectone of those illuminations of the destruction of virtue by vice which gives the novel its power. Siefert and Tarr seem not to have grasped this essential point of the source material. Instead of having to deal with the difficulty of a great beauty thrown into the gutter they have taken the easy way out by killing her off within the first five minutes of the novel. And this without even bothering to pay lip service to the beauty and charm of the woman whose success is the fuel for the fire of Bette's vengefulness. Without Adeline's presence and influence Bette's envy is pointless. But what else could one expect from screenwriters this illiterate?Next Siefert and Tarr erased the most fascinating character of the original novel that of Valerie Marneffe the middleclass civil servant's wife who is the cause of all of the novel's misfortunes. Valerie was a far more fascinating character than her cinematic replacement the actress and whore Jenny Cadine. Madame Marneffe's hypocrisythe truth of her whore's heart disguised by the outward appearance of a virtuous wifeand the complications of her avarice and passion provided a large part of the entertainment and insight of the novel. Again Siefert and Tarr have avoided the difficulty of bringing such a multifaceted character to life simply by cutting her out altogether. Jenny Cadine seems to live for nothing more than a few bouquets of flowers and a pretty dress or two. Not a fraction as compelling.So the characters do not live up to the source material. Neither does the plot which turns Balzac's masterfully arranged actions and reactions topsyturvy. Here and there one may see bits of the original novel struggling to break throughas in Bette's rage when she is told that Wenceslas Steinbock whom she adores has secretly entered into a romance with her niece Hortensebut those glimpses are more tragic than anything else for exposing the greatness that this movie fails miserably to approach.With a series of seemingly natural and inevitable turns of fortune and struggles to escape ruin Balzac presented a wholly organic portrait of absolute devastation.

	schema:headline " A near perfect film. Indulge in revenge without the guilt!";
	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a movie comes along that lets one revel in emotions that are generally frowned upon in genteel society. Revenge is one such emotion and the very black comedy Cousin Bette deals it out in generous portions.Bette Jessica Lange has always lived in the shadow of her more beautiful sister Adeline. Adeline was always prepared for marriage and society while Bette became a virtual servant for her family. To make matters worse Adeline marries the one man Bette loves the Baron Hulot. The film opens with Adeline on her death bed listening to the confessions of her adulterous husband and spendthrift son. She makes Bette promise to take care of her family. The malicious grin on Bette's face lets us know what is coming. Bette orchestrates her revenge on each member of the family with a cunning her family never suspected.Part of what makes this film so delicious is that none of the characters are really very likeable but they are all very interesting and well drawn. Even Bette is not someone you would want to welcome into your own family although she'd make a fascinating guest at a dinner party. The only character who fares even mildly well is Cesar Crevel Bob Hoskins. A merchant who has become the wealthiest man in Paris he is attempting to buy his way to respectability. He is at least without pretense even going so far as to offer 200000 francs to see Hortense Hulot the Baron's daughter played by Kelly MacDonald naked.The story follows Bette's attempts to destroy the Baron and his family by manipulating them in their love affairs. The marriage of Hortense is expected to save the family financially hence the appearance of Crevel. But Hortense loves the penniless Count Wenceslas Steinbach Aden Young a sculptor. Meanwhile the Baron has been borrowing from everyone in Paris to keep his mistress Jenny Cadine. Bette controls all of the characters like a Grand Master.The backdrop to the film is the decay of the French aristocratic society. Resting on the laurels of the Empire of Napoleon oblivious to the coming revolution the film begins in 1846 and in complete denial of the changes around them we actually cheer for Bette as she systematically destroys the Hulot family. In a way it's the revolution carried out from within making the fall all the more sweet.This film is really exceptional. My only criticisms would be that 1 Elisabeth Shue as the famous actresscourtesan Jenny Cadine is merely adequate 2 it is almost impossible to imagine the stunning Jessica Lange as the plain sister and 3 the characters' accents tend to vary from time to time. The script is intelligent clever and realistic. The acting is very strong all around especially by Lange. Hoskins is terrific hitting just the right note of a materialistic man trying to be a nobleman but not quite getting it. The locations and sets are lush and as decadent as one would expect. The direction of Des McAnuff is crisp and assured the pace even and well controlled.".

So I can't comment on whether this movie seems faithful to the book. I found the movie is very good and very well acted. I was readily able to admire Cousin Bette who has been treated disgracefully over her life one way and another lost the first man she loved to another woman and later loses another man to his daughter.... and eventually loses patience with being taken advantage of. I could also happily despise the nasty young Germanm sculptor she so unwisely falls for what an arrogant irritating twerp. Being English I'm used to Hugh Laurie being only a comedian and it was interesting to see him in a more serious part as the family's patriach.But I'm mystified by one aspect of the story. Toby Stephens is cast as a son of the family Victorin and the only one with a brain in his head and one feels for his frustration as the rest of his family behave like idiots. Is he intended to be priggish? Hardly surprising since without him managing the estate and the shockingly large loans that're all keeping them going and his father so determinedly squanders on a showgirl and general stupidity they'd all have been in the poorhouse long ago. Yet when it comes to retribution time why is Victorin forced to flee with his family so as to avoid being murdered by one of the lenders calling in the money whilst noone else suffers or does someone pay off the debts? If the theme is Bette's retribution what on earth has she got against Victorin? And if the theme is wider than her personal retribution it's not exactly clear. Perhaps there is an explanation in the book that was omittied from the movie or the theme is that Victorin must suffer because he doesn't stop his father's excesses. But at least it seems he escapes to build a new safer life with his family whilst the rest of them suffer far worse. As people who live to excess and get themselves into trouble are colourful but also can be considerable bores I would have liked to hear more about the financial aspects and seen Victorin used more in the movie.But what happens to the extensive debts? At the end we see Bette living in the great house but what do they live on? Perhaps the book explains this I certainly hope so. I'd have given 8 stars but for those two quibbles.".

Jessica Lange is great as Cousin Bette yet an older uglier actress would've played the role more convincingly.

Young actor Aden Young who was just awesome in his first film role  in the movie Black Robe is equally as good here as the artist who Cousin Bette loves and upon being rejected by the boy who is young to enough to be her son then discards and uses to get ahead and gain revenge on her uncaring family members. Bob Hoskins is quite funny in this film role as is Hugh Laurie as the family father who loves Ms Shue's character Jenny Cadine the courtesan enough to flounder the family fortune. Really great black comedy. out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "And so it begins the calculations in the mind of a Wicked Lady. This is the type of delicious melodrama often with comic overtones that Gainsborough was known for in the mid 1940's usually starring the gorgeous Margaret Lockwood. But Jessica Lange's Cousin Bette is not a ravishing beauty in fact she's quite unlovely. Lack of makeup or pale powder turns the usually gorgeous Lange into quite the plain spinster devoted to the dying day of her older cousin Geraldine Chaplin. She seemed to believe that her devotion would make her wealthy widowed cousin in law Hugh Laurie wish to marry her so she could take over the running of the household. Well housekeepers do run the house through their master's orders so in a sense she got her wish. As surrogate mother to Laurie's children she becomes a confidante as most servants do and it's instantly fascinating to watch the wheels turn in Lange's severely coiffed head. What could have been a complex melodrama of a woman's vengeance turns out to be a convoluted reversal of fortune version of Dangerous Liaisons where a poor relative of the Mobility plays sexual mind games with the young vowing vengeance on the second cousin who marries the much younger man she tried to control after saving his life. Much of the cast seem far too American in style and mood to be believable as Napoleon era French. Elisabeth Shue in particularly miscast both in the age of her character and her believability in the setting. The musical sequences too obviously influenced by the success of Amadeus are seemingly modern musical theater style rather than the proper baroque feeling. Of course costumes and sets are lush but that doesn't take away from the falseness of the film overall.".

I enjoyed Jenny Cadine's character as well as Bob Hoskin's portrayal of Cesar Crevel.One critique I have is that the atmosphere was not very French.

Our Cousin Bette gets there but she chooses another road perhaps more hazardous but infinitely more entertaining for us. This fascinating tale is about a relative who is treated poorly by everyone in her aristocratic family while they themselves live in debt denial and high fashion. Jessica Lange plays the title character with a cynical smirk as though she's daring every one to call her out yet she knows  only too well  that people are so consumed by their own personal dramas that they ignore the fine details.Described as the bad seed who refused to blossom Bette is the sister of Adeline who languidly takes her time dying while instructing her spinster sibling as to what flowers to lay on her casket. One look at the two  Adeline in her deathbed finery and Bette in a basic drab dress devoid of any adornment  and it's all too evident where the balance of power resides. Bette to Jenny How could you know? You don't know who I was sacrificed to  to Adeline. They slapped me and caressed her. I went dressed like a wretch and she like a fine lady. Adeline the garden peel the vegetables Bette. She never lifted a finger except to tie her ribbons.Describing herself as a country peasant Bette lives in the slums of Paris working as a costume seamstress to the reigning burlesque star of the day Jenny Cadine played by Elizabeth Shue who vainly shows off her derrire before every final curtain is rung down. Jenny puts off the ticking clock of time by enjoying the attentions of her many rich  and generous  admirers yet one fateful day encounters her worst nightmare.Jenny I'm 24I may as well be dead.Bette You were 24 years old yesterday and it didn't seem to bother you then. Jenny Today while I was walking in the park I came across a hideous old woman face swollen and scratched she stank of stale wine and sweat. In her filthy tresses she had placed a beauty patch one red camellia I knew at once who she was  she was known as Carabine the most famous courtesan in Paris. Everyone envied her dazzling shoulders her milky skin. She had a neck so smooth it might have been turned on a lathe. Her trademark was a red beauty patch a red camellia.'Carabine? Is that you?' I asked. 'No there is no Carabine she has left me.' Originally a novel by French author Honore de Balzac this modern version boasts an international cast of talent. Bob Hoskins Cesar Crevel Hugh Laurie Baron Hector Hulot Aden Young Wenceslas Kelly Macdonald Hortense Hulot and Geraldine Chaplin Adeline Hulot all twist and turn in time to Bette's song of vengeance. Set in Paris during the prerevolutionary period of 1846 screenwriters Seifert and Tarr turn Balzac's morality tale into a microcosm of the class resentments barely simmering just beneath the pearls and petticoats of Bette's shadow world. Yet she's nothing if not flexible as she revises her bestlaid plans in the face of cross and doublecross by family and high society associates alike. Bette I'll see them  all of them  in the dust! We're both daughters of the soil and blood of the voge and do you trust me as a sister?Jenny YesBette And will you help me as you would a sister?Jenny YesBette Then you will be the ax and I'll be the hand that wields it.Surrounded by people with their own notions of power Bette plays nonstop Powernoply until she wins all while the French Revolution rages. She's able to play upon the passions of her tormentors and deftly manages to wreck her subtle brand of ruthless revenge upon one and all causing adultery a duel physical illness embezzlement financial ruin imprisonment in the Bastille and a crime of passion  all of which sees her contentedly sewing in the grand house dressed in her own silken finery cooing to a child who's the product of this genteel carnage.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I have read the novel of course and it was excessively boring like all of Mr. Bazac's I must say. The novel is more about bonds and money and it's kind of a good bible for those who have money problems but it's definitely NOT the sort of story that films can be made on. Howevwr when I watched the film Cousin Bette for the first time I was more then surprised.

The novel is more about bonds and money and it's kind of a good bible for those who have money problems but it's definitely NOT the sort of story that films can be made on. Howevwr when I watched the film Cousin Bette for the first time I was more then surprised.

As penance and to redirect his energies Father Fitzpatrick orders Ralph to join the school's cross country running team under the tutelage of the school's avantgarde thinking teacher Father Hibbert. Some of the more unusual circumstances of Ralph's life are that he lives by himself in the family home telling the authorities that he is living with his paternal grandparents who are in reality deceased and telling his widowed hospitalized mother Ralph's father was killed in the war that he is staying with a friend.

I believe this Canadian film could only have been made in an Englishspeaking Commonwealth country possibly Britain but certainly Canada or Australia. It's pretty definite however that this kind of film could never have been made in the U.S. There is a certain sensibility that we south of the Canadian border seem to have lost forever.This movie is not perfect but it certainly ranks as one of the most satisfying films I've seen in a very long time.

People literally clapped in the theatre more than half hung around for all of the credits and groups were huddled around posters seeking more information about the film.My favourite detail I was simply astonished at the music score for the climatic scene. Gord Downie's version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah is breathtakingly beautiful and perfectly set. Adam Butcher playing Ralph in the scene transcends the childactor role. His face displays an exquisite complexity of emotions chilling and sublime while Downie sings. Truly marvelous.The premise by now is familiar a boy's mother falls into a coma and he believes a miracle will awaken her. The movie positions itself in that delicious but awkward transition between boyhood innocence and adulthood stoicism or cynicism. Ralph is a child becoming a man learning the limits of his own body his mother's body and all the while confronting adults inability to imagine or dream. He dream's on and takes the audience on a sweet journey that will rekindle your fire. It truly is an inspirational film without being sappy or relying on overwrought clichs.A truly promising start for Michael McGowan a new Canadian filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best movies I've seen all year. I tried to catch it in the theatre but it was vapourized too quickly and having seen it I'm completely baffled surely Canada can afford to promote movies a little better than this. Many such missed opportunities come to mind Marion Bridge The Hanging Garden et al. This is one of the best of its genre the extremely gritty dedicated athletemusiciansingerpainter who takes on the world against all odds. But this is done with a twist. It all takes place in the 1950s in very Catholic parochial school Ontario.Ralph Adam Butcher is a brazen but cute 14yearold student fighting the system but inwardly grieving his Dad who died in the recent war WW2and his extremely ill mother who lies in a coma in the hospital. This is never sentimentalized his exchanges with his mother before she slips into her coma are beautifully written and believable.How he cobbles together his faith and goes out to seek a miracle is the crux of the story but there are many lovely sidebars his almostgirlfriend who wants to be a nun his best friend who forges notes for him a fun loving nurse played by the never disappointing Jennifer Tilly squeaky voice in place and some disbelieving factory workers who mock his attempts at athleticism.Ralph is a fully developed character his sinful side clashing consistently with his puritanical selfpunishing side his innate flirtatiousness offset by his being picked upon by the older boys in his school. Adam nails the role to such a degree that one forgets he is acting.A younger priest Campbell Scott plays this beautifully with a secret past agrees to help the young boy and Gordon Pinsent plays the part of the older rigid priest with conviction even though he has some thin dialogue to sink his teeth into  the movie's only weakness.The sexuality content is handled well and honestly with none of that gruesome teenage guffawing that litters other movies of this ilk. Because of this content it would not be suitable for children which is a shame but it is not gratuitous and is an intrinsic part of the Catholic sin quotient of the era. 8 out of 10. A marvelous thoughtful film.".

I tried to catch it in the theatre but it was vapourized too quickly and having seen it I'm completely baffled surely Canada can afford to promote movies a little better than this. Many such missed opportunities come to mind Marion Bridge The Hanging Garden et al. This is one of the best of its genre the extremely gritty dedicated athletemusiciansingerpainter who takes on the world against all odds. But this is done with a twist. It all takes place in the 1950s in very Catholic parochial school Ontario.Ralph Adam Butcher is a brazen but cute 14yearold student fighting the system but inwardly grieving his Dad who died in the recent war WW2and his extremely ill mother who lies in a coma in the hospital. This is never sentimentalized his exchanges with his mother before she slips into her coma are beautifully written and believable.How he cobbles together his faith and goes out to seek a miracle is the crux of the story but there are many lovely sidebars his almostgirlfriend who wants to be a nun his best friend who forges notes for him a fun loving nurse played by the never disappointing Jennifer Tilly squeaky voice in place and some disbelieving factory workers who mock his attempts at athleticism.Ralph is a fully developed character his sinful side clashing consistently with his puritanical selfpunishing side his innate flirtatiousness offset by his being picked upon by the older boys in his school. Adam nails the role to such a degree that one forgets he is acting.A younger priest Campbell Scott plays this beautifully with a secret past agrees to help the young boy and Gordon Pinsent plays the part of the older rigid priest with conviction even though he has some thin dialogue to sink his teeth into  the movie's only weakness.The sexuality content is handled well and honestly with none of that gruesome teenage guffawing that litters other movies of this ilk. Because of this content it would not be suitable for children which is a shame but it is not gratuitous and is an intrinsic part of the Catholic sin quotient of the era. 8 out of 10. A marvelous thoughtful film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Clearly the best movie out this month JulyAugust 2005  I've seen most of them. The easiest way to tell you about it is to compare it to similar movies and the first that came to mind were Lucas Corey Haim and Rudy Sean Astin. What Saint Ralph shares in common with these films is the extreme athletic determination against all odds of a spirited boy from a pathetic background. And it's the best of it's kind since Rudy 1993 at least and in my opinion since Lucas 1986.Ralph Adam Butcher is a naughty but naive 14yearold boy ready to take almost everything literally now faced with the paradox of faith. His widowed mother is apparently dying in the hospital and falls into a coma early in the story. A doctor says it will take a miracle to wake her.Ralph is an interesting character his even blend of pure and impure motives providing both the humor that make the film entertaining and the realism that make it believable. His selfabuse in every sense defines the term from the usual meaning to literally sanding his knees to pray in a pan of alcohol the latter recommended by his girlfriend who aspires to be a nun.When his Catholic school's cross country coach says it would be a miracle if anyone on his team won the Boston Marathon Ralph's literal mind seizes a fallacious opportunity. If he wins the Boston Marathon it would be a miracle and that's what his mother needs to survive. Most of the movie is about his training to run that race both physical and spiritual with the help of a priest Campbell Scott a nurse Jennifer Tilly and his girlfriend Tamara Hope.The blend of comedy and pathos is effective the film kept entertaining by the comedy in the foreground while the fact that Ralph's mother is dying keeps us interested in the outcome and rooting for the boy. Even if you don't like running or sports in general the life at stake or at least the boy's faith at stake makes this race important.There may be a bit too much sexual comedy for most parents to let small children see. For instance after Ralph's caught in a venal sin in the swimming pool that involved spying on the girl's locker room he tells his mother It was really an accident. The manufacture of the pool was faulty. The incident becomes a running joke demonstrating Ralph's character trait of not caring what other people think. He later says they didn't really need to drain the pool I'm not going to explain that you've got to see it but it was funny. But it's not as crude as other current comedies like The Wedding Crashers and The Bad News Bears.I recommend Saint Ralph specifically to anyone who liked Lucas or Rudy and generally to anyone old enough to take the humor maturely.".

Mr. McGowan was lucky in getting Adam Kutcher to portray Ralph Walker. This young actor shows us he is a natural who under the guidance of the director gives a tremendous performance and steals our hearts in the process.Saint Ralph is one of the best things that have come out of Canada in recent years. Campbell Scott gives a good performance as Father Hibbert the man who guides Ralph in the right direction. The excellent Gordon Pinsent makes the perfect head master Father Fitzpatrick a man who is never in touch with the young people he is supposed to lead and help shape their minds into being good citizens. Jennifer Tilly Tamara Hope Shauna MacDonald and Michael Kaney are also seen in key minor roles.The film is highly recommended because it gives the viewer a positive take on life.

	schema:reviewBody "was pleasantly surprised by Saint Ralph. It's a Canadian film about a 14 year old boy who goes to Catholic School in 1950's Hamilton. It stars Campbell Scott Gordon Pinsent Adam Butcher Shauna MacDonald and was directed by Michael McGowan. It's about a Ralph Walker who's mother is sick in hospital and who's father died long ago. He is a smooth operator sort of an Eddie Haskell type with the adults but a complete loser with his peers. When his mother goes into a coma he's told that only a miracle would wake her up. He is forced to join the track team as punishment where the coach Father Hibbert Campbell Scott jokes about there only being 6 months until the Boston Marathon. When Ralph asks if the team is going to run in Boston Father Hibbert tells him he was only joking and that it would be a miracle if anyone on the team won the Boston Marathon. Thus Ralph becomes committed to the idea of winning the Marathon and getting the miracle so his mom will wake up. In the way is Father Fitzpatrick played by Gordon Pinsent the head of the school who feels that chasing miracles borders on blasphemy. There is a mix of comedy and drama and the ending is a bit of a hearttugger but I enjoyed this film. Note I would not bring children under 12 to see it since there is a scene in the pool where Ralph accidentally sees into the women's change room and at the same time encounters a water jet which causes him to lose control. There is also some smoking and drinking by Ralph and a few swear words. It sort of reminded me of Heaven Help Us but funnier and more poignant. Adam Butcher was quite funny and earnest while Campbell Scott is always solid and Gordon Pinsent is one of Canada's best kept acting secrets. Even if you aren't Canadian it was a nice popcorn film 7.510.".

Ralph's mother is suffering from an unspecified illness in a local hospital and is in what appears to be a permanent coma. In fact she is so bad off that only a miracle could bring her back. Ralph takes this literally and believes that by effecting a personal miracle he can bring his mother out of her coma. One of the Fathers at the school remarks that it would be a miracle if Ralph were to win the Boston Marathon and that is the miracle Ralph seizes on.This movie is one more installment in the canon of sports movies where one achieves a goal through persistence in overcoming many obstacles and there are many obstacles to Ralph's achieving his dream not the least of which is that he is somewhat of a wimp. For certain reasons Father Fitzpatrick the school's headmaster has forbidden Ralph to participate in even training for the Marathon or running in any public race. But fortunately the cross country coach who just happens to have been Canada's premier marathon runner in a previous life identifies with Ralph's goal and in defiance of the headmaster agrees to coach him. But other obstacles abound Ralph's father is dead and Ralph is living at home alone and being threatened with eviction the headmaster is trying to put him in a foster home he burns his house down by accident and barely escapes he is picked on and made fun of at school and in the community for being caught masturbating in the local swimming pool and so on. But when executed well the formula works. This movie goes down smoothly due primarily to Butcher's winning performance and Campbell Scott's portrayal of the sympathetic Father Hibbert. Their relationship rings true and forms a core of the movie along with Ralph's budding relationship with Claire a wouldbe nun who finds a way to rationalize her attraction to Ralph. Jennifer Tily's appearance as Ralph's mother's nurse adds some color. Gordon Pinsent's role as headmaster seems excessive in its sternness but I am led to understand that his personality is not at all out of the realm of the believable.There are some beautifully filmed scenes of Ralph running against various backgrounds accompanied by inspiring music. I imagine this movie was a shot in the arm for the sport of distance running. A comment by Father Hibbert poses a question for us as to whether or how often we have made a sacrifice to take a risk to satisfy a passion with consequences unknown?Some things just don't work. Ralph is occasionally visited by direct communications with God personified here as Ralph's father in a Santa Claus suit. I doubt that the intent was to identify a belief in Santa with a belief in God but that is what I came away with. Ralph's belief in a miracle seemed incongruous with his having been initially presented as a precocious independentthinking resourceful and savvy kid. The scene where Ralph literally flies while running probably being a metaphor for the runner's high struck me as adding an unnecessary fantastical element. Ralph did not look to have a world class runner's form except in long shots where they must have used a double.About half way through this I began to think about how it was going to end. For Ralph to win the Boston Marathon and have his mother revive would be a stretch even for such a sentimental movie. But having Ralph lose and his mother not revive would definitely be too much of a downer. So the ending is the only logical one.".

The writing and acting are so good every bit of this movie is captivating. It would be hard to find one false step. And having been a kid myself in the 1950s and receiving some Catholic education I can also say it is very authentic for the period.Previously an unknown to me young Adam Butcher gives an award quality performance as Ralph Walker a high school freshman in 1953 whose father is deceased and his mother is in the hospital. Although he is home alone he has a friend with good penmanship write notes from has grandparents who supposedly are staying with him. He is a reprobate of sorts smoking cigs every chance he gets and often confessing his various sins of the heart and personal abuse. But Ralph loves his mother visits her every day at the hospital and is of course very distraught when mom lapses into a coma. The nurse Jennifer Tilly tells him It will take a miracle to get her out of the coma.Campbell Scott is excellent as Father George one of Ralph's teachers who coincidentally happened to be a top marathon runner in 1936 and who teaches cross country. Ralph joins the cross country squad as a way to earn the pain of penance hoping his reformed life and prayer will result in the miracle that will heal his mother. Fr. George casually mentions the Boston Marathon in a few months as a joke but Ralph takes it seriously. Expressing an interest to Fr. George who replies It would take a miracle for you to win Boston. Ralph puts his and the nurse's comments together if he can win Boston that would be the miracle that would heal his mother.Not allowing anyone to dissuade him Ralph is a pathetic runner but vows to train harder than anyone else. The very strict school master Father Fitzpatrick Gordon Pinsent tries to put a stop to it A boy needs to know his place in life but Fr. George reluctantly and in defiance agrees to coach Ralph. Meanwhile mom lies in a coma with no signs of improvement.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. Ralph wins a local race around the lake surprising everyone but himself. Still Boston will be a whole different story. He enters one of the boys locks himself into the media room at school and plays the radio broadcast of the race. Near the end Ralph hangs on and runs nip and tuck with last year's Boston winner but is nipped at the tape. Ralph finishes second believes he has failed. But he receives a warm hero's reception at school even the admiration of strict Fr. Fitz. He even gets the girl who had said she would become a nun. Then his mom came out of her coma even finishing second in Boston was a miracle!".

It is an extremely uplifting movie that everyone will love. I don't recommend it to kids younger than twelve though because it has some nudity when Ralph sees into the girl's dressing room some foul language and some strong thematic elements.".

The religious surroundings could be replaced with any surroundings that might be familiar to each and every one of us.This story is really about faith and desire that stems from a person with a very strong spirit. Although it's about a young lad who wants to win the Boston Marathon the theme is intangible with any of our own desires to accomplish something which at first may appear to be seemingly unfathonable.The photography and acting was solid and the writing was refreshingly original.It's too bad that a great movie like this has not yet found the path to mainstream distribution. It wasn't made by Hollywood and it wasn't made by one of the oligopoly conglomerates like Sony. It will probably take a while until the word gets out but the word will get out. We had to go to a little theatre that shows off the mainstream films.Good Running Gordco".

Stories about kids who gain faith through acts of courage are usually tainted with saccharine scripts but with the wise use of presenting a wellrounded multidimensional character as the hero of this story writerdirector Michael McGowan succeeds in a touching tale that is so based on real behavioral patterns of young teens that it becomes simply an inspiring and entertaining movie.Ralph Adam Butcher is 14 his father died a war hero and his mother is hospitalized for a terminal illness. Ralph is in Catholic School run by the stern disciplinarian Father Fitzpatrick Gordon Pinsent who understanding that Ralph has a free spirit and a propensity for getting into trouble spies on him. Ralph is repeatedly 'punished' for his transgressions but when he inadvertently has a hilarious swimming poolvoyeuristic experience he is threatened with expulsion unless he joins the school's Cross Country team run by the kindly Father Hibbert Campbell Scott.Ralph's 'naughty nature' is balanced by his complete devotion to his hospitalized mother Shauna MacDonald whom he visits daily she is all he has. His mother's nurse Jennifer Tilly is compassionate and shares with Ralph that as his mother slips into coma that the only thing that will save her is a miracle. Simultaneously Ralph's coach Father Hibbert jests that the only way any of the team would win the Boston Marathon would be a miracle. The dots connect Ralph trains and through faith and commitment finds himself crossing the finish line of the Marathon! The manner in which McGowan ends the story is part of what makes this film unique. Just as he allows Ralph to be a testy kid who continues to have hilarious episodes right up to the end of the story he doesn't let the film end in bathos. He makes every action and deed that occur in Ralph's journey combine to drive toward the final meaning. So here is a gentle comedy with a heart one that is touching while it is a little racy full of faith while it tests rationality. The cast is superb and seem committed under McGowan's wise direction to find just the right level of realism making us root strongly for a kid with impossible challenges. Recommended. Grady Harp".

The movie in short is about a rebellious boy who's father has passed away and his mother is in the hospital. He believes he can perform the miracle of waking is mother from a coma by winning a race. The movie is very bland there is nothing original about the plot and the ending is exactly what I expected it to be. It was semientertaining but did not evoke any strong emotion. One could not really relate to the main character he was just some guy to me. In addition the story was extremely unrealistic and typical. By saying it is unrealistic I don't mean that nobody could ever wake someone up from a coma by winning a race because that is debatable but because the amount of time this boy trained for this marathon and the times he received seemed to be pulled out of the air. The social response to this boy was also completely irrational. If you're just looking for something to keep you entertained for an hour or so and you find this movie lying around then i wouldn't advise you not to pick it up and watch it.

Please please send us the list on a regular basis. I believe we heard about this movie on Netflix as one of Roger Ebert's picks for best movie of 2005. While we tend to view any critic's recommendations with a jaundiced eye Ebert is reasonably reliable so I thought I'd give it a try. When it arrived my wife read the blurb on the DVD and said Why on earth did you order this? I gotta admit whoever wrote the blurb really made it sound sappy and had I picked it up at the local rental store I probably would have put it right back down again. What a mistake that would have been. Note to producers and distributors  next time you release a film get someone who understands the movie to write the blurb.Saint Ralph is truly outstanding. From the story to the acting to the photography and on it is a rare movie bringing many laughs and as many tears. From the trappings of 1950s parochial school guilt repression and just plain goofiness blossoms a truly and deeply spiritual quest. I am accustomed to being embarrassed to be a person of faith by the way it is perceived and represented by most of the media available today. Saint Ralph reminds me that there are those out there who still embrace faith as I do and I am deeply grateful to the writer director and everyone involved in this film.The thing that keeps this movie from being a corny feel good movie of the week is the natural juxtaposition of authentic uncontrived humor and uninflated drama  and the intelligence with which the story is constructed and executed.I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. If you've ever wondered what faith is really all about see this movie. If you've ever wanted to know how one very ordinary individual  just like yourself  can inspire and change an entire community for the better see this movie. There is truth here.".

This movie captures precisely how it is to be Catholic....and just a little bit crazy. It teaches the value of the madman and how his exuberance can truly inspire those who so much want to belittle him. The plot sets a 9th grade Canadian boy whose father died in WWII and whose mother is in a coma in his Catholic high school and traces his growing obsession with running's tie to his mother's recovery. His struggles with death illness dogma authority and.....errr..... puberty create a hero that completely won me. What a wonderful movie this is.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant and Complex Story of Innocence Lost";
	schema:reviewBody "Lacombe Lucien is an understated yet complex story of innocence corrupted by war. Though commercially successful the film was judged harshly in France by critics on the Left because of its nonjudgmental stance toward collaboration. Indeed the film offers no psychological interpretations but is content to simply show what happened in almost Bressonian fashion Malle worked as an assistant with Bresson in producing a documentary.Based on the childhood memories of Louis Malle Lacombe Lucien tells the story of Lucien Pierre Blaise a rural French teenager who having been rejected by the French resistance in 1944 joins with the German occupiers and becomes an enforcer. It is brilliant in its understated portrait of how selfinterest and pride can lead to regrettable choices.Lucien lives with his mother together with another man while his father remains a prisoner of war. With limited education and lacking sophistication Lucien is angered when his desire to join the underground is rejected because of his youth. Instead he opportunistically becomes a member of the German police and soon takes on the persona of a surly thug. Malle makes clear that Lucien is neither fundamentally good nor bad but only becomes involved with the Gestapo through a series of accidental circumstances. Though the film implies that Lucien is attracted to the Gestapo as a means for an individual without status or power to achieve a sense of self worth ultimately Lucien must take responsibility for his choice.He becomes involved with Albert Horn Holger Lowenadler a wealthy Jewish tailor from Paris his mother Bella Therese Giehse who has lived in an Eastern European ghetto and his young daughter France Aurore Clement who is totally Parisian and uncomfortable with her Jewish heritage. Their relationship becomes the turning point for Lucien's struggle to come to grips with who he is and retain his humanity. Though I felt repelled by Lucien's actions during the film I also sympathized with his plight and understood the circumstances that led to his corruption. I felt he was moving toward selfawareness before the end of the film.Lacombe Lucien poses moral questions about the point that innocence and immorality meet and with its almost matteroffact style the powerful conclusion almost takes us unaware. I found the film to be gripping and heartfelt and I would strongly recommend it. Pierre Blaise in his first acting role as Lucien turns in a performance of raw power. Unfortunately he was killed just one year later in an auto accident at the age of 24.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucien the provincial teenager who tries to join the resistance and when rejected becomes a Gestapo killer may be more innocent and ignorant as well as more brutish than the average Frenchman of the occupation but many French people must have fallen into collaboration like this. The period was rife with troubling complicity. Released at last in a fine US DVD version by Criterion Collection available with Murmur of the Heart 1971 and Goodbye Children 1987 this rich powerful work is not one for US film buffs to miss. This trio from Malle reveals him to be the New Wave's premier chronicler of the moral complexities and tragedies of the comingofage process. For the lead role Malle found the remarkable Pierre Blaise tragically killed in a car accident a year after release. A youth without previous acting experienced but with the provincial accent Malle couldn't find among professionals Blaise combines the cherubic and the dangerous the brutish and the sweetly innocent. Sullen yet ineluctably present Blaise has great presence and essentially makes the film. In a French TV interview with Malle at the time still available online Malle says Blaise was compared with Delon. Blaise turned out to be very very gifted Malle adds.The atmosphere of this interview incidentally suggests that in some circles not everyone in France was as violently upset by or opposed to the film as we are now told. After all Le Monde did hail Lacombe as a masterpiece initially even if they recanted and called it dangerous later. Dangerous is a strange criticism for a film a sort of backhanded flattery.When considering the moral ambiguity of the piece it's worth considering Allocin's commentary which points out the following Malle adopted a Marxist approach in looking at the collaboration. He stated that his Lucien was inspired by Marx's concept of the lumpenproletariat as a social class with no choice other than to collaborate with the forces of repression because its members have no political culture available to them. Thus in the filmmaker's mind Lucien Labombe's enlistment in the militia was a choice determined not by ideology but by a need to gain material comfort and better his social position. This is in fact a classic collabo situation while some supporters of the German occupation did so because of fascist antiSemitic beliefs many more did it for expediency. It was the arme des ombres to use JeanPierre Melville's title the rsistence shadow army whose members acted out of idealism. The determinism and sheer stupidity of Lucien's enlistment is underlined by the fact that it's late in the war the Americans are coming the Germans are losing and the French resistance is inflicting daily casualties on the closest collaborators as we see when Lucien's French Gestapo bosses get wounded and killed.Lucien's lumpenproletariat helplessness couldn't be made clearer. Lucien begins with a job emptying bedpans. His father is prisoner of the Germans. His mother is living with another man and tells him not to come around any more. His prospects are grim. He has no status  not even the comfort of parents. Though he's an ignorant boy he has the solid lumpen physique of a man and he also has a certain brutality we see him kill first a small bird with a sling shot then rabbits and chickens and each time this is a gesture in response to being put down or rejected. Yet he has confidence. He asks his schoolteacher to take him into the maquis but the man rejects him out of hand as too young useless we have many like you. By chance  a tire blowout on his rickety bike  he falls into a den of Gestapo collaborators. He's not daunted he recognizes a bike champion among them and drinks with the men and with his tongue thus loosened in an act of childish revenge whose dire consequences he probably doesn't know and which are initially hidden from him he informs on the teacher. He's soon taken to meet Albert Horn an elegant Jewish tailor from Paris in hiding with his mother and daughter Aurore Clment intense in her first screen role. Horn makes a suit for Lucien later another they become his new uniform an escape from his peasant identity and stepping stone to the power status and money that are why he's playing this deadly game.On the way to the tailor in a collaborator's posh sporty convertible Malle brilliantly has Lucien try on a pair of big sunglasses  which instantly transform him. By dint of this little gesture the country bumpkin  with his clear skin rich wavy dark hair and strong bone structure  instantly becomes a blas movie star. Coming of age in this film means sexiness transformation danger. Malle's teenagers all live in adult worlds of moral transgression but retain the prettiness and innocence of youth. What comes next clinches the moral ambiguity of Lucien's role he falls in love with the very Parisian but still Jewish daughter of Monsieur Horn.Lucien wields his new power crudely  he has no finesse only selfconfidence and a welltailored suit  but he is drawn to Horn as a substitute father and to the daughter because she  who herself rejects her Jewishness  represents urban sophistication as well as femininity. Why does the tellingly named France Horn takes no political or moral stand himself but does love the country sleep with Lucien? There are half a dozen very good reasons. The trajectory of Lacombe Lucien troubles us and makes us weep.".

Lacombe Lucien is dead. The marriage of character and actor was so profound that it was impossible to separate them. Pierre Blaise in Louis Malle's hands had given us a unique unrepeatable portrait of a young man walking the tightest rope without actually knowing it. The innocence of his brutality is something we have never seen in film before or since. I saw the film again last night first time in over 20 years and there it was beautiful Pierre Blaise his portrait with the passing of time has acquired an extra coat of truth. It made me think with a shiver running down my spine of Columbine and suicide bombers. What an extraordinary film. Louis Malle Pierre Blaise I miss you. Lacombe Lucien however is still here and will remain here for ever and ever.".

Lacombe Lucien is dead. The marriage of character and actor was so profound that it was impossible to separate them. Pierre Blaise in Louis Malle's hands had given us a unique unrepeatable portrait of a young man walking the tightest rope without actually knowing it. The innocence of his brutality is something we have never seen in film before or since. I saw the film again last night first time in over 20 years and there it was beautiful Pierre Blaise his portrait with the passing of time has acquired an extra coat of truth. It made me think with a shiver running down my spine of Columbine and suicide bombers. What an extraordinary film. Louis Malle Pierre Blaise I miss you. Lacombe Lucien however is still here and will remain here for ever and ever.";

	schema:reviewBody "Of all of the hundreds of foreign films I've seen through my 42 years one has stood out in mind  a film I first saw in 1979 and again in 1980. Lacombe Lucien director Louis Malle's searing powerful film of innocence lost and how power corrupts is one of the great films in French cinema. That the French themselves criticized the film on its initial release is amazing. That this film has gone for so long without a proper DVD release is unforgivable. The drought of its release to home video is about to end. The Criterion Collection is releasing Lacombe Lucien as part of a three film box set retrospective on Mallle's French films Au Revoir Les Infant and Murmus of the Heart two great Malle's features in their own right. Lacombe Lucien also will be available separately by itself. Either way modern American audiences will finally be able to see this film. And they won't be disappointed. Malle's film tells the story about a young French boy who joins the Nazis and snubs the French Resistance during the German occupation of France. From the powerful performances all the way to Malle's meticulous production design that beautifully recreates period France this film is unbeatable. As much as I enjoy watching Truffaut films nothing compares to the genius of Malle. From his French films to his American productions Malle truly was a genius of the cinema. I suggest you buy the threefilm retrospective. Or at the least but Lacombe Lucien.".

	schema:reviewBody "When this movie was released in 1974 it created a huge scandal and strong controversies because it was the first movie about the second world war to introduce a collaborator and not a resistant as a main character. Louis Malle was surely affected by these controversies and he decided to escape into the dream and imagination in his next film the odd and underrated Black Moon. So the main character here Lucien Lacombe is a member of the German police but he didn't choose this situation because he is antisemitic or he's fond of Nazi thesis. It's simply because he is a victim of his naivety and of his foolishness and he's easy to persuade. Several times in the movie you are under the impression that he doesn't know what he's doing or saying for example when he's drinking champagne with Albert Horn a Jew tailor and his daughter France. On the other hand the stroke is responsible of Lucien's entrance in the collaboration the school teacher doesn't want him to enter the Resistance because he's too young he had a flat tyre.... Moreover the action takes place in june 1944 and it's not the right era it's nearly the end of the war I also noticed that the collaborators were initiating him into several activities at one moment one of them is learning him to fire with a browning without taking care of his opinion. With all these happenings Lucien's behaviour is changing he becomes rough haughty scornful takes advantage of his wealthy life and committs a few errors  Horn is under arrest due to him and he didn't want it to happen. At the end Pierre Blaise provides a great calibre in his main rle and thanks to this the film is strong powerful and remain one of Malle's best films.Note the movie was inspired by a real fact during the second world war in France a young collaborator had arrested and killed numerous resistants.".

By avoiding stereotypical characters the director maintains a more intense level of suspense due to the unpredictability of the main protagonists. All the performances are excellent especially Pierre Blaise and Aurore Clement as Lucien and France. In my old age I find French and Italian films present women in a much more interesting and appealing manner than American films where they tend to be little more than eye candy or character studies with minimal sensuality. Virginia Madsen's portrayal of Maya in Sideways is one of the few American performances that can compare with Aurore Clement as France or Jeanne Moreau in Le Notte. Male European directors undoubtedly have a better and more mature understanding of the female psyche. The untimely death of Pierre Blaise shorty after the completion of this film only adds to the importance of this work since he displays a unique talent which was tragically cut short. Weaknesses in the film are a limited portrayal of the resistance fighters and a truncated ending which did not segue well with the final scene.".

	schema:headline " Moral ambiguities abound";
	schema:reviewBody "I think you could read history books about what it was like to live in southwestern France in 1944 and never come to as complete an understanding as you get from this film. It takes a look at French collaboration with the Nazis and concentrates on how a young farm boy Lucien Lacombe ends up collaborating with the Gestapo. Through Lucien's experiences we come to understand the intense moral complexities of the time. I am sure that this tale opened some old sores for a lot of people.It's hard to pigeonhole Lucien. In the early going we see that he takes pleasure in killing animals  birds for fun and rabbits for fun and food  but he is also shown to display much tenderness for a horse that has died. These paradoxical qualities manifest later in more significant ways.When Lucien finds himself stuck mopping floors and emptying bedpans in a local hospital he feels the need to escape that deadend. First he tries to join the French Resistance and is rejected because he is too young or perhaps because he is not thought clever enough. Then due to a random set of circumstances he winds up being taken into a hotel that is home base for a large group of collaborators. They recognize his potential value and get him drunk and plumb him for knowledge about the Resistance. Feeling some importance at being paid some attention and being attracted to the upscale surroundings Lucien drifts into the fold of the collaborators. Depressingly Lucien falls in with the collaborators more out of circumstance than political commitment  he is simply enticed by being given some authority sometimes exercised brutally and comfortable surroundings. The most disturbing thing about Lucien is that although he has some charm where passion or thoughtfulness should reside there appears to be nothing. He never seems to weigh the morality or consequences of his acts.To complicate matters Lucien is taken by the collaborators to the Jewish tailor Albert Horn Holger Lwenadler in a great performance in order to get him out of his peasant's clothes and into something more befitting one who works for the Gestapo. When Lucien sees Horn's daughter France he is immediately taken with her. This is where things get really interesting. Independently of any moral or political considerations the movie offers us some great character studies not only of Lucien but also of Albert and France. Lucien uses his authority to intrude into the Horns' lives and it is not long before France recognizes some of Lucien's charm. There is palpable tension among the three but also attraction  the interplay is fascinating. Each has something to offer the others and they all use their bargaining powers with each other. At one point Albert says to Lucien It's very strange. Somehow I can't bring myself to completely despise you and Lucien says he considers Albert a friend. Albert who hates the German occupation and the fact that Lucien is taking up with his daughter has an actor ever more poignantly projected such abject sadness as Lwenadler does in several scenes? sees Lucien as providing a possible escape to Spain and also uses Lucien's authority to confront his landlord when it is convenient for him to do so. In spite of being afraid of Lucien France is attracted to him and is not immune to the excitements he can offer.It is no accident that Albert's daughter's name is France. It is by way of Lucien's love of this woman that a more mature personality emerges in the final scenes.The most dispiriting message is how drab the whole business of collaboration was. You get the feeling that many of the collaborators were rather ambivalent about their choice or even worse that they had not thought enough about things to have made a choice at all. In one telling scene a woman functionary whose job it was to open letters from informants complains about her having broken a fingernail while reading through the mail. You get the feeling that in peacetime these collaborators would be ordinary people in ordinary jobs. Wartime forces people into making choices  if not active choices then passive. It was hard to resist the little perks of collaboration  even Lucien's mother had few qualms about taking money from her son knowing where it came from.While the story is absorbing one has to be impressed with Malle's artistry in its telling and his choice of actors. I think I have never seen more effective use of closeups to capture emotion. Malle also uses background images and light and shadow to augment the impact of many scenes. This is a master practicing his art. There are a couple of bothersome things. The Django Reinhardt track used as background music for the opening credits I thought a little odd. It does not set the appropriate mood for what is to come enjoyable as it is. And Albert's abrupt personality change toward the end is puzzling  he goes from being cautious even referring to himself as fragile to boldly entering the den of the collaborators wanting to talk with Lucien. His presence there is like waving a red flag in front of a bull. Minor quibbles aside in this movie you have a history lesson a captivating story fine performances firstrate cinematography intense character studies and the examination of complex moral issues. I would hope that that would be enough to draw you in.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tragic page in the history of France is examined in this disturbing account about the rise of a young man who went to the enemy's side after being rejected to join the resistance movement. Lucien a peasant youth with no future is stuck as a janitor in a old folks home which he clearly hates. At home Lucien has to put up with the indignity of seeing his own mother who is having an affair with the landlord of the farm where they live while the father is held prisoner by the Germans.All along one can witness a mean streak in Lucien. We watch him pull his sling shot to kill a small bird senselessly. He is an avid hunter as witnessed when he goes after rabbits something that in the war torn country comes in handy. We also see him beheading a chicken at the farm. The only way to go in his mind is by joining the traitors that are collaborating with the invading Germans.JeanBernard one of the French collaborators decides to show Lucien the ropes of his new chosen career. It is JeanBernard who is in Lucien's eyes a role model who introduces him to a life style he was not used to. Taking Lucien to get a new suit the young man meets Horn a Parisian tailor who happens to be a Jew.

Lucien commits the ultimate sin by turning Horn over the Germans and to a sure death but has second thoughts when a German soldier comes for France and her grandmother.Louis Malle film seen for a second time still holds one's interest. The story is one of many accounts in how French citizens turned against the less fortunate French Jewish population. It is also a tale about the cruelty of a young man that enters a world where otherwise he would have never been admitted had it not been because his determination to impress his newly found friends. Lucien relished in watching the school teacher being tortured by his allies. Mr. Malle examined the life of a young man without real convictions political or otherwise who became a monster that stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. The director's coup was casting a non professional Pierre Blaise for the pivotal role of Lucien Lacombe. Unfortunately the young man with a future in front of him died tragically in an automobile accident. Aurore Clement shows a luminous quality in her way for bringing her tragic character France Horn to life. Ms. Clement was at the height of her beauty something that comes across in her work in the film. Swedish actor Holger Lowenadler plays Albert Horn with dignity. The actor was perfect as the Jewish tailor. Therese Giehse a German actress is seen as the older Bella Horn. The supporting cast does excellent work for Mr. Malle.Lacombe Lucien is one of Louis Malle's best films among his distinguished career in the cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Louis Malle's film about the German occupation of France is based on his own experiences during that time when he was a teenager Malle was born in 1932 The young man is Lucien Lacombe and he is 17 in 1944 when the German war machine has started to fall apart. He lives in occupied France and as we get to know him we realize he's a moral cipher with no point of view at all toward the momentous events surrounding him. He's not stupid but his interest in the war is limited mostly to the daily ways it affects him directly.It affects him at home where his mother lives with her lover his father is missing in action. It affects him at work where he labors in his boring job at the hospital. A lot of the young men in the town are members of the underground resistance movement. They carry guns are involved in secret schemes and don't have to mop floors. Lucien approaches the local resistance and asks to join but he's turned away because he's too young. He wants desperately if desperately isn't too strong a word for such a taciturn character to break the mold of his life and since the resistance won't have him he joins the local Gestapo. This is crazy we're thinking. Lucien joins the Gestapo almost absentmindedly and then this bright Jewish girl falls for a guy like that. But Louis Malle's point is a complex one. Neither of these people can quite see beyond their immediate circumstances. They're young uninformed naive and the fact is that adolescent sex appeal is a great deal more meaningful to them than all the considerations of history.Louis Malle whose previous film was the bittersweet and lovely Murmur of the Heart 1971 gave himself a difficult assignment this time. His film isn't really about French collaborators but about a particular kind of human being one capable of killing and hurting one incapable of knowing or caring about his real motives one who would be a prime catch for basic training and might make a good soldier and not ask questions.As played by Pierre Blaise a young forester who had never acted before and who died in a road crash a few years later Lucien is a victim trapped in his own provincialism and lack of curiosity. Louis Malle seems almost to be examining the mentality of someone like the war criminals at My Lai  technicians of murder who hardly seemed to be troubled by their actions. That's the achievement of Lacombe Lucien. But what Louis Malle is never quite able to do is to make us care about Lucien who is so morally illiterate that his choices even the good ones seem randomly programmed. Perhaps to show that illiteracy is the point of the film.".

Director Louis Malle masterfully conjures the sense of vulnerability that would result if la milise francaise had commandeered the nicest hotel in town and used it for torture dances executions and sex.I have read that Malle wanted a nonactor to play the lead here and he auditioned 1000 young men before choosing Pierre Blaise as Lucien. The babyfaced teenager is a natural for a part that calls on him to be blithely cold manipulative cruel and absolutely vacuous when it comes to having a soul.I was filled with apprehension through much of this deeply disturbing film. Malle is able to induce trepidation in the viewer as one wonders with dread what Lucien will do next. A scene in which he accosts a boundup torture victim who has been left in a room is practically unbearable to sit through. The depth of Lacombe's depravity is stunning.Yet Lucien has stumbled into his position somewhat accidentally after abandoning a position as a janitor at a nursing home. Lacombe is the type of person who will kill a songbird just because it's there or poach more rabbits than anyone can eat just because he's a good shot.It's little wonder that this cipher of a human being seeks out the milise when local Resistance fighters reject him as too young. His mother who has had to make her own grave compromises because of the war worries about Lucien and who could blame her? When she warns Lucien that he'll eventually be shot for his deeds he shrugs it off telling her he likes it where he is and stuffs a few francs into her purse.In this at least partly basedontruth story Lacombe eventually gets his comeuppance. How tragic according to Wikipedia that Blaise only a year after the movie came out lost his life as well  crashing the Renault he'd bought with wages earned from the film.A truly astonishing work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lacombe Lucien 1974A disturbing and sad movie about surviving the Nazi occupation in France. It's unlike any other film of its type turning from tender to ruthless in a breath and from joyous to ghastly just as fast. And though the Nazis are behind the violence and fear they play a mostly indirect role in the cornering of a small Jewish family in the countryside. This is a tale about French and French about the Resistance against collaborators.And it's told from the point of view of the collaborators a gang of opportunistic thugs who have taken over an old hotel and who terrorize with German supplied documents ordinary citizens. The title character is Lucien an utterly heartless but somehow at times sympathetic boy who gets pulled into the lure of these thugs. But he shows a scary detachment from all feeling even from love at first and certainly from respect for life. There is a hint that he grew to think human life was cheap from his days hunting and killing animals without a flinch as a youth but it could be the movie is showing that he had almost a disorder something that made him unfeeling even for the most ordinary harmless vulnerable things. I think the former is more accurate though because his hunting rabbits and killing a chicken with his hands were probably and still are part of country life where rabbit and chicken were part of the cuisine.But it's people who will eventually be his target and he is not like his older counterparts. He doesn't want the spoils of war not money or finery resisting at first even the suit the Jewish tailor is ordered to make for him. It is here the movie gets to what matters. Lucien is ignorant enough to not quite see why this Jewish man is any different than other men but he catches on when others around him make clear the Jew is only alive and in hiding as their choice. I guess they need a good tailor and they need the man's money the tailor pays when he makes the suits it seems. The complication of a beautiful and very French looking daughter takes some of the expected turns but not completely because this very young man doesn't really know how to behave or how to fall in love.The director Louis Malle is a legend of French cinema and later even of American cinema. He depends on location shooting natural light and naturalistic acting to give every scene a believability that is both beautiful and at times uncanny especially combined with violence to animals. The lead actor Pierre Blase is almost too convincing in his cool and relatively mindless determination. The tailor played by Holger Lwenadler a Swedish actor is a model of patience and continual assessment trying to play the game with the thugs for his survival. His daughter is less fully realized with Aurore Clement playing this charming and innocent girl withheld from normal life by the war. But she does in fact learn to love Lucien in her own way and he responds in his own way.Needless to say the end is tragic and rather perfect. And the whole troubling two hours getting there will leave you moved for sure but also enlightened. The problem of loyalty and survival takes on new light here.".

Some of the commentators wrote that Indeed the film offers no psychological interpretations but is content to simply show what happened in almost Bressonian fashion. I strongly disagree with these opinions right from the opening scene where Lucien stops washing the floors of the hospice where he works to take out a sling shot and shoot down a singing bird an obvious act of cruelty that defines Lucien's character at the very beginning of the film. Lucien is aware of the fact that what he's doing is wrong he slants a sideways look to check if anyone's observing him. This strong statement about Lucien character is no coincidence. Throughout the movie there are other scenes where Lucien's nasty personality comes out his betrayal of the school teacher who refused to let him join the resistance movement his abuse of power his bullying of the Horn family etc. and toward the end of the movie when the German soldier takes the pocket watch Lucien stole Lucien kills him to take it back! Louis Malle taints handsome Lucien's character with the worst of human characteristics he is cruel rude jealous a looter and a thieve a snitch a coward a bully and finally a murderer who shoots someone in the back. Malle could have not have offered better psychological interpretations.".

Throughout the movie there are other scenes where Lucien's nasty personality comes out his betrayal of the school teacher who refused to let him join the resistance movement his abuse of power his bullying of the Horn family etc. and toward the end of the movie when the German soldier takes the pocket watch Lucien stole Lucien kills him to take it back! Louis Malle taints handsome Lucien's character with the worst of human characteristics he is cruel rude jealous a looter and a thieve a snitch a coward a bully and finally a murderer who shoots someone in the back. Malle could have not have offered better psychological interpretations.";

	schema:reviewBody "French director Louis Malle's Lacombe Lucien is an honest film about one young man's journey into accidentally becoming a Nazi collaborator during occupied France in the 1940s. Pierre Blaise was not an experienced actor when selected to portray the titular character. This could have been disastrous in most instances but Malle's instincts pay off. Blaise's boyish looks and blank stare are the perfect mix in pulling off the tabula rasa that is capable of evil if the circumstances are right. Lucien works as an orderly and helps out at a farm where his mother is shacking up with the owner while his father is in a German prison camp. He goes through life doing chores and farm work taking delight in killing animals whether it is for food or just for something to do as in the scene where he kills a song bird out of boredom. This rugged survivalist approach to life is ideal for a life on the farm in the country however the world has changed and after being rejected by his teacher to join the Resistance Lucien seeks to find his place and purpose. By accident he has a tire puncture on his bike and finds himself at the collaborator headquarters after curfew. Lucien is accepted by them and given drinks prestige money and fine clothes especially after inadvertently turning in the school teacher who had previously rejected him. Taking to this newfound prestige Lucien uses his power over a Jewish tailor and his family to court the tailor's beautiful daughter France and holds the fact that he can turn them in anytime he likes to force them to accept him and to woo France. Lucien is such a misfit that he has no concept of family and thinks bullying his way into their lives will make them accept them. In a strange way they begin to grow on each other. The tailor even says No matter how hard I try I find it difficult to dislike you. to him. Even in his very limited way Lucien grows to care about them but can only go so far as he is completely devoid of emotion when consoling France and forces her into sex after she becomes hysterical about her father being sent away. This film conveyed what is the most troubling about this period of history which is that the people who collaborated were regular people who only cared about getting prestige even though it was temporary and it was hollow and devoid of any integrity. They dance drink laugh it up and listen to both the German and English news and split the difference in order to get a semblance of the truth. One aspect of these scenes was the Great Dane. The way the dog is filmed it was as though he is subtly performing. Sitting quietly leading Lucien up the stairway and offering a consoling paw to an upset France. The other intriguing character is that of the hotel maid. A homely looking woman whose face shows a life of hardship reveals upon initiating Lucien into losing his virginity that she is biding her time until the Americans win which is a certainty only to hurl antisemitic insults at France upon seeing her with Lucien. This hatred was not borne of any nazi sympathies but rather her frustration at the fact that France has beauty youth and is treated as an equal for the party and most of all she has Lucien's affections. Despite the maid's strong feelings for Lucien he has no feelings for her or most people. His show of affection is throwing money at them whether it is his concerned mother or the Tailor's family after being hurt by him. Up to a tragic conclusion that is merely mentioned in text on the screen the film is powerful in its' simplicity whether it is in the main character or the seemingly peaceful scenery. The most powerful scenes are between Lucien who is a brute with clout and the tailor who tries to cling to his civilized bourgeoisie ways despite having lost all prestige and status and is very trepiditious around this boy brandishing this power over him and his family that could destroy them so that he can be accepted by them. I am still thinking about this movie 2 days after watching it very chilling indeed especially since the young actor Pierre Blaise would die in a car accident with two companions Time Magazine Sept. 1975 a year after the film's release.".

This boy we follow as he sells out his own school teacher gets his hands on his hope of power the ultimate phallic symbol a gun and tries to woo France the girl whose name sets up an obvious metaphor for the country itself.The metaphor works from Lucien's perspective as the love hate and sometimes sardonic relationship the two have entirely encompasses the disassociation a lot of the French must have had at the time but it doesn't work so much as a roundly developed character from France's perspective. This movie is largely a character study of Lucien but it misses out on the character of his chere the girl who is even hidden from the camera's view when she doesn't have use for Lucien's development. Again as a symbol she works but as a woman she doesn't. I'm sorry but I don't buy anyone falling in love with their onetime rapist.On the most part the movie is an effective and engaging look at something many of the French wanted to simply demonetize and denounce. If it weren't for some strange character development in France and some holes in the editing especially during the end when things seem to just happen with no explanation except that they're supposed to happen it would have been a masterpiece.PolarisDiB".

Admiral Horthy leader of the nationalist far right movement becomes the selfproclaimed regent of Hungary and assumes power as the legal Head of State. Soldiers of the shortlived Hungarian Red Army are now on the run from relentless secret policemen and patrol units of the nationalist Royal Gendarme. If caught exRed Army soldiers are executed without mercy or proper trial. Istvn Cserzi a former soldier of the Red Army has fled to the Great Hungarian Plains and has taken refuge on a farm which is run by two sympathetic women.

	schema:reviewBody "Silence and Cry reminds me more of Jancs's My Way Home where Jancs is still in his mannered interpersonal melee and strife period and yet he injects a modicum of storyline and pathos.This is a miserable film in the sense that it is clear that nothing good is ever going to come of events right from the start and there is also more obvious sadism than in the other Jancs movies I've seen.One thing that I think severely disables Jancs from being as recognised as I believe he should be is that you are really facing difficulties if you haven't understood the context of his films. As in fact to a great extent they are portraying particular episodes in Hungarian history rather than being decontextualised avantgardism. In a more recent film of his The Lord's Lantern in Budapest the Hungarian cultural references are overflowing. So this sort of film will probably never make it out of Hungary unless Hungary become the world's next hyperpower  unlikely.The background to this film is a postWorld War one setting where a shortlived communist government has been overrun by rightwing nationalists aristocratic remnants and secret police. Well the commies are actually the good guys here which may be difficult for a stateside audience to comprehend. As in a country under the ironfisted rules of Hapsburg types has a right to explode out into communism. Anyway one of these freedomfighters is on the run and takes refuge on a farm where he is looked after by two pretty young ladies. I am sure this is most enjoyable for him there is much ultracultured of facerubbing unfortunately I don't know any ladies of this type.When I say the commies are the goodies Jancs is more of a humanist than a commie although I'm sure he was a good revolutionary too. Anyway this was a very difficult film for me to watch as I am really quite autistic and I need emotional cues to understand what is going on. This is why I can't digest Bresson. Also Mikls Jancs really has divested the film here of any melodrama which however I do appreciate to a certain extent especially due to the subject matter. It's a slowburn film whose emotional impact is most overwhelming to me now an hour after watching.We're shown a small population under the control of a military police force the police chief here knows the freedomfighter from many years ago and so is content to let him hide out. However other more hardcore forces are roaming the countryside checking up that people are loyally royalist. In that case Istvn still has to maintain a very low profile.So our idealist has to stay schtum. Which is a problem because the two ladies he is with are poisoning the husband of one of them and his mother. This is very naughty of them.Our idealist has a problem should he report it to the authorities? By what authority do these authorities hold authority? The authorities will be forced to execute him if he reports it because he is a commie and will have to reveal this fact. It is a mindboggling dilemma. And if Mikls had played it for any melodramatic potential it would have been excruciating to watch.One cannot be help but be humanised by Mikls Jancs's films of this period once you see past the stylisation. It has occurred to me on a deep level tonight that not even Jancs's supposedly onenote period is actually onenote.After the style of Round Up Jancso has a photo collage at the beginning of the film of military types in parades and such like this is very humorous to me he plays a silly pathetic childlike rendition of some doubtlessly military theme singlefingered on a piano over the top just to show us what he think of those damned militaryaristo types.".

Men who are proud of the fact that they would kill their own father if they were ordered to do so. In this right wing culture the capacity to obey is a bigger virtue than the capacity to love.Mikls Jancs is dealing with the same themes in this film as in The Red and the White 1967 and The RoundUp 1966. It is shot in the same style and is just as pessimistic. Silence and Cry is however far from as hard hitting as the other two. It is only 73 minutes long but I got restless while watching it. I felt Mikls Jancs was just repeating himself here with nothing new or clever to say about misuse of power. It is only at the end of the film that something of interest starts to happen.It is a little strange that this does not work as well as the other ones since this has more of a plot. Maybe the problem is that the plot is revealed too late. For most of the time we don't know what is happening and we don't get these wonderful atmosphere scenes as in The RoundUp and The Red and the White.

I saw the version dubbed into English and perhaps that's the only fault of the movie.  I never fully got a grasp of who each character was what their name was as well as the purpose for their actions.  Introductions to the characters are never properly given and soon the plot twists so much you don't know who's who who's Chinese who's Japanese who's working for which mob boss and who's actually a good guy.  This might be part of the film's mystique or just really bad English dubbing.  In any event I didn't really care.   The martial arts fight scenes are plentiful in this film and they are brilliantly done.  The actors themselves are very skilled in the martial arts and the director really enjoys playing with slow motion and rotating camera angles.   The effect is absolute brilliance a truly new art form made up of technical merit and intelligence in both filmmaking and martial arts skill.  This movie has been called a comedy.  It's not so much a comedy as it is a comedy of errors.  I liken it to Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' as both involve some frantically hysterical antics that happen when average Joes get mixed up in the seedy mob underworld. Both films move at a mile a minute as well.  Have I mentioned this film moves fast yet? The artfully done martial arts more than makes up for any confusion caused by the speed of the plot and the poor English dubbing.

Obviously basing himself on John Woo note the amount of dove shots and use of slow motions and trying out some 'timelapse' shots it really brings out some life into the film. Tony Leung and Ekin Cheng actually play well off each other for the cantonese audience it is at times obvious when the cast adlib which was left untranslated and simplified on the English translation. The film is very simple and the twists get a bit overdone with one after another but overall it did turn out quite good. Personally I enjoyed the film with it's unique blend of Japanese and Chinese acting and a comedic score it is a fun film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jingle Ma long one of Hong Kong's best cinematographers shows here that he can create and direct an amazing film when given greater control. Tokyo Raiders is a quintessential HK fusion film containing plenty of traditional HK elements but making superb use of Japanese and Western elements as well.  The soundtrack alone makes it stand out from other HK films of the postNew Wave era but Tokyo Raiders adds great humor irony editing photography and a broad spectrum of choreography and action a nod to Jackie Chanfilm regular bit actor Allen Chiuwai Sit as action choreographer here.The main cast comes off very well playing characters that veer from serious or in some cases at least nearserious to absurd  as the story does the same.  Tokyo Raiders is really an actioncomedy and strong in both categories and the cast is a delight.I usually really hate fancy editing and camerawork for action scenes.  If the action is any good it should be presented cleanly and clearly so the audience can see it.  Anyone can fake action albeit poorly in most cases by messing with the film.  That's not impressive.  If you have a cast capable of real action and go to the trouble of choreographing real action then you're only hurting the film by chopping it up with closeups slow motion rapid cuts and the like.But in Tokyo Raiders Jingle Ma shows that he has the very rare talent of actually enhancing action sequences through careful use of effects. Personally even if the film weren't so allaround enjoyable I think this would make it worth seeing all by itself.  Most other action directors should take notes.It's true that many viewers may find the thread of the plot a little hard to follow at times but this isn't the kind of movie where you have to follow everything to enjoy it.  Few HK action films are and it's a good thing too.  And it's true that many viewers will wish that Tony Leung's character's assistants had more screen time.  Well no film is truly perfect but Tokyo Raiders is definitely worth a shot if you like Asian action films and comedies at all.Just be sure if you don't speak Mandarin and Japanese to get a subtitled not dubbed copy and not pannedandscanned edited to fit a TV screen if you can help it.  As with most foreign films it makes a world of difference.".

Being that this is part of the new wave of Hong Kong action movies I expected bad choreography well at least not up to the standards of the 1980s through mid90s films and a lot of pretty boys who couldn't fight. Well Ekin Cheng is in it although he does better than I thought he would. The plot is some complicated mishmash involving a bride left at the altar a kung fu interior decorator and a Japanese p.i. They get involved in a search for the man who left the girl at the altar. A lot of twists and fight scenes ensue. This movie is actually quite a bit of fun. There's a whole lot of schwing women around. Kelly Chen and Tony Leung's women are real eye candy. There's some comedy here and there. The action is served up in spades. While Tony Leung and Ekin Cheng aren't actual martial artists Alan Sit choreographs the scenes well with a little bit of wires and fancy camerawork and they're all entertaining. Imagine a Jackie Chan fight without Jackie Chan fighting in them. The pace is incredibly fast which is always a good thing. Overall just a lot of fun.".

They've also failed to cash in on the talent of Japanese actors and couldn't make a good story around them. Hiroshi Abe should have been the lead role on the Japanese side and should have been pit against Tony Lueng Chiu Wai.

The stars like Ekin Cheng and Tony Leung aren't even martial artists so isn't it then obvious that you'll get disappointed? As far if I'm concerned the fight scenes were quite good it did look like that they can fight.But anyway the movie is actually quite nice. Overall it's quite fastspaced and the jokes are thoughtfully made. I reckon that most people would not understand the jokes since they simply can not understand the original language spoken in this movie.

The stars like Ekin Cheng and Tony Leung aren't even martial artists so isn't it then obvious that you'll get disappointed? As far if I'm concerned the fight scenes were quite good it did look like that they can fight.But anyway the movie is actually quite nice. Overall it's quite fastspaced and the jokes are thoughtfully made. I reckon that most people would not understand the jokes since they simply can not understand the original language spoken in this movie. And this is exactly why I only would recommend this movie for the ones who can speak the original language.";

And like so many others it only succeeds in proving that Hong Kong can't make American movies. It just doesn't work and it never will. Hollywoodization is not the way to save the Hong Kong movie industry. Korea is king of Asian Hollywood and the way things are going Korea may be king of Asian cinema in a few years and even a great cast like this can't change that.And let me just state for the record that the cast is pretty good. Obviously there are a lot of pretty faces but most of the actors do a good job acting as well and you simply can't go wrong with Tony Leung. Tru Nakamura is also one of my personal favourites but unfortunately his role in Tokyo Raiders is very small.That said however just about everything else is subpar. For starters the plot makes little sense. Why would the CIA want to devalue the Japanese yen? Well the movie certainly offers no answer it only asks you to accept that they do for one reason or another. And why would any newspaper write about the love affair of a yakuza oyabun's girlfriend? Relax I'm not giving away much here. In fact part of the problem is that there's actually very little to give away. Nothing really happens except for a broken heart and a few not too spectacular fights...The music is another story. I won't get into too much detail but I find the soundtrack choices a bit odd. The onscreen action and the music just don't fit each other. Basically Tokyo Raiders is a fairly mediocre affair. While I wouldn't say it's a total waste there are certainly better movies you could see.".

The plot then starts to build and suffice to say that it is twisty and complex with secret identities spies and romance all merging together  it sounds like it could be fun but the film has no idea how to deliver it and simply cannot make the plot work. It never gets solved and it stopped me getting involved in the film because it was just so messy and convoluted. The action has its moments but I was surprised by just how dated it felt. The scene on the car transporter was good and the rest was fun but the dated music was rubbish and Ma's use of slowmotion just made it look blurred. Despite being OK the action is not enough to make up for the rest of the film.The cast are good on paper and do try to get the sense of fun into it but they just can't do it. Leung is a good actor and I hoped he would be able to deliver the goods but it is more about him getting the money to allow him to do proper acting in other films. He is quite fun but it hardly stretches him. Cheng is a bit better with a roguish sort of character that is a bit more fun and he handles the action well. Chen is unforgivable stiff and she doesn't work no matter what the film asks her to do other than just look pretty  although alongside cuties like End and the other Lin girls that is hard ask. The direction is roundly misjudged and only made better by the impressive use of locations throughout well apart from Las Vegas.Overall it is a very basic film that has barely enough fun and action to be worth watching. I quite enjoyed some parts of it but mostly it is dated and too obvious. How it got a sequel made I'm not sure because this just didn't cut it for me and should have been much better than it was.".

The kung fu here is sleek and stylised with slowmotion moves and impeccable choreography unfortunately as this is a film with a young cast and is likely aimed at teenagers it isn't very violent. The characters are also invariably annoying newcomer Ekin Cheng is praised in the accompanying documentary for his martial arts skills but they aren't really apparent here. Old pro Tony Leung steals his scenes as the slick PI with a ton of hidden devices especially in the 'Inspector Gadget' style opening battle whilst Kelly Chan just looks very attractive as do the rest of the young female cast members.

Watching their young child growing up he starts show unnerving signs which the parents slowly start picking up on and also bizarre tragedies start occurring. This leads Robert on a whirlwind investigation that all points to his son being the AntiChrist.Right off the heals of 'The Exorcist' successful stint with moviegoers comes another one of those endless 70s religious themed horror flicks involving Satanism. 'The Omen' I'd definitely say is one of the better horror films in the shadow of The Exorcist' but I'll even go to say its an vast improvement over it's influencer. That might be a surprise for some but I found this film superior as it was more entertaining fascinating and truly creepy in its context and shocks. Everything about it has a knack for falling into place. From the impending doom that's achieved by its coldly layered atmosphere to a premise that teases the viewer on how it's all going to play out. I won't deny that it seems silly enough when you pay close attention to it all but with such conviction in the performances and that off confident direction these factors makes sure that it doesn't slip overboard into cheesy daftness. Another stroke of brilliance would be Jerry Goldsmith's memorably nervewrecking score with those explosive chants scattered throughout.On a grand scale the film was efficiently catered with well established cinematography and polished setpieces that had penetrating might which director Richard Donner handled with precise skill. Even when there wasn't much happening he knew how to keep things compellingly tight with good pacing and impressible imagery. Though when it came to the essential thrills he caps off some remotely tense dogs' attack and macabre moments infamous decapitation that display bite and flair. The climax is great and the ending is a fitting imprint too. The plot is filled with shocking revelations interesting characters and it emits a glorious amount of excitement and dread from it mysterious outset.The performances are that of top quality by a stellar cast. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are convincingly excellent as Mr and Mrs Thorn. David Warner turns in a marvellous performance as the photographer Keith Jennings. Then Billie Whitelaw is genuinely creepy as Damien's nanny Mrs. Baylock. Patrick Troughton is superb as the withering Father Brennan. But my applause goes to Harvey Stephens' who's the epitome of evil well he definitely looked the part and had a memorizing awe as Damien. Although Peck deserves more credit really as he brought such devotion to his character that we honestly feel the pain and confusion that hits home.One of the true benchmarks of horror along the same lines of 'The Exorcist' but for me it beats that film all ends up. Expect a devilishly good time!".

	schema:reviewBody "Always avoid people born on the 6th June  especially if they are called Damien and bizarre violent accidents seem to happen to those around them! Since this film has recently been remade I thought it would be a good time to look back at the original  a horror classic!In 1973 'The Exorcist' broke all boundaries previously horror movies had only concentrated on the dark side there were hardly any references to main stream religions. The basic rule was if the Devil was in it God wasn't. Even Rosemary's Baby released five years before has hardly any reference to God or a more heavenly supreme being. The reaction that followed the release of The Exorcist was that the public loved it but the censors didn't and it was banned in the UK for twenty five years. The Exorcist may have fallen foul of the censors but it opened the flood gates for this sort of movie and three years later The Omen was released on 06061976.What do you think a good horror movie should have? Is it a superb cast a brilliant score a battle of good versus evil artfully portrayed on screen or maybe a sinister and ambiguous open ending? No matter which of these sways your opinion 'The Omen' has all these and much much more!!!Firstly let's look at the cast Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are the leads these two names are nothing short of Hollywood elite. Lee Remick is perfect as the mother who as the movie progresses realises there is something very wrong with her child. I'm not sure what tipped her off  was it the baboons attacking her car or her son's feral reaction at the thought of entering a church? Gregory Peck again is perfectly cast as no one does noble and principled like Mr Peck. However it is not only the leads that are terrific the supporting cast includes David Warner and Tommy Duggan who both put in notable performances but it is Billie Whitelaw that eclipses them all as Damien's overly polite yet sinister nanny. The score of a horror movie is very important it has to chill to the bone and help create and maintain a feeling of an ever present danger. Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack is probably one of the best scores ever written for a horror movie. It is perfect for The Omen gloomy disturbing chilling music interlaced with what sounds like religious choirs portending the end of the world. It really is that good and if you don't believe me consider the fact that it won Jerry Goldsmith an Oscar the following year.By this stage I know that most of you who were considering going to see the new Omen film at the cinema are now thinking to yourselves 'maybe I will rent the old one instead!' but for the few that are still on the fence here are a few other points to convince you. The 1976 version had a great plot a child adopted into the corridors of power whose destiny is to destroy the world this is a simple and perhaps unoriginal premise however David Seltzer quotes Revelations at every turn and comes up with very original ideas to kill people off. Today we are used to seeing a lot of blood and gore when people get killed in this genre but this is one thing that the omen lacks. Gore is preempted by well choreographed violent outbursts each one being more frightening and compelling than the last from a priest being impaled by a church spire to a reporter being decapitated by a pane of glass. These events all build to the foreboding finale. In the last scene we see a little boy holding the hand of the President of the United States turning around and smiling at his father's funeral. What greater ending could there be!?!The Omen stands out in this genre and has stood up to the test of time. Today horror movies are packed with the latest teenage idols and gratuitous violence has replaced good plots and imaginative thinking. There are exceptions to this of course Dog Soldiers The Ring etc. The Omen combines a great cast a great score and brilliant storytelling without a teenage idol in sight.".

	onyx:emotionText "Always avoid people born on the 6th June  especially if they are called Damien and bizarre violent accidents seem to happen to those around them! Since this film has recently been remade I thought it would be a good time to look back at the original  a horror classic!In 1973 'The Exorcist' broke all boundaries previously horror movies had only concentrated on the dark side there were hardly any references to main stream religions. The basic rule was if the Devil was in it God wasn't. Even Rosemary's Baby released five years before has hardly any reference to God or a more heavenly supreme being. The reaction that followed the release of The Exorcist was that the public loved it but the censors didn't and it was banned in the UK for twenty five years. The Exorcist may have fallen foul of the censors but it opened the flood gates for this sort of movie and three years later The Omen was released on 06061976.What do you think a good horror movie should have? Is it a superb cast a brilliant score a battle of good versus evil artfully portrayed on screen or maybe a sinister and ambiguous open ending? No matter which of these sways your opinion 'The Omen' has all these and much much more!!!Firstly let's look at the cast Lee Remick and Gregory Peck are the leads these two names are nothing short of Hollywood elite. Lee Remick is perfect as the mother who as the movie progresses realises there is something very wrong with her child. I'm not sure what tipped her off  was it the baboons attacking her car or her son's feral reaction at the thought of entering a church? Gregory Peck again is perfectly cast as no one does noble and principled like Mr Peck. However it is not only the leads that are terrific the supporting cast includes David Warner and Tommy Duggan who both put in notable performances but it is Billie Whitelaw that eclipses them all as Damien's overly polite yet sinister nanny.

Everything about the movie contributes to feel of the movie. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score the great acting the cinematography and the scary as hell ending.It's the 6th hour on the 6th day of the 6th month. Robert Thorn Gregory Peck has just found out his newborn son is dead. He can't let his wife Katherine Lee Remick know though since it would devastate her. But when a priest offers him another newborn whose mother died all problems are solved they name him Damien.....The Omen is one of my favourite horror films. When I first saw it it scared the living hell out of me. The score done by Jerry Goldsmith is now one of the most famous horror movie scores. It sets the mood and sends a chill up your spine. The acting is outstanding especially Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are as usual fantastic. Billie Whitelaw is pretty much flawless as the evil nanny and Harvey Stephens although he doesn't say much is very good as little Damien.The last thing that makes the movie scary are some of the most bizarre deaths. The most known of them is a decapitation which is one of the scariest deaths in horror history.55.".

It was almost 30 years later when I finally saw it for the second time and I thoroughly enjoyed it again although it wasn't terrifying to me anymore. The DVD version is excellent because it presents the movie in the 2.35 widescreen mode which is essential to the viewing of this film if you are a fan of cinematography. A VHS formattedtoTV picture would lose too much of the great camerawork done in this film. I was amazed how beautifully filmed this movie is so if you love this film and don't have the DVD please consider getting it.The story was a bit slower than I remembered it back in '76 but still provides enough action and plenty of chills. This time around I found the nanny Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock to be more scary than the devilkid! I didn't even remember her from 30 years ago but she got my attention on the DVD. It was a very effective job of acting by that woman.In the meantime I always enjoy looking at Lee Remick's gorgeous face with her magnetic eyes and Gregory Peck is usually rocksolid in roles he plays. This is no exception.Although I question some of the supposed quotes from the Book Of Revelation from the Bible there is no s in Revelation the screenwriters showing their biblical ignorance. the movie is still a good witness to people who don't believe in Satan. They might after viewing this movie. This is one of the classics of the '70s and often underrated. The sequels to this were simply not memorable and not worth your time. I don't know about the re make that just came out but it would be tough to top this film. I think I'll stick with this one and I won't wait another 30 years to see it again. Maybe tonight!!".

American Ambassador Gregory Peck has come up with an idea after his newborn son dies at birth he decides to pass another child off to wife Lee Remick as their own. Life in England seems grand for a few years but as the child becomes a toddler in the form of the young Harvey Stephens strange murders start to occur. The child is really the son of Satan born of a goat and his only goal is to grow up and take over the world for his unearthly father. As the truth slowly unfolds the film twists into disturbing murders and highly unholy situations. Not a film for the faint of heart and certainly not a perfect film but still one of the stronger films of the usually lukewarm genre. 4 stars out of 5.".

It definitely wipes the floor with recent pretenders like 'Lost Souls' and 'End Of Days'.One of the reasons it still works is that the actors take the sometimes silly material so seriously. And when you have actors of the calibre of Gregory Peck and David Warner it certainly helps. Peck is utterly convincing as the Ambassador who doesn't want to believe the shocking facts staring him in the face and Warner who often found himself in second rate bgrade rubbish obviously relished his role as the inquisitive reporter who helps convince Peck that things are not as normal as they seem. Along with Peckinpah's 'Cross Of Iron' one of his best roles. Lee Remick is strong as Damien's worried mother Billie Whitelaw chilling as the mysterious governess and Patrick Troughton 'Dr Who' 2 is very good as a dying priest who knows the truth about the Thorn's son.Forget the sequels 'The Omen' is classic Satanic schlock and still has more than a few scares left in it.

	schema:reviewBody "Following the heels of the success of The Exorcist The Omen tells the story of the son of Satan being born from a mysterious pregnancy and given to a U.S. ambassador and his wife in Italy. The couple raise the young child but things begin to happen to the couple as the boy matures. A governess hangs herself. The child acts wildly when brought near a Church. A spooky governess appears from nowhere to take care of the child. A black evil dog takes up residence at the child's bedroom. To complicate matters a priest gets in touch with the father and tells him to beware his son and that he is the spawn of evil. The Omen works very well due to several factors. The script is generally wellwritten. The story is very implausable in some places but it works on the whole. The use of powerhouse stars like Gregory Peck and Lee Remick in the leads help to give the film the royal treatment making sure no one mistakes the budget level of ability and time put into this production. Peck is very good in his role as a man convincedfinally of horrifying news. The rest of the cast does equally well with some fine performances by Billie Whitelaw as the crazed manical governess Patrick Troughton as the consciencetorn priest David Warner as a helpful photographer and Harvey Stephens as the young sweetyet evil looking Damien. Most of the film's success can be attributed to director Richard Donner. Donner keeps the pacing of the film tight uses some firstrate pan shots and creates a mood and suspense that build climatically throughout the film. Some of the scenes that are most memorable include Damien on a tricycle Peck and Warner in a cemetery and most famous of all is the priest's demise. A wonderfully shot sequence. The music in the film is a great asset to the overall mood. A very good film....not nearly as gory or shocking as The Exorcist but still as powerful in its own right for its seemingly somewhat realistic adaptation of scripture.".

It's more chilling and freaky and subtle. There isn't any fake pea soup here either. Which isn't to say that The Exorcist isn't any good  but it hasn't fared as well over the years.The Omen is just really good. It was released the same year as Exorcist if I'm not mistaken and Gregory Peck gives a fine performance. The part where a character's head is lopped off and rolls across a street in slowmotion and then director Richard Donner cuts to a whole new sequence is really chilling and bizarre.It's that sort of eerie unexplained stuff that makes this in my opinion superior to a lot of the other stuff out there  i.e. many other trashy supernatural flicks that don't hold anything against this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie appears in the book 50 Worst Movies Of All Time alongside such fare as ROBOT MONSTER . This is completely undeserved because i rate THE OMEN as one of the best horror movies from the 1970s  if not all time . The book in question makes a big deal of how young Damien's parents experience some ghastly going ons without realising something is seriously wrong  but this is churlish since the audience  like in most horror movies  are one step in front of the protagonists  we instantly know what's going on even if the characters on screen don't and this is what makes the narrative so suspenseful  we're waiting for Ambassador Robert Thorn to put two and two together . It should also be pointed out that these types of tradgedies do happen in life and there's a rational explanation with no supernatural causes involvedComparisons with both THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST will be made but this is by much the better film I think . Both films deal with satanic powers and both are very dead pan but unlike THE EXORCIST the serious tone of this movie doesn't go against it  THE EXORCIST goes out of its way to shock the audience while THE OMEN keeps its discipline and is all the better for it . Richard Donner brings shock moments where it's needed like the revelation of the priest after the fire  the scene in the cemetery and the lorry accident at Megiddo and unlike the shock scenes in THE EXORCIST they're never unintentionally funny . Giving roles to well known Brit character actors like Patrick Troughton  Billie Whitelaw  Leo McKern and David Warner also helps the movie a lot The only real criticism I have is that it's not as good as I originally remembered after seeing it for the first time  but that's a problem with a great number of movies I've seen  or that the biblical city of Megiddo is nowhere near the location described in the screenplay  It is in fact a few short miles west of the border of the West Bank on the route to Jenin  but that won't matter to 99.9 of the rest of the audience . If I ever write a book called 50 Best Horror Movies Of All Time THE OMEN will definitely feature in it".

	schema:reviewBody "The date is June 6th. The city is Rome. Ambassador Robert Thorn's wife Katherine has just given birth to a stillborn son. Rather than devastate her with the news Robert agrees to take in another baby born on the same night in the same hospital and whose mother died giving him birth. No one but Robert and the hospital priest will ever know that the baby isn't theirs. Six years later terrible events begin to occur and all of them seem to be centered around the Thorn's son Damien. A nanny hangs herself at a birthday party a grim priest tells Robert that he knows who the boy's mother really is and a news reporter named Jennings is finding alarming omens in the photographs he takes omens which foretell a violent death for anyone who gets too close to the truth. When Katherine suffers a suspicious miscarriage Thorn and Jennings head for Rome to find out if it's true is Damien the AntiChrist son of Satan? And if he is will Robert be able to destroy him?This movie followed in the wake of The Exorcist and was immensely popular. Movies about apocalyptic disasters and demonic children were hot box office commodities in the 70s and The Omen had both topics covered. However The Omen was also an intelligently scripted beautifully filmed and very suspenseful thriller to boot. It wasn't just a rip off of The Exorcist it had its own story to tell one taken from the Book Of Revelation the most grim and frightening book in the Bible.The characters played by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick may be the beautiful people  rich powerful and privileged  but they are still real people and quite accessible. Kathy is a strong but emotionally fragile woman who seeks help from a psychiatrist. Robert will do anything to protect her from heartbreak and pain. It is their devotion to each other that makes this film so tense as we watch their lives unravel. Robert thought that by taking Damien in he would simultaneously save his wife from grief and give an orphan a home but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions and in this case that road is very real. David Warner as Jennings and Patrick Troughton as the cursed Father Brennan also win our sympathy as the illfated men who try their best to help Robert. Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Blaylock is evil personified. We like her even though she's Satan's minion  it's her wicked secretive smile and the fact that she'll do anything to protect Damien. Even Damien himself has our sympathy even though little kids in tiny little suits are just really upsettingly scary. It's not Damien's fault that he is what he is  he didn't ask for this dubious honor after all  and when he begs Robert not to kill him at film's end it's hard not to feel sorry for both of them. This is a great film filled with vicious Rottweilers nasty deaths powerful music and great performances by the entire cast. Should not be missed by film buffs in general and horror fans in particular.".

Good old Christian doctrine comes into play here as we've got the doubting at first Peck who writes off Damien's behaviour as that of a normal fiveyearold. As the proud father of my own little Damien I have spent many an hour checking my kid's scalp for three sixes especially after he's tried to put our budgie in a blender or destroyed a piece of furniture but at least I haven't had a priest turning up at my door pleading for me to kill my own child. Also I'm sure that when our babysitter killed herself it was just due to the brimstone tinged contents of our kid's nappy rather than being compelled to swing from a rope by a persuasive dog. The first Omen film is rather good. It's filled with dread and there's some pretty good set pieces in there plus when you've got decent actors like Peck and Warner playing it pretty straight that helps things too. It's still worth a watch after all these years but sad to say any of the sequels don't really stand up to the original.".

Gregory pecks acting was great and damn always had a creepy little grin on his face that you could tell was evil. the last scene was one of the best i would say this is a must see for any horror film enthusiast. This is not your average horror film it has to do with real life things and was a movie that wouldn't just scare you right away it would get into your head. if i had to say this would be in my top three movies I've ever seen. i have not yet seen the new movie but i doubt that it will be even comparable to what this movie accomplished.".

	schema:reviewBody "And I thought Rosemary's Baby my personal favourite is the most scary movie on the God's rival Satan's child entry into the world of ours. I was proved wrong when I saw The Omen. The Omen takes the idea of Rosemary's Baby forward and tells you the story of a family who finds that their son can be the son of Satan. The atmosphere is enhanced by haunting back ground score water tight screenplay sincere acting taught direction and a lot of scary moments making this horror experience a masterpiece. There are many scenes that stand out like a group of Baboons attacking the car carrying Satan's son father and the photographer finding the dead mother of Satan's son father reciting a verse from bible after finding the news of death of his beloved the killing of photographer and many more. It might be hard to go and re watch the movie because of its genuine scare moments but it stands at very top in my list of best horrors because as they say horror lies in knowing something bad is about to happen. All horror lovers don't miss it and all people who get scared easily please stay away from it!!".

	schema:headline " Sublime Occult Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "The Omen of 1976 is a true classic of occult Horror that is capable of mesmerizing and giving the viewer the creeps even after repeated viewings. Richard Donner's film was doubtlessly inspired by William Friedkin's earlier classic The Exorcist and along with Friedkin's film one of the absolute mustsees involving satanic kids. This simply is a film that works perfectly on all levels The most intriguing Horror topic is illustrated with a spinechilling and fascinating premise and executed brilliantly on all levels. The film is an incredibly atmospheric persistently suspenseful and genuinely creepy Horror Thriller and an intelligent Drama at the same time. The fascinating story is brought to screen with greatness in all aspects be it the ingenious settings and cinematography the constantly high suspenselevel the great acting or the tense atmosphere which is underlined by a simply unforgettable score.Robert Thorn Gregory Peck is the American Ambassador in Rome. When his unconscious wife Catherine Lee Remick gives birth to a stillborn baby boy Thorn can't bring himself to tell her. At the suggestion of a priest he exchanges his dead son with another newborn boy whose mother has died in childbirth making his wife believe the healthy boy is hers. Both his real son who died and the the other boy whom he accepts as his son were born under a bad Omen it is the sixth hour of the sixth day of the sixth month the year is 1966. The couple name the boy Damien... Five years later the Thorns have moved to London where Robert has become the U.S. Ambassador to England. With Damien's fifth birthday party mysterious things begin to happen around the boy...The Omen is one of several 'demonic child' films from the 70s but in my humble opinion it is definitely one of the best ones. Personally I would even say it surpasses both previous films that it is most often compared to Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby 1968 and Willaim Friedkin's The Exorcist 1973. These two films are both classics no doubt but while Rosemary's Baby has dated a bit and also has its lengths and the Exorcist has many unforgettably creepy moments but sometimes lacks cohesion The Omen is incredibly suspenseful from the beginning to the end and its coherent and extremely creepy script is brought to screen in a brilliant manner in all parts of the film forming a stunningly uncanny and tense wholesome. The film has an intensely creepy atmosphere and a constantly gloomy feeling of doom from the beginning. The story simply is very creepy as such and director Donner brings it to screen in a manner that is truly magnificent. The photography choreography and settings and maybe most memorably the brilliant spinechilling score  this film's atmosphere is rich in all aspects. At the same time The Omen is also a compelling and highly intelligent film with complex characters. The acting is superb. Gregory Peck's reputation as one of the greatest actors ever in cinema is no coincidence and he is once again brilliant here. Great performances also come from the other cast members such as Lee Remick who plays the wife David Warner or Patrick Troughton who plays a great little role and whom fellow Horror fans will also know for his roles in Hammer's films such as Scars of Dracula. Utmost praise has to be given to thensixyearold Harvey Stephens who once again proves that children can be the creepiest of all Horror creatures. His performance is scary and very powerful one of the truly memorable childperformances in Horror cinema. The film mainly builds up suspense through plot and atmosphere and isn't very actionpacked. Yet it includes several highly memorable disturbing and gory moments. The ingenious decapitation sequence is only one of them. The Omen is an absolute mustsee for all Horrorfans and film lovers in general. A remake was done in 2006 but I will probably never watch it recent Horror remakes tend to make me angry. This original is a spinechilling occult masterpiece that must not be missed... by anyone!".

A sexy thriller soaking in a sticky tingly atmosphere. I've seen the English and the original French version. Go for the French the adaptation of the dialogue in English is silly and pretentious. Although I don't like the idea of remakes this is one lends itself beautifully for a juicy rehash. I have a brilliant idea about how to update it not to mention how to cast it and as far as a director is concerned I know the perfect one. I of course don't intend to reveal a thing here you may steal the idea and strike a deal with Miramax.".

So here we go Delon needs to hide and these 2 women accept to hide him from police in their beautiful house  but what u see is not what is real like Hitchcock used to do to fool his audience and soon you'll learn as the poor delon learns that these charming ladies are worse than the police... Women here are pretty modern and men are toys for them toys u can tear apart toys u can leave in a room til u need them men slaves to their desire and will. And what was at the beginning just a hide and seek with the police become a nightmare and a jail for a man totally under control of 2 women  like women had been toys for men for centuries... And this is the modern part of the movie the raising power of women in the world and the unability for men to take back the control of their lives. Delon is handsome as the devil but a devil ruined by women with no escape and what was only a runaway movie becomes a nightmare movie  watch it til the end ! Without hesitation  910".

A fun movie full of colorful characters insane dialog and some of the hippest music courtesy of Lalo Schifrin. Clment's direction is stellar and the cinematography by Henri Deca is first rate. It helps that the film is shot in the south of France. Delon has a lot of chemistry with both Fonda and Albright. This is probably Fonda's best acting up to this point and it's heartening to see the underutilized Albright given such a substantial role. She's a twisted mix of Grace Kelly  Mrs. Danvers.

However despite beating the snot out of the guy he's able to escape and desperately looks for a place to hide. He wanders into the lives of two ladies Jane Fonda and Lola Albright and they help him hide and give him a job as a chauffeur. This is a bit strange and it's all chalked up to the ladies being full of love of the poor and destitute. However through the course of the film Delon picks up on some clues that PERHAPS these women aren't such wonderful benefactorsand he is being kept their for nefarious reasons. However if he leaves the killers will find him and dispatch him. What's next?! In many ways this film is very reminiscent of a later Delon film Diaboliquement Vtre. Both have wonderful endings and both involve Delon being held in a mansion due to ulterior motives. So in a way this later film is a bit derivativebut still good. Both however feature AMAZING endingsdeliciously twisted and very satisfying.By the way one of the killers is played by Sorrel Bookethe guy who later played 'Boss Hogg' on The Dukes of Hazard. Also the DVD case really makes Joy House look like a terrifically sexy film. It has its moments but really is a suspense film not a film with a lot of skin.".

But I quickly found out that it was a deadserious Thriller.Perhaps I was in the wrong frame of mind when I sat down to watch this picture but whether a Comedy or a Thriller I thought Joy House stank in the worst possible way imaginable.Set in the ritzy district of the French Riviera and directed by French filmmaker Rene Clement I found Joy House to be a piece of emptyheaded fluff that might have benefited some had it been filmed in colour.Joy House stars shallow French actor and allround prettyboy Alain Delon who without his looks couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag even if his life depended on it.This film's cast also included 2 bigname American actresses Jane Fonda and Lola Albright. At first I thought these women's characters were a lesbian couple but that assumption soon proved to be an error.Since this was a French production with English subtitles both Fonda and Albright's voices were dubbed badly and this annoyance of course proved to be yet another strike against this dimwitted picture that steadily began to grate on my nerves bigtime.From my perspective Fonda and Albright's characters were truly sickening. These 2 bitterly jealous women living under the same roof were both vying for the attentions of the same man Delon and as a result they came across as being nothing but ruthless calculating sluts.Joy House's story has smalltime conmangigolo Marc Delon on the run from a group of bungling hit men. Marc takes refuge in the posh mansion of a wealthy widow Albright who lives there with her cousin Fonda.It's from this point when Marc encounters these 2 women that Joy House's already faltering story completely falls to pieces and lost my overall interest altogether.".

As someone who has lived in a football obsessed city surrounded by football casuals and witnessed running street battles i thought the fight scenes were very well done. if your unlucky enough to see this type of thing in real life then you will realise just how scary they can be. Shocked me as much as The Firm Gary Oldman one did although with The Firm i felt slightly for the characters peer pressure vulnerabilities etc but with this film i had no sympathy whats so ever for the players in this story. Basically their a bunch of nutters that got what they deserve  Remember this is based on an true account of the time and is severely brutal with savage characters and moments.

The 80s90s period detail is captured very well with haircuts fashions and soundtrack and the violence doesn't let up. I was half expecting some subGuy Ritchie cringeworthy thing but it's not like that at all. The plot focus does shift from Leach to his cohorts in the film's latter half which some viewers seem to have a problem with but not I. ROTF barrels along and seems shorter than its neartwo hour running time. Plenty of brutality nudity swearing and drug abuse. Sweet!".

	schema:headline " From Upton Park to Rettendon";
	schema:reviewBody "Rise of the Footsoldier is directed by Julian Gilbey who also cowrites the screenplay with Mike Hawk. It stars Ricci Harnett Kierston Wareing Craig Fairbrass Roland Manookian Terry Stone and Frank Harper. Plot follows the story of one Carlton Leech sic how he rose from being a football terrace hooligan to one of Essex's top clubland gangsters and his involvement in the truelife murder of three drug Barron's in Rettendon Essex in 1995.I remember writing back in 1994 that there is a market for film's involving football hooligans. This was after the release of a film called I.D. the first and still the best film to put the itchy subject on the big screen. Four years later Guy Ritchie would make British gangsters hip and since then a number of like minded British film's about hooligans thugs convicts and underworld crims have made their merry way to the screen. Some great Lock Stock Snatch Sexy Beast Football Factory Layer Cake. Some mediocre Cass Revolver Bronson. And some plain bad Essex Boys Bonded by Blood The Business. What we do know is that whatever the quality people want to see them granted some of the viewers might actually be thugs or criminals themselves getting off on another slice of blood marinated pie but fact remains that the market remains the same a number of film watchers enjoy their trips down the dark side of Britain.But here's the question where do we stop? After Cass Bronson and now Rise of the Footsoldier are we to assume that any hard man geezer can get a film made about him? Lets face it we are not talking about Peter Sutcliffe or Dennis Nielson here. You sense that director Julian Gilbey realised this and made a film with two dovetailing stories one about a hard man working his way thru the ranks of the underworld the other about what might have led to three drug Barron big boys getting blasted to shotgun death one night in a dark country lane. Smart move it gives his film an edge over other recent one dimensional film's of its ilk.The top British film magazines have been savage on Rise of the Footsoldier their critics clearly growing tired of having to sit thru yet another British thug movie. Yet although it clearly isn't the British Goodfella's as one over keen DVD advertising executive called it it's still a brutal and savage piece of film making aimed at a particular audience who it has to be said will find tremendous amounts of things to enjoy about it. In many ways it's an ambitious attempt by Gilbey threading the two stories together is a good move and largely it works tho fans of football hooliganism film's should note that this only fills the first ten minutes of the film. He's also tries to make his characters less psychotic than their crimes suggest they are that doesn't work but it's top marks for trying. Thus I disagree with those who have poured scorn on it as a piece of thug porn a film glorifying the bad seed that festers in society. Gilbey set out to shock clearly the subject matter calls for it but he at least told a good story in the process and didn't shirk the big moments either.Where it sits in the pantheon of Brit thug movies is to my mind quite high because I found it riveting nasty and often uneasy to sit thru. That has to be job done no? Cast are mostly OK with some of them familiar faces from other previous ne'er do well portrayals and the snapshot of the times is bright and soundtracked accordingly. It's not a film I could watch with my mother or even my missus but the makers wasn't making that sort of film anyway. An acquired taste for sure but still a tasty treat for those so inclined to the themes cooking in the pot. 810".

What we do know is that whatever the quality people want to see them granted some of the viewers might actually be thugs or criminals themselves getting off on another slice of blood marinated pie but fact remains that the market remains the same a number of film watchers enjoy their trips down the dark side of Britain.But here's the question where do we stop? After Cass Bronson and now Rise of the Footsoldier are we to assume that any hard man geezer can get a film made about him? Lets face it we are not talking about Peter Sutcliffe or Dennis Nielson here. You sense that director Julian Gilbey realised this and made a film with two dovetailing stories one about a hard man working his way thru the ranks of the underworld the other about what might have led to three drug Barron big boys getting blasted to shotgun death one night in a dark country lane. Smart move it gives his film an edge over other recent one dimensional film's of its ilk.The top British film magazines have been savage on Rise of the Footsoldier their critics clearly growing tired of having to sit thru yet another British thug movie. Yet although it clearly isn't the British Goodfella's as one over keen DVD advertising executive called it it's still a brutal and savage piece of film making aimed at a particular audience who it has to be said will find tremendous amounts of things to enjoy about it. In many ways it's an ambitious attempt by Gilbey threading the two stories together is a good move and largely it works tho fans of football hooliganism film's should note that this only fills the first ten minutes of the film. He's also tries to make his characters less psychotic than their crimes suggest they are that doesn't work but it's top marks for trying. Thus I disagree with those who have poured scorn on it as a piece of thug porn a film glorifying the bad seed that festers in society. Gilbey set out to shock clearly the subject matter calls for it but he at least told a good story in the process and didn't shirk the big moments either.Where it sits in the pantheon of Brit thug movies is to my mind quite high because I found it riveting nasty and often uneasy to sit thru. That has to be job done no? Cast are mostly OK with some of them familiar faces from other previous ne'er do well portrayals and the snapshot of the times is bright and soundtracked accordingly. It's not a film I could watch with my mother or even my missus but the makers wasn't making that sort of film anyway. An acquired taste for sure but still a tasty treat for those so inclined to the themes cooking in the pot. 810";

Its very violent very gory and has some real laugh out loud moments and in the cinema I was sitting in it had plenty of oooo's and ahhh's so the audience seemed to like it. Its definitely been made for the lads and is a working class film. Its not just some mickey mouse gangster film trying to imitate Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. It has similarities to Goodfellas and I think as a low budget British gangster flick it deserves to be praised for what it is. It has some amazing performances from Ricci Harnett Terry Stone and Roland Manookian who in my opinion jointly make this film worthy of at least a 3 review and at best 4. My advice is go and see this film and make up your own mind don't let some upper class snob who hasn't watched this film properly and obviously has issues with the working class and the British Gangster Genre sway you from what I think is going to be a cult British film like The Football Fatory and Green Street are.".

Leach's success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters profitably benefiting from the 80s90s rave scene and drug culture.Opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened but left wholly unsatisfied. The next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions. Each of these basically establishes yet another typical 'hard man' shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims before probably coming to an even nastier end. What little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters for example a family man blamed for missing drugs is quickly destroyed when they are either anticlimactically killed or their storyline left unresolved. The hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events. This film has been made with a standard formula in mind for an audience who prefer violence and 'ard nut' slang to an actual storyline. 'Rise of the Footsoldier' borrows too much from 'Football Factory' leaving out the good bits demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. The violence although brilliantly shot seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment. The implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough but machetewielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer. The audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion. Attempted 'grittyrealism' is further destroyed with a substance called 'Truth Serum' which the Turkish Mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals. This is NOT the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs and renders the interrogation almost absurd.The actual scenes of violence before becoming repetitive hold some tension spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel. Seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky handheld camera work saves the film but unfortunately the plot or lack there of limits it to a niche demographic.In essence the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot. This film has a place in the market but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn't for you. httpwww.obsessedwithfilm.com".

This is NOT the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs and renders the interrogation almost absurd.The actual scenes of violence before becoming repetitive hold some tension spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel. Seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky handheld camera work saves the film but unfortunately the plot or lack there of limits it to a niche demographic.In essence the events this film is based on aren't deservedly represented and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot. This film has a place in the market but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn't for you. httpwww.obsessedwithfilm.com";

This True Life story of Carlton Leach who? has everything that is wrong with this genre a truly awful script that consists of people screeching Cant Fahcking Cant and I'll kill ya ya fahcking cant ad nauseum. The acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most recognisable cast members being two former soap stars quite visably out of their depth. For some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of Essex hasn't and that we should be interested in some low lifes story. Why? This isn't Goodfellas despite the blurb on the DVD cover. The story centres around a football hooligan turned bouncer turned gangster who's friends end up getting shot. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film. In all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people pretended to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time. People talk about how violent the film is as though it's the sign of a great film and although many great films have violence in them this is just an excuse for the FX man to show what he can do. Overall this film is a reminder of why the British film industry is defunct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions the better.".

Not so. This is a loathsome plot less and titanically meanspirited cartoon that is so offensive and so depressing that it calls to mind nothing less than Meir Zarchi's evergreen vulgarity barometer I Spit On Your Grave. Overlong and aimless the flick just ambles briskly along taking frequent pause to go off on random inconsequential tangents all of which culminate in either gratuitous sex or gratuitous violence occasionally played for repugnant laughs that'll have most audiences continuously scraping their jaws off the floor. It is completely impossible to overstate just how grotesquely pornographic the violence is even when compared to the other specimens from this illustrious cinematic subgenre. People are endlessly having their faces smashed in with bricks their heads bludgeoned with metal poles their backsides penetrated with blunt knives often in glorious slowmotion and even more often perpetrated by our lovably roguish hero. In 'is world you gotta 'it em ard innit? Or else they don't respect ya yeah?Other highlights include... Our hero forming an impromptu posse of about ten strangers on a subway train who take on and end up beating into retreat a tribe of around two hundred machetewielding maniacs our hero romancing marrying and fathering the children of two posh angelic and smitten beauties a few months apart and our hero being accosted by a random blonde who nonchalantly begs for permission to fellate him. And as if the swelling diseaseoftheweek string syrup on the soundtrack wasn't bad enough the flick even has the audacity to go all Rashomon on us in the third act pretentiously recounting a plot event repeatedly for no reason other than to garishly bask in the glory of another dozen senseless killings. And who the hell cares anyway? All that plot stuff just gets in the way of the gore. But fear not after a couple of very brief minutes featuring three men swearing at each other in a Range Rover the plasma is right back to flying around like jism in an apocalyptic gusher gangbang. So in short its just like all those other recent British hooligan movies only worse it is manifestly the unbridled most peerlessly idiotic most misogynistic masturbation delusion of the thickest teenage fantasist in all of fackin' England. Oh and the actors are all so universally unconvincing that they make Elijah Wood in Green Street look like Lenny McLean.Trust me.

Talentless hacks have come out of the woodwork and have exploited the lowclass tastes of our increasing ned culture by cranking out endless guff like Essex Boys The Football Factory Love Honour and Obey The Business and the downright diabolical Revolver. Basically the kind of films that only get good reviews in tawdry lads mags and only because they're paid to deliberately come up with some crass soundbite like 'The best British film since Trainspotting' every time. Honestly the amount of times I have seen that particular quote doesn't even bear thinking about.But now just when you thought that the fascination with Cockney or Essex slime was over we have the 'true' story of Carlton Leech gracing our screens. Why anyone would want to torture their minds by suffering this garbage is beyond me. The only reason I went to see it is because I honestly didn't know what it was about. I will do more research next time.Carlton Leech is a football hooligan the dream of every young British boy who is hired by some scum to be a doorman cue amusing montage of various beatings. He is then hired by some other scum to supervise drug dealings. Then more scum appear and hire him...blah blah blah.Before you know Carlton has gone quite mental. But then something really odd happens. Craig Fairbrass destined to play one and only character for his entire life enters the film and it goes off into this tangent that hardly ever includes Carlton Leech. So much for it being a film about him then.Various other scum come and go and there's plenty of bloodshed and killing for people who like that sort of thing. Roland Manookian who like his pals Fairbrass and Danny Dyer will only play the one type of character for his whole 'career' turns up and degrades all British young men everywhere by portraying yet another wimpy criminal loser with no aspirations other than his next daterape or whatever. Cue more beatings and bloodshed before a triple massacre at the end. Carlton Leech finally comes back not that I was missing him or anything and does nothing but observe.And that's the movie. Sounds great doesn't it? Doesn't it? No? Being a true story doesn't validate it. Having nostalgic references to the 80s and 90s doesn't validate it. Rise of the Footsoldier has as much integrity of an 18rated episode of Eastenders only more miserable and with less skill.If you want to leave the cinema feeling like you need to wash then this is the excrement for you. Personally I have had enough of these misleading films where Britain is filled with the underclass who indulge in drugs sex drugs misogyny and drugs...and drugs. Britain is where history comes from.However films like this mountain of feces only encourage more and more people to become philistines. If their ain't no real culture out there then no one will want to be a part of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film smacks of a middle class director getting hold of a story and making it completely irrelevant. The violence is so flippant that it doesn't hold the audience. I hate the comments that suggest the poor reviews are related to a middle class snobbery fact is when characters are in violent situations the audience should care for them or feel the pain of the victim. This is why I suspect the director is probably middle class themselves as they have no respect for the violence shown. If you think i'm talking crap think back to Scarface when Tony is about to get cut by a chainsaw. One of the most violent scenes in cinema history but wasn't fawned upon as most of us really felt the pain and we all routed for him to get out of that situation. Basically we cared. If this story was told by a decent director and slight change in script dialogue this film could of been great. I feel sorry for the investors I really do. By the way I love Frank Harper what a legend.I can't wait for a remake.".

Same goes if you're not into violence or cussing.However there are other types those who don't mind the violence and cussingbits. Quiet the opposite.True enough the direction is no masterwork and the story often disjointed always fearful of loosing a moment of violence and mayhem. But it's the characters which make the film interesting Ricci Harnett is a suitable sharklike 'protagonist' one cannot help but admire the tenacity with which Terry Stone spews out obscenities and violence at an equal measure and again if you're not the type who enjoys Craig Fairbrass cutting up a pizzaboy with a pizzacutter cussing all the while well this movie wasn't made for you. Special mention should go to Frank Harper who despite only making a short appearance is brilliant as ever and makes a spinchilling murderous psychopath. Never was an actor more cut out to play hooligans brutes and thugs.Did I mention that the movie is violent? Very very violent. The violence in Rise of the Footsoldier keeps a fine balance between exaggerated comicbook gore and realistic brutality heading to the level of 'exploitive' but as said the film never pretends to be a moral play or romantic comedy.Lingualwise the better part of the dialogue  the one that's not about committing crimes taking drugs or beating up people  is reserved for two words. IMDb etiquette won't allow me to post the full context but that this review and add at least one FAK and one KANT to each sentence you'll get the picture. I must also admit although I'm not a native Englishspeaker I generally have no troubles watching films in English  with a few exception among those exceptions it Rise of the Footsoldier which forced me to turn on the subtitles. Wouldn't want to miss one of the verbal obscenities would you?Definitely one of the better British gangster and hooligan films I give it 7 FAKIN points out of 10 points KANT.By the way Bounded by Blood after The Essex Boys and Rise of the Footsoldier the third retelling of the Rettendon Range Rover murders should be thoroughly avoided by people who enjoyed this film especially since it has been billed as Footsoldier 2 in some countries. Despite a similar cast and storyline that movie was a real zeropointer.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film this week and since there is no comment yet I'll have the honor  I don't want to go into detail and tell or analyse the story right now but I want to say that it's really outrageous. I haven't read the book to it yet I must confess but my friend did and she said that the movie is somewhat different which is quite logical. I think that they really made the best out of the story the book was basically about a catastrophe and the life before and after an atomic accident. I give away that there is a lovestory that wasn't obvious in the book but it is not like in other bookpicturisations a publiclure it is just a wonderfully insightgiving thread. I liked it that the film does not rush through things it's not that you feel after fife minutes like okay that was the life before it now and then ooh yeah the accident now there's gonna be action. Far from it. It starts like a great movie about common characters life family love youth .. and the film manages to keep your attention but it does not lead you into a romantic idealworldfeeling that crashes when the alarm rings it just is realistic to sum it up. And all in all it really keeps your attention your interest and your emotions it gives room for emotions and thoughts about the meaning of love of life existence and death at the same time and there's not a sweet beginning a total clue of action sadness and shock with an abrupt ending it has this sweet expectation that again and again there's something worse to come up that leaves you sitting small but gracefully and caring but not unnecessarily crying in the cinemachair. The actors did a great job all of them above all the quite young main characters. To put it in a nutshell go and experience that experience but do it aware and on a day your nerves are strong with someone you can look at in moving moments where words wouldn't do but loneliness would turn the effect in another direction don't just go to the movies because this is not just a film. every blessing eicberin".

	schema:headline " Good stuff in terms of writing acting and directing";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Wolke or The Cloud is a German 105minute movie from 2006 so this one had its 10th anniversary last year. The director is Gregor Schnitzler and it is certainly one of his best efforts. This is also true about the writer duo here Ainscough and Kreuzpaintner who have done worse during their careers especially the former. These two adapted the novel by Gudrun Pausewang here. This is the story of a teenage girl and what happens when her first love happens at the very same time like a nuclear catastrophe that has an impact on her and all her beloved ones and actually on thousands of people in Germany. This film is not really about telling us that nuclear reactors are bad even if it still gets the message across but it is about the fate of individuals concerned by the disaster and the film works very well without big action sequences or not so special effects trying to hide the lack of substance as it has been done so so many times in catastrophe movies here in Germany.I may be a bit biased as I have always liked Paula Kalenberg but for me she is the heart and soul of the movie. It is very easy to cheer for her and her happiness and wellbeing because of the approach P.K. gives to her character. The script however is really good too and works nicely for the most part. They weren't afraid of taking risks like the boy's death that may shock the audience or depict Kalenberg with a bald head that shows however that lack of hair cannot destroy love in a nice metaphorical way. The best and equally most devastating scene of the film however is the toxic rain sequence. Heartbreaking stuff there. This one was also an 810 at least and i would have been way more effective on the big screen too I am sure. I would not say that this is a perfect film and my liking for Kalenberg especially her face expression in the kissing scenes may cloud no pun intended! my vision a bit here but I think that eventually it is a very rewarding watch. And even if the future may not be as bright as I want it to be I am somewhat glad the film ends on a positive almost uplifting note. But even besides that like I already said this one here shows all the horribly untalented filmmakers when it comes to disaster movies especially the way mass panic is put on display here worldwide how it is to be done. Initially you may think this film is mostly for audiences that are roughly the same age as the central characters i.e. teenagers but this would be a very shortminded assumption. It is for everybody who likes quality movies and certainly considerably closer to great than to mediocre. I very much recommend checking it out.".

One might actually notice that some trends are more 'adaptable' than others and it just so happens that it's the lesser trends which have this characteristic.Yet talking about trends is like talking about the act of imitation because that's all there is to do in order to 'adopt' a certain shift in secular thinking. Unfortunately though while the act itself  the act of imitating that is  was once considered the premise for facilitating swifter advancements in a nation's cultural endeavours the underlying concept seems to have been...misplaced. That is the concept of adapting which implies creating shapes that can serve as a basis for foreign 'imports'.I am so sorry for digressing in such a disgusting manner but I believe it serves an obvious purpose. It's truly a shame that a culture as vast as the German one is ignored in producing a movie which is so hollywoodian it simply implodes. Too much of anything just can't survive.Die Wolke is based on what I heard to be a heartbreaking story about love facing boundaries. A bit atypical in the sense that the problem isn't of a common nature such as family or society but of a more horrendous one a nuclear meltdown. Given that the starting point is one of such graveness it would have been important not to overemphasize some aspects of the film. Regretfully this is exactly what happens and the movie slowly turns into a love story that sometimes simply goes beyond the pathetic in the Oxfordian sense of causing one to feel pity or sadness.As the Wolke catches up with the main protagonist a girl named Hannah she is severely affected by the radiation. Elmar her boyfriend defies his father's who just happens to be as rich as they come and in a gesture of absolute altruism and complete devotion starts to search for his Hannah. I guess a more pragmatical viewer can imagine what outcome the relationship between a healthy person and a one recently 'radiated' might have.I hate being overly sarcastic but sometimes this is all we humble mortals are left with in the face of a work that tries to be of such an astounding magnitude and actually is nowhere near it. There are however some things I enjoyed about Die Wolke. Actually it's only one thing but of quite an importance somehow the film managed to convey the disaster at a fine pace in all it's urgency and in a rather threatening manner. And this is truly an impressive achievement as the film does not rely on extensive SFX.To digress once more for a bit this German movie tries to be as American as possible. The thing is if you're trying to do a disaster movie without massive special effects then you might as well try to avoid using ALL the clichs you've ever stumbled over. Not being pretentious when playing with art is of the utmost importance.".

Even if it might seem closer when you live right next to the place the atomic power plant accident is happening in the movie. The movie is about telling us that we have to think about the atomic power plants that are all around us and could destroy our live in such a short time. After the accident happened and Hannah and Elmar find themselves in crowds of people just running around to save their lifes from 'the cloud' the death that no ones sees they have and keep their close love that began right before the accident. They don't have much time to live they will probably die soonthe movie didn't tell if and how they died but still there's that strong love between them that helps them get through it. They might even have lived a better life then people that live for 80 years and haven't had the luck to have such strong feelings. In my eyes the movie was really sad. Probably the saddest movie I have seen so far. Franz and Paula who played Hannah and Elmar did a great job. Very passionate and believable.".

	schema:reviewBody "The longawaited film adaptation of Gudrun Pausewang's 1988 bestseller lives up to readers and critics expectations alike. As in the novel the teenaged protagonists take centrestage in the cautionary antinuclear tale.

The thing I like most about this movie is that it transports you back to that glorious time in 70's Venice and that's what a good movie does. Granted if I were to dig deeper into the facts of the Zephyr team I probably wouldn't like the movie as much because it wouldn't be factual. What I have come to find out is that most movies that are based on a true story always distort the facts but that is irrelevant. This is still a movie not a documentary. The purpose here is to entertain. I remember Roger Ebert gave JFK a great review and Walter Konkrite ripped him for it saying the events depicted were not fact based. Ebert responded by saying that the movie captured the nation's collective fears paranoia and cynicism about the government since the assassination and that's what a movie is supposed to do. I love the use of music in this movie and how the character's all have to come to grips in their own ways with their new found stardom. The ending is also very emotional and almost poetic. Overall a fun nostalgic glimpse into some of the skater's lives and what they did for their sport.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although there has been much controversy about whether the movie has really portrayed 'Dogtown' and the zboys accurately i feel this is not even necessary. If you feel unsatisfied with what you have learnt about the zboys and Dogtown go and watch Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Zboys. Lords of Dogtown has the intention of entertainment and i personally exetremely enjoyed it. Lords of Dogtown tells the story of how a group of Venice street kids changed the face of skateboarding and to some degree youth culture in the mid to late 1970s. The adolescent adopted the Zephyr Shop a surf store run by Skip Engblom Heath Ledger as their home away from the own dysfunctional homes. Engblom recruited the best skaters for the Zephyr Team. Including Tony Alva Victor Rasuk responsible Stacy Peralta John Robinson and troubled badboy innovator Jay Adams Emile Hirsch. With the introduction of urethane wheels revolutionary for the boys skating style as now the wheels gripped they could climb wallsand the timely South Cal drought meaning swimming pools were to be emptied giving the boys perfect locations to practice their gravitydefying maneuvers Zephyr became the beallendall of the skateboarding scene.Lords of Dogtown follows the rise and inevitable fall of the team efficiently conveying the events with a flat accuracy that emphasizes history over character development. Director Catherine Hardwicke Thirteen does an outstanding job of recreating the seedy '70s atmosphere so much so that you could be forgiven for assuming you were watching archival outtakes from ZBoys. Hardwicke really nails that sense of postVietnam rejection of authority of SoCal.Hardwicke also understands the thrilling nature of speed for these kids. She employs a pointofview camera from a skateboard's wheel to convey the rush. Hardwicke's most important achievement however was how she portrayed that skating was indeed these boys life. You really could see how skating for character Jay Adams was an outlet for the psychological pain he was experiencing. Hardwicke was very devoted to her character's individual portrayals. She has 3 contrasting personalities of main characters and shows this also through camera techniques. Jay being the more kinesthetic hard gogogo character has many hand held shots and the zoom is employed more creating a rough jerky portrayal. Stacey Peralta being the strangely responsible one with a job has straight on clean cut shots. Tony Alva however our most competitive Zboy by far is filmed often from below giving him a larger than life presence. The movie was composed exceptionally and not too 'Hollywood'  that is focusing on unrealistic character relations and excruciatingly socialanalytical. It moved just fast enough to stop you from being potentially bored by the many skating scenes if you did not fit that demographic. However even there i felt Hardwicke handled this amazingly too. I have never thought in my life i would ever watch a skating movie but i simply adored this one. Character relations were conveyed so realistically. The boys relationships were almost to real you could feel the unspoken tension between them as the Zephyr team starts to go their separate ways. Hardwicke shows that true stereotypical male bonding that is that their love of skateboarding in the end is what brings them together. Featuring a great soundtrack  including much Jimi Hendrix David Bowie and the classic Wish You Were Here i gave this movie a real thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will start out by saying that I really do love this movie but I'm not here to rant and rave about it. This movie is fascinating to me because I do love the skate culture and seeing a movie about characters who started modern skating was as I said fascinating. However I realize that most of the world doesn't think that. With that in mind I will continue. This movie is not a documentary about skating!!! If you want a documentary then check out Dogtown and ZBoys directed by a Zboy himself. It is full of stories about how the Zephyr team came to be and the way life was in Venice Beach at the time. I personally love the documentary as well but Lords of Dogtown is not meant to be a Hollywood representation of the documentary. If you are looking for that DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Lords of Dogtown is meant to be a story about the characters that fills in the gaps the documentary leaves about how these people felt mainly Jay Adams Stacy Peralta and Tony Alva. The camera angles are not straightforward the cinematography is rough and its not a cookie cutter film. But that in my opinion is why it works so well. A lot of the ZBoys themselves were on staff for this movie and helped to make it as authentic as it could be while still holding the attention of moviegoers. These guys were very impressed with the way the film was produced and for the most part were very pleased with how it represented the time. If you love skate culture then chances are you will fall in love with this movie like I did. Even my parents who are definitely not into the skate culture or the 70's still enjoyed this movie and were interested about the documentary afterwards. This movie definitely made me more interested in what skating was all about and I can't get enough about these guys now. I highly recommend this movie as well as Dogtown and ZBoys.".

	schema:headline " You'll appreciate the movie more if you watch Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Zboys.";
	schema:reviewBody "It was the seventies Sam. Materialism was making a comeback. For poor kids this was a way out of the dead end they saw in their future so many of them jumped at the chance for a corporate sponsor. Watch the documentary. These were real people. Most of the events happened in some fashion to the team members but to make it a more cohesive story Peralta put it into one year and focused on the three main characters for the movie. Put the Dogtown and Zboys documentary on and watch for how well they all match the mannerisms of the real people they are portraying. They also had to be convincing skating and in some scenes surfing.

John Robinson does most of his own skating. Peralta himself doubles for the multiple 360s in the Delmar contest scene. The real Alva does some as well. I've never even skated but I lived through the seventies and I thought it was like stepping back into the past. Very convincing.

Most of the events happened in some fashion to the team members but to make it a more cohesive story Peralta put it into one year and focused on the three main characters for the movie. Put the Dogtown and Zboys documentary on and watch for how well they all match the mannerisms of the real people they are portraying. They also had to be convincing skating and in some scenes surfing.

I'd wanted to see it for awhile so with Heath Ledger's death didn't hesitate anymore. I didn't recognize him as the surf shop owner Skip for the first several scenes. I think he added poignancy to his role as did others who in the film fought their way to who they are. Interesting to know this is based on lives of people still in the skateboarding business including the man who started off Tony Hawks career. It's good to have work out there yet to see Heath Ledger's talent shine. I'd recommend this movie to people who like to observe people even if you're neither a skateboarding fan or a Ledger fan.".

	schema:headline " Unnecessarily redundant the legend askew. spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "You have two ways of learning about the early history and transformation of skateboarding from kiddie fad to extreme commercial success. That is through former ZBoy Stacey Peralta's stylish documentary released in 2002 or through the 2005 fictionalized Hollywood mainstream feature inspired by the events and directed by 'Thirteen' director Catherine Hardwicke and written by Peralta.While I thoroughly enjoyed the former I was quite disappointed with the latter. And the argument that it can only be appreciated and understood by the most hardcore of skaters is completely stupid. You don't have to skate well or at all to enjoy a good skate movie. Unfortunately unlike Peralta's fantastic documentary Dogtown and ZBoys this fictionalized legend paid little homage to the sport itself and the Zephyr team beyond just Peralta Alva and Adams. Lords of Dogtown without context and with such annoyingly abrupt and disoriented storytelling almost makes it like Stacey Peralta Tony Alva and Jay Adams invented skateboarding. Dogtown the sacred skater tale turned mainstream has been given a Hollywood polish establishing a mythical celebration of personal arrogance rather than honest insight for the team and the sport. And that leaves little to distinguish it from other Hollywood productions. Instead there was little focus on how these teenagers love of skating completely revolutionized the skateboarding in ways that relieved it of a tired 1960s paradigm and transforming and laying the foundation for primitive technology with the most intense performance not to mention a substantial commercial success even to this day. This this legend is told slightly askew. Above all else and I believe this was due to legal problems critical founders of the team as well as members of the team themselves were omitted entirely. You're just watching the Embloom Adams Alva and Perlata show the whole time. Jeff Ho cofounder of Zephyr surf shop was absent. As were team riders Paul Constantineau Nathan Pratt and others seen in the documentary although I can see why Chris Cahill was out. Bob Biniak was a tremendous skater in his day. As was Shogo. Where were they? Granted Shogo has about a twosecond scene.Likewise the events in the story appear to move too fast and in such a scattered manner dwarfing their true impact on the changes that skateboarding would undergo. The viewer is never really given time to digest it or actually to appreciate what it was about the Zboyz style of skating that was so important when reviewing the sport. The skateboarding contest was ridiculous and rather condescending if not simply exaggerated. Watching this movie was as though you watched the documentary and pulled pieces from it which were to be given greater anecdotal backstory such as Skip Embloom's obnoxious presence at the Del Mar contests Jay Adam's wild nature only they thought to reference this at unusual points of the film or Sid the young man who died of brain cancer who's Dog Bowl swimming pool sessions in the last moments of his life were credited for reuniting the ZBoyz for a few last runs although the documentary features more than just the same three skaters skating in these sessions. But like everything else nothing was told in a way fully developed enough to give the viewer some sense of order never mind some sense of appreciation of what the stories of Dogtown. The film actually tries to duplicates sections of the documentary as well including the soundtrack 'Old man look at my life...' plays when Jay scores poorly at what appears to be his last contest Ted Nugent's 'Cat Scratch Fever' cues at the contest. What was the purpose for trying to duplicate what was already a finely crafted documentary? I can't help but to look at this as an exhaustive attempt to praise Alva Adams and Peralta or the Dogtown in general because people could be satisfied with the documentary alone as wellmade as it was. Instead some have found an opportunity to cash in even further on the fact that now the mainstream not only knows the story but now knows the name of those most recognized from the team and Engbloom but only because of Heath Ledger being cast in the film.Aside from shoddy story telling the acting wasn't great. Victor Rasauk was a miscast. Emille Hirsch never fully captures Jay Adams as the rambunctious prefame youngster and spent most of the film giving his trademark distant stares regardless of mood changes. John Robinson did alright as Peralta probably because Perlata himself was able to coach him. My biggest complaint with casting is that they should've hired actual skaters to play the parts rather than succumb to the marketing potential of the preteen crowd. The names are obviously a draw cashing in on the pretteen girl market. Although the skating sequences were nice enough to make you want to grab a board and go out and dig up old snake runs.If you are in the mood for a Dogtown tale because it is about skateboarding first and foremost you would do best to capture the history in it's most stylish and honorable form in Peralta's documentary Dogtown and ZBoys.".

My 16 year old daughter is going to love it because of the boys the boardboys will love it because it chronicles the history of the sport and parents like me will be swept away by the soundtrack alone. I hope this film gets the attention it deserves. My husband had seen the trailer and warned me that I was in for snooze but I was actually quite engaged the entire time. I am currently putting together a program in Seattle that will pair teen skaters with beginners in exchange for community service hours. Hopefully this film will reinvigorate the sport and draw more attention to the need for decent skate parks in the area.".

Written by Stacy Peralta one of the three lords mentioned in the  title the film seems to want to tell a story about rebellion  teenagers and skateboarding but this novel effort is eclipsed by box  office pressures of the Summer film release season. The big wigs at the  distributors don't want an arthouse film on their hands during June  they want highprofile adrenaline charged action that will pull  teenagers in by the droves. This pressure probably led to a neutering  of the original screenplay and the old snipsnip of explicit content  which would make the film R instead of a profitproducing PG13.  Consequently Lords of Dogtown is a blehquality sports film that  only brushes the surface of its potential.   Skip Heath Ledger is the king of Dogtown which in reality is Venice  California. It's the sixties and surfing in California is a rapidly  growing fad. Skip owns Zephyr surf shop dedicated to the philosophy of  allowing his workers to surf and work on their own hours and terms  consequently leaving him with the bills piling up. An idea sparks when  new skateboard wheels arrive at his shop and open up the possibilities  of skateboarding becoming a sport not a hobby for when the waves are  flat. He decides to start the Zephyr Skate Team. Hired for the team  among others are Jay Emile Hirsch Tony Alva Victor Rasuk and Sid  Michael Angarano. The only one with a smooth temper and a fair head  on his shoulders Stacy John Robinson is also the only one left out  of the team. But this all changes when Zephyr attends their first Skate  competition. Amping up the tunes and transforming the gymnasticlike  sport into one of style Team Zephyr lands Jay the bronze and Tony with  a potential gold had he not picked a fight with an opposing coach.  However Stacy decides to show up without a team and ends up with the  silver proving his talent to Skip. Now with Team Zephyr complete Jay  Tony and Stacy take on the Skateboarding world and make their way to  the top. But when a reporter from Skateboarder Magazine does a cover  story on the boys everything changes.   What's so agonizing about Lords is all that it actually has going for  it. There's obviously great potential here but the screenplay just  never pulls through. Most noticeably the time period director  Catherine Hardwicke creates is nearly flawless. The soundtrack features  great tunes from the era of sixties hard rock instead of a copout  raptechno backdrop that haunts many of these period sports films  nowadays. The town of Venice is also stylishly recreated. The sets  achieve the mood of a laidback surfer town with postagestamp  developments of a suburbia from the fifties. I found it easy to sink  into Hardwicke's world of Dogtown and believe every inch of it.   Also impressive is Heath Ledger's performance. Even though the  screenplay never completes his story as it does with the Lords  Ledger's character is the most convincing. Shaving his Australian  accent Ledger holds a perfect drunken Californian drawl the entire  film. And of all the characters his is the most dynamic. His character  isn't bound by the stereotypes the others are. He's pathetic  motivating rousing obnoxious rewarding and lovable all at once.  He's essentially human. He's the sort of guy we all know. The guy we  aren't quite sure if we love or if we hate. If for nothing else Lords  of Dogtown deserves a bit of recognition for Ledger's portrayal of  Skip.  But Skip aside Lords' characters are flat. Their written as  onedimensional stereotypes that never grow or react to their  environments. Also none are all that likable. Even Stacy the kind  one is sometimes too kind and eventually ends up abandoning his roots  for fame and fortune. We're constantly being alienated from these  characters because the story never allows us to like or even relate to  them. They're kept the onedimensional characters they started as even  if their hairdos may have changed.   How can a film about the sixties rebellion teenagerhood  skateboarding and revolution be rated PG13? Since when was the  rebellious behavior of the sixties a tame subject? Lords of Dogtown  likes to believe it was. They try their best they really do but with  a PG13 rating strapping it down what chance did it really ever have?  Language is kept absent sex is suggested but not witnessed drugs and  alcohol are the same and mostly Lords skips around every aspect of  the sixties that made it what it's known for. This castration of  material makes the film disappointingly less believable. And with  onedimensional characters and some poor acting on the parts of Tony  Jay and Stacy Lords of Dogtown is little more than an afternoon  endeavor for only the most hardcore of skaters.

	schema:headline " A decent film with a few engaging scenes and characters.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the mid70's a group of teen surfers from Venice California formed a skateboarding team known as the ZBoyz turning a fad into a sport by introducing a number of wild surfinginfluenced moves that had not been seen before. But the fame and fortune that came along with their newfound notoriety eventually leads to friction between the friends.I don't really like skateboarding so I thought this film was going to be boring but it turned out to be enjoyable. The characters were realistic and the drama was intense. Also the skateboarding scenes were pretty impressive even if a couple of them ran longer than they should have. The screenplay was pretty routine and predictable but it was still engaging. It was written by Stacy Peralta who just happens to be one of the characters in the movie. Unsurprisingly Stacy Peralta was the nicest character in the film and he was also one of the best skaters in the film. I wonder if it really happened like this or if Peralta was just making himself look good. They should have asked all of the original ZBoyz to pen the script even though there's a documentary on the same story.The first half of the movie was kind of slow and dull. It took awhile for things to get going. However the second half picked up and it was a lot more exciting. The ending was really nice even if it was a little cheesy. It was my favorite part in the film since it was more than a little heartwarming. Catherine Hardwicke did a horrible job behind the camera. She moved the camera rapidly with quick editing and I guess she was trying to get a documentary feel to the film. It didn't work out very well. It was messy and it seemed like a desperate attempt for drama and excitement. Also the dialog was exaggerated and annoying. I know skateboarders really do speak like that but only to a point. They really went overboard with it and it was very unnecessary.The acting was pretty good with Emile Hirsch giving the best performance. His character was the most developed and interesting one. He handled the role well and he should become a big star one day. Victor Rasuk was also pretty good as Tony though a little annoying. John Robinson was okay a little dull though. Heath Ledger was pretty funny as Skip and his character was a good idol for the young skaters. Rebecca De Mornay gave a horrible performance that was completely fake and unbelievable. Michael Angarano played Sid and his performance was pretty good. It was sad to watch at times because of the illness Sid had and what it did to him. This is why I really liked the ending because it was just the boys skating with Sid watching them. The majority of the film was on the forgettable side but the ending was really touching. In the end Lords of Dogtown is worth checking out for skater fans otherwise approach with caution. Rating 710".

I also remember that my son who grew up in the 70's had skateboards that were much further advanced so the time line on The Lords of Dogtown seemed to be in the mid 60's and not the 70's as the movie depictedThe clincher for me was how a Producer of Art Linsons stature could economize on the music. I wanted to hear the soundtrack of the time but I found the music was very generic........

	schema:reviewBody "The ZBoys were a group of Venice Beach teenagers who in the 1970's pioneered a whole new style of skateboarding that is still popular today and which earned the boys status as instant international celebrities at least within the tightly circumscribed world of skating. In 2001 one of the original members of the group Steve Peralta wrote and directed a documentary on the boys entitled Dogtown and ZBoys which featured interviews with many of the original members of the group. Then in 2005 a fictionalized version of the story came along Lords of Dogtown also written by Peralta but this time directed by Catherine Hardwicke.It's understandable that in her approach to the material Hardwicke would want to preserve as much as possible the roughhewn documentary flavor of the original. Thus virtually the entire movie has been shot on grainy film stock using a handheld camera which creates a sense of immediacy and spontaneity and nicely approximates the look of the time period in which the story is set. The best scenes involve the boys performing harrowing deathdefying stunts as they glide through and around pedestrians and vehicles along the trafficclogged streets of their Southern California neighborhood. However this impressionistic style also means that the narrative is often diffuse and unfocused making it hard for us to distinguish one character from another and to know just who we should be concentrating on at any given moment. The ostensible protagonist seems to be Peralta himself although it is roughly 45 minutes into the film's running time before even that simple fact becomes apparent. However about halfway through the film the dramatic elements finally begin to come together we get to know some of the boys as individuals and the movie ends on a genuinely touching note.In the rare moments when the camera actually manages to settle down and an individual scene is allowed to play itself out we begin to sense that some of the boys playing the skaters may actually have some real talent as actors we can certainly see that they are damn fine skaters and a few of them I suspect we will be hearing from again in the not too distant future. In a nonskating role Heath Ledger plays a sort of mentor to the boys and the owner of the surf shop which served as the launching pad for the movement. Unfortunately with his halfhearted attempt at mastering a slackerstoner persona and accent Ledger seems to be merely marking time in this film counting down to that moment when he would stun the world with his soulshattering performance in Brokeback Mountain. Who could have foretold from his work here that he had THAT up his sleeve? Lords of Dogtown is moderately informative to those who know next to nothing about the history of skateboarding but I imagine it is the true aficionado of the sport who will get the most enjoyment out of the movie".

	schema:reviewBody "A Japanese photographer returns to Vietnam three years after documenting its 'liberation' and becomes increasingly involved in the fate of a young girl and her family. It is a time of poverty violence and death.There are many deaths in this film and the majority of these deaths are graphically depicted. One of the least explicit but perhaps the most moving occurs on a scrap heap surrounded by a body of filthy water. While the young victim's blood is still flowing out his peer runs the length of the heap bearing a standard his identity and the colours of the flag rendered anonymous by the remote camera angle and the silhouette produced by the setting sun. The boy lays the flag over the body with a timeliness and purpose that implies he is always ready for such tragedies. It is one of the film's most striking images calling to mind such questionable iconic images as the flagraisers of Iwo Jima.Such readings are possible over much of the film. Director Ann Hui's 'vrit' camera calls to mind Altman's MASH as does her treatment of violence and its bloody consequences  something which contrasts with the comic book violence of later 80s Hong Kong films with which many people are more familiar. Comparisons could also be made with Kubrick's use of zoom though MASH has this too and formal composition with characters placed in the centre of frame as if being interviewed for live television. Kubrick of course would later direct his own Vietnam masterpiece Full Metal Jacket.Comparisons could even be made with Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Coppola's helicopter sequence filmed in the Philippines shares a lot with Hui's remarkable opening shot of tanks driving through the streets of Hainan China both standing in for Vietnam. However where Coppola tended towards using the imagery of Vietnam to attain a greater artistic goal Hui would be discredited for receiving any such reading. Where the sound of Coppola's napalm explosions bring a certain excitement and satisfaction to the viewer the gunshots heralding executions and the chance for children to pillage the corpses has an entirely different motive and effect.One of the film's strengths is that while it plays with even exploits some wellestablished grammars of film making  tragedy documentary romance  it never defers to a single one. The film works on each level equally well. It is a welltold story excellently paced and genuinely compelling right up to the end credits. At the other end of the spectrum it is perhaps the boldest and most unflinching criticism of the brutality and hypocrisy of communist states to come out of a small island that would 17 years later become a Special Administrative Region of such a state.The film has elements of curiosity. One can accept for purely practical reasons the need for Cantonese to be the common language of Vietnamese and Japanese characters. It is harder to understand why a Japanese man played by a local Hong Kong actor should be the main protagonist especially considering the film's political overtones. Does he represent objectiveness or irony? Perhaps there is no single answer.Despite some minor flaws the film manages to illustrate without preaching condescending or even aestheticising the subject even though the dimlylit tableaux and pitchperfect editing combine very pleasingly for the eye. Hui works with a lightness of touch rarely seen in Hong Kong or Hollywood at that time or since and with a feminist subtext scarcely seen in her later work. This film welldeserves the acclaim with which it was awarded on its release and is sadly underrated at the time of writing. It serves as an interesting and important counterpoint to the various lavish 'magnum opuses' of American directors of that era and has an enduring relevance and importance that many young people especially of the film's native land would benefit from experiencing.".

In fact the script is a purely fabricated by the screenwriter Kang Chien Chiu at a time when Hong Kong people were uncertain of their future and for fear of the social overhaul if Chinese Communist Party would eventually take over the colonised financial hub. Chiu's anticommunist slant is the elephantintheroom although Hui has tried to sidestep the politicssensitive issue by emphasising that the film is more focused on personal struggle under the extreme circumstances.Shot in Hainan island of China as a standin for a tropical Ho Chi Minh City Shiomi is a Japanese photography who has been granted a license to shoot the new life of Vietnamese people under the government of Communist party after the Vietnam War. The commencing flourishing impressions are disrupted when Shiomi decides to roam the city alone without the company of the bureaucratic officials soon he is attracted by an impecunious girl Cam Nuong Ma on the street who has two younger brothers and a sick mother Hao to raise. Slowly Shiomi realises all his previous photoshooting visits are the front arranged with the government to give a grand veneer for foreigners the harsh reality stuns Shiomi he witnesses extreme poverty the utter disregard for human life and death can happen anytime anywhere no one cares the poor refuses to be relocate to the socalled new economic district because young men are violently manhandled to manually remove land mines under cruel administration from the authorities. Disillusioned and unsettled by the darkness and savagery Shiomi decides to help Cam Nuong and his younger brother flee from this country but the sacrifice might exceed his expectation.The film doesn't recoil at the bloodletting casualties and the intensity of waiting for a land mine to explode at any moment is excruciatingly taxing although Hui doesn't intend to let those scenes to be too startling with long cues as a ballast. The murky and repressing air engulfs lives without hope except fro Cam Nuong she is precocious but has yet been contaminated by the vice around her sincere laughters can still burst out between her and Shiomi Season Ma injects a spirited purity and spunky pizazz into Cam Nuong in her careerdebut performance. George Lam exhibits an affable persona as an outsider involuntarily elevated to be a true hero with unyielding ethical virtues.This is also Andy Lau's screendebut too the subplot around him can evoke quite a harrowing weep. Cora Miao who play's a 40yearold mistress using her body as the leverage of survival under the tumultuous situation configures a mesmerising presence with intriguing backstories left unfinished. Mengshi Qi is Nguyen the bureaucrat who finds a camaraderie in Shiomi represents both the executioner and the victim of the government his poetic reflection The revolution of Vietnamese is successful but my own revolution fails  narrated beautifully with a golden sunset in the background. The production looks a bit dated by today's standards and certain editing hiccups are rather noticeable but if we can be impartial to the story's pejorative nature regarding to the Communist regime the film is a wellconsidered ode to humanity and altruism when it is urgently needed also more remarkably it would be an impossible task for Ann Hui to get a green light under today's cinematic weather neither in mainland China nor in Hong Kong.".

	schema:reviewBody "So is the Hitchhikers' movie any good?Yes and no.It is great to finally see one of my favourite stories finally get the big screen treatment. There are moments where the budget has clearly benefited the overall experience with some breathtaking CGI sequences. Two particularly spring to mind An impressive backwards zoom out from earth's surface past the Vogon demolition charges before the planet is so hastily disposed of and Arthur's journey onto Magrathea's staggeringly colossal factory floor which is simply overwhelming. Both illustrate to great satisfaction the dramatic readjustment of scale Arthur Dent has to undergo in such a short space of time in a stark manner that is just not possible in any medium other than cinema. The onscreen format of the guide itself is an appropriate update of the format developed for the television series and it's highly enjoyable to see such delightfully silly animations grace a giant cinema screen.Cinema is a different experience and that is the nub of the matter. We are dealing with a radically different medium from any of the other that Hitchhiker's has materialised in and not only does that offer new opportunities to explore Douglas Adams' marvellous universe it also necessitates dramatic changes. Most noticeably and perhaps most important for a twohour motion picture there is more effort to form a conventional plot than is present in the original incarnations and this change is accompanied by major changes in character motivation. This is interesting because here analysis becomes problematic since it is impossible to know which changes were instigated by Adams and which were down to Karey Kirkpatrick none of the characters in Adams' earlier material really had any significant motivations that would lend them to becoming interesting protagonists in a more conventional setting.Previously Narcissist Zaphod wanted his ego stroked by fame and fortune Ford was content with the prospect of a decent party to go to and Arthur's only desire was a palatable cup of tea. Trillian didn't really do anything. Although they are far from unrecognisable the introduction of tangible drives into most of the characters alters the pattern of events in the story to accommodate what begins to resemble a more conventional story structure. One of the first casualties of this is that the principle players overshadow others who are introduced halfheartedly expanded upon and then almost entirely dropped in deference to the favoured few. It never goes the whole way towards a standard structure though as half of the principle story is seemingly abandoned in favour of a concentration on the romantic subplot and an overall resolution that is at least reverent to the previous formats. The result is a mixed bag. I found Arthur much more likable and Zaphod funnier than I ever have done but it never actually occurred to me until the film that Arthur was a bit of a whinger and Zaphod quite boring because I was too busy paying attention to what happened to them rather than what they happened to do.The other major objection which may or may not have been inevitable given the time that must be given over to visuals in cinema is that the filmmakers appear to try and get too much into a twohour film. As a result some brilliantly funny lines are missed and key explanations fudged and both are replaced by a general silliness which appears to be a compromise between the demands of hardcore Hitchhiker's fans and those of the cinemagoing public. A lot of the new material is funny but some of it doesn't really fit with Adams' universe and sticks out like a sore thumb. Whether this is the consequence of those responsible being caught between the rock of Adam's inventiveness and the hard place of the medium they were working in is hard to say. Perhaps someone braver could have produced something more appropriate or perhaps this is the best that there could ever be. I suppose we'll never know.To summarise It's very different.".

I don't want to sit in the cinema watching a line by line copy of the radio play book or TV series. Each of those stand by their own merit and each were good largely because of the new material they contained.I think the cast did an excellent job and although Zaphod wasn't quite how I pictured him Sam Rockwell brought a freshness to the part which largely works. His portrayal of Zaphod as a guy who thinks he is cool rather than is cool works pretty well and once you get over the southern drawl he soon settles as a character. Ford is beautifully played as are all the major characters.Admittedly some of the criticisms that were voiced by Simpson have some justification but most were simply overstated to support his general vitriolic attack on the purity of the film.In summary go to see this film and don't worry.I'm looking forward to the DVD and I have all my fingers crossed for a sequel.Martin".

He's an everyman his slightly vacant permanently confused facial expression which we've all come to recognise from his role in The Office truly becoming from a man who's trying to make sense of what's Out There which happens to be similar to though on a slightly larger scale than what's Down Here. And stupider.Admittedly it would've been nice to see more English talent taking on the roles from Adams' well loved creation. Steven Fry is THE Guide the quintessential voice of logic and goodhumoured reasoning in the Universe. Bill Nighy makes a great Slartibartfast coming across as the kindly if a little absent minded genius that I've always imagined. And Alan Rickman providing his nasal drones to Marvin the Paranoid Android worked to near perfection.That's not to say that the American cast isn't great. Mos Def and Zooey Deschanel are excellent as Ford Prefect and Trillian but it's obvious that it's Sam Rockwell who's having all the fun relishing his role as the overexcitable reminiscently hippierockstar ExPresident of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox.So all in all The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great experience. NonAdamites will love it as will the die hard fans. It's such a shame that its creator had to bow out before his beloved creation came to life but due to his input into the movie script the character Humma Kavula played by John Malkovich was written by him especially for the movie his enthusiasm still lives on.Want to go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe now please.".

Think Monty Python in space or a very British version of The Fifth Element.As an adaptation I think it works extremely well though there were a few confusing moments even for me as the large philosophical questions were crammed into two hours worth of movie. The new stuff is cleverly done and works a treat IMO.The cast never been a fan of the office but Martin Freeman is perfect as Arthur Dent Sam Rockwell hilariously OTT and Mos Def a surprising choice but one that really works. Trillian isn't that important in the novel and the movie bumps up her role to a love triangle situation between her Arthur and Zaphod. Again Deschanel is an odd choice another yank but she is utterly spellbinding oh the shower scene...hubba hubba.The FX are great both CGI and the Jim Henson creatures the Vogons brilliantly voiced by The League of Gentleman. The opening title song is worth the price of admission alone think Eric Idle at his peak.So I loved it though the ending is also a bit of an anticlimax but only perhaps because I was expecting something bigger. Still it's pfunny and that's the main thing.Best moment Ford attacks the Vogons with a towel and foils them by closing a tiny garden gate Oh no! We'll have to go around!.".

But Don't Panic! As Robbie Stamp Adams' pal and the movie's executive producer rightfully says The cast and crew rose to the challenge and created the perfect tribute to Douglas.The film carefully brings the story into the noughties without incurring the wrath of Hitchhiker fans and adds enough smug nods in their direction to keep them happy. They will relish whispering to their unimpressed cinema neighbour Look Douglas Adams' face is in that shot or That's Marvin the Paranoid Android from the TV series. And for the uninitiated there's an acidtrip of a movie featuring love aliens and the answer to life the universe and everything. A galaxy of stars were enlisted to bring the mindboggling story to the big screen including Martin Freeman who reprises his superb Everyman role from The Office to play Arthur Dent a tealoving Londoner who becomes the last man from Earth following its destruction to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Mos Def proves not all hiphop stars are fistgnawingly embarrassing as actors in his part as Ford Prefect a revoltingly cool alien who accompanies Dent on his hitchhiking adventure around the universe.The unspeakably delicious Zooey Deschanel provides the love story that was sadly lacking in Adams' script drafts. She plays Trillian the last surviving humanoid female who finds herself caught in an unsavoury love triangle between Dent and Zaphod Beeblebrox the President of the Imperial Galactic Government and owner of three arms two heads and one planetsized ego. And if you've ever wondered what Freddie Mercury and George Bush's lovechild would be like and frankly who hasn't? watch Sam Rockwell's extraordinary portrayal of Beeblebrox. As Rockwell testifies I studied footage of US presidents and rockers for this role until I tasted blood.The essential Britishness of the film is provided by the delectable Stephen Fry and Bill Nighy who are more English than chips awkward dinner parties and halitosis.Who better to voice The Guide a book which contains all the knowledge in the universe than bulgingbrained Fry who uses the perfect amount of middleclass haughtiness irony and intelligence to narrate the delightfully complicated story.And Nighy can't fail as planet builder Slartibartfast who as every nerd knows won an award for creating the twiddly bits around Norwegian fjords because he based the worldweary alien on the nation's bestloved character Bill Nighy.I almost missed out one character insane religious leader Humma Kammula a new character Adams wrote especially for John Malkovich. He is easily forgotten because despite his amusing dialogue the special effects drown out his performance preventing him from doing the honour justice.But fans will forgive this small transgression for the pleasure of seeing a beast of a movie which has defied the laws of the universe to make it onto the big screen.Jennings and Goldsmith have proved that despite their movie virginity the first time isn't always messy awkward and disappointing it can also be earth shattering amusing and very very satisfying.".

Scenes have been added and other scenes thrown out but in the end the movie just is not funny. The seemingly random plot of the book is just plain senseless in the movie.Throughout the movie I just kept asking myself why certain scenes were changed and lines removed. If it made sense to advance a movie plot fine. These changes though were just completely random.Instead of a hysterical scene in which Ford Prefect convinces a putupon construction foreman to lie down in the mud in front of a bulldozer because logically Arthur has to go to the pub with Ford and somebody has to lie in front of the bulldozers you have a scene in which Ford Prefect simply passes out cans of beer. Is this funnier? Does it make more sense? Does it advance the plot in some way... NO.Worse still the scene in which the construction foreman explains to Arthur that the plans have been on display and he should have filed his grievance earlier.The version in the movie isI eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.But you found the plans didn't you?The version in the book isI eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.That's the Display Department.With a torch.The lights had probably gone.So had the stairs.But you found the plans didn't you?Oh yes they were 'on display' in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the leopard.'The movie version is 10 seconds shorter but about 10 million times less funny. Why? There are so many more things wrong with this movie I can't begin to list them all. I completely understand that Douglas Adams use to change the story with each new adaptation but they all had one thing in common they were funny. This movie is simply awful.The only redeeming parts are Marvin who although he looks stupid is at least sort of funny the guide itself and the yarn characters.Please do yourself the favor and do not bother to see it.

	schema:reviewBody "Well I'm not a film reviewer. I'm not really a fan of film reviewers as their job involves pretending that there is an objective standard that governs how much everyone will enjoy a film well some of them are smart enough not to dress their opinion as anything else. Everyone enjoys films in different ways and I like to use my own judgment to decide if a film is worth my time or not well that and the opinions of a few trusted individuals who's taste in films is very similar to my own.So this isn't a review it's just my honest reaction to the film and you may judge for yourselves if my opinion is likely to be similar to your own.I loved it. There were a couple of small points that I wasn't happy with but there was so much that I really enjoyed that I left the cinema very happy indeed. It has a very frantic pace especially when compared to the glacial pace of the TV series. But in my opinion it works.I'll now talk about different aspects of the film.The Cast. Each member of the cast has brought a new interpretation of their character to the film but they are still definitely the same characters. Martin Freeman is very funny but also very human. He's less of a caricature of Britishness than Simon Jones's interpretation.Mos Def is an excellent laid back Ford who occasionally has slightly manic David Dixon style moments. I don't think everyone will like his delivery of some of the lines as he can be very deadpan at times but I found him very watchable and likable.Sam Rockwell's Zaphod is either lovable or irritating depending on your loonytolerance. I found his overthetop performance was just perfect for Zaphod and frequently had me in stitches.Zooey Deschanel. Mmmm....Zooey. She's the best Trillian ever! She's adorable funny charming intelligent and finally has an emotional depth that was missing from all other incarnations. She works well with both Zaphod and Arthur and their interactions were believable.Bill Nighy gave a performance that managed to be nothing like Richard Vernon's yet at the same time definitely Slartibartfast. Very funny. Very human.Stephen Fry is someone who I new would be good. He has the intelligence needed to get the delivery right and a mysterious gentle voice like God has popped round for a cup of tea.The Effects sets and puppets. Wonderful. I loved the Vogon puppets it made them seem much more real than any CG character yes even Gollum. The sets looked great and there is one nice tracking shot down a Vogon corridor that shows just how huge the set was. Every set is packed with detail I cannot wait for the DVD. The Magrathea 'factory floor' is breathtaking  especially on the bigscreen. Zaphod's second head isn't brilliantly executed but it didn't bother me much.The Guide entries. I'm a big Shynola fan. I was extremely excited when I learned that they would be doing the guide entries. I wasn't disappointed  the guide entries look great and are packed with the inventive wit that characterises Shynola's work. The way they visually interpret the words of the guide entries is very clever and matches the wit of the original animations in the TV series but with a more modern approach.The Music. The Dolphin song at the start was wonderful. Call me a softy but a couple of the lines nearly brought a tear to my eye. The music for the guide entries fit really well. The new orchestrated version of Journey of the Sorcerer is great. I was too wrapped up in the experience to really notice the music I'll have to see it again or buy the soundtrack! Editing. The film flies along at an incredible pace but for me it never suffered from the 'why are we here now?' problem that some film The Phantom Menace suffer from. I really couldn't tell you how someone new to Hitchhiker's Guide might react. The destruction of the Earth is particularly well handled managing to be both funny and moving.Stuff I didn't like. Not much really. Part of me craves for the inclusion of things that other parts of me recognise will make the film less effective. One thing that I felt was a shame is that certain added plot elements make the story less bleak. These plot elements actually come from later books in the series so they weren't unHitchhikery but they contributed to a more optimistic story than I am familiar with from other versions. But this is a minor quibble and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the film. Though I really liked Zaphod I didn't really like the second head. It didn't work as well as it might have. Still it was preferable to a shouldermounted permanent extra head  which would have been wrong for many reasons.Conclusion. It is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reborn with a new energy. It is lighter than previous incarnations but still retains most of what I love about the story. It also adds a brilliant level of visual inventiveness that matches the aural inventiveness of the original radio series. People expecting the TV series but with better effects will be disappointed. This is a new beginning. The Hitchhiker's Guide is alive again it is an enormous shame on a galactic scale that Douglas isn't here to enjoy it. The huge applause after the film showed I wasn't alone in having a good time.Also the film contains my favourite line. It previously only occurs in the second radio series as far as I know and is moved to a different occasion but I was dead chuffed when I heard it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Well I'm not a film reviewer. I'm not really a fan of film reviewers as their job involves pretending that there is an objective standard that governs how much everyone will enjoy a film well some of them are smart enough not to dress their opinion as anything else. Everyone enjoys films in different ways and I like to use my own judgment to decide if a film is worth my time or not well that and the opinions of a few trusted individuals who's taste in films is very similar to my own.So this isn't a review it's just my honest reaction to the film and you may judge for yourselves if my opinion is likely to be similar to your own.I loved it. There were a couple of small points that I wasn't happy with but there was so much that I really enjoyed that I left the cinema very happy indeed. It has a very frantic pace especially when compared to the glacial pace of the TV series. But in my opinion it works.I'll now talk about different aspects of the film.The Cast. Each member of the cast has brought a new interpretation of their character to the film but they are still definitely the same characters. Martin Freeman is very funny but also very human. He's less of a caricature of Britishness than Simon Jones's interpretation.Mos Def is an excellent laid back Ford who occasionally has slightly manic David Dixon style moments. I don't think everyone will like his delivery of some of the lines as he can be very deadpan at times but I found him very watchable and likable.Sam Rockwell's Zaphod is either lovable or irritating depending on your loonytolerance. I found his overthetop performance was just perfect for Zaphod and frequently had me in stitches.Zooey Deschanel. Mmmm....Zooey. She's the best Trillian ever! She's adorable funny charming intelligent and finally has an emotional depth that was missing from all other incarnations. She works well with both Zaphod and Arthur and their interactions were believable.Bill Nighy gave a performance that managed to be nothing like Richard Vernon's yet at the same time definitely Slartibartfast. Very funny. Very human.Stephen Fry is someone who I new would be good. He has the intelligence needed to get the delivery right and a mysterious gentle voice like God has popped round for a cup of tea.The Effects sets and puppets. Wonderful. I loved the Vogon puppets it made them seem much more real than any CG character yes even Gollum.

I watched it again afterwards still shocked.The acting was insipid and unbelievable and that in an epic space fantasy!. Zaphod was way overplayed and unbelievable and the two heads and three arms were just plain wrong. One head could not talk to the other! Who is Ford? Why is he named Ford? Why is he black? Why does he run to Arthur's house with a grocery cart full of beer and peanuts? There is so little motivation in this film for anything! Why is there an entire construction company and 25 men? It was just a little house. Besides they cut out the dialogue about finding the plans the basement the disused lavatory and the leopard. So why bother with all the props? Marvin is short and moves quickly and often. This is not in keeping with the character! The great Warwick Davis deserves better.What a waste of the adorable Zooey! She wants to go to with Arthur? Why? And why would she desire him anyway? BTW they met at a 'fancy dress' ball. This uh doesn't mean weird costumes. Huge mistake 1. Love story where there was none.Characters drift in and out of continuity. The letter Z is pronounced ZEE by Tricia but ZED by everyone else. The planet Magrathea is pronounced variously as magraTHAYuh and magraTHEEuh. The excellent narrator does his best to hold things together but he's no Peter Jones alas and he's not given the chance actually. The name of the film IS the name of the book but the part of the book is hugely reduced.What's this 'dolphins with musical bit' for the beginning? Of course I knew what it was stupid and wasteful but did most of the audience? That's not the beginning anyway. These folks should've followed Douglas Adams  who wrote the story for radio. They were not treating a book here! They were working with output from a man who had a tremendous albeit unusual understanding of how to tell a story  the sequences being especially important to his style. And this story is nothing if not style.The end seemed to tease us about the restaurant at the end of the universe and then confuse us about at which end it was located. Good grief! It's the end of the universe in time not location. This huge gaffe 2 is enough for me to hope that these same folks do not get a chance to make a sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "What Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy needs is space. Not outer space that's a given. It needs the kind of space that gives Douglas Adams' cosmically discursive whimsy a chance to grow in the minds of an audience. Like a fivevolume trilogy. Or a miniseries. Or a computer game.What it didn't need was a twohour movie.Hitchhiker's Guide the movie is the proof. A crammed artificialfeeling creation by committee it tries to be both a massmarket entertainment and true to the extended Adams family of fans by cramming the story of a man in a bathrobe one Arthur Dent Martin Freeman shuttled beyond the known universe after his home planet of Earth is destroyed to make room for an intergalactic superhighway.It must be Thursday Arthur muses. I could never get the hang of Thursdays.The film feels like that too. A shapeless regurgitation of episodes from the first Adams novel mixed with a couple of annoying new story lines and an uncomfortably conventional even sentimental romance between Dent and the lead female character Trillian Zooey Deschanel Hitchhiker never gets the hang of its source material not surprising given that material's selective appeal. Any story that starts with Earth's wholesale destruction as a source of liberation and hilarity won't play in Peoria.Director Garth Jennings treats Adams with unfailing deference even as he skirts past Adams' work out of simple necessity. If you remember things from reading the books or watching the BBC miniseries there's a good chance you'll see it referenced in the movie. But Jennings and writer Karey Kirkpatrick never get the material to play on its own power. Instead it seems to settle between two opposite attitudinal poles that of a giantheaded manicdepressed robot Alan Rickman's voice Warwick Davis's body and the twoheaded maniacally egotistical President of the Galaxy firstbilled Sam Rockwell spouting dialogue that's likely to infuriate Adams purists and befuddle everyone else. The story moves in fits and jerks as Arthur and his companions planet hop in search of the question to the ultimate answer which isn't as cool as it sounds.The film does have an impressive look especially when we meet the nasty Vogons Muppets cleverly designed by the Jim Henson people to resemble black walking warts with Charles Laughton faces. In their vast clanky metal spaceship I was reminded of the best parts of Brazil. Deschanel is as cute and winsome as ever those big blues of hers just slay me. The humor still manages to connect about three times out of ten especially when Bill Nighy shows up as a somewhat dazed fellow who helped design the original planet Earth. He's very proud of his fjords.But in the end you are left feeling more like the robot than anyone else.".

I was hoping this film would capture the brilliance of Adams' work as it's been shared with me. Unfortunately the film failed to deliver. This flick really has no plot. Most of the film's events come as complete surprises I suppose that randomness was supposed to add to the wackiness of the whole experience. It quickly became nauseating. In this case I wish I'd watched ANY of the advertised films in the trailers instead of the feature film. That's a HUGE claim The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl was in there .. shudder.The characters in the film are empty and shallow. Sam Rockwell's character was mildly amusing at best Marvin the JarJar Binks of the movie was predictably dull and the Vogons were just lame. I really didn't care about any of them so being a part of their adventure was really boring the love story was horribly illdeveloped The President's search for the question of the meaning of life and the universe was trite and the mouse experimentation explanation for the existence of the Earth was well stupid.Let's take inventory at this point ... the film lacked both a plot and interesting characters. How does a movie redeem itself when it lacks these two essential elements you ask? IT DOESN'T! There was no one to like and nothing to be interested in. I'm serious people you'll find yourselves staring at the floor playing with pocket lint or perhaps making a mental shopping list during the showing. We're talking about streaming nonsense ... take a pillow or a book perhaps a deck of cards you'll need something to pass the TWO HOURS it'll take for this disaster to wrap itself up! In the process of editing this flop someone should have realized that there is no substance to the film and promptly cut out 30 minutes of what we'll generously call content. I wanted so badly to like this film and have it be good that I waited through the entire thing for it to turn itself around. What a disappointment. Honestly Future War and Cyborg didn't get 2 hours to torture me why did this film get special treatment? I suppose the worst part of the film is that it's a disgrace to the book. Leave it to Hollywood to take something interesting and original and in an attempt to package it for the mass stupids ruin everything appealing about it. It's at a time like this that I wish I had a genie in a lamp and 3 wishes I'd first wish that the producer and director of this film were forbidden from making more films second I'd wish that this film be taken from the theaters immediately and third I'd wish for the film to be rewritten with only two characters Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen and that it be released on DVD as not one film but as an series of films about their travels through the galaxy. This way the public will know what the film is really about and can judge it as absolute garbage without having to see it for themselves.".

If only there had been an end of year exam I may have gone on to university. Fast forward several years or decades  I don't remember and I have just walked out of the British premiere of the new movie in Leeds a first for me. Lacking any of the subtlety of Adam's humor that made the radio shows and book so popular in the 80's and acted as badly if not worse than the TV series this movie is a horror. It is obvious that the producers have never made a movie before the plot is a mess the whole thing chops around all over the place with bits thrown in for no apparent reason like the Humma Kavula  Questular Rontok characters. This movie is lazy sloppy badly shot and grainy  looks like it was shot on digicam. I kept waiting for the film to settle down and find its rhythm however it never did nor did it look like it was going to when I walked out whilst Arthur  Trillian were taking a shower. I cannot really think who could have pulled off a movie of HHG maybe Terry Gilliam The only saving grace is a cameo by the original Marvin from the BBC series. Truly awful. I don't know why I bother Oh my God  Funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does.".

It is obvious that the producers have never made a movie before the plot is a mess the whole thing chops around all over the place with bits thrown in for no apparent reason like the Humma Kavula  Questular Rontok characters. This movie is lazy sloppy badly shot and grainy  looks like it was shot on digicam. I kept waiting for the film to settle down and find its rhythm however it never did nor did it look like it was going to when I walked out whilst Arthur  Trillian were taking a shower. I cannot really think who could have pulled off a movie of HHG maybe Terry Gilliam The only saving grace is a cameo by the original Marvin from the BBC series. Truly awful. I don't know why I bother Oh my God  Funny how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does.";

The animations of the book itself were much better even in the 1981 TV series which has a lot of bad SE but is much more on the hook of the book than this new bullshit. there are so many lost opportunities e.g. right at the beginning where Ford gives the workers some beer to stop them destroying Arthur's house instead of convincing the head worker to lay down in the mud instead of Arthur. All the important things were not really explained e.g. the need of a towel  they just say you need one but are quiet about the why Before seeing it I thought that it's impossible to shorten the plot to a 109 minutes and unfortunately I was right. too bad and too sad... I really do hope they will NEVER do a sequel to this. The end credits start with to douglas.

However there are many problems with this that make it not a patch on the original classic upon which it is loosely based.1.

	schema:reviewBody "Last night I was at the world premiere of the new HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy film in Leicester Square courtesy of the BBC's H2G2 competition. Front seat rows bang in the centre. Nice though a recipe for neck ache that even the free towel on the back of the seat couldn't prevent I don't have the privilege of coming to HHGG with a fresh view and it's always going to be difficult to compete against three hugely successful previous formats of the same work. But if I did then I suspect I might have left the theatre wondering what all the fuss was about. As it was I can see that the film was its own beast though I was left flat by the parts that most closely mimic the TV series partly because the jokes are now 25 years old and well known to me but mainly because they didn't do them as well as other versions.And for a series that always excelled in all three formats on carefully honed dialogue there was a throwaway element that leaves me scratching my head wondering how it got into this state. Example  When Arthur is lying in front of the bulldozer about to demolish his house and the foreman is telling him that the plans have been on display for weeks Arthur's reply is that they were in the basement. Now HHGG fans know that this is the start of a comic battle of wits which is essential to getting the most out of the Vogon's Apathetic bloody planet comment later. But here the rest of the dialogue is skipped. Now I know that the movie is shorter than the series and so cuts of some parts were inevitable but as it is the cut isn't deep enough. What is left serves only as a placeholder for your memory of this episode and for people new to HHGG it is an irrelevance that could have been skipped all together. Either the placeholder is deliberate or perhaps the whole scene was recorded and the sense of it ended up on the cutting floor. I was left with a similar feeling during the Deep Thought recording.Before any other criticisms though the good bits. 25 years is a long time in CGI terms and the vogon construction fleet is a marvel. As the camera pans up the simply stupendously huge ship and you realise it is one of thousands surrounding the earth you can't fault the directors visual ambition. And that visual style compliments the humour inherent in the story from the shape of the heart of gold to the vogon's microphone. I.e. not simply a rendering of the words in the script. Those bits of the movie which are brand new have the power to excite the point of view gun being the one which is most likely to pass into legend. Martin Freeman is a convincing Arthur though not one ever likely to say I seem to having a tremendous problem with my lifestyle  which is presumably why he doesn't. Sam Rockwell as Zaphod is hugely entertaining though as he plays half the movie with only half his brain you do get a little tired of his antics. John Malkovich as Zaphod's former political opponent is a great cameo it's just a shame it doesn't seem to fit in very well in this film.As for the rest of the cast Mos Def as Ford Prefect never really comes to life and Zooey Deschanel while enchanting never comes across as a astrophysicist. Perhaps because she never gets the chance to say she is an astrophysicist because if Sandra Dickinson could convince in that role then surely anyone could? While reviewers have given Alan Rickman's Marvin a thumbs up I find him more sarcastic than depressed a worry I had before the film began. Even the vogons  wonderfully brought to life by Jim Henson's Creature shop seem to lack bite. Had the office clerk had more of the say Roz from Monsters Inc about her it would have worked much better.As for the book which is wonderfully voiced by Stephen Fry who shows an obvious delight at working on this film the graphics themselves are a mixed bag and don't seem to have much in the way of consistency. While the messing around in hyperspace graphic is brilliant the rendering of the finite probability machine party is in a completely different style from anything else it seems.Perhaps the biggest gripe of all though is that the Golgrafringham B ark is completely missing. I've always considered this essential to the book and to Douglas Adam's vision  the earth as a huge computer with an equally huge flaw In this film then the Earth is what it is supposed to be and it is the universe that is chaotic and arbitrary. Adam Douglas's genius was to mimic what he saw on earth on a grand galactic scale and this film glosses over his inspiration.Is it as good as it could be? Definitely no. The directors have been brave enough to take it on and they should be given credit for that but you do wonder if it would have been sharper if Douglas had been around to see it through. Overall I'll give it 5 out of 10. 6 maybe if someone goes on to invent that bread cutting knife".

I was unfortunate enough to have free tickets to a preview screening last night and I had honestly been looking forwards to it and went with an open mind. Five minutes into the film my mind was beginning to shut down from sheer despair.To start with oh Gods where to start?  all of Adams' witty dialogue has been excised and replaced with truly lame oneliners and slapstick. Yes you can definitely see the Disney influence.All of that wonderful nonsense which made the radio series and the books and the TV version what they were has disappeared forever into the void. The story as we know it has also been savaged to the extent that whilst most of the main characters remain  broadly  the same you might be forgiven for thinking you had mistakenly wandered into a screening of Galaxy Quest meets Spaceballs. Whatever it is it is NOT Adams.Gone is the excellent exchange between Arthur and Mr. Prosser gone is the philosophy of the towel gone Milliways and Disaster Area and the B Ark and don't even ask me about the Infinite Improbability Drive! Instead we have slapstick and a level of humour which might have been OK for The Love Bug but is sadly deficient for this material.There are three redeeming features which enabled me to give the film a rating of two rather than a negative score namely Mos Def's performance as Ford Prefect which given the bathetic level of the script was excellent.Bill Nighy's portrayal of Slartibartfast which was IMHO even better than Richard Vernon's.The whole Magarathea shuttle sequence which is visually stunning and easily the best part of the film.Sadly these were mostly effaced by the film's defects and as a lifelong his not mine Sam Rockwell appreciator all I can say is Sam less is more. It's easily his worst performance ever. On the whole with the exception of the three caveats above I would expect anyone who had a hand in the production of this film to be deeply deeply ashamed of what they've done to one of the funniest works of fiction ever produced. Lets leave aside the utter mangling of Adams' philosophy and the fact that the director completely missed all the salient points of this the film JUST AIN'T FUNNY. Hardly a ripple of laughter disturbed the silence of the cinema last night and people leaving afterwards exhibited the same shellshocked expression that I'm sure was plastered on my face.I left the cinema feeling that something precious had been utterly despoiled  not helped admittedly by the fact that the opening of the M77 had meant travelling both ways at 7mph. If you love HHGTTG savour the existing versions for if you watch this they will be tainted by it's banality.".

I saw the film last week and after having seen the television adaptation as a child I did not have my fond memories shattered. The eccentricity of the story and characters have remained intact and the Monty Pythonesque humour has been enhanced with even more surreal flights of fancy.

I saw the film last week and after having seen the television adaptation as a child I did not have my fond memories shattered. The eccentricity of the story and characters have remained intact and the Monty Pythonesque humour has been enhanced with even more surreal flights of fancy.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good and faithful recreation of Adams' brilliantly sketchy radio series. Not surprising as Adams wrote the screenplay and was on the verge of having his dream realised when he suffered a fatal heart attack. A fitting credit at the end of the film For Douglas serves as a gentle reminder of the genius we have all lost. As for the film many of the original and wonderful lines thankfully remain and the plot is largely unchanged. There's a new character or two written in for the film by Adams himself and they add to the overall story. John Malkovich is great albeit very briefly as religious leader Humma Kavula. Sam Rockwell Mos Def and Martin Freeman all carry off their characters with wit and style whilst I felt Zooey Deschanel looked a little out of her depth. At times her dialogue seemed to get lost and her character seemed weaker than Sandra Dickinson's interpretation in the radio and TV series. Bill Nighy marries his own idiosyncrasies into the character of Slartibartfast seamlessly. Simon Jones makes a welcome cameo appearance as a holographic warning system. Stephen Fry steps well into the shoes vacated by Peter Jones as the Guides voice and you feel as if you are in safe hands. The Guides animated sequences are wonderfully reminiscent of Saul Bellow and though simple they are hilarious. For a feature directorial debut Garth Jennings does a grand job. I was half expecting the pop video influence to be apparent but thankfully it wasn't. Lastly but not leastly a special mention has to go out to Jim Henson's creature workshop this is probably the best work they have ever done in a feature and that's saying a lot given their success.".

Unfortunately the title sequence is one big inside joke. Those knowing the story will enjoy it for what it is. Newcomers will be totally lost.And the book itself is introduced almost as an afterthought. What few references used from the book are humorous it is not a big part of the tale. Stephen Fry does a fine job as the voice of the book but too little time is spent.Arthur Dent is played as a lovesick man not the confused and befuddled Brit from the book. His biggest problem is not that the Earth has been destroyed but that he lost the girl.That girl is Patricia McMillan or Trillion. She is played by Zooey Deschanel. But unlike all that we know she has no reason to be here. We know nothing about her except that she is the object of Arthur's affection.So how do Arthur and Trillian meet? Ford Prefect a friend of Arthur's rescues him by using a ring device that signals space craft of a hopeful hitchhiker. So just in the nick of time. Unfortunately the movie doesn't explain why they get picked up only to get tossed off.And like in the book they get picked up the second time by President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox. Why is he President of the Galaxy? The film only says because he won an election. What does the President to? According to the movie sign his name to things.Zaphod is played by Sam Rockwell. And Zaphod does have two heads well faces would be a better term. This makes the interaction of the two heads impossible. The three arms does work like we would expect.And the story is now completely different. Fans are going to miss some of the best lines. No mention of bricks. No mention of being drunk. And the biggest waste of time is the towel. It is never explained for its importance a book reference would be great and it is far more prominent than it should be.There are some humorous gags with the Heart of Gold spaceship but it is nothing like described. Marvin the robot is odd looking without the overwhelming limitations that is Marvin's life.So what is the plot? None that I can see. Just a lot of stuff happens. But unlike what fans know there is a forced plot line with Trillian being captured by the Vogons just so she can be rescued.What a waste that this movie is. Arthur Dent is not overwhelmed. Ford is not the happycolucky researcher. Zaphod is obnoxious as opposed to adventurous. And Trillian is boring.Save your money. If you liked the books you will hate this movie.

	schema:headline " Surprisingly fun '80s witchcraft romp";
	schema:reviewBody "The Devonsville Terror focuses on a small town in New England where three women perceived to be witches were executed in 1683. 300 years later a mysterious woman Jenny Suzanna Love arrives in town as the new school teacher. She seems to be a student of the feminist movement which doesn't sit well in these parts. Little has changed in Devonsville the one room schoolhouse has a class of about 20 kids and still has a fireplace and the people still seem to have retained a colonial mindset. The arrival of two other women a scientist and a female sex radio host gets the townsmen riled up and curious as to whether or not the witches have returned reincarnated. Meanwhile a doctor Donald Pleasance spends all of his screen time pulling worms out of his arm and studying a curse bestowed on his family linked back to the executions.I'm not even going to get into Uli Lommel's filmography of the past decade because it truly is that bad but I will stand up for him on two counts because he did make two decent horror films in the '80s this and The Boogeyman 1980. The Devonsville Terror plays out like a Halloween TV movie of the week and draws from historical occurrences such as the Salem witch trials. Because of this the script is actually pretty informed and intelligent in terms of logistics. It's a Lommel film so some coherence has either been lost in editing or was never entirely present to begin with but overall it's a mostly cohesive picture.It's obvious from the getgo that this film's thematics are rooted in feminism and it acts as a reiteration of the modern issue of cultural progress vs. tradition which for a horror film is a bit sophisticated. All three of the modern female characters who enter the town represent three things that much of conservative America fears feminism sexuality and science. That alone sets this film apart for me and elevates it above most horror fodder. Thematically this film is far elevated above what it need be.As for the horror it's not scary. There are a few spooky shots and some really cool camerawork the kaleidoscopic flashback shots of the witch executions are the things horror classics are made of but I'd say it's more atmospheric than anything. It has the autumnal New England setting down to a tee and is a perfect OctoberNovember watch. The opening scene in the film where the witches are executed is perhaps the best scene in the film and really sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Not only is it well shot but it's also well acted and actually still fairly shocking.The acting in the film is not great but is good. Suzanna Love plays the vulnerable educated schoolteacher and has a gentleness that juxtaposes nicely with the harsh judgmental nature of the townsfolk who seem to be against her. Donald Pleasance has little screen time and spends all of it in a single setting pulling worms out of his arms which is apparently the result of a curse by the witches tracing back through his paternal lineage but he's a pleasure to watch as always.Overall The Devonsville Terror is a shocker for those who thought Uli Lommel never made a decent film. This is not a bad movie. It's actually on par or even above average as far as '80s horror goes and it is a thematically sophisticated genre film.

	onyx:emotionText "The Devonsville Terror focuses on a small town in New England where three women perceived to be witches were executed in 1683. 300 years later a mysterious woman Jenny Suzanna Love arrives in town as the new school teacher. She seems to be a student of the feminist movement which doesn't sit well in these parts. Little has changed in Devonsville the one room schoolhouse has a class of about 20 kids and still has a fireplace and the people still seem to have retained a colonial mindset. The arrival of two other women a scientist and a female sex radio host gets the townsmen riled up and curious as to whether or not the witches have returned reincarnated. Meanwhile a doctor Donald Pleasance spends all of his screen time pulling worms out of his arm and studying a curse bestowed on his family linked back to the executions.I'm not even going to get into Uli Lommel's filmography of the past decade because it truly is that bad but I will stand up for him on two counts because he did make two decent horror films in the '80s this and The Boogeyman 1980. The Devonsville Terror plays out like a Halloween TV movie of the week and draws from historical occurrences such as the Salem witch trials. Because of this the script is actually pretty informed and intelligent in terms of logistics. It's a Lommel film so some coherence has either been lost in editing or was never entirely present to begin with but overall it's a mostly cohesive picture.It's obvious from the getgo that this film's thematics are rooted in feminism and it acts as a reiteration of the modern issue of cultural progress vs. tradition which for a horror film is a bit sophisticated. All three of the modern female characters who enter the town represent three things that much of conservative America fears feminism sexuality and science. That alone sets this film apart for me and elevates it above most horror fodder. Thematically this film is far elevated above what it need be.As for the horror it's not scary. There are a few spooky shots and some really cool camerawork the kaleidoscopic flashback shots of the witch executions are the things horror classics are made of but I'd say it's more atmospheric than anything. It has the autumnal New England setting down to a tee and is a perfect OctoberNovember watch. The opening scene in the film where the witches are executed is perhaps the best scene in the film and really sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Not only is it well shot but it's also well acted and actually still fairly shocking.The acting in the film is not great but is good. Suzanna Love plays the vulnerable educated schoolteacher and has a gentleness that juxtaposes nicely with the harsh judgmental nature of the townsfolk who seem to be against her. Donald Pleasance has little screen time and spends all of it in a single setting pulling worms out of his arms which is apparently the result of a curse by the witches tracing back through his paternal lineage but he's a pleasure to watch as always.Overall The Devonsville Terror is a shocker for those who thought Uli Lommel never made a decent film. This is not a bad movie. It's actually on par or even above average as far as '80s horror goes and it is a thematically sophisticated genre film. Not only is it well made but it's also plain fun to watch. Definitely not something just anyone would enjoy but if you like your witches and ghouls served '80s TV movie style then The Devonsville Terror is prime pickings. 710.";

This town is your average smalltown where everyone knows your name 'cheers' style. Lommel does capture that smalltown feel very successfully and I found myself drawn into the complex web of ignoramuses inhabiting this town. The only smart one in my opinion was Dr. Worley Donald Pleasance Pleasance always provides an utterly fantastic performance in any work he does and he didn't let up in this movie. The ending is a perfectly blatant ripoff or homage if you will of the Raiders of the Lost Ark. You would think Lommel would pay homage to another slasher flick but oh well. Otherwise this movie wasn't too bad Suzanna Love is great as always but I wasn't to keen about her short hair what do I know? It was 1983 and I guess that was the big 'thing' then. Witch fans will love this flick no doubt. Peace".

Ulli Lommel and Susana Love are much better known for the Bogey Man but I like this one a little better. It is charming little witch story with some truly unintentional laughs thrown in i.e. the Convenience Store Guy. It is crudely produced but it manages to work up an understated feeling of mystery and tension.The supporting actors I assume many of them are local rural Wisconsin folk manage pretty good in earnest amateur way. Were there ever supposed to be witches in Wisconsin? In the town of Rhinelander there is a legend of a prehistoric dragon like creature called a hodag which has nothing to do with this movie but when I saw that this was made in Wisconsin it reminded me of a vacation from long ago. Anyway this movie is about the curse of Devonsville where a few hundred years ago some townsfolk slayed some witches in mildly horrific manner cue Rush's Witchcraft from Moving Pictures 1981. Fast forward to 1982 and some outsiders come to Devonsville and are perceived by the local intolerant inbred as evilsexya threat to their collective blandness. Menace ensues followed by an awkwardness. Will they also meet their doom in ways that mirror the earlier deaths or will they triumph over these dullard yokels?Susanna Love is great as the confused outsider. As is the case with The Bogeyman she exudes a certain naive warmth. Donald Pleasance is pleasing as always. Like Ms. Love he has a very mannered way of delivering his lines that is kind of fun. And the aforementioned towns people are obviously dedicated to the project if a little green. Say what you will about Ulli Lommell at least he made a solid effort with this little picture. Solid entertainment if you like this kind of thing.Going back to the Rush song is it possible that the filmmakers heard the song and thought it would make a good movie? Probably not.".

The script by Lommel star Suzanna Love  George T. Lindsey is very slow after the promising opening sequence. Nothing much happens until the very end  as a whole the film feels somewhat padded even at a short duration of just over 80 minutes. The script has an obvious  clear message about persecution  prejudice as the townsfolk of Devonsville convince themselves that Jenny Chris  Monica are the reincarnations of witches by jumping to conclusions being very small minded  set in their ways. Unfortunately this reasonable idea for a plot is poorly realised on screen with the entire film becoming a chore to sit through as nothing happens for long stretches most of the characters are underdeveloped  forgettable. There is also another problem with the story surely the original inquisition was right as Rebecca placed a curse on the town which means she was a witch! The same contradiction applies to the climax as well. One more thing when Jenny finds a snake in her bed that wasn't there earlier why does she not question it  who put it there? In fact it's never mentioned again as are many other little bits that happen here  there that are just dumped  forgotten about like Gibbs murdering his wife Sarah Louise Joanna Andruss  receiving a dodgy death certificate from Dr. Warley Donald Pleasence which is also totally ignored for the remainder of the film. The special effects are generally terrible especially when a ghostly apparition is seen  those laser beams coming out of Jenny's eyes at the end look awful. There are a couple of good gore scenes someones head explodes  another's head gorily melts in quite an impressive effect. The film was shot in autumn  is band colourless  dreary throughout. The cinematography is flat  unimaginative. The acting is poor even though he gets near topbilling on the credits Donald Pleasence has nothing more than a cameo as Doctor Warley who never leaves the confines of his comfy wood panelled office! Inbetween bouts of removing maggots burrowing into his skin with tweezers he hypnotises the locals to gain information on the curse  then just disappears from the film completely. Overall I think The Devonsville Terror is a poor film that I personally found incredibly boring  uninteresting. I can't really see anyone getting much entertainment from The Devonsville Terror I certainly didn't  therefore I cannot recommend it. Probably best to give this one a miss!".

There are a couple of good gore scenes someones head explodes  another's head gorily melts in quite an impressive effect. The film was shot in autumn  is band colourless  dreary throughout. The cinematography is flat  unimaginative. The acting is poor even though he gets near topbilling on the credits Donald Pleasence has nothing more than a cameo as Doctor Warley who never leaves the confines of his comfy wood panelled office! Inbetween bouts of removing maggots burrowing into his skin with tweezers he hypnotises the locals to gain information on the curse  then just disappears from the film completely. Overall I think The Devonsville Terror is a poor film that I personally found incredibly boring  uninteresting. I can't really see anyone getting much entertainment from The Devonsville Terror I certainly didn't  therefore I cannot recommend it. Probably best to give this one a miss!";

Almost every two minutes some character acted in a way that weirded me out. What was made into a 90minute film should have been a Twin Peaksesque television show. The only thing really missing in this film is a woman talking to a log. Were there plot holes and other flaws? Sure. The laser beams from the eyes were a bit unusual and the weekly meetings with the drunk priest and the unexplained need for hypnotized people to be naked and the obvious fact the wormy arm was not a real arm... but I digress. A fine film ion its own right  6 out of 10.".

The film is so cheap the producers don't seem to have even been able to afford to pay more than one of the female actors to go topless blowing the budget instead on pulling unconvincing maggot stunts and a laughable torn by dogs sequence stealing the melting head scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' having a ghostly horribly burnt face with a full head of hair float around and making the heroine shoot laser beams out of her eyes! An unintentional murder apparently releases the vengeful spirits of  three women brutalised hundreds of years before the superstituous horriblycliched small town hicks naturally think the spirits have taken possession of three female outsiders a radio broadcaster an environmentalist and the newlyappointed school teacher who hitchhikes into town and falls foul of the townsfolk by telling her pupils that the Babylonian chief god was a woman. Eventually after some extended film time where nothing very interesting happens the locals decide to do them in. All the while the village doctor is trying to purge Devonsville of its curse by exposing his patients to seemingly meaningless hypnotherapy that exists only to allow more lame scenes of women being victimised.

I admit it's not among the worst of Lommel's movies. Lommel does manage to generate a little atmosphere  you really feel the cold and isolation of this small town. And the opening sequence is okay. But after that opening sequence is over viewers will have to suffer through the next sixty or so minutes with practically NOTHING of significance or importance happening. Eventually things do start moving a little again but as it turns out this last part of the movie is too little and too late.

The soundtrack is also quite good and gives the film an eerie quality. I particularly like the scene where Walter Gibbs' face melts the special effects are primitive but cleverly done using wax melting in timelapse. That scene always gives me the creeps. The storyline despite its uncreative allows the characters to really show their true colors. Walter Gibbs' character specifically is quite gross and almost matches with his looks.

The idea of a witch coming back from the grave for revenge centuries after being put to death is not a bad idea but it's featured in too many films and it's rarely if ever done well. Despite sounding promising The Devonsville Terror is yet another bad example of this type of film. A big clue to this film being bad is the director  Ulli Lommel was the genius behind the awful Video Nasty The Bogey Man and it's even worse sequel Revenge of the Bogey Man three years later. His directorial skills didn't improve for this film either although it's probably a minor improvement over his last two. The film starts with the killing of three possible witches. Anyone familiar with this stuff will know what's coming next as the story advances three hundred years and there are three new women in town. Naturally it's no coincidence and pretty soon the villagers who seem to be stuck in the same century that the witches were originally killed in come to believe that three are back for revenge...One of the plot devices used in this film is a storyboarded voiceover in which certain things are explained. This sums the film up completely as the guy they got reading it sounds completely bored and the rest of the film carries on that same lacklustre tone. The standout member of the cast is Donald Pleasence who unfortunately carries on with starring in drivel theme that the formerly great actor started after starring in Halloween five years before this film. His character is the most interesting in the film and he suffers from a curse that means he continually has to remove worms from beneath his skin ...but still practices as a doctor. This is really the film's only good idea but it's not well done as the director simply shows the same bit of film again and again to portray it. The plot has several holes in it and it seems that Lommel didn't have enough money to complete the film as it is short and there's a lot left out. There's no atmosphere suspense or tension in the film which kills the horror elements and despite the odd splash of gore this is a very underwhelming horror movie that I would not recommend to anyone!".

Every woman is an innocent lamb trying to free herself from the shackles of servitude to her patriarchal oppressors in order to live a life of pure elation with her sisters while nearly every man is a misogynist creep and potential rapist. The men deride the women who turn down their advances as lesbians. God we are told was a woman until those nasty male supremacist monotheists came along and forced JudeoChristianity on everyone. The witch hunts were carried out by cruel sadistic men who had had their frail egos wounded by nonconformist women who wouldn't sleep with them.Interestingly all this didn't stop the director from including several gratuitous shots of his wife's breasts. Before watching this I had no idea that it was necessary to take one's shirt off to do past life regression. Sex sells everything I guess including feminist propaganda films.The movie had a rather different effect on me than what I imagine the writers intended because I actually found myself cheering when the men tied the feminist radio talk show host to the back of a truck and dragged her to death.Bad acting and bad special effects throughout with an ending rippedoff from Raiders of the Lost Ark.About the only redeeming thing about this movie was that some of the outdoor photography was nice though it might've been stock footage for all I know.".

The witch hunts were carried out by cruel sadistic men who had had their frail egos wounded by nonconformist women who wouldn't sleep with them.Interestingly all this didn't stop the director from including several gratuitous shots of his wife's breasts. Before watching this I had no idea that it was necessary to take one's shirt off to do past life regression. Sex sells everything I guess including feminist propaganda films.The movie had a rather different effect on me than what I imagine the writers intended because I actually found myself cheering when the men tied the feminist radio talk show host to the back of a truck and dragged her to death.Bad acting and bad special effects throughout with an ending rippedoff from Raiders of the Lost Ark.About the only redeeming thing about this movie was that some of the outdoor photography was nice though it might've been stock footage for all I know.";

Lead Love was married to Lommel at the time and apparently writing the checks with both players fresh off the success of THE BOOGEYMAN 1980. She is probably the main appeal here. The end is pretty amusing as Jenny is revealed to be a witch with superpowers and she causes heads to roll explode and melt. Then she splits town with her relationship with Matthew left with no resolution and a guy trying to ape Pleasence's voice doing a voice over. Pretty sure Pleasence did one day of filming as all of his scenes are shot in the same room and he is wearing the same outfit.

Gladly there's an unpleasant side cooking up some hokey lowbudget makeup FX with icky and overthetop sideeffects. Add a dash of gratuitous topless nudity too. There's an effectively bloody gore scene or two and laser eyes?! at the end but it's all soon but forgotten with an uninspired ending. Watch as an memorizing Donald Pleasance slums about in a role which he spends most of the time picking out maggots from his arm due to a witch's curse or hypnotizing patients to recall those good old times of witchburning in Devonsville to hopefully rid him of this curse. The obscure superstitious framework manages to paint all shades of greys and help settle in a disquieting atmospheric tone. The rural country setting oozes organic creepiness and an ominously crawling score is another added addition. The alluring Suzanna Love is nothing more than sound and others such as Robert Walker and Paul Wilson are droningly okay. Far from terrible just unwarrantably stilted modernday although there's reminiscent flashbacks of the past that we learn that there just might be a little more to the new teacher in town witchcraft nonsense.".

This is the definition of a cult classic.Jamie is what you call an Autistic child. Getting in trouble by running around in his underwear with a superman cape on at the age of 12 is rather unusual. He also has a good friend that being his Teddy his Teddy bear. He also has a few more friends. They live in a big hole in the ground. They are called trollalogs and they like to eat... people that is! When Jamie discovers that they aren't getting enough food and that they may die Teddy tells him he should start luring all the people that have been mean to him to the pit.This is such a strange movie. Originally I don't even think it was suppose to be a horror film. The idea of the pit originally was suppose to all be in Jamie's head but the directer didn't want to have such a serious approach. Thus we end up with the silliness that is The Pit. Not to say that the film doesn't have a few gory moments or not to say that this movie dosen't have a few decent scary moments in it because it does have a few very memorable scenes in general it is just hilarious though. Look for scenes like when Jamie is pushing an old blind lady in a wheelchair to the pit. If you don't laugh during that scene there is something seriously wrong with you.Anyway The Pit is an awesome film and if you are a fan of B horror I highly recommend this movie. 910".

Lehman's aided substantially in his goal to present Jamie as one deliciously deviant and depraved puppy by the strikingly obnoxious performance by homely and charmless child actor Sammy Snyders With his stringy build bumpy nose grating raspy voice and unsightly salad bowl haircut Snyders qualifies as one of the most grotesquely offkilter and unsympathetic murderous little twerps you will ever see in a fright flick.

	schema:reviewBody "You got problems check your nearby woods and maybe they'll be solved. Twelveyearold Jamie is a strange sexually obsessed loner whose only real friend is a sinister scheming stuffed teddy bear that talks to him. He has secret that in the nearby woods he finds a large hole in the ground which harbours a pack of prehistoric beasts known as troglodytes. He doesn't know what to feed them until reads up on them and learns they're carnivorous. So those people who have harassed him or got on his bad side will soon find out about Jamie's secret. However he did tell his secret to one other the attractive babysitter looking after him since his parents have gone away but maybe that wasn't such a good idea.The Pit is a very peculiar but hypnotic bgrade l drivein rural psychokid outing that's a lot of fun. If you enjoy something rather twisted senseless and perverse with a dark sense of humour. What it really has going for it is the extra creepy and disquieting performance of Sammy Snyders as Jamie. He striking visual features standout and he superbly plays a disturb mindset as if he entirely lives in his own world along with his teddy. Quite a seedy little teddy but still don't know if its because of his imagination or if it was possessed due to one sequence which has its head moving with Jamie being nowhere in the scene. The dialogues between the two are dementedly funny but still there's a real sincerity about it. The lovely Jeannie Ellis plays the concerned babysitter who tries to communicate and understand him but she finds out he's truly a little monster. Director Lew Lehman plays it as it is never trying for anything truly clever.

There's a little touch sleaze the voyeuristic peeping and blood and gore but the killings mainly happened offscreen some moments were quite ribtickling with how certain people just don't seem to see the pit before taking the trip in and monsters are nothing more than cheesy costumes with the striking element being the glowing eyes. Most of the time they're in a dark pit until later on when they come to the surface to cause havoc. The music score is sweepingly full of life but terribly overwrought and the final shot ends on such a perfectly foreboding and ironic note that goes down so well.".

	onyx:emotionText "You got problems check your nearby woods and maybe they'll be solved. Twelveyearold Jamie is a strange sexually obsessed loner whose only real friend is a sinister scheming stuffed teddy bear that talks to him. He has secret that in the nearby woods he finds a large hole in the ground which harbours a pack of prehistoric beasts known as troglodytes. He doesn't know what to feed them until reads up on them and learns they're carnivorous. So those people who have harassed him or got on his bad side will soon find out about Jamie's secret. However he did tell his secret to one other the attractive babysitter looking after him since his parents have gone away but maybe that wasn't such a good idea.The Pit is a very peculiar but hypnotic bgrade l drivein rural psychokid outing that's a lot of fun. If you enjoy something rather twisted senseless and perverse with a dark sense of humour. What it really has going for it is the extra creepy and disquieting performance of Sammy Snyders as Jamie. He striking visual features standout and he superbly plays a disturb mindset as if he entirely lives in his own world along with his teddy. Quite a seedy little teddy but still don't know if its because of his imagination or if it was possessed due to one sequence which has its head moving with Jamie being nowhere in the scene. The dialogues between the two are dementedly funny but still there's a real sincerity about it. The lovely Jeannie Ellis plays the concerned babysitter who tries to communicate and understand him but she finds out he's truly a little monster. Director Lew Lehman plays it as it is never trying for anything truly clever. While its lowscale restrictions show it up at times don't know why it began with a scene that shows up later on but Lehman's vivid creativity shows in sequences along with the meanspirited vibe and immensely unpredictable nature.

	schema:reviewBody "Strange movie filled with bad acting and unsettling images. Story basically is about a lonely 12year old kid who is picked on by people in his neighborhood and has a crush on his livein babysitter. He does creepy stuff to get her attention watching her sleep while her boob hangs out sneaks in the bathroom while she showers feeds her boyfriend to monsterswhoops I'm not there yet.... He also talks to his worn and torn teddy bear that talks back to him. Before long he announces to his babysitter that he knows of a hole in the woods that holds 4 monsters he calls Tralalogs. The middle of the film has the kid feeding his enemies to the beasts and the last 20 minutes has the police hunting for the Trogs after the kid lets them escape. This movie jumps around a bit. I feel there were some problems with the script because the whole thing unfolds like it suffered from last minute script changes. Subplots are brought in and out of the movie to no avail and the first 75 minutes is more like a character study on a perverted little kid rather than a horror film about monsters in a pit. The horror elements take a back seat until the last 20 minutes. However I do enjoy this movie. The acting is absurd and overacted. Some of the things the creepy kid does holds attention and some of the lines in this film are wackyfunny person I'm gonna look at these a lot...etc.etc.. The shocker ending is okay and there are some good moments when the beasts escape the hole.For some reason the main characters are not included in the last 20 minutes and the lead girl is unexpectedly offed them script changes I'm sure.There is no blood until after the 75 minute mark. And why do those people just walk into the hole? It's a big hole! How could ya miss it? Not bad but I would like to know what the original script was like. Two and a half stars.".

This movie is about a rather unique boy who has conversations with his teddy bear.  This is really one of the more stranger aspects of this movie.  You are led to believe he is just having imaginary conversations with the bear but in one scene the teddy actually turns its head.  This aspect of the film is never explained in any kind of detail.  For the most part it is about the boy having a crush on a woman.  This boy also has a rather dark secret.  He knows of a pit of monsters near where he lives and he feeds these monsters. What does he feed them you ask?  Why people that tick him off of course.  It is rather funny seeing him find ways to feed the monsters the best being the football scene.  After awhile though the kid actually frees the monsters from the pit where they then go on a rampage.  A good movie as long as you don't take it to seriously and the ending is good too.".

The second time was on another Saturday on our then Fox affiliate WATL.  Like any traumatic experience that defines one's life from then on I have a great lovehate relationship with this movie.  The second time I saw it was like looking through a photo album from an extremely romantic and cherished relationship...albeit with the eating of human beings a teddy bear with an oscillating head snakes frogs abuse of the handicapped elderly childhood cruelty jealousy and lust.  This movie really is quite effective.  The composition of the shots works well the movie is technically competent the acting...is creepy.  As mentioned previously Sandy is almost just as unsettling a presence as Sammy. Personally a couple of my favorite characters are the cartoonishly prim librarian check out those glasses and her buttugly daughter who laughs hysterically at Jamie.  Oh yea who can forget the beginning scene with the Halloween party and Jamie getting punched in the face and being laughed at. This film has a...rawness too it that's hard to put into words.  It's more disturbing than most movies with twice the dialogue twice the names and twice the violence.  You must see it.".

He has no friends save for 'Teddy'his teddybear that talks back to him... and some trolllike creatures that live in a pit in the woods. He's also a bit of a pervert and has an unhealthy obsession with his latest livein babysitter. When Jamie runs out of money and can't afford to provide his trollbuddies with meat from the local grocerhe turns to the locals that have wronged him as a new source of food for the pit dwellers... THE PIT is one of those seriously 'what the f!ck' type films that really makes you wonder what types of psychedelic drugs the writers were on to come up with such a story. There's no shortage of bizarrity going on in this one. The talking teddybear some alluded to incest themes 'do you know why my mother washes me so much? Is she really trying to make me clean? Do you like washing me???' Jamie's overall creepy nature pit trollsthe list goes on. The kid that plays Jamie is surprisingly good in his role as the freakish outcastand his ability to switch from vulnerable and almost sympathyinducing to deranged and homicidal onthefly is pretty noteworthy. My only real problem with THE PIT is there are parts toward the middle and end that are I hope intentionally 'funny' and sorta kills the mood at timesand the parts toward the end where the trolls get out feels a little disjointed compared to the rest of the film though the very last scene is priceless and suitably twisted. There's very little gore to speak of and just a few quick titty shotsso don't expect anything in terms of graphic sex or violence. In the case of this film thoughI was entertained enough that I didn't really notice itand for onceI'll go so far as to say that the film didn't suffer from the lack of graphicness. Definitely an oddball of a filmand since I tend to dig the 'evil kids' subgenre I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

Jamie has also been feeding all the people who have been nasty to him to the Trogladites but noone is safe as he soon runs out  an alternative source of food must be found...This Canadian production was directed by Lew Lehman  I think I'm safe in describing The Pit as a one of a kind film oh  I loved it as well! The script by Ian A. Stuart is just downright weird from prehistoric monsters living in a hole to talking Teddy bears from the perviest 12 year old ever to him getting sweet revenge on everyone by feeding them to the Trgoadites. Some of the things Jamie gets up to are amazing porn under his bed he seems to get a crush on every woman he meets he tricks a woman into taking her top off so he can take photo's of her by telling her that her daughter has been kidnapped he drops something on the floor so he can crawl under the kitchen table  look up girls skirts he psychically talks to his Teddy bear who seems to be alive as it moves it's head on it's own  orders Jamie to do nasty things while he has no conscious at all about who he lets the Trogladites eat from the little girl who lives next door to an old lady in a wheelchair who Jmaie wheels into the pit! What's more is that I absolutely loved every demented twisted bizarre weird wacky  downright imaginative second of it! It moves along at a nice pace  is never dull or boring far from it as the little pervert Jamie is always up to something. I loved the ending as well as Jamie has the tables turned on him  I was glad that some of those Trogladites survived now all we need is for someone to make a sequel. It's different it's not full of clichs it's both interesting  disturbing it's solid exploitation of the highest standard I couldn't take my eyes off it  I just found it immensely entertaining. The Pit is the sort of film they just don't can't or simply won't make these days!Director Lehman takes the whole thing extremely seriously although I doubt many in the audience will I loved the eerie atmosphere to it  The Pit has that wonderful sleazy horror vibe to it it has a certain childhood innocence to it with the way Jamie speaks  acts which makes the film even creepier. The monsters themselves look OK their shown in quick flashes rather than lots of closeups or lingering camera shots. There's a decent amount of nudity  more gore than I had expected there's some great shots of the monsters biting chunks out of people's flesh  eating people's intestines there's plenty of blood as well.Technically The Pit is very good the special effects have that 80's feel to them but are more than acceptable it's competent  generally well made throughout. The acting was spot on that kid Snyders who played Jamie is just evil itself! He plays Jamie to perfection  I'm getting creeped out just thinking about him.I loved The Pit I just loved it. It's as simple  straight forward as that folks The Pit definitely isn't for everyone that's for sure but if you like your horror films slightly twisted then The Pit is for you. Highly recommended track a copy down at once...".

Some of the things Jamie gets up to are amazing porn under his bed he seems to get a crush on every woman he meets he tricks a woman into taking her top off so he can take photo's of her by telling her that her daughter has been kidnapped he drops something on the floor so he can crawl under the kitchen table  look up girls skirts he psychically talks to his Teddy bear who seems to be alive as it moves it's head on it's own  orders Jamie to do nasty things while he has no conscious at all about who he lets the Trogladites eat from the little girl who lives next door to an old lady in a wheelchair who Jmaie wheels into the pit! What's more is that I absolutely loved every demented twisted bizarre weird wacky  downright imaginative second of it! It moves along at a nice pace  is never dull or boring far from it as the little pervert Jamie is always up to something. I loved the ending as well as Jamie has the tables turned on him  I was glad that some of those Trogladites survived now all we need is for someone to make a sequel. It's different it's not full of clichs it's both interesting  disturbing it's solid exploitation of the highest standard I couldn't take my eyes off it  I just found it immensely entertaining. The Pit is the sort of film they just don't can't or simply won't make these days!Director Lehman takes the whole thing extremely seriously although I doubt many in the audience will I loved the eerie atmosphere to it  The Pit has that wonderful sleazy horror vibe to it it has a certain childhood innocence to it with the way Jamie speaks  acts which makes the film even creepier. The monsters themselves look OK their shown in quick flashes rather than lots of closeups or lingering camera shots. There's a decent amount of nudity  more gore than I had expected there's some great shots of the monsters biting chunks out of people's flesh  eating people's intestines there's plenty of blood as well.Technically The Pit is very good the special effects have that 80's feel to them but are more than acceptable it's competent  generally well made throughout. The acting was spot on that kid Snyders who played Jamie is just evil itself! He plays Jamie to perfection  I'm getting creeped out just thinking about him.I loved The Pit I just loved it. It's as simple  straight forward as that folks The Pit definitely isn't for everyone that's for sure but if you like your horror films slightly twisted then The Pit is for you. Highly recommended track a copy down at once...";

	schema:reviewBody "Jamie is a 12 year old boy that cannot seem to get attention from his parents or avoid getting picked on. Left home alone with the babysitter he begins to fixate on her. And when he discovers a pit full of Trogs maneating creatures he seeks his revenge on his bullies.Jamie is exceptionally creepy and wellacted by Sammy Snyders. Director Lehman effectively shows the child's abuse at the hands of his peers and how he is outcast. He is punched for wanting to join a club called a weirdo for admiring a young girl's bike and called a hippie by an old lady for just standing on a sidewalk. But there are the more disturbing scenes like when he talks to his Teddy and Teddy talks back! When his parents abandon him amidst his weird personality changes he begins to fall in love with his nubile babysitter Sandy. Sandy is cherub faced and acts just as angelic with her endless patience with the weird kid. There are a variety of scenes with Jamie hitting on Sandy. He sneaks in when she showers watches her sleep with her breast exposed because women never notice drafts! and makes her bath him in a tub because he is dirty.When he discovers the Trogs he notices that they like fresh meat. He begins buying meat wherever he can get it and then turns to people when the money runs out. Soon he is luring random mean people into the woods and then into the pit. He even hijacks an old lady in a wheelchair and pushes her through the city through the woods into the pit and then the cruises around in her wheelchair after.There is a cute scene where he has exhausted his resources meatwise and must feed the Trogs. He attempts to kidnap a cow but it won't budge. He talks to it and tries to convince it that it will die anyway so might as well be for his friends. It doesn't work by the way.Jamie begins to run into trouble when a pesky librarian notices his penchant for art nudes and animal husbandry carnivores. One scene of interest would be when he sneaks to her house phones in as a man that kidnapped her daughter and makes her strip in front of the window for him to take pictures! Produced by Amulet Pictures it clocks in at a solid 96 minutes with an Aspect Ratio of 1.851.Weird Fact The director's wife refused to let him shoot the nude scenes so the screenwriter shot them instead. The only shot involving nudity that the director was allowed to film was the skinny dipping scene and only because the actress was his daughter. Umm this sounds incredibly gross and creepy to me. Also this is the only film Lehman ever directed.Favorite Quote An 8 year old girl asks her mom What is wrong with boys? Is that boy Jamie crazy? They are all the same. Always stressing. DVD Extras Just the poster and some stills.Bottom Line The movie is a weird combo of a serial killer flick and a troll movie. Good acting plus the strange premise helps it to hold up well over time.Rating 710 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com".

Even my girlfriend gasped at the last scene and made me fill in every hole in the yard the next day. That did kinda suck but it was worth it and I'd do it again if needbe to watch this gem of a movie. Also worth a mention is the fact that Jamie looks like one of my old school chums and kind of acts like him too. You know the type. Talks to teddybears Spies on chicks whilst they sleep Blackmails librarians into stripping in front of picture windows Lures people into the woods and feeds them to hairy cannibalistic ape things that kinda look like that toothy creature from The Crate segment of Creepshow.

He's looked down upon and pretty much hated by the local people. But after he acted perverted on several occasions which grants the viewer with a handful of RANDOM GRATUITOUS BREAST SHOTS!!!! I called into question how I felt about him. And another thing that confused me was Jamie's demonic Teddy Bear which may have been the main character originally hence the film's original title Teddy. But I ignored that fact since it added to the feeling that maybe Jamie was crazy or just didn't get the love and appreciation he needed. And the Pit itself? It contains four flesh eating beasties that Jamie names the Tralalogs or Trolls but that isn't nearly as much fun to say. Jamie kind of treats the monstrous creatures as pets first feeding them beef he purchases with his babysitters money later feeding nasty people to the Tralalogs. All in all I liked this one. It's different it's strange and there are plenty of funny scenes and the occasional breast shot for the guys that keep it interesting. Plus it has a great but somewhat predictable ending. I don't know about anyone else but I'd certainly sit and watch it again.".

But due to jealous within his ranks he has a major fall. His ego and the law help him fall as well. Loosely based upon a true crime case.

	schema:headline " Great and massive real life gangster film from Hong Kong";
	schema:reviewBody "Poon Man Kit directed To Be Number One and it is produced by the famous Johnny Mak. The film is based on real life gangster in Hong Kong and this film reminds very much of Scarface but it definitely isn't any rip off since it's based on real and individual character too. Both films give same kind of message and have similar kind of elements and I really like these both. Ray Lui plays Ho the main character in To Be Number One who firstly is at the bottom like Tony Montana but soon begins to rise and reach the top in criminal world. Soon he is one of the chiefs in the criminal world and unfortunately for him betrayal and greed start to destroy his career and the lesson has begun..This film is very long it runs approximately 136 minutes which is pretty much for Hong Kong movie. Ray Lui is very professional and occasionally as manic in his performance as Al Pacino himself. Other actors are also fine and consist of many popular actors like Kent Cheng and Cecilia Yip. The theme of the film is the same as Scarface's and The Krays' for instance. All these films depict power and greed and how they are capable of destroying everything that has been reached. In Number One all the characters seem to betray and finally there aren't many that can be trusted on. Power and money corrupts and that has been the main theme in many great films before and after To Be Number One. Technically this film is brilliant and the director of photography is no less than Peter Pau himself. He made the incredible photography in films like Bride With White Hair and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon among many other films. The dust and blue smoke are hypnotically alive in this film and the same unique atmosphere lasts throughout the whole film. All the interiors and exteriors are extraordinarily shot and also edited. The magic created by camera in Hong Kong movies is almost impossible to describe with words and the result is always in these films something never or very seldom found in Western cinema. The film is perhaps little confusing at times but that is also typical in Hong Kong movies. There are many characters and plot turns and they are usually hard to follow and fully understand at first viewing. The viewer must be patient and concentrated when watching these Orient films. I don't think Number One is too long as there are many important segments that demand long running time. When film is this professionally shot and made the long running time doesn't even come to mind and the film goes smoothly before the viewer's eyes without ever feeling too long.The violence is strong in this film but it is never gratuitous or too explicit even though a film this violent is not likely to come from Hollywood nowadays. The axe battle at the beginning is almost as brutal as the infamous chainsaw scene in DePalma's Scarface. Number One is very violent throughout the film but it serves only as an effective element to depict the mayhem and madness that takes place in the movie and inside its real life characters' heads. The scenes of action are again very professionally and excitingly shot and done and they really are unique when compared to other countries' efforts.I give To Be Number One 810 and this is very noteworthy piece of Eastern cinema.".

	schema:headline " The Rise and Fall of a Crime Lord  Through his eyes";
	schema:reviewBody "I did not see all of this movie as the video ran out of tape near the end but basically it is a retrospective life story of the Hong Kong crime lord Ho Ng. The movie was disturbing namely because it was a tragedy. We knew that in the end he would be in gaol which is better than dying but we can see all the way through the movie as he claws his way to the top that he is coming ever closer to disaster.Basically the movie chronicles the rise and fall of a crime lord. When the crime lord is a bad guy they seem to be untouchable and invincible but when we see the crime lord in this context we come to understand how vulnerable he really is. In fact through this movie we come to relate to Ho as he is the main focus. We have seen him at his vulnerable stage when he first came to Hong Kong and has he grows in power we see how shaky this power is.Ho's flaw is his greed and his arrogance. At first he works with another crime lord Por who comes from the same province as Ho did but soon they become bitter enemies not willing to concede to each other. Tiger Li the police officer who is under the pay of the crime lords attempts to reconcile them but Ho simply does not want to let his hatred of Por go away. Por never really did anything that bad it is just that Ho is over sensitive and simply did not want to laugh when Por poked fun at him. Even though it is bad for Por he seems much more flexible than does Ho so when Por is set up and sent to gaol he is released and back on top of things which Ho still holds a huge amount of animosity towards him.I guess this movie is a character study of a crime lord and how he claws his way to the top but is never truly satisfied. It also shows the failings of the capitalist system that people must turn to crime to succeed with those who have everything. The police who are paid badly receive lots of money to turn a blind eye to the crime lords.All in all this is not a bad movie though it is overtly long. While watching it we cringe as we watch it progress knowing that Ho is simply leading to disaster. He is living his life to fast and too extravagant and this life must end sometime. He is lucky that he lands up in gaol for then he is able to learn what life is really all about.".

Even so it is very much a Bergman film the visual style is distinct and the themes of appearances vs. reality the inability to correctly interpret another's behavior and the failure to understand one's self are very much in evidenceonly here to comic effect. It is in every way a charming film that Bergman fans will enjoy.Incidentally SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT was successfully translated to the stage as the musical A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC the score of which includes the famous Send In The Clowns.

	schema:reviewBody "Men as a gender do not come off well in Bergman's charming sex comedy Smiles of a Summer Night made only one year before his breakthrough hit The Seventh Seal. At the center of the film is Frederik Egerman Gunnar Bjonstrand pompous and selfassured as a lawyer but insecure and frightened by competition as a lover. His son Henrik Bjorn Bjelvenstam torn between the church and the bedroom is filled with selfhatred for even thinking about going to bed with Petra the maid Harriet Andersson. Another overthetop male character is Count Malcolm Jarl Kulle a poseur whose only response to his wife's infidelity is to challenge the paramour to a duel or a game of Russian Roulette.In Bergman's world men are childish selfish and arrogant. The women on the other hand are stronger more selfreflective capable of pandering to the male ego and to direct their affections elsewhere when the need arises. They suffer greatly however. Charlotte MalcolmMargit Carlqvist the Count's wife admits that she hates men and finds them repulsive with their hairy bodies but nonetheless is hopelessly in love with her philandering husband. She says that in any event a woman's view is seldom based on aesthetics. And one can always turn out the light. Set at the turn of the century Frederik is married to the very beautiful 19year old Anne Ulla Jacobson but their marriage has never been consummated even after the passage of two years. Though it remains unclear as to why this is the case nonetheless Frederik is not at a loss for romance taking up with a famous actress the equally lovely Desiree Armfeldt Eva Dahlbeck a relationship that began soon after Frederik's first wife died but never revealed to Anne. He confides in her in a way that he cannot with his young wife and she is a comfort to him though their relationship is full of bitter verbal thrusts and parries. Desiree on the other hand has a string of lovers and it is not hard to understand why given her fame beauty and rapier wit. One of them is the aforementioned Count Malcolm a ludicrous character with his military getup and macho posturing.The Count is also not averse to playing around and it turns out that he is also married to the stately and elegant Charlotte. He says that he can accept someone making overtures to his wife but if anyone goes after his mistress he becomes a tiger. Later he says the exact opposite when his wife and Frederik have a go round. Oh yes Henrik secretly desires Anne and Petra well she's open to any offers. The situation could have deteriorated into farce but in Bergman's assured hand everything is resolved in a civilized and even graceful way at a gathering of all eight combatants at Anne's mother's country retreat. Here they all drink a mystery wine and sort out their relationships in a remarkably satisfying manner.Smiles of a Summer Night came as quite a surprise to me being used to the philosophical Bergman of Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal yet always with an added bit of humor. I found it thoroughly enjoyable an opinion apparently shared with Woody Allen whose film A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy mirrored it and Stephen Sondheim who based his musical A Little Night Music on the film. I can't remember when there was such a collection of beautiful women in one film. Not only do they look wonderful but act impeccably and say wise and witty things. Bravo Bergman!".

She can't have sex with himshe's too afraid. He knows and agrees to be patient. He also has a son from a previous marriage Henrik who is attracted to Anne. He's also attracted to the maid Petra. Then there's Desiree a former mistress of Fredrik who is now sleeping with Malcolm who's also married and still attracted to Fredrik. Got all that? They all end up spending a summer weekend at a beautiful house in the woods. Things come to a head.I've always wanted to see thisthe title alone is beautiful. I did see it in a revival theatre in the 1980sI hated it. The print was lousy and edited! During a fairly explicit for 1955 talk about sex the subtitles disappeared! Just saw it againunedited and in pretty good shape. While I don't think this is a masterpiece I'm not a Bergman fan I did like this.It is funnybut pretty subtle. The relationships are all complicated but you do have them straight by the end. What's really good about this film is how Bergman treats and shows his female characters. Except for Anne but she changes they're strong stand up for themselves and find men and their ways amusingsome of Desirre's looks were very funny. Also in the form of Petra they want sex and have no problem letting men know. For 1955 audiences this must have been shockingPetra almost bares her breast and the sexual talk between women is very frank.The acting is good by everybody...but the film is lacking in romance. I never believed any of these characters loved each other. Also it's slowmoving but it all ends happily. So I did like itI give it an 8.Later musicalized by Stephen Sondheim as A Little Night Music and disastrously remade sort of in Woody Allen's A Midsummers Night Sex Comedy. Avoid that one at all costs.".

Woody Allen famously based A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy on this movie thus coming out as a Bergman fan.  Frankly I think Allen has more talent for comedy than Bergman but Smiles of a Summer Night has more depth and more interesting development of ideas than the Allen followup.  This movie is a typical comedy of manners and the plot is of little consequence  it has a few fun moments but the interest is in the acting and the ideas.  In terms of performances Gunnar Bjornstrand and Harriet Andersson are both superb  the rest are Bergman's usual suspects mostly of ensemble quality.  Perhaps it is Bergman's weakness with comedy but Eva Dahlbeck and Jarl Kulle who appear frequently in his comedies usually seem very weak to me.  Bibi Andersson is in this movie but I blinked at the appropriate moment so I missed her.  Sigh.The core ideas of the film that love visits few of us even fewer of us make a good fist of it most of us live lies andor make fools of ourselves in matters of love are examined well and in an enjoyable way.  The style of this comedy reminds me of Jean Anouilh's lighter plays which I suppose reflects the European style of the 1950's.  Most Bergman comedies have aged disgracefully but this one has aged gracefully and certainly has something.  Worth watching.".

The story is wonderfully sweet the characters are sharp and brilliantly played by the entire ensemble and the dialogue will make you chuckle throughout particularly Wifstrand as the dotty mother with the short attention span. As with all his work it's Bergman's insight into the universal frailties of human nature that makes the movie so touching we have a man who has married for beauty not love a femme fatale who is tired of twisting men around her finger young lovers who careen between ecstatic joy and suicidal misery a man who foolishly ranks his pride above all else and a selfloathing wife who can't stop loving a cheating husband. Bergman dances these characters around each other making his points with subtle skill and entertaining us with style and wit. The four Swedish female leads  Dahlbeck Jacobsson Andersson and Carlqvist  are all stunningly beautiful women.

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout a career that has spanned six decades Ingmar Bergman has not been known as a director of light comedies of manners. When certain landmark titles come to mind THE SEVENTH SEAL PERSONA I get images of deeply meditative poetry which through their iconic imagery often delve much deeper into the layers of his characters' hidden and exposed feelings and bring forth subtle yet multiple meanings to his unique stories. So when coming across one of his earlier works  SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT  with only the knowledge of it being the movie that brought him into international acclaim on the cusp of THE SEVENTH SEAL and little else I was prepared to view yet another of his ultraserious tapestries of reflection that would leave me thinking and thinking and thinking.However I was most surprised when from the getgo SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT opened in on a high note. A farce in the tradition of the most refined English or French comedies sharply influenced by Shakespeare it opens in on three couples about to realize who they are in relation to one another and to the person they are meant to be with. Frederik Egerman is married to Anne a woman about the age of his son Henrik. He has not been able to consummate his marriage to her because he prefers she remain a virgin. However he has a lover in Desiree a stage actress who reveals to him her son is also named Frederik for reasons that are clear to us even though she never verbalizes it. She is also carrying on an affair with Count Malcolm who is married to Charlotte though the last two probably look like they would rather be divorced as they seem to hate each other. At the same time Petra the maid is brazenly offering herself to Henrik  the woman literally oozes sex in every scene she's in.These characters converge at a dinner at Desiree's estate that she's planned because she wants to take matters into her own hand in regards to these people also because she has an invested interest at hand. Her mother has prepared a love potion and has served it to her guests who drink from it bringing forth unusual consequences to them all.Deliciously wicked from start to finish SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT crackles with kinetic energy a razorsharp script and strong characters. The men are all clueless of what is around them which makes for a splendid farce. The women on the other hand all fare much better in Bergman's movie since all are variations of female assertiveness which places them in a position ages ahead of the timeline of the story and therefore the ultimate controllers of destiny. Magic is a feminine science so it's appropriate when Desiree's mother  a woman who has a morbid sense of humor  dictates to her hapless guests the ingredients of her potion. Even Anne who at first shows signs of being much too sensitive for her own good toughens up quite a bit when Charlotte comes to visit and lets her in on her husband's affair by throwing it right back and effectively silencing her into dullness.A beautiful and quite touching comedy SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT is a movie that makes for a perfect introduction into Ingmar Bergman's work even when it's the only flatout slapstick he's directed and all of his movies following this one are much graver in nature. It features his trademark closeups of actors facing the camera all conveying more than their faces would register initially which has become the benchmark of Bergman's cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bergman's Smiles on a Summer Night is a delightful and mildmannered comedic effort studying love and the different natures of relationships those of opposing genders go through with one another in regards to feeling strongly for the opposite sex. It is quite the engaging piece observing the webs and complications created once one person's feelings for another takes over a film balancing those whom are married with former girlfriends they cannot rid their feelings of with young men wanting to begin relationships with married women whom feel for younger men despite being indirectly related to them to name but a few. It is quite the involving rather scathing film looking at people rich in attitudes towards culture and finer things but utterly devoid of any kind of sensible or moral outlook on sexual relations a quite brutal comedy covering people sneering down at those of a generational difference below despite those of whom occupy such a space are infinitely the more wellnatured and humanist amidst all the other fatuity.The film begins with a lawyer named Fredrik Egerman Bjrnstrand occupying his decorated office a rich space inside of a large and rich manor house in Sweden. From the manner in which his general location is decorated with props and items we can tell the man has a substantially large amount of money and appears both regimental and thorough in his business particularly when the time comes to speak to his younger son Henrick Bjelfvenstam who's a piano player is studying to become a priest and has feelings for both his motherinlaw Anne Jacobsson and a young houseservant called Petra Andersson. Egerman has tickets to an opera that evening instilling a sense of highculture about the man further embedded when it is revealed he will be watching a former girl friend of his within the show suggesting previous exposure to those working within an industry of such highend culture. Furthermore the actress he was once in a relationship with unfolded not so soon after a previous wife died thus implying a mentality of the man as one that enjoys the company of women.Frederik observes this actresscomeformer lover Desiree Armfeldt Dahlbeck on stage Desiree given a big build up as she lingers off stage by the characters within the play furtherstill characters within the film dialogue to do with the power she has over most men complimenting what will later transpire in the film as a whole her appearance on stage is greeted by an array of applause and she is the focal point of everybody's attention. Fredrik meets her backstage his once stiff and regimental demeanour made to look somewhat false as she bosses him about in her dressing room and later comes to look down and laugh at him at his drenched figure having fallen over once outside into a large puddle. Their relationship and knowing of one another will come to form a great part of Bergman's film. Cause for concern arrives in the form of a count named CarlMagnus Malcolm Kulle a man of militarian profession Desiree's current lover and a man whom verbally reiterates his credentials when it comes to conflict and disagreements when he talks of his rich and successful history in dueling and fighting he's also pretty handy with a fruit knife and barely even reacts to a gentleman in the form of Fredrik standing there wearing not much in his lover's dormitory such is his professionalism. He clashes with Frederik when CarlMagnus finds him in Desiree's backstage dressing room and Bergman frames them in profile with Desiree's beaming figure standing between them highlighting what or who it is they are essentially clashing over face to face.The film is deceptive in its initial beginning and surroundings the film not so much about a love triangle involving Fredrik this actress and her current lover as much it is about human nature's reaction toward love and firm relationships the sorts of relationships people get into with those of the opposite gender and the vast characteristics and mannerisms that define these relationships as perpetrated by those enacting it. Some are forlorn and forbidden some are comedic and rather quirksome others are defined by one man's general attitude towards women and its consequent points during which violence threatens to burst into life as a result of said separate attitudes. Bergam balances scenes of great drama and tension with that of lighter fluffier content rather well all the while maintaining focus of the film's core thesis and doing well to engross us in the different stories and strands each of the bevy of characters find themselves caught up in.".

On balance I found the adaptation remarkably faithful to Bergman with perhaps the character of Desiree's mother enlarged slightly and all the names and most of the situations retained. Not being so informed about Bergman and his oeuvre as I might be I had somehow formed the impression that he made this light comedy quite some time after and as something of a break from and a contrast to his early dark work like Seventh Seal so I was surprised to read here that Smiles in fact preceded Seal. It should not of course matter where a given title occurs in a filmmakers catalogue all that should matter is how well he made the film in question. Overall in this case I'd say pretty well. After a slight irritation of the clumsy exposition in which two of the clerks employed by the chief character lawyer Fredrik Egerman tell each other and us that 1 Fredrik has two tickets for the theatre where the star of the show Desiree Arnfeld used to be his mistress and 2 that he will be going with his new wife Anne who is half his age and leaving his son Henrik by a previous marriage at home it settled down into a well observed comedy of manners owing a little to a current American film Baby Doll in its central story of a child bride who refuses to consummate the marriage but then spinning off another series of lovers both starcrossed and otherwise. The cast reads like a roll call of the Bergman stock company Harriet Andersson Ulla Jacobsson Gunnar Bjornstrand Eva Dahlbeck etc and not unnaturally they play as an ensemble. As several other people have said here this is as good and as painless an introduction to Bergman as any.".

If it were not for those two aspects it would be easy to mistake the film for a plain drama. The reason for this is that there are no jokes or gags as such. Bergman injects into the script a few witty lines but I can only guess that some humour is meant to blossom from the film having a satirical viewpoint on love. A comedy does not have to be funny for it to be effective but if it is not funny it makes the comic aspects redundant. The characters are all developed around love and desire rather than their own character traits and there are a few others thing that one could complain about but either way the film nevertheless says a few things about love. As usual Bergman does a great job setting up all the shots. It is interesting stuff on a visual level with fitting lighting choices and some long pans. And as with just about every Bergman film it is worth a look. However it is difficult for me to recommend this awkward comedy as one of his better films even though it is the film that really brought Bergman into the spotlight.".

Back to Smiles of a Summer Night though I think it is well worth seeing for the title alone which is one of those touchingly poetic ones. But that is not the only reason to see the film. It is very elegantly made with beautiful scenery and cinematography and Bergman's direction is superb. The music is sweet and lilting the story is swift and charming and the writing is both thoughtful and funny. The leading ladies are not just sexy but they are all great actresses and prove so in their roles in particular Eva Dahlbeck who is appealingly mischievous and Harriet Andersson who is in a different role to Through a Glass Darkly and Cries and Whisperswhich called for a darker and more poignant style of acting but her sensuality really shines through here.

It would be a couple of years before The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries cemented his reputation as an international film auteur but looking back on this film over a half a century later and half a world away it only shows how differently tastes in humor can be. Compared to today's better film comedies this film is both more mature and more puerile in its approach to sex in that it treats its characters as intellectual beings yet also shows them as somehow reserved. Granted the film is set in turn of the 20th Century Sweden yet there is still an element missing in the film especially when compared to later films in the Bergman canon. That missing element would most likely be depth. Yes compared to even more 'intellectual' Hollywood comedies of recent vintage like Sideways Smiles Of A Summer Night is far deeper but there is truth to the old Woody Allen claim that drama is 'sitting at the grown ups table'. In fact Allen was so smitten with this film that he tried to do his own version of it a quarter century later in A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy. Of course his own film was one of Allen's lesser works. Yet so too is this film one of Bergman's lesser works. Stephen Sondheim also based his musical A Little Night Music on this film. The camera work by Bergman's first collaborating cinematographer Gunnar Fischer is stellar especially in the interior scenes where the whites radiate like novae in comparison to the pitch hues but the film is at its weakest in the characterizations. No unlike most modern fiction in film or prose it is not a failure for its reliance on the trite but for its simple lack of detail. The viewer is never drawn into the characterizations nor dilemmas of the main protagonists. This is certainly a flaw that dogs most comedies. Even the comedies of William Shakespeare are notably deficient in this area most especially his appropriately wretched A Midsummer Night's Dream. Yet even though this is the only real failure of the film it is enough to make this a rather tepid viewing experience especially for the refined Bergmaniac.".

She also presented NYC in no less passion than Woody Allen who's cited in the movie itself except she beautified the poormen's share and perhaps cast doubt on the rich though with much sweetness.2 Most of the movie is simple and easily appreciated. But those who know Cantonese get a real bonus. In fact Chow Yun Fat started out in TV shows making himself cool and noticeable via his unconventional and memorable use of the language  everything he said would be fashion for long long time some of those terms he invented are still being used. So the exact things he said were cutecoolclassic quotes again at least among the generations growing up watching him. It was unfortunate that back in those days foreign movies were not as well publicized and received in the western world so that his move to Hollywood was necessary for him to reach out to a wider audience. I have not seen him cast meaningfully since then ".

You will get an instant feeling of the lifestyles of New Yorkers and the city's rich and poor surroundings.The screenplay by Alex Law and ChiYeuh Low was captivating as it makes you eager to follow the story and has moments that capture your heart including the parts where Jennifer tries to make up to Pang for her childish behavior after her breakup with Vincent and when Pang helps cultureshocked Jennifer get adjusted to life in New York. The chemistry between the two are touching.In addition to the drama and romance there are bits of humor sweetness and lightheartedness in the story and make you appreciate the film and enables you to relate to the characters. Also Lowell Lo's music score is charming Mabel Cheung's direction is solid and the overall acting is superb. True talent is depicted here as Chow YunFat known for his action films can pull off real drama and Cherie Chung's acting is simply to the greatest degree.I don't want to reveal the story too much except to conclude that this is more of a movie where a woman meets a man and a special relationship forms.

	schema:headline " This movie is so desperate for a laugh that if it nudged you it would have broken a rib";
	schema:reviewBody "Annie Kristen Wiig is a lonely woman who works in a jewellery store and shares casual sex with Ted Jon Hamm. She is still reeling after her bakery closed during the recession. Her best friend that she's known for years is Lillian Maya Rudolph. Lillian announces that she's getting married and that she wants Annie to be her maid of honour. Annie is initially excited but then realises that she will be alone again. Worse still is that Lillian is using four other women to help organise the wedding including the dominating Helen Rose Byrne who she met less than a year ago. Helen and Annie compete furiously to outdo each other on the wedding plans but its Annie and her relationship with Lillian which comes off worse. Adding a little bit of joy to Annie's life is patrol officer Nathan Rhodes Chris O'Dowd as they start to slowly connect.'Oh my God! You're getting married!' If you enjoy this kind of shrieking along with references to various bodily functions and wedding parties so extreme they'd make royalty look mild you will like Bridesmaids. As someone who does not have any interest in these things I found Bridesmaids to be a film of two halves the first appalling and the second not much better. It's been directed by Paul Feig under the watch of producer Judd Apatow and many have touted this as a female version of The Hangover 2009. Although the misdirection of the comedy could be pinned on Feig the film was already on shaky ground because of the screenplay written by Wiig. She cowrote the film with Annie Mumolo and was also one of the producers herself. Wiig has a background in variety programs like Saturday Night Live and for worse it shows. Somewhere the rules of comedy have been forgotten. Comedy must exist in reality. Humour is funniest when we can imagine ourselves in similar plausible situations. There are very few scenes in Bridesmaids that feel honest or genuine. Too many moments play out like extended skits stretching plausibility with unsophisticated humour and little concern for developing theme. This movie is so desperate for a laugh that if it nudged you it would have broken a rib. I took zero pleasure from watching women defecate over a sink vomiting on top of each other or becoming boozy on an aeroplane.If these situations weren't distasteful enough smaller moments are undone by dialogue that lacks subtlety. Some lines of dialogue like when Annie talks to customers in the jewellery store are ridiculously blunt when they should have been loaded. It weakens the credibility of the characters and flattens the humour because we know people don't talk like this. Though taste in humour is subjective it's difficult to ignore the image problems rising in modern comedies. A lot of romcoms including this one are pushing a social view that if you are fat single or unmarried you are weird low in confidence and a failure. Wedding parties in films are also now so extravagantly realised that they have become a measure of success and social approval. Bridesmaids continues many of these trends taking every chance to deprive its characters of dignity. That is until Annie can find the ridiculously nice Irish bloke. In the second half the film at least tries to give Annie a recovery after hitting rock bottom but its views of friendship and renewal are simplistic and predictable. Like a lot of the film Wiig's comedic performance is so annoyingly exaggerated that it saps any chance of realism. But Chris O'Dowd as one of the film's few likable characters is mercifully restrained. A lot of women will see this because it gives them the rare centre of attention in a raunchy mainstream comedy. But is this really the best Hollywood can offer? If there's a Bridesmaids Part II I'm sending a nonacceptance card.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK. After seeing the previews of this movie it was added to the list of movies I did NOT have any intentions of seeing. However I heard so many great things about it I decided to give it a try. Let's just say my gut feeling was correct. I have NO idea what so many people found so amazing about this movie.It's not that funny. Yeah there were a couple of scenes that I found humorous and chuckled. However most of the funny scenes were either involving sex about sex about poopvomitfartingburping or a lame attempt at slapstick humor. Lots of predictable cheap shots. Seriously no sophisticated or classy humor... the whole film made me feel trashy honestly. I get that it's rated R but still. I felt like I was in an adult version of an equivalent to Spongebob at times.Small plot. This movie is slowly stretched out for over 2 hours with a plot that could easily be explained entirely with all important scenes in about 30 minutes. There were SO many long scenes that seem to be thrown in just so Kristen Wiig can score another laugh yet they don't progress the story. Quite a few plot holes and there were many scenes where I caught myself rolling my eyes thinking really? The greatest movies develop their characters so much that you literally feel for their outcomes. I left the theater with no regards to any of the characters in this movie because they were all so distant and underdeveloped. The plot was so weak and rushed for the next pointless comedy spiel that they didn't give the characters any depth except maybe the lead of Annie. I can think of 2 memorable scenes right now from this film and I saw it last night. Yeah there were some funny scenes but nothing worth raving about in my opinion.I do have to give Bridesmaids some credit. An allfemale leading role movie is very new in showbusiness especially in comedy. Sadly these women made the Hangover equivalent instead of raising the bar but they get Kudos for the efforts. There were some sweet moments in the movie that for me held the film from turning into a complete waste of money. I do like comedy but I prefer classier witty humor instead of the easy thoughtless humor. I would much rather watch a movie that evolves a character so much that the cheap shots aren't needed for laughs. If you liked The Hangover then you'll probably enjoy this movie..".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself wow this seems like the female version of the HangOver. While it was not along the same plot as the HangOver it was about the moments leading up to the wedding. At first I looked around the theater and noticed it was 95 women and I started to feel like I had made a mistake. But by the end I was pleasantly surprised that there was a lot good humor involved. Some of it would be considered guy humor but actually had all the women in the theater laughing their asses off. There is a bit chick flick element to it between the main character and a guy but it is such a small part of the movie that I would say it's about 85 comedy and 15 romancechick flick. So as a guy I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie. Most of these types of movies are about guys making complete asses out of themselves and you almost never see the same from women. Hollywood always likes to make women seem perfect but you see women making crude remarks about their own genitals and it's nice to see that women can be funny in this regard as well. I think this was a great movie for female humor because I have long thought that comedy was dominated by male actors and I am just waiting for some women to jump in there and start paving the way. Good job on this movie!".

The plot was a muddy hackneyed meandering mess the acting mostly soso and the subject matter includes graphic depictions of diarrhea and vomiting. If that's your thing you'll love it. All of the funny scenes were in the trailers. The protagonist was such a whiny loser I kept hoping that someone would bump her off.You know there's a problem when your bad girl comes off looking like a nicer and more sympathetic person overall. Anything that was supposed to be a joke or a funny situation was hammered home with a 15 pound sledge hammer and then repeated! This movie took over two hours to get to a place it had no business ending up I.E. a happy ending for Annie. Her redemption was way too little way too late and was contrived as hell. This movie is now my new standard for really bad bad waste of film. My wife wanted to see it based on trailers and the mostly good reviews. She had to cover her eyes during the bathroom scenes and found the whole movie to be one of the absolute worst she has ever seen. If you must waste 20 bucksroughly two tickets take a 20 bill shred it in a food processor then flush it down the toilet. Do this while eating popcorn and you'll have the same overall feeling of having seen this movie.".

	schema:headline " A hilarious and surprisingly touching comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "My friends invited me to a preview screening of Bridesmaids last night and I accepted the invitation with a sense of cautious optimism. The trailer for the film admittedly didn't do much for me but I was intrigued by the concept of a femaledriven Apatow film. Ultimately I went into the theater with modest expectations hoping to get a few good laughs out of it.By the time we came out of the theater my three friends and I had smiles plastered across our faces and we couldn't stop talking about the film for the next couple hours. We all loved it. I think it easily ranks with the best of the Apatow productions and it might even be my personal favorite. Like all of Apatow's productions there are admittedly scenes that arguably go a little too far or a little too long but that's a small criticism when the film successfully fires on so many other cylinders.To start with the film is hilarious and I think the comedy far exceeds the standalone bits shown in the trailer. Scene after scene is filled with humorous and often sidesplitting moments and they had the theater in an uproar during the screening. I can't say enough about Kristen Wiig. Prior to this I've always liked her to some extent but never really loved her. I think she's good at what she does but I wasn't sure her shtick could sustain an entire film. Would her passive aggressive wit get old? Is it the only note she can play? Can she handle anything more dramatic? Ultimately she blew me away in this film. Not only is she consistently and uniquely funny but her character is surprisingly welldeveloped and Wiig brings the character to vibrant and dynamic life onscreen.And this brings me to my next point about Bridesmaids the film has a surprising amount of depth that completely caught me off guard. Bridesmaids isn't a quickie 80minute gag fest by any stretch of the imagination it's actually a leisurely paced 2hour characterdriven comedy that takes time to develop its characters and establish the various relationships and resultant conflicts between them. Ultimately the film ends up being quite heartfelt and even rather sad in places. Despite the overthetop antics shown in the trailer the themes that the film explores are actually quite grounded. Kristen Wiig's character is someone who is feeling completely let down by life which is a place we've all been and the personal journey of her character resonated strongly for me. While her character is easily the most welldeveloped of the bunch even the other bridesmaids ultimately show some threedimensionality as well despite the fact that they are sometimes initially introduced as twodimensional caricatures.Ultimately Bridesmaids was one of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in a long time. It's certainly not perfect it could probably do with some editing there might be a few too many subplots some of which are left unexplored and it arguably goes too overthetop at times but everything else about the film works so well that these complaints are little more than nitpicks. While I applaud everyone involved in the production it is Kristen Wiig who deserves the most accolades. As cowriter and lead actress she plays a huge part in the film's success and I sincerely hope this film puts her on the Hollywood map as I would love to see more from her in the future. Whatever the case may be Bridesmaids certainly makes for a successful maiden voyage for her into the world of featurefilm comedies.".

	schema:headline " Not the movie the television ads set me up for....";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me begin by saying that I'm a man and that I went to see this movie with my wife not under duress I was looking forward to seeing it. Let me add here that in an almost full theater I counted four other men in the audience which would lead me to believe that I was definitely not the target audience for this movie. That being said my wife didn't like it either she actually disliked it even more than I did.All of the television promos I saw led me to believe that this was going to be a female version of The Hangover it wasn't not even close. Which leads to my first problem with this movie the advertising campaign was very deceiving. Pretty much all the funny scenes in the movie were included in the advertisements. What they didn't show was a very formulatic been done a dozen times chick flick about BFF's and wedding's gone wrong.I will say that the funny parts of this movie and they were few were very funny the scenes on the airplane were good and when Annie was trying to get the cop to help her find Lillian. And...that was pretty much it except for most of Melissa McCarthy's scenes with the exception of the one during the credit roll which was just kind of sick. The rest of the scenes that were meant to be funny either went on for much too long were bizarre or crude instead of funny or were just strained. A good example of strained was the bridal party all dancing at the end of the movie it didn't look natural or funny or like anything but a bunch of actors having been told to dance around and try to look like they were having fun some like Rudolf and Wiig very badly at that. If you have zero rhythm and can't dance don't put a dance scene in your movie. One example of bizarre was two of the bridesmaids just deciding to make out on an airplane for no discernible reason. Did Ms. Wiig think the guys in the audience would just enjoy seeing woman kiss?The rest of the movie was an overlong strained attempt to make a funny and touching movie all in one that failed at both. Some other major problems I saw The scene near the beginning of the film in which Annie and Helen try to top one another at the announcement party went on and on and on way past the point where it was funny and to the point were it became tedious and even uncomfortable to watch. In fact many of the scenes in the movie were like that they just didn't know where to stop.Kristin Wiig's character Annie progressed in the movie from being likable and funny to just being stupid and annoying. The scenes were she sabotaged the wedding plans either intentionally or unintentionally also ran way too long and were sad and annoying instead of funny. Ms. Wiig needs to learn that sometimes especially when the material is weak to begin with less is more.And while this may sound mean and petty I have to mention it because I kept noticing it over and over during the movie Maya Rudolph is just not an attractive woman and was just wrong for her role in this movie. She was not believable at all either as the bride to be or as the main characters best friend or as anything else. She is probably a fair sketch artist but she does not having the looks or the acting chops to carry a movie.All in all a disappointment firstly because we were snookered in by a misleading advertising campaign and secondly because the movie tried to be two things at once and failed miserably at both.".

Let me add here that in an almost full theater I counted four other men in the audience which would lead me to believe that I was definitely not the target audience for this movie. That being said my wife didn't like it either she actually disliked it even more than I did.All of the television promos I saw led me to believe that this was going to be a female version of The Hangover it wasn't not even close. Which leads to my first problem with this movie the advertising campaign was very deceiving. Pretty much all the funny scenes in the movie were included in the advertisements. What they didn't show was a very formulatic been done a dozen times chick flick about BFF's and wedding's gone wrong.I will say that the funny parts of this movie and they were few were very funny the scenes on the airplane were good and when Annie was trying to get the cop to help her find Lillian.

This is a chick flick for dudes... the antichick flick chick flick if you will.What I loved about this movie is that although you get a sense of the heart and charm it's not afraid to pull any punches just because the characters are female the scene in the bridal shop will be the topic of much discussion I assure you. I also loved the cast lead by the always awesome Kristen Wiig. She was perfect in this role and I hope she does more work like this. She can make me pee my pants with laughter and then straighten me right back up in a matter of seconds.I also loved the pacing of most of the film. Several scenes had just the right amount of awkwardness or pause or beat that really added an extra element of hilarity. There were several of those scenes where the audience was collectively cracking up almost violently so. People were wiping tears from their eyes and still relaying jokes back and forth to one another as they filed out of the theater.Anyway guys trust me.. make this the chick flick you surprise your girl with and take her to the theater. You won't regret it.".

I have never seen a comedy in a long time that was as consistently funny and I mean laugh on the ground with tears coming down your face funny as well as touching and for once genuine characters that you can relate to and have an instant believable bond and chemistry on screen that makes the ongoing crazy shenanigans all the more effective and hysterical. The showstopper scene stealing laugh riot Melissa McCarthy was fantastic and no wonder has her own sitcom and she should host or be apart of SNL or something she is so freaking funny I almost wet myself! Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig should make more comedies together and are much better than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler were in Baby Mama they are a comedy dream team and the rest of the cast is the cherry on top. The movie goes through typical issues from the average chick flick like jealousy insecurities narcissism cat fights selfdoubt selfpity selfdestruction you name it but it deals with those is a more honest realistic non sugarcoated way that was refreshing and smart from the norm and raises the bar so high for chick flicks which is more anti of that anyways and comedies in general that I personally can't see any comedy this year or in the future surpassing its comedy greatness it's golden!!! Overall if you were waiting for a movie that will truly make you laugh harder than you ever laughed before in the theaters in a long time your wish has been granted wear depends just in case because you might need them. Highly Recommended! The most satisfying comedy in the past decade that I never wanted it to end and forget about the overrated The Hangover and its unnecessary sequel and bring on Bridesmaids 2 already! 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie had reputable and wellliked actresses and staff I am a big fan of both Wigg and Apatow. This movie had a good budget for a film with no action sequences.However I will list for as long as possible the reasons why this movie sucked Air Marshall cock sandwich. 1 Expectations Don't make a movie and advertise it as Hangover with girls unless you are ready to deliver. Hangover was fastpaced and crazy with unexpected plottwists and turns around every corner. This was a leisurely comedy. The movie was like a chick flick but with jokes and poop. I should note that I came into this movie excited and with good expectations.2 The Lack of Characters Who was the focus of this Hangover with women movie? The maid of honor who's life just got worse and worse throughout the film. The bride who was a cardboard cutout placed into random scenes and referred to by a name. An actress would have been nice in that role. There was also the superrich and fake girl. None of those were original. The other three characters the ones who could have made the movie interesting and who I looked forward to seeing more of when they were introduced but then they did nothing at all. In Hangover the husband The boring one in the group wasn't even around Because he was boring and the movie was constantly doing gags and jokes with the three remaining characters. This made it good. In Bridesmaids the funny characters remained on the side and played no role in the movie This made the movie bad....3 Comic Relief in a Comedy? Why were the British siblings there? There is NO need for Comic Relief in a Comedy unless it really really sucks. In which case any comic relief you attempt to add is most likely also going to suck. Even if you liked the movie this was stoopid.4 The Formula. In a pityfest funny movie things need to start hitting the upswing between 12 and 23 of the movie. This movie went 100 minutes before the main character turned her life around and then ended 25 minutes later. The best movies break from the formula... for instance Groundhog Day follows this same formula. However this movie was already breaking the script when it decided to have 6 women make a funny movie. It should have stuck to the script the rest of the way through or else it risked sucking which it did. 5 The Pace. Here is another case where they did not follow the formula. Comedies don't have to have a great story... however let's not pound the audience in with a chickflick. Try to cover up the fact that this is a standard chickflick with jokes and fastpaced humor and do not let the pace drop bellow that of a HighSchool Prom Queen speech. This will make the audience think about the story... which was a standard chick flick script. 6 FeelGood Ending. The jokes do not end in a comedy until the credits roll. Just because the main character is happy again doesn't mean you take the humor from slow to stop. Oh and flirting dancing and a stupidly overthetop wedding do not count as funny. I guess this movie could be funny for some people. Stupid women who have never seen stupidmancomedy before may have liked it. Stupid men who didn't realize this was stupidmancomedy because there were some hot chicks in it Some.... And even stupider men who like the stupidman comedy probably liked it. Otherwise this movie sucked. I really can't describe it any other way. It just sucked. Badly.".

Maybe it a hysterical reaction to how dumb and how bad the Hollywood film industry is these days. I am annoyed that I paid good money to watch this rubbish. Do not believe the hype surrounding this awful rubbish. The women in this film are as truly disgusting as it gets if you like simple hackneyed rubbish about vomit bodily functions and all that simple morons find hysterical you will die laughing.

It's been about 5 months since this came to theaters and I finally sucked it up and watched it only to realize I was right about how awful it would be.I assumed it would be one of those movies where the only funny parts are the ones you see in the previews and I was right.The first thing that I found cheap tacky and unoriginal was the overweight woman was disgusting. Melissa McCarthy played an adorable and beautiful Sookie on Gilmore Girls so to be reduced to a farting blob that can't be sure if she's farting or burping is pathetic. And i couldn't tell if she was a masculine lesbian or not. She acted like a man but was attracted to men which made no sense.This movie is full of disgusting scenes trying to be funny rather than actual humor much like the Scary Movies.Neither Paul Feig Kristen Wiig nor Annie Mumolo had a creative bone in their bodies or an original thought in their heads. The bridesmaids dresses are hideous even though these days most brides choose nice dresses to make the whole wedding look nicer bad dresses aren't so common anymore. They all get food poisoning and the entire bridal shop scene is vomit worthy. The maid of honor surprisesurprise is upset about still being single so she shrugs her duties as MOH. And as always if you don't have anything worth while win over the audience with sex and profanity.The movie was the most unsophisticated you can get so far but lets give people a chance to beat it. It's not funny is disgusting and so implausible that you'd have to be an idiot or drunk to find it to be a quality comedy.The only funny part was... In conclusion I'm sure this movie is hilarious to its target audience of teenagers adults with lower than average IQs or viewers that are high or drunk. It may be for viewers of Jersey Shore and Jackass not viewers of Jeopardy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Annie's life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime best friend is engaged she simply must serve as Lillian's maid of honor. Though lovelorn and broke Annie bluffs her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect she'll show Lillian and her bridesmaids just how far you'll go for someone you love. C UniversalWhen I saw the trailer for BRIDESMAIDS I didn't see anything special with it. There were maybe a couple of good jokes in there but nothing really hilarious to make me wanna see it right away. However after the end credits rolled from a prescreening I went to I have to admit it It's freaking hilarious! To put this into perspective I don't like many modern comedies so this is saying a lot. There was one sequence in the film that was so funny and so shocking that I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in a film EVER! To say that the trailer doesn't do the film justice is an understatement. However on the up side the trailer doesn't show the funniest jokes in the film like most trailers for comedies do these days don't you hate it when that happens?.And no. BRIDESMAIDS is not a chick flick. There are some raunchy scenes in here that you have NEVER seen in any other film before. Let's remember this is a hard Rrated Judd Apatow production so this film shouldn't be taken very lightly. It's not to say that BRIDESMAIDS is one of the best comedies of the decade. In fact as much as I laughed throughout the film it does slow down after the first hour with the second hour not being nearly as funny as the first. Still I laughed out loud pretty frequently which is a feat hard to pull off on someone like me.BRIDESMAIDS is also pretty heartfelt. This is mostly due to the wonderful ensemble cast who are all fantastic in their own way. Kristen Wiig FINALLY gets the chance to shine in a starring role! Honestly this girl can carry a film on her own. Maya Rudolph was also great. Seeing the dialogue exchange between her and Wiig made their chemistry feel very authentic which is no surprise since they were in SNL together. It's also fun to see Rose Byrne in more comedic roles who was also in GET HIM TO THE Greek and this year's sleeper hit INSIDIOUS!!.I think an obvious audience favorite from the group of girls would be Melissa McCarthy. She provides some of the films biggest laughs and for a good reason. Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendonCovey are the remainders from the group and they were pretty good but they aren't as prominent as the other girls. There are also some guys in the cast most notably Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm. O'Dowd did a good job playing Wiig's love interest and you can pretty much see where this is going... and Hamm did well for the limited amount of screen time he had.Sure BRIDESMAIDS is predictable as hell but so are 99.9 of other modern comedies. However it's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid sexist or meanspirited. Overall it's just plain old entertaining hilarious and heartwarming. Who knew? Also with the HANGOVER with girls comparison BRIDESMAIDS is a much funnier insightful and honest film than THE HANGOVER ever was.".

Between a series of humiliating situations the director decided to add some jokes or situational gags. I have to admit a couple of them were funny. But apart from those we get 2 hours and 10 minutes of a woman being miserable. She is more miserable than Dr. House during hist stay in the mental hospital and after Cuddy dumped him put together.The only good thing about this the role played by Chris O'Dowd who is funny and convincing. Too bad there is only about 25 minutes of him in that 2 hour 10 minutes worth of continuing sadness and misery.".

Probably not considering that none of the SNL people seem to have the slightest appreciation of the brilliant satire Mike Judge employed in that film.

It is a true combo of kung fu and superheroics as the main character Lulu Wong Michelle Yeoh has excelled in the martial arts since childhood and have found a way to use her martial arts for the good of all society as the silvercostumed hero Silver Hawk.The movie takes place in the future where they have holographic mahjong and some brandnew mindreading devices. Stylistically everything is entirely kept in iceblue glass and metal which all looks sleek and cool but also rather cold and inhuman.A human dimension is added however in the childhood flashbacks where a lot of connections are drawn to Silver Hawk's adult life. For instance the reason she wears a mask is because she did so as a kid too to disguise her identity when she was kung fu brawling in defiance of her teachers' orders. This crosstime dimension with her childhood works very well indeed also because she runs into her childhood friend again as an adult his having become a police chief. Initially he wants to catch Silver Hawk but as soon as he finds out who she is he starts working with her.The bad guy supervillain really Fire Wolf is quite dull and his plan not very well described. There are a couple of plot holes in the story too and while the action is pretty good the fighting isn't spectacular. But still a relatively good and watchable movie. I rate it a 6 out of 10.I'm very interested in movies that combine kung fu and science fiction. My list so far includes Silver Hawk Avenging Fist Jet Li's The One and of course the Matrix Trilogy and Equilibrium. And also Star Wars sort of since the Jedi abilities are a form of martial arts... I hope to discover more movies with kung fu and scifi combined.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silver Hawk is an enjoyable Cantonese take on the superhero genre. As such it's much more enjoyable than recent US additions like Spiderman 2 or Daredevil taking a very Bladelike 'Good vs Evil in a knockdown drag out fight' approach as opposed to going for the 'tortured hero' take on things American directors seem to dig. If you want depth you are firmly looking in the wrong place go for the original 80s Batman maybe? but if you want action humour and incredibly sharp fight choreography you've come to the right place.It's similar in style to both Blade and Sam Raimi's Darkman also taking cues from recent Hong Kong movies like Twins Effect. It has a fantastic look good strong characters and a simple but effective plot that keeps you glued to your seat. Additional praise must be heaped on leading lady Michelle Yeoh. Much like Jackie Chan despite many wouldbe successors coming and going since her debut in the 80s she still has what it takes to front an action movie in spades. She not only makes Silver Hawk a genuinely likable and unique presence she's also still a mesmerizing fighter to watch. The fights in this movie are really good some of the best nonperiod kungfu I've seen since the likes of Versus. They're played with humour by Yeoh with Silver Hawk cockily dancing around baddies before kicking their teeth in but they're still imbued with an impact missing from many similar films.So why the 6? Firstly Silver Hawk is incredibly lightweight. If it wasn't for the balletic and convincing fight scenes this movie could probably have been a 12A or even a PG it's like a Bond movie only with a female lead. Get boy send bad guys home with bloody nose end. It's simple and that's why it works so well but it doesn't have much depth and I'll mainly rewatch it to enjoy the great fights and Yeoh being cool as she always is.Then there's the dub. It's not as I originally thought an entirely Americanised dub. It's like Gen X Cops 2 in that it's dual language always has been and was intended for dual release. However much like a lot of Jackie Chan's movies and Jet Li's earlier films it's dubbed in quite a slapdash fashion in a sloppy manner that makes it obvious all the actors except Yeoh and Luke Goss have been redubbed by voiceover actors and that Yeoh and Goss voices were added at postproduction instead of using the original recordings. It's not awful and it compares favourably with some more suspect redubs but it's still glaringly obvious that most characters are not being voiced by the original actors and that the voiceover wasn't done in sync with the film it was done off in some studio somewhere with just a script. If you think you can put up with that better than I did I couldn't help wincing during certain scenes such was the complete disconnection between dialogue and onscreen action add a point to the score and if you don't watch subs add two. That's the best way to approach it really.Basically Silver Hawk is really good fun a cool superhero movie with a great heroine played by a great actress. It's fast funny and has really good fight scenes but you could get put off by the awkward dub. It's good enough that I think it's worth the effort and I'll definitely be watching it again soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Michelle Yeoh ever since I saw 'Supercop' a few years ago. In fact having not previously heard of 'Silver Hawk' I bought it based solely on the fact that Michelle Yeoh was featured on the cover in a kickarse pose. I regret nothing.Lulu Wong Michelle Yeoh is a Hong Kong celebrity who happens to have a secret She is the masked superhero Silver Hawk. Silver Hawk just happens to be in the neighbourhood whenever there is trouble 'neighbourhood' can refer to a Hong Kong alley the Great Wall of China etc. The Hong Kong police are out to catch Silver Hawk as it seems she's been making them look like fools.

The Professor doesn't quite understand why the AI chip is poorly received by the crowd until he runs into trouble with Alexander Wolfe Luke Goss an English pop star turned super villain. Wolfe's sinister scheme is to combine the chip with the latest in mobile phone technology so he can brainwash the population unless Silver Hawk can stop him.'Silver Hawk' is a bit odd for a kungfu film. It is sleek but silly occasionally suffers from an awkward imbalance between a serious and silly tone and then switches from reality to over the top superheroics. Sure these are characteristics found frequently in Hong Kong kungfu movies but 'Silver Hawk' seems a bit different. I can't quite put my finger on it. It is fun but it seems like HK cinema borrowing from 'The Matrix' rather than 'The Matrix' borrowing from HK cinema.'Silver Hawk' features some pretty cool action scenes namely Michelle taking on villains on bungee cords or an evil inline hockey team. The fights are generally fun I'll get to those in a minute. A lot of the comedy and character interaction  especially between Michelle and Richie  seemed rather awkward but it was entertaining anyway. I think the main strength of 'Silver Hawk' is that it looked like Michelle was having a lot fun filming. I mean she got to play with Batmanesquire Hawkerangs  who wouldn't have with those?I mentioned the fight scenes being fun to watch. Conversely they also present one of the film's weaknesses 'Silver Hawk' goes for too much of flashy Hollywood look. It looks sleek but I couldn't help but think that it could have been done better. The villains were generally unimposing and uninteresting and the story could have been better polished.'Silver Hawk' may not be the best superhero or kungfu or Michelle Yeoh movie around but take it for what it is a fan way to kill time. Recommended for fans of Michelle Yeoh  610".

Her experience in martial arts helped tremendously. Providing comic relief is Brandon Chang who plays a computer whiz kid who constantly pops up to annoy Richie Ren. Wolfe's role was downplayed. Instead his two assassins played by Bingbing Li and Michael Jai White Universal Soldier The Return and Spawn got most of the action.

	schema:reviewBody "Michelle Yeoh is apparently trying to kill herself or at least damage something. The woman will do anything regardless of how potentially painful it can be. This movie is a little bit tamer than other things I've seen her do but still. She induces flinching. I loved watching my mother's face when I made her watch Supercopthe scene where Michelle hung off the side of a van only to fall off and crash through Jackie Chan's windshield caused Mom some anxiety. I of course piped up Michelle Yeoh does all of her own stunts. Jackie Chan isn't the only one. Anyway this movie is about Lulu Wong a hugely famous womanshe's famous because she's rich apparently. What's nifty about Michelle Yeoh playing Lulu is that you can see Michelle being stylish. She isn't usuallyit's also interesting that Lulu seems to be MUCH younger than Michelle actually is. Good acting there Michelle! Lulu wears all white and has all kinds of wigs and different hairdos. She knows everyone everyone loves her she's perfect. That's her main identity. When criminals strike she dons a silver mask a silver suit a silver jacket and dashes to the scene on a silver BMW motorcycle. Gorgeous bike. Silver Hawk is an appropriate name as you can see. She has little silver blade things like Batman's batarangs or whatever they were called but she only uses those to disarm people. Once they're emptyhanded she starts the akicking. The first scene of the movie is the bestthe movie starts off with Michelle I'm assuming it's The Stuntwoman herself jumping over the Great Wall of China on her bike in pursuit of some poachers. The cinematography here is marvelous. Once she catches them she beats them mercilessly but it looks beautiful. It doesn't seem like wirework but if it isn't then Michelle Yeoh isn't affected by gravity. She does an incredible kick on several of the poor criminalsshe runs up the front of a van then does some sort of pinwheeling roundhouse kick in midair. All of this is in slowmotion and I actually think realtime would have been more effective. Once the crooks are in a heap on the ground Silver Hawk reveals her disappointment. Give me ten more minutes she asks. Five? Two? By this time the criminals have tied themselves up and completely surrendered. See Lulu has to put herself in danger to get excited but since she's such a great fighter she's never really in a perilous situation. When I said excited I didn't mean that this is a porno movie. I mean that some people ride roller coasters others fight crime.After that great opening sequence we're treated to a plot. Professor Ho Chung one of Lulu's love interests has developed a completely idiotic artificial intelligence chip that supposedly increases the wearer's standard of living. We see it tested on a young ladya holographic English butler appears and informs her that she is 48 days pregnant. A coworker of hers confirms this yelling That's incredible! We only found out yesterday.! I found myself wondering if the transparent English butler had Tact 2000 a program few people seem to possess. What if the lady didn't want everyone to know she was pregnant? Could the AI detect that or will it just humiliate everyone endlessly? The guinea pig doesn't seem to mind she just smiles. An assistant brings her a drink and the butler explains that the AI taps into your most primitive impulses in this case thirst. That amused mewhat would it do if someone had a certain other primitive impulse?!? Finally it demands that she do some prenatal exercises. She doesn't want to but the butler isn't taking no for an answer. Finally the demonstration is concluded. When Professor Chung asks Lulu what she thought she tells him flat out that she doesn't like it. I don't blame hershe isn't fond of people telling her what to do. HOWEVER... ...enter Alexander Wolfe a nut with an English accent. He is very fond of telling people what to do via secret subliminal messaging preferably. This new device seems to be perfect for his plan so he sends MICHAEL JAI WHITE to kidnap the professor. Don't send a Spawn to do a kungfu master's job. Once that's done Wolfe reveals his silly planhe is going to place the chip into millions of cell phones and at a certain time he will play the aforementioned subliminal messages. A technology mogul's daughter is kidnapped also so that Wolfe can force the mogul to place the chips into a new phone model. He does and Lulu remember her? wonders why. She decides to take matters into her own silvergloved hands.As it happens the new police superintendent used to be a friend of Lulu's and even more coincidentally he despises Silver Hawk. How can they work together you ask? Not very well is how. He has no idea that Lulu and Silver Hawk are the same person even though anyone with at least one sense could figure it out. Silver Hawk looks like Lulu she sounds like her she might even smell like her I'm not sure. You get my point. So while they have to save the world they also have to contend with each other. The superintendent Rich Man is more interested in arresting Silver Hawk than anything else especially when she humiliates him in front of some teenagers. He dressed himself in drag so maybe he shouldn't be so hard on her. Eventually it comes to the point where Rich Man has to knuckle under and just deal with it.This was a good action movie with several nifty fights and some funny parts. I had a couple of gripes though and I might as well vent. FirstMichelle didn't get to do all the cool stuff the bad guys go to do. For instance when Silver Hawk first runs into Alexander Wolfe his minions bounce around and fly through the air using huge rubber bands. It looks incredibly fun but Michelle is grounded. She has to run around getting kicked in the face. By the time she gets her leg up to kick back the person has already flown away. It's just that she could have done wonders with that. This same problem pops up in the last fight with Wolfe's goons. They zoom around on rollerblades with hockey sticks. Not Michelle. She has to hit them as they fly by. Again. It could be that Michelle Yeoh didn't want to do these things. That's okay. If for some reason behind the scenes they just decided that she wouldn't do it that's not okay. She is Silver Hawkshe should fly. Secondthis movie falls prey to another problem that's rampant in Michelle Yeoh's films. She's absent for long stretches at a time. Eventually you get wrapped up in something else and then she pops up again just when you least expected her. That happened in Royal Warriors Supercop Supercop 2 Butterfly and Sword and gosh even Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. I don't want to sit there wondering what happened to her. Did her character die or just get fed up? Maybe if I had an explanation of why this is done. I realize that Michelle Yeoh gets injured frequently and that's understandable. Is that the deal? Do they have to shoot around her? Someone fill me in please. I guess I'm used to Brigitte Lin's filmsthere is rarely a moment where she doesn't appear. Even if one pops up the filmmaker makes darn sure that you'll think about her. Someone please give Michelle Yeoh the same courtesy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much after Michelle Yeoh's last flop the Touch. Silver Hawk doesn't have such a great story but the action scenes were really well done. the part where Yeoh flew over the Great Wall with her motorcycle was particularily amazing. Jingle Ma once again proves his talent as an action movie director a few years after Tokyo Raiders skip Goodbye Mister Cool and Para Para Sakura unless you're really desperate. Another good reason to go see Silver Hawk is the absence of Ekin Cheng from the cast. That guy seems to star in too many HK movies since the mid 1990s. Worth mentioning is Yin Xiong's Chen Daoming who delivers a great performance. Silver Hawk is by far the most successful HK attempt at adapting a comic superhero to the big screen after Hak Hap and the mediocre Hak Hap 2 City of Masks. Just for that I would give it a 710.".

Silver Hawk doesn't have such a great story but the action scenes were really well done. the part where Yeoh flew over the Great Wall with her motorcycle was particularily amazing. Jingle Ma once again proves his talent as an action movie director a few years after Tokyo Raiders skip Goodbye Mister Cool and Para Para Sakura unless you're really desperate. Another good reason to go see Silver Hawk is the absence of Ekin Cheng from the cast. That guy seems to star in too many HK movies since the mid 1990s. Worth mentioning is Yin Xiong's Chen Daoming who delivers a great performance. Silver Hawk is by far the most successful HK attempt at adapting a comic superhero to the big screen after Hak Hap and the mediocre Hak Hap 2 City of Masks. Just for that I would give it a 710.";

	schema:reviewBody "Silver Hawk is such a great movie not overly dramatic or drudged up with too much blood or sex. In fact I don't remember seeing any of either. Michelle Yeoh is so cute and smart and funny it's not dumb fun but it's so great to see a character who actually has lots of fun kicking butt something which is usually seen as burdensome and depressing by most superheroes in movies and comics nowadays. Don't listen to anyone who says Michelle Yeoh is too old for this role she doesn't look her age at all and she could've fooled me! I hate it when people think forty is over the hill they are gravely mistaken I think it's more of a sign of maturity and talent than the overpaid upandcoming sluts on our silver screens today. The character is original the costume is beautiful and not at all immodest. The music is just right and we are finally allowed the luxury of enjoying the fight scenes totally real beautifully choreographed and filmed so we can see it without getting a headache or feeling ripped off with up too close choppy filming. I think some of the voices are dubbed over but it doesn't bother me at all they're all English speaking anyways. The bad guy isn't the most sinister but he's bad enough for me it's been so long since we've seen a villain with the classic motives of world domination and a viable method of doing so. Bad guys and superheroes don't have to be overdramatized for me to be entertained they just have to have clear motivations and a simple sincerity. As far as any of the humor or lines coming off stale or lameI've seen MUCH worse in movies made by people who speak English every day of the week. Silver Hawk is beautiful strong original well made and modest. Ten stars and my recommendation if you like superheroine or superhero movies martial arts and scifi.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been looking forward to this for over a year and it's region 2 DVD release finally came a week or so ago.It's an Asian take on the traditional superhero movie with Michelle Yeoh as a Batmanesquire crimefighter. Of course there is also more emphasis on martial arts. And although it's Asian all the actors speak English.The Good points...The action scenes. Great martial arts all sorts of different weapons and situations all number of different fighters and the actors all know how to fight properly. You know the problem with modern action movies is the toofast editing? Silver Hawk gets that just right so you can see exactly what is happening in one shot but no more than that and then it changes. It's perfect. There is a fight on top of a moving truck a fight with men on bungee cords from the ceiling and a fight with guys on rollerblades with hockey sticks. This shows Batman  Robin how it's done  but Christopher Nolan could learn a lot from it too.The music. Surprisingly good and lush sounding.Silver Hawk's background. Her history is told in flashbacks throughout the film Highlander style. It's simple but effective nicely creating the relationship between the two principal characters as children at martial arts school.The Bad points.The actors speak English. This is not as bad as dubbing but it's very obvious some of the actors don't speak English whatsoever.Comedy. Very very bad. And even Silver Hawk is messing around and making jokes by the end. One of the characters has a very bizarre supposedly funny martial arts stance with a weird noise he makes and we're shown this repeatedly much to the audience's dismay and embarrassment.Tone. Silver Hawk is good when it's serious it's dramatic and exciting. Silver Hawk is no way near invincible and she has to escape from the bad guys at one point. But then we have jokes and Silver Hawk smiling during the climactic fight. There is a silly scene where the main police officer tries to catch Silver Hawk  by dressing as a woman. And then they have a fight. Which is taken seriously. Silver Hawk is only good when it's serious and that's only for the last thirty minutes.The bad guys. Michael Jai White Spawn and Luke Goss Blade II are wasted on very 2D cartoon characters. They are decent for a fight but White doesn't even talk and Goss plays an English Blofeld with bionic arms.Finally Michelle Yeoh as Silver Hawk is debatable. No question she has the charisma as well as the physical and actorly skills to pull off the role. But she is much too old for the role as Silver Hawk seems to be about thirty in the narrative.So my verdict on Silver Hawk is......meh. It's entertaining enough and the action scenes are exactly what you wanted to see but didn't in all those BatmanCatwomanDaredevil movies. But it's just not serious enough to take seriously most of the time.Of course it's much better than Supergirl 1984 or Catwoman 2004 it's a solid 7 out of 10 movie which makes it the best female superhero movie so far. A dubious honor.".

I was hoping for something as much fun as Returner. Silver Hawk however is not it. The movie is decent but other than a couple of moments in the movie it just doesn't fare too well. In some fights the action is pretty good but in others it's just overly cheesy. Don't get me wrong I like cheesy stuff sometimes but some of this was just bad. The editing and slow motion parts in the fights were crappy. Another problem and this is the fault of the DVD makers and not the movie itself is that the DVD did not contain the original language track. So I had to contend with a really bad dubbing job as well. Despite all that there is some fun to be had. Michelle Yeoh and Richie Ren looked like they were having fun and there was some good unintentional humor. It wasn't a total waste of money but if I could go back I wouldn't have bought it. The bottom line is it's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's no where near the best either. It's merely forgettable and that's worse than being horribly bad. If you want a good fun action movie go get Returner which stars Takeshi Kaneshiro and Anne Suzuki. Let Silver Hawk be a renter.".

Its your basic comic book character action film but the hero is a heroine Yeoh and she isn't exactly a superhero but more like Iron Man a person with money who fights crime in a nifty suit.Well I say nifty suit this suit simply looks like silver spandex with some silver painted goggles on her head and a long silver flapping coat. The thing that is so silly with this is everyone is virtually dressed in silver all the bad guys and henchmen are in silver armour and everyone uses silver weapons or gadgets.Surprisingly Jai White is a silent bad guy henchmen in this looking like a certain character out of Mortal Kombat and with some Biggles head wear for some reason and unsurprisingly Goss is the main villain. He is dressed in a Matrix style full length silver trench coat indeed with prosthetic silver metal forearms and looking like Richard O' Brien's brother. The action is tame but reasonably well choreographed nothing amazing but it does the job with no strong violence or blood.All of the film is pure comic book silliness which does look like something made for TV but a lot of Asian movies can look like this. You could almost think of this as a Chinese 'Batman and Robin' complete with fighting bad guys on bungee ropes rollerblading ice hockey bad guys and Silver Hawk has her own Batbike type vehicle its just not as camp. Well...that is until you see Goss in his skintight shiny silver vinyl costume towards the end.510".

This seems to be an illfated remake of I Robot one moment and a martial arts movie the next. The effects are good but the martial arts elements are heavily overdone as are the performances. Were it not for the technology featured herein this work could easily have been made in the 1970's. Honestly the content quality isn't much better than that.I wasn't expecting much and it's a good thing. If you expect anything more than mild enjoyment you could be severely disappointed.And the visuals? They are good but not great. You could definitely profit from finding something more useful to do with your time. This can go completely unnoticed and we wouldn't miss a thing.It rates a 3.710 from...the Fiend .".

Expect everything you saw in the first two films to appear in Cradle 2 The Grave.Yes expect all the action sequences to drown the whole plot of the film. Yes expect DMX to have his hiphop soundtrack blasting in most of the action scene. Yes expect the two protaganist of the story to reluctantly get along with each other and then later on to share a common bond at the end of the movie. Yes expect Jet Li to have the same facial expression throughout the whole film and no more than 10 lines in the movie. Yes expect the same fat black guy from Kangaroo Jack to be back as the black comic element. Yes expect Tom Arnold a guy who was once married to a woman who looked like Kangaroo Jack to be back as other white comic element of the film. Yes expect a night club scene and every prop seen in a Hype William music video i.e. Jacuzzi champagne and big booty bitches. Yes expect the Rap Star actor do some martial arts of his own. And I'd like to say to DMX Yo dog stick to rappin' cuz the karate thang ain't you. You got those thin wires making you look good. And yes expect Jet Li to fight with his counterpart nemesis in a ring of fire at the end of the movie. Where the hell is Johnny Cash when you need him!And as for Jet Li I do respect him as a martial artist but since he's been making movies in US his skill have been more halfassed compared to what he did in his Hong Kong Flicks. The scene where Jet fights in a cage match was the only highlight of the film. However only to be distracted with DMX's action sequences with camera going from one scene to the other. For me I'd rather see Jet Li do his stuff than to see DMX being pursued by cops. I live near Oakland and I see that sht almost every day.Overall I would suggest to save your money and watch Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds at the same time. Or if you don't care what I say...Hell go spend the 9.00! But remember the Cradle is robbing you!".

The scene where Jet fights in a cage match was the only highlight of the film. However only to be distracted with DMX's action sequences with camera going from one scene to the other. For me I'd rather see Jet Li do his stuff than to see DMX being pursued by cops. I live near Oakland and I see that sht almost every day.Overall I would suggest to save your money and watch Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds at the same time. Or if you don't care what I say...Hell go spend the 9.00! But remember the Cradle is robbing you!";

This is an action movie wit jet Li and it delivers what you would expect. Hell DMX even attempts to use martial arts and his acting is certainly improving as is Jet Li's. Combine Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds and this is what you get. The fights are great Jet vs the champions of UFC the comedy is there Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson and the film is certainly entertaining so if you want a mindless film with lots of action this is it.

	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilers...if such a movie can be spoiled...Here is a question of great philosophical import Is a movie like Cradle 2 the Grave criticproof?  Consider the plot. Jewel thief and family man Tony Fate and his intrepid crew are hired to steal a mysterious bag of Black Diamonds'.  His heist is disrupted by resourceful Taiwanese policeman Su who's country was the original owner of the diamonds. Meanwhile the fellow who contracted the heist shadowy international criminal Ling decides he has been doublecrossed and kidnaps Fate's daughter to force the thieves to hand over the loot. Of course the Black Diamonds' are not ordinary jewels and Fate and Su must become a team to foil Ling's nefarious plans. Judging from this description you would be safe in assuming C2tG has no pretensions to lifting the bar of cinematic excellence. All it wants to do is give you a good bang for your buck. Unfortunately there is more kick in your popcorn than C2tG exhibits onscreen.While you don't go to something called Cradle 2 the Grave expecting Laurence Oliver you do expecting a likable star a cool villain and a funny sidekick or two for that downtime between explosions.  Nominal star Jet Li barely registers. As Su Li's struggle with the English language leaches him of personality and the movie values it's gunplay over his martial arts displays. Rapper DMX fares better as Tony Fate. DMX is a tough looking hombre with a great raspy voice who convincingly handles a gun and carries off the tender scenes to the degree that the movie requires.  As Ling Mark Dacascos would have made a good foil for Li had their conflict been given more weight and their final confrontation been staged to highlight their martial arts rather than pyrotechnics.  The heavier acting  such as they are  chores are handled by the supporting players. Chi McBride easily outshines the leads as a particularly nasty crimelord and Tom Arnold brightens up the proceedings as a nonetoocagey fence.Fine acting is all well and good in its place but what you want from a movie like C2tG are fights chases and a few gallons of blood on the side. A good plot would be nice but is not strictly necessary.  While C2tG's plot is adequate to its needs the movie fatally botches its action.  Midway through the film there are two sequences one of which could have been sort of fun and the other  well it must have seemed like a good idea at the time. The good idea has Li going up against an army of steroid abusing cage fighters. The bad one has DMX outracing every cop in the city riding an allterrain vehicle. Both ideas are handled badly.  There is no build in the cage fight and Li seems distracted and bored.  DMX's chase depends on the notion that a four wheeler can outrun and outmaneuver cars motorcycles and helicopters. Both sequences peter out rather than end.  Mistakes multiply when in a bid to goose the excitement level the two sequences are intercut. You have about twenty seconds of Li pounding on the cage fighters then a cut to DMX buzzing down the sidewalk and then back to ten more seconds of Li's fight. Rather than adding to the excitement this strategy causes the viewer to lose the flow of the action and deadens whatever tension could have been generated if each sequence had been allowed to run separately.C2TG is no where near as bad an example of the action movie genre as Rollerball.  It has its moments and would do well as the second rental on a guy's night double bill. If however you are only allowed one shoot'emup per rental by your significant other there are many other movies that give you a more entertaining bang for your buck.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoiler Andrzej Bartkowiak directs the third in his bling bling kung fu movie in which American rapper DMX and his motley crew rob some diamonds from a bank or something specifically black diamonds which his team are stealing to order for Mark Dacascos professional team.During the robbery DMX explains to his team the value of the coloured diamonds. This is a plot point but this is ignored as is most of the other stuff in the movie.Jet Li in a muted and frankly uninspiring role plays a silent Taiwan spy sent to retrieve the black diamonds although from the start you don't know whether he's on the good side or not because he's often seen talking to Dacascos. I thought this was pretty clever but this idea is never really developed  this is because Li hardly ever speaks or emotes anything. He just looks weatherbeaten and bored. I feel sorry for him as an actor. Anyway back to my review.DMX is one of the heroes of the movies despite being a hightech diamond robber. Unfortuently I wasn't sure whether I should cheer for his character or not. He's meant to be a bad guy but is touted throughout the film as just doing the job to get by... that might be so but if he's struggling to get by why is he driving an expensive German sports car and wearing flashy leather clothes?DMX's daughter is kidnapped and this is where the film falls apart and tries too hard to be a hardnosed action movie but I kept saying oh come on right throughout the movie. One example is the chase between DMX's porshce and a fourwheel drive vehicle.Another example is when Jet Li decides to scale down a highrise building by going around the outside and using his hands to hold onto the ledges and then falling onto the next level. This film moves so much inbetween reality and wirefu it makes the film utterly ridiculous. Especially when DMX starts doing wirefu beating up Jet Li or running up walls to escape dogs.Anyway DMX's team decide to take the black diamonds to an annoying Tom Arnold who has Tanks in his backyard to get them valued. DMX gives Arnold ALL of the diamonds! Earlier in the film we saw DMX professing some knowledge of the value of coloured diamonds and one would assume that the black diamonds are the most precious  so why did DMX give Arnold ALL of the diamonds? From that moment on I knew this movie was pointless. Arnold then goes to lose all the diamonds... Mark's team is meant to be a professional team yet make so many mistakes its hilarious. When they kidnap DMX's daughter they don't tie her up or blindfold her until later on in the movie. The team always bitches against each other especially the guy who likes to think he's the reincarnation of J. Robert Oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb who famously said I have become death destroyer of worlds.DMX's daughter is not scared at all by the big scary guys with submachine guns and tries on many occasions to escape  in one hilarious sequence she drives a van with blacked out windows  and yet Mark and his team don't do anything other than tie her up. They should have put her in a cell.Anyhow other random stuff happens  DMX gets chased by cops whilst he's on a quadbike and Jet Li fights UFC fighters in a cage  but this is where you can see Andrzej Bartkowiak ideas for a hard nosed action movie fall apart... he cuts back and forth from the UFC fight and to the DMX chase. This really annoyed me and made the film even more messier.By the end we're treated to an auction of the black diamonds and an all out action sequence begins with a shootout between a Tank and a guy with some sort of twin mounted machine gun. Naturally the tank wins but the damage it does is very minor.Anyhow Mark tries to escape via a helicopter and Bartkowiak who must have watched too many episodes of the ATeam decides to blow up the helicopter  but Mark stumbles out of the wreckage without a scratch..Then Bartkowiak treats us to yet another one of his clichd ring of fire fights  I've seen this idea done so many times and its never ever worked. Bartkowiak makes it worse by cutting from the much anticipated fight between Mark and Jet Li to the numerous fights that are meant to be going on at the same time.The fight between Mark and Li isn't very special and is ruined by poor lighting the rain and the horrible cutting from one fight sequence to another  it reminded me of The Phantom Menance where it moved from one sequence to another and it totally ruined the very good ending. This is very similar.In the end the cops arrive but for some reason decide not to arrest DMX for stealing the diamonds or Tom Arnold for possessing a Tank. Heck they don't even question Jet Li of why he's spying in United States.But its all okay we've been watching crade 2 the grave and none of it matters. All I learnt from this movie is that all that matters in the world is 'bling bling'  all style and no substance.Overall 2.510.".

The action is well done don't get me wrong but for some reason Jet Li just seems uncomfortable here.  Perhaps it's just the role he was given but for some reason he never quite clicked with everything else that was going on. Another gripe I had about the movie is that we're told who everyone is by other characters.  Instead of showing Jet's history with the villain portrayed by Mark Dacascos we just hear Jet saying We used to be on the same side he betrayed us etc. etc.  This keeps things going along at a fast pace but personally I like my movies fleshed out a little bit  even a flashback scene would have been enough.  Since it's not the final battle really doesn't mean anything.  Oh well I guess I'm just asking too much.I suppose that after Kiss of the Dragon and even The One I was expecting Jet Li's U.S. track record to improve not slide backwards 3 years to Romeo Must Die status.  Perhaps after Hero is released state side we'll start getting some good projects from Li.  Until then we'll have to deal with more DMX Get At Me Dawg! movies.For now I'll continue to watch Fist of Legend.  If you haven't I recommend you see that rather than this.".

A week before it came out I hit the official web page and was excited to learn that Mark Dacascos The Crow Stairway to Heaven Brotherhood of the Wolf and Kelly Hu The Scorpion King XMen 2 were in the movie.  The real reason I was waiting for the movie was of course Jet Li.Over all I have to say that the movie left me unimpressed.  DMX gives a terrible performance.  It's not consistently bad but when he breaks out into highly emotional scenes he stinks. Tom Arnold is also in this movie and is funny in his Tom Arnold way.  He's basically the comedic relief exploiting his fishoutofwater position he's a middle age white guy who's main associates throughout the movie are young AfricanAmericans for laughs.  And love or hate the guy he will make you laugh.  He's good in supporting roles just think of him in True Lies. Similar effect here. Bad dialogue and acting can be forgiven but two things are unpardonable Not giving Jet Li enough to do and the misuse of Mark Dacascos and Kelly Hu.  Apparently they forgot that Jet Li is an international star and while DMX is known for his music he can't act to save his life.  The primary focus of the story should have been on Jet Li's character not DMX's.  Simple common senseuse your star.  The star of this movie ain't DMX it's Jet Li.Those who have seen Mark Dacascos in Brotherhood of the Wolf know that he can kick some serious tail.  All that is wasted since his fight with Jet Li is a pathetically wasted effort and his only fight in the movie.  Kelly Hu an emerging star soon to be seen in XMen 2 should have been given more screen time.  Sure she has a fight but one can't help but feel that she also was misused.KungFu and HipHop are a bad mix.  Producer Joel Silver can't seem to get that through his head and I doubt he will anytime soon since Cradle 2 the Grave took the number one spot at the box office on it's opening weekend. The fact of the matter is Jet Li carries this mediocre effort all the way. That's a lot of weight for one man to carry but he does it.  Hopefully he'll get back to starring in movies that exhibit his abilities not stick him in the passenger seat of a stinker driven up by a recording artist.".

He's basically the comedic relief exploiting his fishoutofwater position he's a middle age white guy who's main associates throughout the movie are young AfricanAmericans for laughs.  And love or hate the guy he will make you laugh.  He's good in supporting roles just think of him in True Lies. Similar effect here. Bad dialogue and acting can be forgiven but two things are unpardonable Not giving Jet Li enough to do and the misuse of Mark Dacascos and Kelly Hu.  Apparently they forgot that Jet Li is an international star and while DMX is known for his music he can't act to save his life.  The primary focus of the story should have been on Jet Li's character not DMX's.  Simple common senseuse your star.  The star of this movie ain't DMX it's Jet Li.Those who have seen Mark Dacascos in Brotherhood of the Wolf know that he can kick some serious tail.  All that is wasted since his fight with Jet Li is a pathetically wasted effort and his only fight in the movie.  Kelly Hu an emerging star soon to be seen in XMen 2 should have been given more screen time.  Sure she has a fight but one can't help but feel that she also was misused.KungFu and HipHop are a bad mix.  Producer Joel Silver can't seem to get that through his head and I doubt he will anytime soon since Cradle 2 the Grave took the number one spot at the box office on it's opening weekend. The fact of the matter is Jet Li carries this mediocre effort all the way. That's a lot of weight for one man to carry but he does it.  Hopefully he'll get back to starring in movies that exhibit his abilities not stick him in the passenger seat of a stinker driven up by a recording artist.";

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Fait is a head of a gang of thieves who are on a job to steal a bag of black diamonds.  Inspector Su from Taiwan is out to stop them. The gang succeed but find themselves with both Su and crime lord Ling after the diamonds.  Fait takes them to his friend Archie to have them valued but a local mobster has them stolen.  To make matters worse Ling kidnaps Fait's daughter and demands the diamonds.  Fait and Su join forces to get the diamonds back from the mobster rescue Fait's daughter and bring down Ling.I was in the UK watching a tape of the NBA AllStar game that someone had taped off US TV for a friend.  Fast forwarding the adverts a movie trailer caught my eye  the trailer for this movie.  Dacascos and Jet Li in a movie together!  Gotta see that!  I couldn't wait and was excited when I saw it coming to the UK sooner than I'd expected.  So I went to see it not expecting art but hoping for a good ride.I was a little let down but not too much.  The film has some good scenes that almost manage to hide the inherent weaknesses in script plot editing direction acting etc etc.  Let me start with the plot.  Now I didn't expect wonders and I didn't get them  however the film pushes things too far by making the film about a world threat  a leap of faith too far for me. The actual script is full of so many clunky lines you won't believe. Little of it sounds like people actually talking.The main weakness were direction and editing.  You see I can for Jet Li et al fighting and for action.  However the fight scenes and actions scenes are edited together and directed with a frantic touch.  I'd prefer to see Li at work than constantly trying to keep up with the camera switches.  I can understand why they do this many of the actors must have done their scenes one move at a time but with Jet Li it loses much of his power to not be able to follow his moves.  Some of the action works well and is exciting but too often it is just frantic direction and noise.The cast are passable but none really excel themselves.  Li is good but not fully used.  He has yet to have a film that really showcases his skills. Here he has some good moves but the direction spoils them.  DMX is a good rapper I like his joints but he can't act anywhere near well enough to manage the scenes with his daughter'  they are awful!  Outside of these he is OK but he has NO chemistry with Li.  Also he doesn't convince as a ninja ! when he runs up a wall 15 minutes into the film it just looks silly. Tom Arnold and Anderson are pretty poor as the comedy sidekicks and really just clutter the film with characters more later.  I didn't know Union was in this till I sat down but she makes a mark.  She may be shameless eye candy I like to think I'm above these shameless crowd pleasers but she is very hot eye candy!  She does a dance in the film that is pretty pointless in terms of plot but is worth the price of admission alone!  Kelly Hu is not used well at all and her losing her cat fight towards the end is unlikely.  The biggest let down for me was Mark Dacascos.  I know the guy does a lot of tat but he is one of my favourite actors.  I was looking forward to him and Li fighting at the end both have skills but again it was spoilt by bad direction and the editing of 5 other scenes in with it.The soundtrack is heavy but it is really poorly used.  The makers just seemed to drop hip hop tracks in at random with little context.  The opening credits worked well and the use of DMX's X gonna bring it to ya' really compliments the onscreen action but mostly they just seemed thrown in to draw a certain demographic.Overall I did enjoy this film.  It has enough noise and dumb action to just about cover the weaknesses while you are watching it.  However it is pretty exploitative and excessive.  Did we need to have EVERYTHING blow up in the end  no.  Did we need to Gabrielle Union sexily stripping  no but it was worth it!.  It's not original and it is banged up with clichs ring of fire showdown and it's is inherently weak.  But lets be honest we came for action and it is just about passable in that.  Worth a watch if you keep your expectations low.".

The biggest weak spot to this film was DMX. He is not even close to a good actor and he can't do entertaining fight scenes and is very weak when emotional scenes are being done ie. with his daughter here. This film could have been much better if there had been some other angle than a kidnapped daughter. Overall I think this movie while not excellant was pretty good.

To see DMX do a Matrixlike wall climb and flip and do karate on his opponents was just unbearable to watch...i wanted to walk out the theater after seeing that.  Gabrielle Union was TOTALLY miscasted as the partnerformer love interest of DMX....mind you she whoops Kelly Hu in her token female fight scene.  C'mon....Gabrielle Union doing kungfu???  PLEASE!!  There was absolutely NO character development in this film....so you end up assuming everything anyway.  For instance...you're forced to assume that its Tom Arnold's character that supplies DMX and his crew all their gadgets to break into these places.  But how did they hook up and why do they do what they do?  What also killed me was everyone DMX  Jet Li 'just knowing' where to go to find what they were looking for.  Then the film like many socalled action films today turn to a 'oh well we gotta save the world now' crusade. this film couldn't be more cliched and predictable.  PATHETIC.  there are so many plot holes in this film its ridiculous...and so many other things that just don't make sense.  the biggest of all  if they sneak through security and break into a building avoiding security...why is it that when they finally find what they're looking for they make all the noise in the world to get to it alerting the security they were trying to avoid?? e.g. the laughable rocket launcher scene and the 'oh ill just shoot the lock' scenario.  DMX is a terrible actor...trying to have him as a compassionate father with a sensitive side was just horrible....there's no way that can be pulled off.  And of course you know that his music just HAD to blaring through the film don't you?  Do me a favor Hollywood keep these wannabe rapperactors to what they could do....DMX's 5 minutes in Romeo Must Die didn't bother me...thats his persona thats what he is so I bought it.  I didn't buy this thieffather of 8 yr old who gives his daugher TWO hugs before going to bed and saying a prayer every nighttheme at ALL....and it was a disgrace to witness.  Anthony Anderson is just annoying as usual...he seves no purpose....talk about typecasted.  Jet Li still impresses me with his martial arts skills....but he needs to get away from all these hiphopkung fu collaborations.  if he keeps this up he'd be right along with Jackie Chan burying his movie career and ruining his credibility as a martial arts actor.  and if that happens there we would have no one.  This film is simply terrible....waste 34 on the video when it comes out rather than 810 in the theater.".

Jet Li still impresses me with his martial arts skills....but he needs to get away from all these hiphopkung fu collaborations.  if he keeps this up he'd be right along with Jackie Chan burying his movie career and ruining his credibility as a martial arts actor.  and if that happens there we would have no one.  This film is simply terrible....waste 34 on the video when it comes out rather than 810 in the theater.";

You had several sitcoms of your own which disappeared faster than the Roadrunner.  You've been effective in several movie roles such as True Lies.  But this HopeandCrosby thing developing with you and Anthony Anderson needs to be nipped in the bud. It detracted from Exit Wounds and it threatened to bring Cradle to a dead halt several times.  That closing dialogue isn't funny or incisive just seems selfindulgent.  Do your sports show and when you appear in movies try to play somewhat more convincing characters such as an exjock from Iowa.  Don't be down with the brothers it just seems goofy.After Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds I had a pretty good idea what to expect from a film from the Polish guy to borrow Mr. Arnold's term. All you really need to know in advance is that it stars Jet Li and rap star DMX. Since I don't listen to rap and know nothing of DMX outside his four movies that I've seen I'm free to enjoy him just as an actor.  He has a lot of charisma delivers his lines with conviction and in Cradle even hints at a flair for comedy.  He could be a kind of black Vin Diesel.  Of course in Cradle he has the advantage of working with an adorable little girl with the audience's love for her washing over him too.  Traditionally actors have complained about kids stealing scenes from them but smart actors make that work for them.  As for Mr. Li well what needs to be said maybe nobody will ever fill Sonny Chiba's shoes but Mr. Li comes fairly close.The plot is the umpteenth Maltese Falcon variation with the characters this time seeking not a black bird but a bunch of small black objects that may or may not be diamonds.  There's an elaborate heist scene at the beginning with DMX leading a gang who use the word faith a lot which makes sense since God seems to be watching over them keeping the heist from going south umpteen different ways.  When the thieves fire a rocket into a vault not only does it not set off any alarms but nobody in the building pays attention to the noise.  Earthquake somebody shrugs.  Damn they really ARE laid back out in L.A.  This gang apparently only steals from criminals who of course keep all their valuables in safedeposit boxes so you know they're good bad guys as opposed to bad bad guys.  The latter are led by Mark Dacascos and Kelly Hu neither of whom I had previously seen as a villain.   Movies like this are only as good as their bad guys and these two wring every drop of juice out of their roles.Enjoy the set pieces like the allterrain vehicle chase and the underground prize fight in broad daylight never mind how contrivedly they come about.  Enjoy the stunts and fights and melodrama and SFX some of which are pretty spectacular towards the end.  Enjoy Mr. Bartkowiak's penchant for internalorgan shotsis he a Dario Argento fan?  Don't sweat the plot holes e.g. we see DMX in his heavily secured home with his young daughter and three colleagues all equally concerned about her wellbeing next thing we know the girl's been kidnapped and we never learn how it happened or where the three colleagues were.   And how likely is it that a convicted criminal would be imprisoned in conditions more luxurious than those enjoyed by leaders of Colombian drug cartels with anyone and everyone being allowed in to visit?  But who cares?Favorite moment Jet Li dropping himself down the side of a tall building floor by floor with no gear whatsoever just grasping each lower ledge. There was a simple but breathtaking elegance there reminiscent of silent movies a kind of quiet aplomb.  The movie got a lot noisier after that.SPOILER IN THE FORM OF A FEW QUESTIONSAfter the kidnapped girl is bound and gagged with duct tapepresumably not bought to keep toxic chemicals at baywe see her sawing through the tape with a diamond pendant.  Is this feasible?  Well maybe.  Then she goes rummaging through the van into which she's been locked and findslo and beholda cell phone.  Could such supposedly sophisticated crooks be that negligent?  Well maybe.  Then after she calls DMX and gives a couple details of her surroundings they licketysplit ascertain she's in an airplane hangar and pinpoint the location using apparently limitless technology to which they have access so much so one wonders why they bother being jewel thieves in the first place.  Farfetched?  Well maybebut then early on DMX calls on angels for protection  what the hey maybe he's got such connections.

Anderson and Tom Arnold are at it again since Exit Wounds. Though the plot is different in this movie the action is all the same to me. The best part of the movie is when DMX Jet Li and Gabrielle Union did their fight scenes. I bet Union must have had intense training in the martial arts. At the end everyone were starting to see the errors of their ways and starting over is the way of hope. Redemption was the factor at the end and big legit plans for Arnold's and Anderson's characters were always going to happen. GOOD LUCK YOU TWO! I think this movie just like any other will keep the a in action!3.5 out of 5 stars!".

And prior to viewing this film it's exactly what I did I lowered my expectations by a few notches even though the director here is no chop liver. Why should I adjust my expectations for anything? some of you might ask I don't know but would you rather be disappointed again? One of the film's reoccurring themes deals with the phenomena of drunk people who say things that they either don't really mean or yelp things that they otherwise wouldn't dare say when sober. So we meet our designated love birds. Miriam plays a feisty beer server who coincidently doesn't get drunk easily. She like everyone else has aspirations. Next comes Daniel Wu a free spirited globetrotter with cooking credentials in French cuisine. He on the other hand gets drunk fast which helps him to meet Miriam while puking and muttering cohesively in French but I'm sure that he'll still somehow manage to resonate his on screen charms on his female fans. Doesn't take a brewer to figure out that the two will hit it off but what I found pleasant was that the turning point of their relationship wasn't dragged on and manipulated. I can't say that the two provided the best chemistry of romantic comedies but at least they weren't at all annoying or cheesy. The enjoyably nonsleazy humor noticeable lessens halfway through the film which is as expected in this genre as the happy endings and the sad radiofriendly love songs playing over scenes like a music video.There are other characters too you know. Notably Alex Fong and Vincent Kok who could have easily over played their characters into complete wackiness but instead provide a lukewarm shtick which may leave some people yearning for more. The director does a right thing of not entirely replacing the humor with sappy romance fluff. The problems feel rather real although they also feel very light and unable of delivering a grand climax. That's where the bubble might burst for some of you due to high expectations.Soon after the evil woman shows up and for a few instances drives these characters apart. Again nothing that we've never seen before. Jing Hu plays a spoiled restaurant entrepreneur who likes to get things her way. She woos Daniel Wu's character no pun intended by lavishing him with gifts and a high profile job but once again the direction strays from serious dramatic resolutions and instead keeps things playful and free of heavy consequences.In the end I was entertained and not entirely let down yet not exactly satisfied with Drink Drank Drunk. I was able to avoid making comparison with the director's past work mainly because this film didn't feel too contrived and maintained a linear plot albeit a harmless one. Just don't expect any groundbreaking textures and subtle humor here but if you are looking for a routine romantic comedy with fine performances and a happy ending then by all means give this a try. Considering how much worse romantic comedies turn out sometimes this one did a fine job. But I think ultimately it comes down to whether you're a glass is halfempty or a glass is halffull type of a person.".

Whacky romantic comedy standards bubbly chic haughtily evil Putonghua speakers and egotistical Westerners. Why there's even a schmaltzy Mandopop moment to floor your hearts with nostalgic joy. Not surprising as a product from Mr. Derek Yee craftsman behind earlier classic One Nite in Mongkok. Yee has a gift his movies always make Hong Kong look good and brimming with a sense of place that reallife residents find endearing as they don't always see it the same way actually living there. Furthermore a typically stolid cast of characters especially those in support of main protagonists imbue Drink Drank Drunk with its layers of fun and eccentricity without which it may have ended up an OK but ho hum comedy romp.DDD has been getting PR of the sort usually reserved for brainless fodder understandable in light of its summery release and the kind of audiences distributors are going for. However it's very much akin to Crazy n the City of a few months ago in that there's so much more here than meets the eye with the gaudy comedic thrills working magically en route to one of the better motion pictures of the year thus far. Although awash with blatant product placement especially Budweiser DDD transpires to be a superb feel good movie full of wit and charm as well as wholeblooded cynical laughs that for a change work. It stars Miriam Yeung and Daniel Wu together again reenacting their old magic from those heady Love Undercover days. The pair has good chemistry and it's put to great use throughout with Yeung's natural affinity for humor tuning effortlessly to Wu's diverse range of machosensitive capabilities. Yeung does Siu Min a Bud booster trawling the city's bar and restaurant areas along with ditzy coworkers Toby and Rene. Their lot is a happy but uneasy one facing rival beer grrrls and the ever present search for good men. Siu Min on the other hand has given up trying to pinpoint her chevalier raising concerns among friends regarding her sexual orientation. Speaking of friends we have quite the entourage on hand including satisfying performances by Vincent Kok as Yeung's decidedly gay employer and Stephen Fong again sporting his by now obligatory facial hair. Fong plays Brother Nine the local triad boss and Siu Min's protector who's also keen on seeing her married off to some unsuspecting victim.As a capper Siu Min's notorious for her immunity to alcohol. She can put them away at no risk something that can't be said for sentiment. When she meets rolling stone Michael Wu Siu Min soon develops a dependence and the two fall for each other. Wu performs well too. His character a vagabond French chef with huge dreams and a knack for whipping up the most excruciatingly bizarre cuisine teams up with Siu Min as they build a professional and personal relationship much to the puzzlement of those around them.Later on temptation arrives via one of Michael's sojourning buddies tempting him to relinquish the urbane existence he'd forged with Siu Min and head back down the endless road of adventure. And before you know it a superwealthy attractive female entrepreneur sets her sights on Michael both romantically and as management for her chain of ultra pricey outlets. This adds turbulence to our antic lovers' steadfast course but needless to say there's hope yet.On the face of it DDD may seem not too special. Having said that it feels more like a genuine HK product than anything we've seen over the season so far and despite its mainstream accoutrements possesses a freewheeling spirit fit for a release much more criticalindie by nature. Gags and jokes present good writing and an eye for ridiculing the contemporary rather than the bland while Yee's pacing remains intact there's hardly a slow or boring moment. The cast carries out respective roles with confidence as we get a slew of classic fixtures that have served this genre faithfully for decades from bitchy beauties to rough but ludicrous mobsters and senile old grannies at street corners.Those hankering for a slice of what Hong Kong romantic comedies used to be like before the city's movie industry began atrophying will immediately realize Drink Drank Drunk provides more than an ample glance.

Lucio Fulci is widely renowned as the 'Godfather Of Gore' and Contraband is a movie that is certainly not going to deprive him of this welldeserved reputation. Although the plot may not be as original as it was the case with many other of the generally violent Italian Crime Thrillers of the 70s and early 80s Contraband scores in means of roughness intransigence and gruesome gory violence.Luca Di Angelo Fabio Testi and many of his friends make a living as cigarette smugglers in Naples. After their refusal to deal with drugs instead of cigarettes ruthless drug dealers amongst them a sadistic gangster from Marseille start to target the cigarette smugglers' families. Luca however is not the kind of man who gives in to threats...Fabio Testi who had already worked with Lucio Fulci in Four Of The Apocalypse in 1975 aside Tomas Milian and Lynne Frederick delivers a good leading performance as Luca and Marcel Bozzuffi is wonderfully evil in his role of the villain. I also found several of the supporting actors such as Guido Alberti who only has a very small role very good. Some other supporting cast members deliver rather bad performances. The violence is pretty brutal and includes several very nasty scenes of torture and sexual violence. There are some scenes that don't really fit in such as some cheesy looking and kitschy slowmo sequences of horses at a racecourse and the music is sometimes out of place but all in all the movie's qualities come up for its flaws. Contraband is certainly no highlight of Italian crime cinema but a brutal and uncompromising flick that highly entertains. Fans of Lucio Fulci and Crime thrillers of the rough kind should be pleased.".

One by one Testi's comrades are being killed off in many different gruesome ways including the backs of heads being blown off a rotting cadaver thrown through a window blood bags exploding in stomachs with intestines flying out and a pretty female drug courier getting half her face burned off by one of the Margilese's henchman.This has to be one of the goriest crime thrillers I have seen so far.  Fulci pulls no stops here and the bad guys are truly gonna get what they deserve. The ending shootout in the street between the Margilese's men and the retired Camorra bosses is classic Fulci.The Blue Underground DVD uses an excellent widescreen print that is only marred in a couple of places by bad splicing.  The only extras that come with it are a couple of bios Fulci and Testi and an American trailer. If you want to see violent crime thriller that doesn't pull any stops like the American ones do then go see this one!  Recommended!   7 out of 10".

He crafts a brutally biting if disjointed Italian crime melodrama that serves to make you squirm in it gratuitous acts of extremely depraved violence and sleaziness. Fulci definitely left his calling card on this one with many unforgettably unflinching nasty moments like an uncomfortable facemelting scene. The superfluous gore and meanspirited nature is great but a lack of any real tensionbuilding does hurt it. The twisty story is frank and unspectacular even with its shifty chain of bleak events and the script is weakly penned the unsuitable humour when included falling flat but being broken up by its impulsively vivid action stunts nice use of slowmotion too and gorgeous Naples' backdrop leaves quite a hypnotic imprint. Sergio Salvati's brashly sharp and tight camerawork interlocks with Fulci's kinetic visual bursts and rounding it off nicely is composer Fabio Frizzi's everchanging saucy music score that doesn't lye down. Performances are workably tailored. There's a humanely chiselled and honest performance by Fabio Testi. Marcel Bozuffi makes for a great smarmy calculating French Mafia Don trying to take over Testi's character's turf. Ivana Monti Ferdinand Murolo Saverio Marconi and Guido Alberti provide able support. Quite an edgy blunt and vicious crime joint that basically gets it kicks off its effectively rousing if scandalous violence than anything more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Luca il ContrabbandiereThe Smuggler1980 is a very good Italian mafia flick that is overlooked by the gothic films of Lucio Fulci from that period.  Its a transitional film that is the middle film between Zombie1979 and The City of the Living Dead1980.  Its about a group of smugglers led by Fabio Testi who battles with drug dealers who want a piece of the action.  The Smuggler1980 is an anti Delitto film because the police do not take part in the violence.  It was the only gangster flick in Fulci's resume.The scene at an industrial limepit site has a dimension of horror.  Not just a Godfather ripoff The Smuggler is quite convincing at showing the brutal nature of the drug dealers.  The movie at times becomes boring and slow moving.  As good as the best of Fernando Di Leo and Umberto Lenzi.  Its a shame that Fulci didn't do many more action films then this.Fans of Lucio Fulci were turned off the this because the violence is played in a realistic enviroment instead of the fantasy format that many fans were accustom to.  There are two scenes of violence that many people found repulsive.  One the torture of a female drug runnerin lingering detail no less by way of burning from blowtouch.  Two the vicious rape and sodomy of Adele Di Angelotension builder.  The murders of Perlante's sidekick and female companion has a suspenseful build up to it.Fulci does a good job in portraying the violent nature of the characters. He directs the action of the picture with flair.  Fulci appears as a gun toting assassin.  The death of Perlante is one of the major pluses for the picture.  The Smuggler1980 I think is one of Lucio Fulci's top motion pictures.Fabio Testi is good as the head smuggler Luca Di Angelo.  Very similar in plot to Four of the Apocalypse1974.  Deserves the attention of being released on Home Video by Anchor Bay.  Some of the action resembles the style of Heroic Bloodshed films in Hong Kong during the mid 80's.  Fabio Frizzi's score is both offbeat and weird.The special effects are at times gruesomely realistic.  The old members of the Mob spent much of the film sitting and watching Italian Westerns on television at home.  Its only near the end that they decide to take on the French gangster.  The ending is the weakest part of the film.  The murder of Mickey Di Angelo is done wonderfully with different camera shots.A grotesque mise en scene includes a man who loses his stomach to a shotgun blast.  Sergio Salvati's camera gives the film a stylized appearence.  One of The Smuggler's main strength is the smooth editing.  Contains almost the same flaws that made the Hong Kong flicks Rich  Famous  Tragic Hero very good but inconsistent films.  Good as part of a triple bill with Massacre Time1965 and Four of the Apocalypse1974.".

Bad filmmaking without the slightest wit or irony. Those were the days... They all lined up for this very sleazy and sadistic Poliziottesco by Lucio Fulci his only foray into the crime genre and I'm glad it was the only one he made. Fabio Testi is the focal point as Luca Di Angelo an idealistic family man and cigarette smuggler in this tale of mob warfare in economically depressed Naples. When a rival gang massacres his brother and abducts his wife Luca goes berserk and triggers an allout mob war with virtually every Don in town getting involved.Testi is OK in the lead and Marcel Bozzufi THE FRENCH CONNECTION makes quite an impact as The Margliese a Frenchman who tries to muscle his way into the Neapolitan crime world. He really is the most sadistic and ruthless crime figure you'll ever see. I figure this film would satisfy most Fulci fans. Torture rape bare flesh endless shootouts and plenty of sleaze and violence make this slightly entertaining. I could sit through this because there's quite a lot of action and it's never really dull but otherwise beware. This film has some of the most atrocious English dubbing I know  real bad only made worse by the already howlingly awful dialog and some wooden acting. What about that club scene? I think they took some dialog from a totally different movie there Blue Underground's release didn't include an Italian audiotrack it didn't make sense whatsoever. Even by gradeZ poliziotteschi standards this was pretty mystifying.The film also features a soundtrack with some Italian pseudorock 1980 style. I can't really describe it but it was annoying and totally inappropriate for the scenes. Fulci does show some of his earlier cinematic flair in some especially interior scenes but then ruins it all in the next with bad lighting and bad editing like showing somebody's head blown off before the actual shot is being fired. In an earlier comment someone remarked the gore was very realistic. Well what can I say? If you think blood looks like strawberry juice I guess it does.Camera Obscura  410".

There is one effect where a guy gets shot in the stomach with a shotgun and his belly opens up like a giant red piata. It's his birthday! There were plenty of other nasty bullet shots too. Fulci also delivers three or four disfigured corpses. Oh and two torture scenes one involving a Bunsen burner and lots of seared flesh.What I'm saying is Contraband has its points.

The Marsigliese is targeting all the mob gangs who run illegal smuggling operations wishing to take over the whole city as chief crimelord but the thorn in his side is Luca who is willing to do whatever it takes to avenge his brother's murder..which adding to the agony happened not far from him.My very first Poliziotteschi was entertaining for it's graphic bloodletting and enthusiastic staging of gangsters and hoods being killedbeaten in ultraviolent ways..I do wonder if the slow motion action setpieces where characters fall from great heights or through windows was inspired by Bloody Sam. Bodies riddled by bullets with lots of blood squibs. A woman's face is viciously scorched. Brains shot out the back of a mobster's skull. A spike stabbed into a hood's chest as blood slowly leaks out. A throat is blown apart. Even though Fulci wasn't directing a horror flick he could still serve up the blood shed unrestrained within a serviceable plot dealing with a criminal world wrought with violence and corruption.The cast and story are quite familiar to what you often associate with mafioso tales featuring betrayal revenge  violent methods at securing power prestige and wealth. A shared empire is desired by a mafioso boss with a grand scheme to run coke through Naples without the trouble of other mobs dealing in lesser risky criminal ventures. Interesting enough we are taken right into the criminal underworld as investigators attempt to solve the string of murders occurring across the city. But we see how crime doesn't always pay and if you are immersed in this culture as Luca is..pulled into assisting a smuggling empire with his slain brother and other capos there's a possibility that you endanger those you love. In CONTRABAND Luca's wife is kidnapped badly beaten and anally raped as the Marsigliese demands a partnership..it's all a setup to finish off the last remaining capo left in the cityin his drugrunning operation. Nifty climactic showdown with old retired dons helping out Luca against Marsigliese and his thugs with even Fulci getting to fire a machine gun! Composer Fabio Frizzi provides a rather discofunkadelic type of score coexisting within a brutal crime story. Saverio Marconi has a memorable role as a trusted mobster Luigi Perlante who is in cahoots with the Marsigliese Ajita WilsonMacumba sexualhas a minor role as part of Luigi's entourage and Romano Puppo is the Marsigliese's coldblooded trigger man. Venantino Venantini is Captain Tarantino and Fabrizio Jovine is the Chief of Police trying to end the smuggling operations plaguing their economydeprived city. The film's breadnbutter are the shootouts and assassinations with Fulci trying to cover up the story's inadequacies with lots of action. The film does suffer some pacing issues with an ongoing gag involving Guido Alberti as the powerful Don Morrone watching television with only an appetite for spaghetti westerns. Photographed by the great Sergio Salvati Fulci's long time cinematographer..and a staple for Charles Band productions as well. Special effects from Germano Natali a long time collaborator with Fulci and Argento whose work here is satisfactory..the standout besides the brains exploding from a skull being a henchman's stomach exploding from a shotgun blast with his intestines spilling out on the streetthe weakest effect showing the obvious fake head of a mafioso being blown apart by a machine gun.".

It comes right at the end of the Italian crime movie phase and is probably the most violent of the lot right up there with Ruggero Deodato's LIVE LIKE A COP DIE LIKE A MAN.  THE SMUGGLER is at times a wonderful combination of the genre with all the usual gang dropping by from Romano Puppo and Nello Pazzafini as hitmen to Luciano Rossi as a hunchback drug taster!   This flick's got it all loads of violence some imaginitive photography and two of the coolest leads in history  Fabio Testi as the good guy and Marcel Bozzuffi as basically the same guy he was in THE FRENCH CONNECTION a greasy slimeball.  After all the violence and mayhem this flick isn't exactly perfect.  Where at times it rolls by smoothly quite often the flick gets bogged down in confusing narrative and a lot of pointless characters.  It's not atypical for Fulci even if it is his only pure crime movie complete with wanton and gratuitous gore.  Faces are melted heads are blown off and guts are shot out of Romano Puppo's belly in glorious slow motion much like his very similar death at the end of STREET LAW.  Watch for the running injoke with Guido Alberti who looks no less than a million years old flipping through channels always skipping the crime flicks and erotic thrillers in favor of the good old Spaghetti Westerns. These scenes don't really ever fit in with the rest of the film but it's all good fun nonetheless.  Certainly Lucio Fulci is no Enzo G. Castellari or Umberto Lenzi when it comes to directing crime movies but he injects this film with enough of his own touch that it becomes a lot of fun.  Definitely not one to miss and it certainly is a delight to learn it's finally coming to DVD.".

I also love watching bad movies so I'm not some artsyfartsy type who bashes films a great deal so rating a film this low is something special for me.This is a blatant ripoff of the Godfather series. Entire scenes are plagiarized even if the lines are altered. Scenes like all the godfathers having a meeting to decide how to deal with a particular situation and the main character splitting with his wife are basically Godfather ripoffs. But this film is so bad that in the godfather meeting scene they democratically take a vote by a raising of hands. Wait a minute...isn't the head of the family supposed to sit in silence and then TELL everyone what to do? What's with this all in favor for choice one raise your hands BS?! And the scene where the husband and wife split up is pathetic because in the next scene she mysteriously shows up to take care of him and all is well! The plot is threadbare and the dialogue is worse than a porn flick. Speaking of porn what's up with the soundtrack? I think that very soundtrack was used in every porn flick from 19751985...you know the one where you have a heavy pulsing bass track with a screeching lead riff in the background. And when the porn track switches off again with the plagiarizing...I'm sure the track is just a slightly altered version of the Godfather soundtrack.Yes this is a gory film. But it dragged so much inbetween the violent scenes I found myself fastforwarding. The gore ranges from great bloody squibs to totally fake effects like the candleintheface scene. But there are some spectacularly gory sequences that work and the rape while never actually shown will make you squirm just because of the screams of the actress. I must say she really went for it.Overall not really worth the effort. If you can get a 2 or 3 minute montage of the gore that's what I'd go for.".

They have a close call with the police and suspect a rival gangster Scherino of turning them in. After sharing their concerns with their boss Perlante oen of Mickey's prize horses is killed and a fake police roadblock leads to Fulci paying homage or straight up ripping off depending on your perspective to the scene where Sonny dies in The Godfather. Luca escapes death while his brother is not so lucky. Despite warnings that he should leave town he has a speedboat funeral for his brother and vows revenge. Breaking into Scherino's house he almost kills the man before running into his henchmen. He gets his ass kicked but his life is spared after the boss tells him he had no part in the death of his brother.Adele Luca's wife wants him to forget this life. But he's in deep after discovering that a vicious French criminal named The Marsigliese is responsible. We meet this criminal during a drug deal where he responds to a bad batch of heroin by burning a woman's face with a blowtorch. If you haven't realized that you are watching a Lucio Fulci movie this would be the point in the film where you realize that fact.The Marsigliese starts killing all of the Mafia leaders so that he can become the sole boss of Naples. Even Perlante is nearly killed only being saved by the fact that his chief capo was having sex with his mistress and triggered a bomb under the bed. After a meeting between Luca Perlante and The Marsigliese where they discuss working together Luca warns his fellow smugglers that if the French boss has his way there will be more drugs more overdoses and more problems  with less money for all of them.The police are using all of the intercine battling to round up smugglers but Scherino saves Luca and suggests they work together. They meet at Perlante's house but Luca smells The Marsigliese's cologne. That's when gunmen bust in and shoot everyone but Luca who escapes by crashing through a window. Scherino is mortally wounded but not before shooting Perlante in the neck killing him.Again in case you wonder who directed this film The Marsigliese kidnaps Adele and demands Luca turn over his smuggling operation over the phone...and then plays him the sounds of our hero's wife being beaten and gangraped. Luca unites all of the retired mob bosses and old guard bosses who are sick of hearing about the Frenchman taking over. They take out most of his men and Luca guns him down in a garbagestrewn alley in a scene packed with blood spraying everywhere.Adele and rescued and Morrone the leader of the old school mob guys tells the police that he has no idea who Luca is.Contraband was made as Fulci was starting to claim his gore crown. It's his only crime movie but it's not a bad effort. And if you're looking for his trademark tics as you've read above this film is full of them. It has way more blood and guts than any film of this type and subverts the genre it should be in so it's quite similar to how Fulci treated sword and sorcery with Conquest. This may not be one of his bestknown films but it's worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "At least that what I think he says. Contraband is Lucio Fulci trying his hand at the Italian Crime genre adding his very own touch to the proceedings and producing what results in a very gory thriller with all his eccentricities intact. Set in Naples it involves small time crooks Luca and his brother Mickey who are heavily involved in the smuggling of cigarettes. After a raid on their operations they both seek to find the grass who's been trying to mess things up for them. But who is it? After much accusation and conspiring it turns out there's a new boss on the street wanting to flood Naples with drugs and willing to wipe out the competition at any cost. Contraband is a very slow moving film at first but in a good way. Luca doesn't even start getting payback until the half hour mark and there's a definite lack of car chases and gun battles that we've enjoyed before in films like The Big Racket and Violent Professionals. Fulci approaches the story from a different angle showing us the various levels of the criminal hierarchy in Naples introducing us to a myriad of characters and then basically killing them all off in a very gory fashion. It's not action packed but when the violence happens on screen it's extremely gory. This film ain't for the kids!There's gore here to rival The Beyond and Zombie Flesh Eaters. Throats and stomachs are blown out someone has their face burned off and a man is very graphically shown having the back of his head blown off. Add to that the very cool scene in the disco You can see it on YouTube Fabio Testi's presence and the overall laid back atmosphere and you've got a great film right here.There's a good few cameos from Italian Movie land  Romano Puppo Venantini Venantino and Fulci himself. The Region 0 Blue Underground version is the one to have.".

Fulci approaches the story from a different angle showing us the various levels of the criminal hierarchy in Naples introducing us to a myriad of characters and then basically killing them all off in a very gory fashion. It's not action packed but when the violence happens on screen it's extremely gory. This film ain't for the kids!There's gore here to rival The Beyond and Zombie Flesh Eaters. Throats and stomachs are blown out someone has their face burned off and a man is very graphically shown having the back of his head blown off. Add to that the very cool scene in the disco You can see it on YouTube Fabio Testi's presence and the overall laid back atmosphere and you've got a great film right here.There's a good few cameos from Italian Movie land  Romano Puppo Venantini Venantino and Fulci himself. The Region 0 Blue Underground version is the one to have.";

Made right after he made ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS Fulci was obviously quick to cotton on to the moneymaking potential for extreme gore. With this lateintheday crime thriller made when the Italians were just beginning to ease off from that genre he came out with one of his most shocking movies.The Mafia operations in Naples are being set back by unknown parties. A massive contraband deal is interrupted by the police a Mafia stables is burnt to the ground and the brother of minor league Mafioso Luca Testi is assassinated at a phony police roadblock.

He's not long in finding out  a French drug racketeer known as 'The Marsigliese' Bozzuffi is killing his way through the Neapolitan crime lords hoping to replace the pennyante contraband pipeline with his own drug network.Though CONTRABAND lacks the pace and conviction of the dynamic Lenzi and Di Leo police thrillers Fulci does well enough and handles the action scenes well. Shootouts at a traitor's house and on a dawn street the latter involving geriatric assassins  one of whom is Fulci himself in a witty cameo! are standouts as are the fight scenes at a sulphurpit and a deserted liner drydocked at an angle.It certainly is way more violent and unpleasant than any American thriller you'd care to name if not necessarily realistic in its approach. Submachinegun fire literally disintegrates a guy's head pistolshots take out huge chunks from necks and skulls shotgun blasts blow stomachs WIDE open and in one of the most effective killings one poor sod has an entire machinegun clip emptied into his body until he takes a tumble down a cliff! This isn't mentioning the other unfortunates who are stabbed boiled in pits pistolwhipped or blown apart in bombblasts. The makeup FX vary wildly from good to bad but their extremely brutal approach do make it a film you won't forget in a hurry.Two scenes in particular are especially hard to take. The first involves a pretty female drug courier. Her face is blowtorched to a horrible crispy steamy black when she tries to double cross the villain who sees through her attempt to pass him virtually worthless cut cocaine. This goes on for almost one full seriously unpleasant minute. The second has the villain attempting to force the hero into a deal  by having Luca's kidnapped wife beaten and sodomised with her screams echoing down the phone line as an additional push. The rape itself isn't shown but the convincing turn by the actress involved and gloating manner of the villain 'This time we have to do it right!' make the scene nighon impossible to sit through without provoking some sort of reaction.One of the most extreme crime thrillers CONTRABAND further benefits from a great Eurofunk Fabio Frizzi score and some betterthanusual acting. Testi is likable as the 'honourable' hero even if he does sometimes use sadistic torture. But his character is pretty much the same as the one he played in Fulci's ultrasadistic 1975 western FOUR OF THE APOCALYPSE.The FrenchItalian actor Bozzuffi wellknown for his appearance in international productions is excellent as the main villain of the piece playing his evergrinning sadist as an amalgam between his two most famous roles his beaming gay thug from Z and his sleazy coldblooded hitman from THE FRENCH CONNECTION and presenting a character with no virtues at all! Romano Puppo as the villain's imposing hitman who kills off most of the cast! also makes a big impression and has a great face that was perfect for crime movies. You can't wait for both to meet painfully gory deaths and Fulci does score in that department! It's a shame that neither turn up until the halfway mark but the film picks up considerably when they do. Sadly both actors are no longer with us in real life depriving the world of two vastly underappreciated talents.Other appearances are clocked in by Luciano Rossi as a hunchbacked drug chemist Venantino Venantini as a lazy cop named 'Tarantino' and hardcore starlets Ajita Wilson and Cinzia Lodetti as the playthings to a playboy mobster. The latter gets a great scene rubbing her tits in a gay gangster's face before she gets blown up! So CONTRABAND is a sleazy movie and sleazy enough to make it worth seeing BUT there are some irritating flaws. The English dubbing is chronic and seriously mars some otherwise good performances Bozzuffi gets saddled with a particularly bad gay voice while Testi's voice turns up on at least three other different characters. Plus the first third of the film is slow and boring.Since virtually all of Fulci's movies are flawed in some way at least CONTRABAND does deliver the goods and is essential viewing for anyone into Fulci or European crimeslime in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this when it premiered and just rewatched it on IFC again. This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai'i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900's. My grandparents were part of that migration my parents were born on a Kohala plantation Big Island at the time setting of the movie. I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over 30 years. I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped with wild cane still growing years after the plantations closed. I've heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation. This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories. This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plotdriven movie. It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman's. Some people just don't get it.I didn't recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job. I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train and in an Australian film co starring with Russell Crowe Heaven's Burning. Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English especially for someone who didn't grow up in the Islands. I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator. And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited nonspeaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene. I was saddened to find out that the director and cowriter Kayo Hatta died in an accidental drowning in 2005. There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience Gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil many of them Japanese in the same time period and Sugar Cane Alley about the cane plantation experience in Africa. The latter is still available but Gaijin sadly doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while. Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is A Thousand Pieces of Gold. This was set over the Chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad starred Rosalind Chao Chris Cooper Michael Paul Chan and Dennis Dun.".

Some people just don't get it.I didn't recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job. I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch's Mystery Train and in an Australian film co starring with Russell Crowe Heaven's Burning. Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English especially for someone who didn't grow up in the Islands. I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator. And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited nonspeaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene. I was saddened to find out that the director and cowriter Kayo Hatta died in an accidental drowning in 2005. There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience Gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil many of them Japanese in the same time period and Sugar Cane Alley about the cane plantation experience in Africa. The latter is still available but Gaijin sadly doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while. Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is A Thousand Pieces of Gold. This was set over the Chinese workers' involvement in the building of the railroad starred Rosalind Chao Chris Cooper Michael Paul Chan and Dennis Dun.";

I don't care how much money they make or how many cameos they have these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors writers and directors that truly deserve the attention.

AND if someone gets cut by a sword there should be blood and at least a cut though since the Narnia films get away with it I'll give Disaster Movie a pass here.The 'jokes' are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year there's some from late 2007 as well including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees.You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don't care how much money they make or how many cameos they have these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors writers and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization.";

Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write and I can't believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It's an insult to the audience though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating Unfortunately there is not a number low enough yes this includes negatives to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time right there with Date Movie Epic Faliure...I mean movie and Meet the Spartans.

It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.May Contain Spoilers....if you care First off as it appeared in the trailer this movie does not spoof or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times there are some plastic asteroids and a bad cgi tornado all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie but other than this there's nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references not to be confused with actual spoofs to such films as High School Musical Step Up this summer's crop of comic based films Enchanted Alvin and the Chipmunks Kung Fu Panda and Sex and the City. I can't wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend there's nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the jokes were forced and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is like all their other gems Epic Date Spartans they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing again...not spoofing Such lines like It's an inconvenient truth it's global warming Come here you kung fu panda what is this enchanted place How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Let me get my Get Smart phone proceeds to talk on his shoe and whats with the marching band? I thought I'd cheer you up with a high school musical all exist to make sure we're in on their super intelligent antics.Please save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I can't even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny. Speaking of 5 years old that's about how long many of these jokes will last before absolutely no one can find them funny anymore since as usual most of them are simply based on pop culture references.".

I was never a fan of Miss Winehouse but dear god  How could anyone find this parody of her even remotely funny?It seems that the Directors have now reached a pinnacle since the first ideas they ever had... Scary Movie was Rude and Crude and Broke Barriers  It was funny...... Where this movie is like Epic Movie Just plain CRUDE! So Crude that it is NOT FUNNY  END OF!I watched it simply because it was on the TV... I am damn glad I never saw it at the Cinema or wasted my money buying the DVD...There is an ART to doing PARODY... Being Crude is Great but only if you can do so with Intellect...These people need to take a step back and look at the works of the Wonderful Mel Brooks Gene Wilder and many more... They may be old and their humour may not match the new generation but they had a class that made it work and made it funny!Face it Fellas... You have no class... And trying to be crude when you have no class means you are just plain crude... And that means you FAIL!How would I rate this Movie? Sadly We cannot do Minus ratings... So My honest view is I don't... Not even ONE STAR... But to submit my review I need to add one... And thats all it is getting!".

Will followed by his friends Juney Crista Flanagan Calvin Gary G Thang Johnson and Lisa Kim Kardashian go out into the city and tries to find his girlfriend and a safe place and later realizes that he has to find the crystal skull to set things right.The problem with this movie is just like other movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer that it doesn't stay on the theme but goes all over the place and try to spoof almost every popular movie that was made that year and some that even came later Enchanted hadn't come out that year they could only have seen the trailer. And I use the term spoof lightly. Once again Seltzerberger show that they only grasp the most superficial concept of what humor is and never really bother to dig deeper and see what it is that makes things funny.

That movie at least had a story. Sure it was borrowed and crapified but at least it was a story. In this movie everything that happens during the second act when they try to find a safe placefigure out where they should go just feels like a filler where the gang stumble into one reference after another. Seltzerberger's overreliance on potty humor movieTV references random musical numbers deliberately obvious stuntdoubles and crappy special effects does not save them this time.Seltzer and Friedberg your movie sucks horribly. If I may paraphrase a line from Billy Madison I'd like to say I award you only one star and may God have mercy on your souls.Once again if you want to see a GOOD movie made in the style that this train wreck was trying and failing to emulate watch Hotshots Airplane!

	schema:headline " This movie is a full crime.";
	schema:reviewBody "My friend said 'never watch this movie. It sucks it hurts your eyes and it's bad for your brain'. He said this movie was the second worst film he ever saw. Because of the fact that my friend watched like thousands of films I was a little afraid to watch this movie. Unfortunately My curiosity won my worries. After I decided to watch this movie my friend told me about a hundred times not to watch this movie. But I was to curios. Then last Sunday while my friend was watching the Simpson I watched this film. Before I start this review let's go over some types of movies. The first one is a movie that's so good you can hardly say anything after you watched it. Second great but not as good as the first one. Third just good forth harmless fifth bad sixth very bad seventh a trash and the last type a movie that is used for torturing. This movie is used for the worst torture the humans has ever made.I should have listen to my friend. This movie was a total disaster. I should have known that when I saw the title. This movie starts with some notfunny slapstick and a Cristal skull.Yeah I know it sounds familiar but let's just go through it. It's something about 'if you don't place the Cristal skull back in it's place then the world will come to an end'. Yeah really great plot. Let's give a medal for it. So anyway this person name Will breaks up with his girlfriend and celebrates his sixteen yearold party....... even though he's not. Here High School Musical comes out of nowhere and it's worst than the original. Think about it worst version of high school musical. Than the story suddenly turns into save Will's girlfriend and Will meet's all kinds of characters. Here comes some great shocks like BATMAN IS FLEEING CARRYING A SUITCASE. I am dead serious batman is fleeing carrying a suitcase. Not satisfied? How about this? Ironman and Hulk gets defeated by a cow and so does Hellboy. Juno gets killed by Elvin and the chipmunks who are really monsters Kung Fu Panda is a man wearing a mask Hancok is some guy drinking Giselle is eating glass bottles and Indiana Jones is an old man who is really really short. There are some other characters but I don't want to talk about them right now. No don't cry yet because there is one last thing a song on the last scene. Which is a song that I like to call fk song. I'm not giving this name because the song is bad. I'm giving this name because THE SONG IS ABOUT FKING. I'm not lying. There is a song like this. This song is.........terribly horribly horridly disastrously painfully sickly awful. I'll tell you this. Batman is playing the guitar. Okay? I repeat Batman is playing the guitar.Maybe there is a bad movie that you should watch or maybe there is a movie that's so bad that it's funny. But this film is not one of those films it cannot be one of those films. My friend caught a cold right after he saw this movie and so have I. This movie is just.........awful. No awful isn't the right word. There is not word in this whole universe that can describe this movie. Don't watch this it's bad for your brain your eyes your ears your mind and yourself.".

	schema:headline " A Movie That Made Me Cry";
	schema:reviewBody "I normally don't cry in movies. Forrest Gump Big Fish Schindler's List and many others have passed before my eyes and not a tear has been shed. I consider myself a lover of cinema with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres including comedy action and of course zombie movies. All of this aside I watched Disaster Movie this afternoon and it elicited one emotion from me Anger.I have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as entertainment and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.None of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like Juno and 10000 BC fail to amuse and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did and it failed miserably.I beg all of you as a lover of movies not to see this film. It is an absolute atrocity and I guarantee you will feel stupider for having watched it.PS I work at a theater so the only reason I even saw this movie was for job purposes. I didn't pay to see it and neither should you.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen then you should know that this already will be bad. I'll tell you the truth if you want to watch it as a brainless person ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers which I am not then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it even a little the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan. But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck they are not artists but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer and people usually put the best stuff in them like idiots sometimes.I knew it was going to be bad but I made a bet with my friends and that wasn't a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I'm warning you at least. It shouldn't even be called a movie nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I'm sorry the references are made throughout at pretty much random like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig they were actually close to spoofing it but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it.Oh and please the random wrestling scene? I don't know about you other guys but I have high respect for women and I have a high respect for filmmaking. What I do know is you shouldn't have something in a movie that doesn't add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed Titanic was the closest exception but still you would've gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs. Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same perverts and brainless and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it which hahahaha!!! By the way when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup just like that. Perhaps I'm grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly well I've got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about but whatever the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play the story was still progressing. For example the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere random yes but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun not only was it spoofing cop films and others but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money not to tell people a story. Simple as that and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies or mediocre for that matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jason Friedberg  Aaron Seltzer.I'm generally a defender of the mainstream but these two....these two....They embody all that's wrong with Hollywood hell with modern film in general. I hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films they aren't satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess they are an EXAMPLE of it. It's like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions you don't COPY them and change things by adding hiphop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It's clear they haven't even watched the films that are 'parodied' here in fact several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting thus making effective parodies of those films impossible and imagine for a moment if 'Hancock' or 'The Dark Knight' were never made and they still included references to those films would you still consider that 'hip' and 'relevant'?.And even IF pray tell these films were funny they are still offtopic. 99 of all the 'jokes' have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT You cannot parody something effectively if you don't even mention it. Cut out the offtopic scenes from 'Disaster Movie' for example and you'll only be left with 3 maybe 5 at the most minutes of film mostly credits. I don't care if it's the funniest film in the world if it doesn't in some way deliver what it promises I'm still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or somethinglike how 'Dancing with Wolves' isn't literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware's 'Jimmy Corrigan The Smartest Kid on Earth' comic is about an adult with autism it wouldn't matter but in this case they specifically say what they are going to do and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have offtopic jokes but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9 OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least 'BioDome' actually took place in a BioDome!So I apologize if you get off on being disappointed sorry but I'm not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy or at least have fun. And even worse when they DO make actual parodies of something they only do lame obvious predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively if not more so. Oh so Hannah Montanna's a merchandising whore WOW I didn't know that!!! It's like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent's are discussing politics by making political jokes but who knows nothing about how politics work so he just say's 'I'm a politician' and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cuttingedge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is because it's basically what they do only with 'actors' doing it for them. My review for 'Caltiki' is a better example of satire. And don't call me a snob because I'm a guy who loves stupid comedy 'Jingle all the Way' and 'The Stupids' are some of my favorite guilty pleasures hell I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000' and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks 'South Park' is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.So don't blame other people's films these are crap all on their own.And if they intend their films to be that way that just makes it even worse so they intend to make offtopic unfunny parodydevoid boring unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies then they are onetrick ponies and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few trickslike the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal although yeah he is then these two are the one trickiest one trick ponies who ever lived and their only trick is being offtopic.These films aren't even entertaining in a so bad it's good way in fact they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film as I used to think that that was impossible and although I've done so it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well it's true these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact if someone could have filmed me 'watching' this garbage I'm sure there would have been Z's floating over my head.Ditch this crap please.Oh and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this I'll let you know I didn't pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film.  The previous review will suffice for your FreidbergSeltzer film of choice".

Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isn't one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectra's acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIm's sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC".

Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isn't one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectra's acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIm's sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC";

First off these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. I'm 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I don't watch these movies since Date Movie because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a halfhour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno 10000 B.C. Don't Mess With the Zohan Indiana Jones these are completely irrelevant as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy and made them even less funny.Because of this movie I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic poorly performed excuses for acting and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. It's worse than when Tina Fey left SNL.If you want comedy don't watch this spoofing is an art a talent few posses and these two jackweeds don't posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie Airplane! Blazing Saddles Spaceballs Young Frankenstein Scary Movie 3 and Superhero movie because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.So anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage think again because this stuff is garbage and I don't watch garbage. this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage P. This films will give you AIDS makes you lose your hair make you go blind become flacid makes you get a purple sock this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions that's what it does to you on the inside. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS THOSE DUMBASSES WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND. THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!".

They have brought us the stupid comedies like Date Movie Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans pretty much all those movies have had the same hate I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by just failing every class possible being happy with the C's and D's then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something it's the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie didn't mind Epic Movie liked Meet the Spartans Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy's previous movies jokes that drag on and on to the point where you'll tear your hair out and is of course made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman Iron Man The Hulk and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks aliens and flying cows.Disaster Movie actually does have a couple laughs I will admit that I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody it was so badly funny I just couldn't help but laugh. There are just some fun moments I think it's ridicules that some people can not admit that. That's the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn't even involve them seeing the movie they were just complaining... this isn't the IMDb that I know it's silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie my main thing that I'm upset with this movie didn't need a script it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this while the movie has some funny moments my HONEST opinion if you want to see this I suggest the rental this is straight to DVD quality.110".

And the qualities that should make it rise above porn status are lacking. The high tech graphics are cheesy desktop animated three dimensional renders over live action video. Even in 2000 the look of these graphics is outdated and poor. The anything that would give it a story is nonexistent meaning you get an hour and a half of lame sex scenes but nothing to connect them to some plot or story like the box suggests.

First it relies too much on a technology that helps business to take over personal pleasure this being the film's main critique modern technocrazed society loss of feelings as one replicant says It's sex not love. The director claims that the story develops like doing net surfing. This also means that as when you surf the net you also get overloaded with information which it mostly useless.

Also the overrated Pussy point of view shots which viewed after a couple of times become repetitive and tiresome. The film's production team itself indulges in the film's hype by creating in the film's website some sort of mythology backing the film's story and adding some more information to explain in words what it could not be achieved in images even though the world of the future and to some extent the present world is a world of images. Nevertheless the film's visual style deserves special mention. Shot on DV camera it achieves amazing light and colour effects worthy of film cinematography. Again this is a good example for filmmakers lacking in money but with plenty of ideas of the use of digital equipment.The film's dealing with sexual issues is quite challenging due maybe to the fact that is directed by a woman. Sex is shown quite explicitly. This includes homosexual sex to the disgust of the male audience who sat uncomfortably in their seats as they were watching on the screen two guys performing oral sex. And the amazing scene where one of the replicants is having sex with her boss who turns out to be a female transsexual. The films also has its funny moments coming from the unintelligible dialogue from the Japanese cast and scenes such as the one in which a replicant and her sex partner appeared to be having sex inside a fish tank where koi carps seem to be floating around them.".

	schema:headline " Japanese SciFi Porn... Yum!";
	schema:reviewBody "IKU This film titled I.K.U. which simply translates from Japanese to English as orgasm as in I'm Coming! is quite the mixed bag of feelings for me. First off it's tag line of This Is Not Love This Is Sex. A Japanese SciFi Porn Feature already hands us the delightful notion that this is going to be chock full of Oriental nudity and hopefully plenty of great looking Japanese gals engaging in softcore sex. But not only that these glorious scenes of gratuitous nudity will be splapped into a snazzy science fiction computer animation enhanced cyberpunk action flick. Right? Nope! I was wrong. It's EXACTLY what female Taiwanese director SHU LEA CHEANG claimed it would be... PORN pure and simple. Not so much as in straight hardcore stick it in and pull it out triple X adult video store porn but more like an attempt to be an avant garde experimental sex film. I mean it's loaded with niffty camera angles neon lighting quirky CGI effects futuristic set pieces and a technoindustrial soundtrack performed by the SABOTEN Band. Oh and not to mention the most appealing aspect of all lots and lots of sex. Story as if we need one goes something like this... the Genom Corporation no relation to the classic Anime series BUBBLEGUM CRISIS makes beautiful female replicants or better put sexdroids who venture out into the public and engage in love making acts with various lucky fellas of a future Tokyo. They record the orgasmic pleasures both his and hers and return to the home office where this sex info is uploaded into Genom's main computer databank. This information will later be used to make some sort of ultimate virtual reality sex program or game or a better lovebot or hell I don't really remember anyway. I lost track of the socalled story after the first naked Japanese babe showed up on screen. And there's aplenty of them to go around too. The featured robochick is named Reiko of the XXX Generation played by the elflike actress TSOUSIE who could be the closest thing to an Oriental TANK GIRL and she can assume numerous different appearances throughout her multiple sex encounters. Whatever her sexual partner desires I suppose. This also gives us the audience the chance to catch lots of other gorgeous real life pornstar Asian hotties in some down and dirty sweat sessions. Casting credits go to actresses AYUMU TOKITHO as Reiko 1 MARIA YUMENO as Reiko 2 YUMEKA SASAKI as Reiko 3 MIHO ARIGA ! as Reiko 4 MYU ASOU as Reiko 5 and ETSUYO TUCHIDA as Reiko 6. And well believe it or not that's pretty much it for the film. There's actually some other stuff happening now and then but nothing really important since you're here for the exact same reason I was to see those good looking Japanese sweeties in their birthday suits. However let me warn the guys out there though please fast forward past the underground parking lot chapter if you're easily offended by homosexual activity. There's a scene where two dudes get way too friendly with each other that was so sickeningly foul to watch it nearly ruined the whole movie for me. Steer clear of it trust me on this. But other than that IKU certainly wasn't bad at all if you know what you're getting into from the start. Don't let yourself be surprised like I was by expecting a regular movietype movie here. This isn't one but hey if you think about it Japanese porn is ALWAYS a great thing to see no matter what.".

I encounter these enough to know that they should exist and I am glad of it.Its a bit different when the intent of a film is to serve a prurient need outside of the context of what we consider real movies. Porn is usually discriminated from other films by existing outside of the need for story. This isn't quite right because there's always story its just with porn the stories the viewer brings are so strong and deep that they only have to be referenced in the briefest of shorthands. These stories and shorthands interest me because the implied stories are I think complex and the shorthands are clean universally understood and succinct in their visual form.So I spend time with films that purport to mix porn and real storytelling. Michael Ninn impressed. Max Candy maybe. Some single projects from the 70s.Now this. Its unapologetically porn but on the softish side. What's interesting is that if you take it as porn it seems to deliberately cancel itself because like Sex Psycho it covers so many types of sexual encounter that it is bound to offend whatever story a porninclined viewer will bring. The story thread of this is clever enough to warrant description. Its designed as if it were a chapter in a Bladerunner world replicants designed for or at least adapted for sex. The story is pretty complex not in what you see but in what is explained. A replicant takes on seven bodily forms so as to collect a variety of intense orgasms apparently the Japanese term for orgasm is iku. The purpose of this is to transfer them to a pill so an evil corporation can make money and gain power. By transferring the orgasmic knowledge to the company the replicant will buy her freedom.The Bladerunner allusions are scant except for one critical piece in the very beginning where we and it seems the replicant's control encounter an origami crane from Bladerunner. If you know that movie you'll know that the crane plays a key role in switching the whole focus of the story from that of the theatrical release to a radically different and more exciting one in the director's cut. I won't detail the shift here but it had to do with shifting into the realm of directed dreams. And that's big when it comes to stylish porn. Worth looking into.Speaking of into for some reason the filmmaker chose to have a repeated effect of a woman's and one a man's insides as penishandprobe thrusts. Its a puzzling choice.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

Without being told the plot all you would get from this film is mindless forced dull dumb sex and atrocious 90s 3d. This Reiko robot simply goes around begging for sex and no one is suspicious or anything. It's like the future is just filled with drugged up lunatics who live in squalid living conditions that are always never fully explained at all if even. It could have been so much more if the creator actually took it seriously. This cannot be the best shehe's got. I would say i'm at a loss as to how others gave it good reviews but then I could safely assume they're likely to be hardcore japanophiles. Do not watch this please.".

It doesn't matter if the film is supposed to be art or not. It's a film first and art second. Without being told the plot all you would get from this film is mindless forced dull dumb sex and atrocious 90s 3d. This Reiko robot simply goes around begging for sex and no one is suspicious or anything. It's like the future is just filled with drugged up lunatics who live in squalid living conditions that are always never fully explained at all if even. It could have been so much more if the creator actually took it seriously. This cannot be the best shehe's got. I would say i'm at a loss as to how others gave it good reviews but then I could safely assume they're likely to be hardcore japanophiles. Do not watch this please.";

They would be your typical runofthemill movie that anyone can accomplish. The reason they are difficult to achieve is because not just anyone can do it. I thought this movie was funny. Maybe to a lot of people in the poverty ravaged country of Mexico it's not funny because of the next to life reality of a severed finger and a senseless beating to a sequester victim but to us in the U.S who have been desensitized by all the smut we see at the movie theaters this is a great movie. There were some really funny moments in this movie including the bus chase scene and the romantic love scene at the end involving el cannibal and Cabos' wife. Also Ana Claudia Talancon was aesthetically pleasing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Matando Cabos is the title of Alejandro Lozano's debut film that even when it shares some similitude with American Films such as Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver it stands as a great movie bringing a refreshing breathe to Mexican commercial cinema.The major attractive of the film lies in its screenplay. The story is about two best friends Jaque and Mudo that are involved on a critical situation when they accidentally kidnap their boss the sadistic and rich Oscar Cabos and they hide him on Jaque's car. Meanwhile a kidnapper's band directed by the son of Cabos' exbest friend plan to take him to ask for money. But they take the wrong person and that's how a series of funny events plagued with a black humorscreenplay are shown by a bunch of hilarity characters that add a special charm in the movie.Of course this film is far from been compared to Amores Perros Y tu Mam Tambin or El Crimen del Padre Amaro which were deeper and focused on complex and even controversial issues. On the other hand in Matando Cabos we have a well written and light story from the beginning to the end.Finally it's very remarkable the use of fx for the carchase scene filmed in the Estadio Azteca supervised by people in charge of effects for Matrix that is the most expensive scene ever done in Mexican Cinema's history and by the way the best Mexican action film. That's the reason why the film was released on summer because it's able to compete against the megabudgeted productions.One of the best movies of the Mexican commercial films that vindicates national cinema with its fresh air and leaves the door open for future indie and risky films that are changing the face of Mexican movies. Great film excellent casting very funny and catchy. Don't miss it.9 out of 10".

This movie is done by some fancy kids with the intention to glorify the Tarantino style and a type of American cinema that doesn't need more cheers than the one that has already been giving in the USA but if you are already out of ideas and you wanted to do a Tarantino dirty stylish Mexican film at least you should have written those typical adapted Reservoir Dogs dialogues strong and smart enough to keep out that boring we already seen that and better feeling. Why all this new selfmade Mexican filmmakers can't come with original ideas or at least with a homemade tribute? The movie felt like a sequel of Nicotina a Mexican copycat of Snatch and Smocking Barrels it makes me feel like there is no Indio Fernandez no Almada Brothers no Pedro Armendariz's father! to honor so we have to honor foreign concepts.

Only in a fantasy someone like him would hang out with boring twits like the two writers. Pedro Armendriz Jr. was funny but he only had a very small part.

	schema:reviewBody "It would be an exaggeration to call this Mexican actioncomedy good. It is disjointed full of stupid actions on the part of the principles and the comedic tone is often thrown off by gratuitous violence. Matando Cabos is however a certain amount of fun.The titular Sr. Cabos is a psychopathic businessman known for fits of rage and brutality. In the process of attacking one of his employees he trips and knocks himself unconscious. This puts the employee who happens to be engaged to Sr. Cabos's daughter in an awkward situation especially when he goes for help returns with his coworker and finds his stillunconscious boss inexplicably stripped to his underwear. There follows a wacky night of capers involving kidnappers mistaken identities two unconscious men and professional wrestlers. If Weekend at Bernie's had been in Spanish had two bodies instead of one and periodically degenerated into graphic violence it would have been Matando Cabos.Tony Dalton and Kristoff who play the two leads play their characters as a couple of goofballs and are nothing special. Nor do Ana Claudia Talancon and Rocio Verdejo the two main actresses do anything to distinguish themselves other than look good. It is Joaquin Cosio and Silverio Palacios who play the wrestlers Mascarita and Tony the Cannibal who make the movie. These guys carry themselves with a cool and confidence that makes them the center of every scene. It actually makes no sense that these two would be willing to spend a night risking their lives for a guy they haven't talked to in years but that's part of what I liked about the characters. They are the kind of guys that if a friend calls they will show up ready for anything.".

This puts the employee who happens to be engaged to Sr. Cabos's daughter in an awkward situation especially when he goes for help returns with his coworker and finds his stillunconscious boss inexplicably stripped to his underwear. There follows a wacky night of capers involving kidnappers mistaken identities two unconscious men and professional wrestlers. If Weekend at Bernie's had been in Spanish had two bodies instead of one and periodically degenerated into graphic violence it would have been Matando Cabos.Tony Dalton and Kristoff who play the two leads play their characters as a couple of goofballs and are nothing special. Nor do Ana Claudia Talancon and Rocio Verdejo the two main actresses do anything to distinguish themselves other than look good. It is Joaquin Cosio and Silverio Palacios who play the wrestlers Mascarita and Tony the Cannibal who make the movie. These guys carry themselves with a cool and confidence that makes them the center of every scene. It actually makes no sense that these two would be willing to spend a night risking their lives for a guy they haven't talked to in years but that's part of what I liked about the characters. They are the kind of guys that if a friend calls they will show up ready for anything.";

Having a classic but very funny mixup plot you add excellent injokes and situations that crack you up all over the night. Average acting like Tony Dalton's added to Kristoff Racynsky's humorous persona makes this a very good piece of Mexican cinema. My favorite scenes were the crosseyed microbusero the bar brawl and the damned bird that wont shut up. As it was expected the dialog is plagued with cursing sometimes being funny and others exploiting some curse words way too much. Anyway the car chase scene in the Ztec stadium is beautiful. The only thing that kept me from praising completely was the ending. It was very disappointing. Tony the cannibal was a completely useless character and all we see him actually do the bar brawl not included is him sleeping with Cabos' wife. I personally would have enjoyed him kicking Cabos' ass when he encounters him in the bedroom instead of beating his poor friend up. That was more cruel than funny. And I would have loved to see the crosseyed microbusero once again.With some minor flaws this is the best Maxican film recently. Too bad the same production company was the same to give us Km 31".

In fact the job is so well done that we had a lot of laughs just by comparing the film's verbal antics to the translation. Even though I do not speak French myself it is quite clear that a lot of effort had gone into this. Sometimes the conversations are fast and furious so it's worthwhile to see the movie a second time. Even on the second pass there was a lot to laugh at.This is meant to be slapstick and the story is a total farce so it's hard to see why some viewers apparently expected more. I thought it was well done and very well executed. Even though this whole thing is intended as a joke the reactions of the medieval guys are quite believable.The movie is a blast!".

Unfortunately the subtitles do not do justice to the movie.There are just too many semantic jokes that play off names and locations that could not be translated and make sense.  That is why in so many reviews there seems to be a sharp contrast in views of whether or not this was a jokeaminute movie. The hollywood remake is awful in factit never really made any sense and and the jokes were far and few in between.  This one makes much more sense and the meeting of people and their descendants makes for many more laughs.The other factor is the acting and casting.  This is just the nature of subtitled movies  one very rarely gets the fantastic acting and language ability of actors when reading the watcher is reading a yellow line especially in comedy.  Those who listen to the movie in its original french thikn the acting was fantastic the voice casting something i think is terribly important in acting say could Ashton Kutcher play Maximus from Gladiator no a high pitched voice could not do it is brilliant but reading a crummy translation and it was crummy wont do the film justice.810 for francophiles 610 for subtitle readers".

You get more stupid when you have more slapstick but you also have more laughoutloud moments.

Timetravel films almost always are fascinating whether it's scifi or comedy.Most of the jokes center around the guys trying to figure out today's modern conveniences such as toilets and the problems they have trying to figure them out. Also there are big problems with the men's relatives who are trying to figure out who these strangeacting guys are all about!As for family viewing not suitable.

As the two men try to adjust to life in the 1990s they get into various problems and meet their descendants. The knight is furious that his castle is now owned by the descendant of his peasant servant while his descendant is relatively poor. Great acting throughout and with some great scenes such as when the peasant tries to cook a leg of lamb using an umbrella in the open fire. The ending was quite good although a bit silly how the peasants ended up. Enjoyable overall apart from a few swear words which kind of spoil it a bit. I could not keep up with the French speaking most of the time fortunately I watched it with English subtitles although as they spoke so fast I had to read them fast.".

	schema:headline " This is French Comedy at its best ...Okkay?...";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by JeanMarie Poir in 1993 The Visitors is without a doubt one of the funniest most quotable and most emblematic of all French comedies marking the refreshing comeback of oldschool popular cinema in the same vein than its ancestor La Grande Vadrouille and descendant Asterix Mission Clopatre. No social commentary no political correctness only pure entertainment for both kids and adults notably carried by the unforgettable buffoonery of Christian Clavier as Jacquouille la Fripouille and his immortal OKkay? Proof that the film doesn't take its comical premise for granted it takes almost half an hour to build the setup before the adventure can finally take off. The Visitors begins in an extremely convincing historical setup in 1123 during a thrilling fight opposing the King Louis VI the Fat to his English cousin. The English are defeated thanks to the intervention of Godefroy who saves his king in extremis by decapitating an English fighter then as a reward for his bravery Godefroy is made Count of Montmirail and is promised to marry a duke's daughter Frenegonde de Pouille played by Valrie Lemercier. Victim of a hallucination he accidentally kills his tobe father in law as a result the marriage is canceled. Only God can resurrect the dead objects Jacquouille. Yes but Eusebius the Wizard proposes another solution. Time is like a mountain made of underground galleries and one of his most secret recipes can get Godefroy back to the past one brief instant before the incident.Naturally it all goes wrong and both Godefroy and Jacquouille who had to drink first 'just in case' are ejected in 1992. After that the comedic core of The Visitors depends on a simple yet realistic promise any person who'd be accidentally put in another era would not really be like fish in water. Think of Marty McFly in Back to the Future who was only thirty years too early he was naturally seen as a weird guy. Applying the same logic it's quite understandable that the Count Godefroy the Brave and his servant Jacquouille who were almost nine centuries too late would be believed to be insane. And while this is already funny it's even funnier when they are not like Jacquouille who lives a tender romance with an exuberant trash trailer played by his reallife wife MarieAnne Chazel.The comparison with Back to the Future doesn't end here like Robert Zemeckis JeanMarie Poir doesn't take the comical premise of the plot for granted to let the film go for cheap jokes begging us to laugh. The script is rich in many subplots that enrich the main story and the performances of all the cast have the perfect dosage of overthetop mannerisms and realistic behavior. Reno acts very naturally like a real Knight confident about his majesty while Clavier delivers a magnificent comical performance as Jacquouille proving that he's the worthy successor of Louis de Funes. Jacquouille la Fripouille has quickly become one of the most memorable characters of French Cinema something that most comedies tried to achieve in an artificial way but the public immediately loved Jacquouille and he's now part of French PopCulture.And the performance of Clavier is more impressive because he also plays another prominent character of the film as the descendant of Jacquouille the alliteratively named JacquesHenri Jacquard a snobbish nouveau riche who bought the Montmirail castle. Valrie Lemercier also plays another character as the Countess Beatrice descendant of Godefroy. Only an actress with the talent of Lemercier could have turned such a dull and bland character into an unforgettable caricature of the typical aristocrat woman but touching in her naivety when she believes Godefroy is her cousin Hubert who mysteriously disappeared after an accidental raid. The film earned her a Csar for Best Supporting Actress while it was nominated for most of the major categories. But nonetheless it was the most popular French film at that time.And speaking of popularity that the film made half the success of the more uninspired Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis says a lot about the impact of Media buzz and Internet in a movie's success. Had the movie been directed 15 years later it would have probably dethroned La Grande Vadrouille in the French boxoffice but then again can you imagine The Vistors set in the 2000's with all the movie conventions it implies racial political correctness specialeffects overdose and all that stuff or maybe worse excessive sentimentalism like in Bievenue Ches les Ch'tis. I have nothing personal against Dany Boon's Ch'tis films but the film received so much publicity that at the end it wasn't successful because it was popular but quite the opposite. If only it was good enough to be forgivable but I can't forgive a comedy that ends in an emotional note when a punch line is required.I remember when the movie came out it was the phenomenon of the end of the year everyone was talking about it with so many superlatives that I couldn't believe a movie would be that funny especially a French one. Well I saw it on TV the first time and I laughed my parents laughed the whole family laughed and never did a slower moment ever change that feeling there was not even a slow moment the film was funny from beginning to end with an exquisite twist at the end the socalled punch line that cruelly lacked at the end of Dany Boon's film. At the end the hysterical incomprehension of youknowwho when he finds himself youknowwhere was the icing on an already delicious cake served with a magnificent Gothic music. We all laughed to tears and the fun that never deserted the film is the proof that sometimes the simplest plot premises can make the most hilarious films. I was not in love with the film but with the story and the way everything worked as a setup for a hilarious conclusion. OKkay?".

	schema:reviewBody "Although it is mainly slapstick humor to non French speakers I guess it is in the nuance of the dialog that the French find it so funny. What I liked about it was Jean Reno when playing it straight  there was real menace and one could imagine a medieval knight in today's society coming across as being psychopathic as life was cheap in mediaeval times and to kill a social inferior was as nothing. I also liked the scene not long after the start when the French King although short and portly had a convincing regal air about him darting keen shrewd glances about him as he walked through the camp. And the knights looked like real men at arms a very tough bunch of warriors. If you stay through the titles at the end you will get a wave from a knight in armor who happens to be wearing sun glasses. The version I saw had subtitles that were in keeping with the ambiance of the screenplay  slightly quaint and old fashioned. They were perfect in their intent of conveying the meaning of the clever and understated French dialog. These subtitles were for the showing of the movie on Australian SBS channel. No advertisements either it ran straight through nonstop. Reno plays it as a buffoon for much of the time but underpins his role with occasional deadly serious approaches to his plight and never hesitates to resort to violence to get his way. He presents an unshakeable determination to resolve the matter of being transported in time resulting in a portrayal of a French knight of old which is very convincing. You would not want to cross this guy. I have watched this movie a number of times and can assure potential viewers that it is truly a very funny movie. Disregard the criticisms of those who didn't like it they must be pathetically and pathologically humourless.".

I have a very basic understanding of the language but I knew where the subtle gags were... Okay I admit not all of them but there again I miss the ones in English films too. You only have to watch the faces and the eyes to grasp what it is the characters are talking well mostly fighting about anyway. That is where this film stands up because the acting is absolutely brilliant. It is a true gem of a film and the relationships between the characters are immense. Firstly the relationship between Reno and Lemercier is truly a thing of beauty especially in the future as Reno courts Lemercier and she slowly falls for his charm. Secondly the dynamic of Reno and Clavier who is a very underrated actor and a shame that he has not been in more films to reach English speaking audiences Their master and servant relationship is hilariously done Reno as the aloof nobleman and Clavier as the clumsy fool and is in all honesty a work of genius. When the two first arrive in the future and stumble upon a road they attack a postal van thinking it to be a work of evil  I cried with laughter. All I can really say is please watch this movie and never the remake I mean NEVER Clavier steals the show to be honest in both his roles. Reno is excellent and Lemercier is both beautiful and hugely talented again it is a shame she hasn't been in more films for English speakers.".

This time it doesn't deal with the title character's disability exclusively and as intensely as the 1962 film as much as skirt around it while also relating the story of the people around the girl notably the failed marriage of Margaret and Carlo Landi here played by Joan Crawford and Rossano Brazzi.And it's this failed marriage that provides the fulcrum for the darker events of the story to unfold. Carlo Landi only interested in reuniting with his wife for the money he can get out of her subtly goes after the impaired Esther and in one disturbing scene rapes her while she is in bed alone in Margaret's house as a storm rages on. Esther horrified at what has happened to her tries to commit suicide but is stopped by an equally horrified Margaret who makes a terrible decision about herself and Carlo.While I think Margaret's character could have gone the other way around in regards of the way her character meets fate this was the late fifties and usually heroines in psychodramas had the tendency to choose ending their own lives rather than face the consequences headon see THE CHILDREN'S HOUR for a similar offscreen death scene of the main female character. Even so Crawford does not overplay it and her introspective approach makes her character believable less soapopera like. Heather Sears though is all revelation and steals the movie from Crawford more so since she has no lines until the end of the movie when she has recovered her voice and has to emote all of her feelings from the inside. This is one of the few movies in which Crawford was equally if not more so matched by a younger female star and did not try to snatch scenes away from her with her need of a last shot her character's death is offscreen and I think that she respected this material too much to sabotage it. Her pairing with Rossano Brazzi could have been more to cash in on his appearance with Katharine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME and he plays his character with the veiled repulsiveness that is needed especially for the difficult rape scene. A big winner an intelligent melodrama one which should have been Joan Crawford's last film instead of the pause before her entrance her horror movie exploitation period of which she would never resurface again.".

An odd film for 1957 and Crawford's last starring film of the 50s. She wouldn't return to the screen until What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?Well 53yearold Crawford looks great and turns in a solid performance. Brazzi plays the snaky husband who turns out to be much more rotten than you'd guess. Heather Sears plays Esther as though she is a disciple of Jennifer Jones as Bernadette. Ron Randell is good as the crabby press agent Lee Patterson is good as the boy friend Bessie Love one of Crawford's silentfilm pals from 1920s MGM is funny as a gallery patron Fay Compton plays the head nun Dennis O'Dea is the priest Estelle Brody plays Tammy John Loder is a friend.

	schema:reviewBody "Made while Crawford was still newly married to her final and most say most compatible husband this drama foreshadows in some ways the role she would later take in spearheading the publicity of a corporation. She plays a wealthy divorce on a visit to her birthplace in Ireland who is introduced to a pathetic young girl Sears who is deaf blind and mute. Reluctantly she takes the girl under her wing appalled at the conditions under which she has been living and returns to the U.S. When it becomes clear how much work it will take to make Sears function in any way normally she devotes herself to the cause staying in the school with her until she can communicate. The inspiring story of this transformation leads to an international charity association and unfortunately unearths Crawford's estranged husband Brazzi. The trio lives as a family again but things aren't always as smooth as they appear. Crawford gives a strong portrayal of a mostly selfless individual though at this stage in her career softness was something she had to affect more than present naturally. The strong brow mannered inflection stiff jaw and severe posture were already starting to resemble caricature though she does inject more than a little heart into her role. Sears quite a remarkable discovery does an admirable job in a role based very loosely on Helen Keller that requires expression and reaction without benefit of dialogue. It is to Crawford's credit that Sears is permitted to retain her place as the title character and the central focus of the story in an era when a star could easily have whittled the part down in order to showcase herself. Brazzi is attractive and slick and though he isn't entirely believable as Crawford's mate the two do develop a strong relationship to one another. Patterson turns up as an interested reporter and Randell adds some zest as a chiseling promoter. The strengths lie in the large scope of the story and the attention to detail of the education of Sears. Amusing as these scenes can sometimes be they are reputed to be reasonably factual in their presentation. All of the performances are committed and solid. Weaknesses would include a tendency toward the wildly melodramatic and the occasionally unintentional comedy of Crawford traipsing around muddy Ireland and schools for the blind in a variety of elaborate but notalwayslovely Jean Louis concoctions. It's difficult to know whether Joan had any inkling when making this film that she would soon be flying around to openings and dedications in the name of PepsiCola enacting much of the same gladhanding public relations that she does here. In any case it served as a dress rehearsal for her.".

The scenes at the school on Long Island to which Crawford takes Esther well played by Heather Sears are believable. The Braille is well researched as are other aspects of her learning.As Esther grows up she becomes a very pretty young mwoman. Without giving away the plot she is abused and raped. This is sadly still true of the lives of blind woman and women with other disabilities. They are taken advantage of by parents and other relatives by schoolmates and very often by spouses. The same is true to a lesser degree of disabled men.Make no mistake This is no arid treatise. It has its campy moments as well as its legitimately exciting ones. Among the former are Crawford's swank no matter where she is and the irony of her becoming a sort of foster mother here in light of later revelations by her own daughter.This is a painful movie but a very fine one.".

It's the kind of touch that's effective to watch but which undermines any claim  to a serious exploration of the unusual subject matter. It's that kind of literal heavyhandedness that led Lenny Bruce to devise an irreverent and very funny routine on this movie's story line.".

It's the kind of touch that's effective to watch but which undermines any claim  to a serious exploration of the unusual subject matter. It's that kind of literal heavyhandedness that led Lenny Bruce to devise an irreverent and very funny routine on this movie's story line.";

I don't know why Mr. Maltin found this film funny because it isn't.  It is about a blind deaf and dumb girl named Esther and the way she adapts to society with the aid of a wealthy socialite named Margaret Landi.  Joan Crawford and Heather Sears are incredible in their respective roles of Margaret and Esther.  Miss Crawford did an amazing job very unlike anything else she did.  I highly recommend this film.".

	schema:headline " An underrated drama with a serious message.";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think Joan Crawford ever did a message movie but this is the closest to one that I could think of.  She is an American dogooder who comes across the title character a deafblindmute Italian girl traumatized by the death of her parents in an explosion.  Rather than leave her in an institution Joan takes her in.  She teaches her how to communicate then at the advice of friends she begins a fundraiser for schools for similarly handicapped children.  Troublesome exhusband Rossanno Brazzi comes back and at first seems eager to help.  However his greed takes over and before you know it he is skimming from the funds.When you think of Crawford films of the 1950's melodramatic classics like Harriett Craig Sudden Fear Johnny Guitar and Queen Bee come to mind. This is probably the best script of this era for Joan and she wisely chooses to let the script do the talking not her shoulder pads.  The film takes a sympathetic look at those not able to speak for themselves and one good person who goes out of her way to make a difference until greed enters her life once again.  Brazzi suave and dashing makes a convincing transition from seemingly noble to selfish and greedy snake who takes advantage of the girl in a very horrible and disgusting way.  With no dialogue only a frown tears or smiles to express her emotions Heather Sears is quite good.  There are some sequences which reak of Capra's Miracle Woman or the reallife Aimee Semple McPherson but it is a storyline which stands up on its own.  The tragic twist towards the end is heartbreaking Crawford's sacrifice is perhaps her most noble in films.There is one memorable scene where Crawford's secretary fired by Brazzi tells Crawford she can't come back.  Few words are used in her explanation of why but what she says is moving and honest.  It was a very touching scene and it made me think about the abuse of funds in charitable causes. Another thingLeonard Maltin described this film as unintentionally funny in spots. I just have to say that is so not true in this film.  There may be lighthearted sequences but there is nothing unintentionally funny here at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Story of Esther Costello released in 1957 offers Joan Crawford one of her more interesting roles. Joan plays a wealthy woman Margaret who becomes both a mother and benefactor to a young girl Esther Heather Sears who is deaf blind and mute. The first part of the film is first rate with Joan helping the young girl who has been raised rather savagely to communicate. With much perseverance and dedication Esther learns to understand spoken words by putting her hand on an individual's face and interpreting the vibration of their voice. She also learns to read Braille. Together Margaret and Esther go on a tour raising money for children with disabilities. Enter Margaret's exhusband handsome and suave Carlo Rossano Brazzi who is more interested in money than rekindling his romance with Margaret. However he does so and convinces the two women to embark on a grueling European tour to raise a lot of money as he realizes Esther is a serious moneymaker. The film in the second half descends somewhat into sleaze with Carlo bilking money from the fund raisiers and he also becomes attracted to Esther who is quite a lovely young woman. Needless to say Margaret finds out about the attraction especially after Carlo rapes Esther. The ending is a bit odd. This is not a perfect film but has great importance in that it humanizes individuals like Esther at a time when people often locked them away in institutions. Joan Crawford is her usual dramatic self here and she is quite believable as a woman who cares deeply about Esther and wants all the best for her. Heather Sears is excellent as the young Esther her facial expressions and gestures are very realistic it can't be easy to play a part without dialogue. Rossano Brazzi who was something of an international sex symbol at the time of this film plays his part with all the moneygrubbing sleaze required. Check the film out  it is unfortunately somewhat forgotten.".

She was accustomed to this typecasting and accordingly played it to the hilt in The Story of Esther Costello. This melodramatic on screen persona is a far cry from her early work in such films as Rain 1932 where she plays a prostitute. Crawford's melodramatic persona was a safe bet for her since Mildred Pierce 1945 for which she won the Academy Award. This was the making of Crawfod as well as the breaking. She seemed to be stuck in the character of Mildred Pierce from then on in. As for her costar Rossano Randi it was a brave move for him to take on the part of the slime ball rapist embezzler and exploiter. It was a risk for his career as an actor and it could have the affect of stereotyping people from Latin extraction.The part of the title role as in Esther Costello was played exceeding well by Heather Sears. All of her acting was conveyed through emotion and gestures alone. This was especially played well in her vulnerable scenes such as that of the rape victim. The fact that Esther overcomes many of her obstacles the narrative of the story turns victimhood into survival. A powerful theme with a message of hope. However the end of the film where Esther recovers from her disabilities is too much.If the viewer can overcome the melodrama of this film it has some powerful messages in it.

	schema:headline " Joan Crawford and a charming Heather Sears";
	schema:reviewBody "Crawford is a tough one. I don't like her all that much but she was quite good and likable in Grand Hotel almost stealing the picture from Greta Garbo. But in Crawford's later films she was almost a caricature of a woman. I've seen her in films I never would have watched except that they were either directed by someone I was interested in or there was someone else in the cast I liked. A good case in point is The Story of Esther Costello from 1957. By that time Crawford had lost her youth and was the queen of Pepsi Cola. But I wanted to see Esther Costello because it was one of the earliest performance of Heather Sears one of my favorite British actresses see her in Room at the Top by all means  what a great film!. In Esther Costello Sears plays a girl who went deaf and blind in childhood during the explosion of an uncovered WWII land mine. The story that follows is similar to The Miracle Worker except it's much more cynical and condemns capitalist business masquerading under the guise of an altruistic agency. Sears was excellent. Crawford was bad. There is one scene in the movie at an airport where you can see a big Pepsi sign on the wall in the background. Joan please.Heather Sears on the other hand makes Costello worth a look. Through most of the film she doesn't speak making her performance mostly pantomime which only multiplies her innocent appeal. Unlike The Miracle Worker which is a much better film but very different Costello is more low key. The plot BIG SPOILERS... is rather compartmentalized  traumatized girl is saved from dire poverty learns to communicate through sign language becomes a recognizable icon is used for monetary gain by others then regains sight and speech through another trauma. Yet it sort of flows.The film is also unique for its time in that it addresses child sexual abuse straight on. In this regard it is set apart from Miracle Worker which primarily focuses on one woman Ann Sullivan played by Anne Bancroft getting through to a deaf blind child. That aspect of Costello is dealt with quickly by comparison with Crawford in the similar Bancroft role. The most interesting part of Costello occurs after Sears character has learned to communicate. All the scenes with Crawford trying to get through to her are rather clunky compared to the Bancroft scenes with Patty Duke in Worker. Yet Sears manages to make the early scenes watchable with her discovery of language coming across as very genuine. Sears is worth seeing in a number of films including Room at the Top Sons and Lovers as Christine in Hammer's Phantom of the Opera and much later in life as Biddy in the 1974 Great Expectations. She died much too young.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably the strangest movie of Joan Crawford's career and one of the best from her latter years as well. While the movie is far from perfect it is a bit heavyhanded at times and schmaltzy it dares to be different. Plus while schmaltzy it juxtaposes it with intense cynicism and the end result is surprisingly watchable. This is especially important because this reviewer generally HATES Joan Crawford movies I just didn't think she could act! Okay the movie begins with Joan visiting Ireland and being introduced to Esther Costelloa teen rendered deaf and blind after a frightful childhood accident. Crawford is very rich and takes pity on her and tries to get her the best medical carebut her problems seem incurable. Well Joan takes her to a deafblind school and intends to pay for her to stay. However she becomes very attached to Esther and instead of just leaving her there as she originally intended she stays with her and becomes her personal teacher. Eventually she is able to get through to her and train Esther to read braille and communicate. This part of the movie is pretty inspiringsome might say TOO MUCH but this cynical reviewer liked this part of the film.Joan later realizes that there must be many other kids out there like Esther who need help so she decides to form the Esther Costello Foundation to fund the training of deafblind individuals. The organization takes off wildly as Esther herself is a terrific public speaker with of course the help of Joan to translate.At this point Joan's estranged slimebag of a husband Rossano Brazzi comes out of the woodwork. He proclaims his undying love for Joan and they are reconciled. He feigns interest in the organization and helps Joan to greatly increase the notoriety of the foundation. Unfortunately unknown to Joan is that Mr. Slimebag actually is siphoning off funds and has a more than paternal interest in the lovely Esther. Eventually this piece of filth rapes Esther but is later discovered by Joan. In the end she kills herself and Rossano but only after she determines that the nice reporter she's known all through the film is interested in marrying and taking care of Esther. Had the movie ended EXACTLY like this it would have received a 9. BUT the schmaltzy ending included a miraculous eventEsther's vision AND hearing came back and she and her new husband are the focus of the fadeout!!! The ending is just too unbelievable and detracted greatly from the rest of the film.PSAn interesting note. At this point in her life Joan was married to a bigwig from Pepsi. In several of her films and in public appearances she was sure to have bottles of Pepsi or Pepsi posters around for product placement. Towards the first half of the movie I noticed that once again there's the Pepsi!!! Joan stands directly under the biggest and most obvious Pepsi sign. I'm sure as usual she insisted in this as part of her contract!".

Towards the first half of the movie I noticed that once again there's the Pepsi!!! Joan stands directly under the biggest and most obvious Pepsi sign. I'm sure as usual she insisted in this as part of her contract!";

But it still bothers me that Joan not only failed to protect Esther since she was in effect her adoptive mother but failed to get justice for what happened to her. Unless you think it's justice for both her and her husband to have been killed.As to the very end of the story I think it's fine that the details are slightly ambiguous.

It wasn't that the movie was bad exactly but the intense sentimentality dragged the story down and Rossano Brazzi's character was a most unwelcome intrusion into what might otherwise have proved an uplifting story though Crawford's attempts to steal scenes didn't help either.Oddly enough this story adapted from a novel has striking similarities to THE MIRACLE WORKER which came five years later and was the true story of Helen Keller and her teacher Annie Sullivan. The difference is that the later film presents its story without a trace of sentimentality showing its characters unvarnished and with all their flaws on display. As a result TMW is much more realistic. TSOEC suffers mainly from Crawford's penchant for melodrama. Heather Sears under David Miller's steady direction delivers an impressive performance in the title role the problem is that Crawford keeps making sure the audience's attention is on HER at every opportunity. Something that Anne Bancroft refused to do and it won her an Oscar and one for young Patty Duke as Helen.I feel rather bad about this review. I so wanted to like this picture that the end result came as a major letdown.

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene of this film tells the story of how Esther Costello became deaf and blind. If you can watch this straightfaced then you're a better person than me. It was the first of many unintentionally funny scenes in this melodrama. A rich American woman named Margaret Landi Joan Crawford visits the Irish village where she was born. The villagers with the local priest at the forefront conspire to guilt Margaret into taking Esther Heather Sears with her. Why they do this is unclear. I suppose it could be because they wanted the girl to be taken care of and Margaret had the financial means to do it. But the gleeful way the villagers were acting made me think they were happy to be rid of the girl for less noble reasons. Anyway from here the movie becomes like The Miracle Worker with Joan and Heather as surrogates for Anne Sullivan and Helen Keller. Esther's story gets national attention and Margaret starts a charity in her name. Things take a dark turn when Margaret's ex Carlo Rossano Brazzi shows up.Joan's acting is poor. She seems out of her comfort zone except for when she's dealing with scumbag Brazzi. Sears is awful. Let's be honest she really is. It's hard to play a part like this I'm sure but she's just not up to it. Her wideeyed blank stares and silly miming are hard to take seriously. Later after she has learned how to communicate she acts in such a way you can barely tell she's disabled at all. One particular part I want to mention is a big spoiler so  SPOILER WARNING. Late in the film Carlo rapes Esther. This shock causes Esther to regain her sight and hearing! That's right rape cures her. Wow is all I can say. The movie is often touted for the part of its plot dealing with fraudulent charities. Good intentions aside it's a fairly ridiculous movie with many scenes that are unintentionally funny.".

The role of Mrs. Landi is one of an unfulfilled wealthy woman whose maternal cravings are thwarted by an onagain offagain relationship with a cheating husband she doesn't divorce because of her Catholic faith. Crawford is a little too domineering even in this film to pull off a role that demands a much softer side.Despite the weakness in casting the movie itself is highly engaging and retains the interest of the viewer from beginning to end without being too soapoperaish in nature. Rossano Brazzi plays his role of alcoholic gigolo very well being both charming and disgusting at the same time. Heather Sears does an excellent job as Esther Costello. She has no dialogue until the end but evokes a sense of vulnerability through her acting skills. Other reviews have mentioned that Leonard Maltin found the film unintentionally funny and I have to concur with his observations. The aftereffect of Mr. Landi's drunken rape of young Esther is that she regains her eyesight and hearing psychiatric opinion at the time was that a shock to the system would cure hysterical blindness  deafness. Not only that but Esther is suddenly capable of delivering a speech after the Landis are killed. Quite a turnaround for a girl who was blind and deaf for years. This ending varies from that of the original story but it is in keeping with the desire to create a movie with an uplifting and happy ending.".

Joan is at her campy overthetop best in this bizarre story of a woman her love interest and a couple truly strange neighbors one of whom would later become Lovey on Gilligan's Island. The dialog alone is enough to make it worth seeing. Jeff Chandler is at his studly best too. So much of Joan's work is out on DVD and hopefully this film will be too some day. If you're a Crawford fan and you've never seen Female on the Beach get a load of that title! you'll be thrilled by this seemingly lost movie. You can't beat a film with a line like I wouldn't have you if you were hung with diamonds upside down!".

And if there is an era that defines the Crawford that we remember most vividly it's the decadeplus from her Oscarwinning turn as Mildred Pierce in 1945 through her last really top' movie The Story of Esther Costello in 1957.  In her valiant assault as she moved into middle age against time's winged chariot she had vehicles built around her that helped define the canons of camp but retain a fascination that transcends camp.  This dozen or so includes Humoresque Flamingo Road her second Possessed The Damned Don't Cry Harriet Craig This Woman Is Dangerous Sudden Fear Torch Song Queen Bee and Autumn Leaves. Though we may howl at some of them or at parts of them for they range from rather good to quite dreadful we're always aware  at times discomfitingly so  of the human drama that underlies and links them all the Joan Crawford story.In Female on the Beach she plays a recent widow taking up residence in the coastal California home her wealthy husband owned.  Her arrival proves illstarred for a broken railing on its deck marks the spot where its previous tenant  another woman battling age and isolation  plunged to her death.  Did she jump or fall  or was she pushed? It unfolds that she had fallen prey to a youngish beach bum Jeff Chandler operated by a pair of older conartists Cecil Kellaway and Natalie Schafer Crawford is targeted as their next mark.Obsessively guarding her privacy however she proves to be a tough nut to crack.

But the course of true love never did run smooth as the Bard of Avon warns us.  Crawford just happens to find the dead woman's indiscreet diary it's hidden away behind a loose brick in the fireplace! a sad yarn of being cheated in card games and bilked for loans by the larcenous old couple while being strung along by Chandler.No fool she Crawford hands the gigolo his walking papers.

Crawford in jeopardy by contrast turns all the conventions upside down.  The coquettish bulldozer she has constructed of herself at this menopausal juncture in her life with her face as fiercely painted as a Kabuki mask seems designed to repel   to crush  any threats.  Of course like most such postures of domination and intimidation It's a construct of fear  her fears of falling short as a serious actress as a mother as a woman fears of aging and no longer being able to lure her directors and costars between the sheets fears of not mastering her own unachievable goals.  The facade of control and selfsufficiency proves all the more arresting when it comes under siege from the cumbersome twists and turns of these situations held over from nineteenthcentury melodrama.Hence Female on the Beach and its ilk.  An indomitable woman of a certain age flies solo into the perils of midlife only to triumph against all odds.  That was the life Crawford was living at midcentury the life reflected in these films by turns appalling and transfixing.

	schema:headline " Campy Crawford film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a case where an aging Joan Crawford was just about done with good leading parts and the studios were only offering her B level scripts like this. Films were beginning to change and Crawford was not to far off from the last phase in her career. This story begins with an older drunken woman named Eloise Crandall Judith Evelyn chasing after her boytoy Drummond Hall Jeff Chandler but when she goes onto the balcony she falls over and dies. Was she pushed? Lynn Markham Crawford moves into the house and soon meets her neighbors like Drummond and the older couple that he lives with Natalie Schafer and Cecil Kellaway. Their is also a nosy detective hanging around named Lieutenant Galley Charles Drake who thinks that Eloise may have been married. Drummond tries very hard to get Lynn to like him but she's very cold natured. One night she's lonely and horny and makes up with Drummond and they become close. Lynn finds the diary of Eloise and finds out that the neighbors are card sharks and that she was set up for her money. Also the real estate agent Amy Rawlinson Jan Sterling is secretly in love with Drummond and Lieutenant Galley makes very obvious advances on Lynn! Lots of melodrama in this story and it runs like a soap opera. Chandlers character is such a pushy bum! Two seconds after meeting Crawford he is in her house making breakfast and putting his hands on her. He paws her like a Tijuana whore on a Friday night! And I thought it was funny that six foot four Chandler would come onto a woman that stands five foot in heels. Crawford is a tough woman in this film and really cracks Chandler a couple of hard ones. The dialogue is over written like when he asks her how she likes her coffee and she retorts with Alone. Not a bad little subplot involving Sterling either. She's pretty hot looking and you have to wonder why Chandler was never attracted to her. The one scene that stands out for me is when Chandler is on Crawford like a grizzly bear and she cracks him and he responds by tearing her dress off! Rape anyone? But of course this just turns her on. Overly melodramatic and it does have its share of laughs but at the same time you can't stop watching it. You can credit Crawfords screen appeal for that. Silly film is worth a peek at Crawford entering a part in her career that was winding down from serious roles.".

Every evening dress is a masterpiece and the plot secondary only to anything Joan wears in this film. As you may expect Ms. Crawford plays the rich bitch role to the hilt too. I had to love the role played by Natalie Schaefer she's just too delicious in this role. No Joan Crawford drag party would be complete without this gem playing in the background. And if you can't arrive in a stunning frock similar to ones worn by her in this flick you're not invited !!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a lot like an extended Perry Mason episode which isn't surprising since it's from exactly the same era. I would add also that it's beautifully photographed in a noir style.I have a friend who pointed out that the first half of the movie consists of Joan Crawford repeatedly throwing people out of her house which is kind of fun to note perhaps it's an indication of a bit of clumsiness in the script. One could also perhaps say that Crawford leans a bit too much on toughness in her characterization and not enough on the bewilderment the character would have felt as she unwittingly walks into the situation she finds herself in.The film does keep the suspense going though in that it continues to fan the ambiguity of who the house's previous occupant recently dead as the movie starts really was and what her relationship was to the various supporting characters. The film is full of manipulative characters with mixed motives so you find yourself drawing conclusions about the dead character but then resisting those conclusions because it seems like you're being led to them by pretty slippery characters.Overall the film is definitely worth a look sums up the type of movie Joan Crawford was best known for. To get a look at her lighter side try Love on the Run one of a handful of comedies she did in which she costars with Clark Gable.".

Further elevating this goofy Bmovie into the camp stratosphere is the presence of Natalie Schafer the once and future Lovey Howell as a villainous bridge hustler serving as pimp to aging pretty boy Jeff Chandler a gigolo who seems allergic to wearing shirts. One regrets that the producers didn't wait a couple of decades and make Female on the Beach in the 1970s when John Waters could have cast Divine in the Crawford role opposite Troy Donahue kept Lovey had Tennessee Williams doctor the script and made a fun trashterpiece. As is you're stuck enjoying an unintentionally hysterical lowrent thriller starring a Hollywood legend who got stuck in films like this one because she kept plugging away decades after her star faded. And why not? Was it her fault that Hollywood couldn't offer better roles to women her age? The eponymous tootsie is not Crawford but Judith Evelyn who gets drunk and falls to her death on the eponymous beach in the film's opening. Joan as gambler's widow and world's oldest Vegas showgirl Lynn Markham buys the late stiff's Newport Beach mansion so she can have some privacy. Invading her solitude is Chandler the world's oldest charm boy who at the behest of Schafer and coconspirator Cecil Kellaway keeps dropping in on Crawford uninvited and trying to seduce her. She rebuffs him repeatedly which is kind of understandable since he doesn't have much to offer aside from his manly physique and cheesy pickup lines like you're cold  let me warm you. But there wouldn't be much of a movie if Crawford continued to act sensibly so she decides she's attracted to the big lug who has a sensitive caring heart under all that chest hair and the two team up against Schafer and Kellaway. Prepare to marvel at the scene in which Joan disses the socialclimbing parasites with the intendedtobedeathless line I'd invite you to dinner but I'm too afraid you'd accept. If that was all their was to the film it might be a decent screwball comedy but there's the little matter of the dead Miss Evelyn. Did she jump or was she . . . pushed? Who should Joan trust the overthehill male model she's hooked up with or the nosy cop who keeps barging in? And why can't she get rid of that ditzy real estate agent played by the forgettable Jan Sterling after she's already paid for the damn house? These are not compelling dramatic questions but they're mildly diverting and it's hard not to feel a little sympathy for Crawford as she plays out the string. Keep her some company watch her in Female on the Beach.".

Huh?However the movie manages to recover and I thought it was extremely effective to have Drummy saving Lynn from a disastrous plummet from her porch.I'd never have anticipated this would have ended on such a satisfyingly romantic note.

Her scenery chewing acting style is also a hoot. She plays it like she's trying to get an Oscar. She takes every opportunity to show off her figure also.

In other words she was simply too old to be believable as the sexy leading lady she was portrayed as in several of these films. This soap operastyle movie was a prime example of this as she was paired with a much youngerlooking Jeff Chandler...and when she appeared in gorgeous gowns and bathing suits it just seemed very forced and unbelievable. She was 51 and Chandler was in his late 30s. This role should have been played by a woman at least 10 years younger. But apart from that the movie is a pretty pedestrian effortnothing particularly outstanding one way or the other. Passable at best.".

Sure there are some outdated sexist elements of the movie Jeff Chandler practically abuses Joan Crawford in some moments but that's all outweighed by the great powerful and feminist performance of Joan Crawford. So I think this is a movie that can be appreciated by both misogynists and feminists alike as it has a little something for the both of them. Besides what fixed the sexism for me was the fact that Joan Crawford while she ran back to him DID actually have to think for herself about whether or not he was that good for her. It's a beautiful movie and I would recommend it more so to melodrama fans than film noir fans as while it is a mystery on the surface it's a beautiful melodrama underneath.".

She returns to a house in which police are looking at something on the on the beach beneath her house there's a broken railing on her balcony and random items of mens clothing can be found strewn throughout the place. What's going on here? Lynn soon finds out that her last tenant Eloise Crandall fell off of her balcony to her death and the police are still trying to decide if it is an accident or homicide.A beach bum Jeff Chandler as Drummy has moored his boat to her pier and apparently thinks he can pick up with Lynn where he left off with Eloise and doesn't seem to have the phrase personal space in his vocabulary. Lynn is not just another bored lonely near middle age socialite. She's an exspecialty dancer from Vegas and she can see right through Drummy. However time and the solitude she says she's always wanted begin to have a negative effect on her xray vision. Nobody dresses to the nines every night just to pace the floor of their dark empty beach house.Drummy's story  he's hired beefcake by a couple of refined card sharks Osbert and Queenie Sorensen who need a steady flow of cash through loans and illgotten gambling debts to keep them in the lifestyle to which they are accustomed. The source of that cash had been Eloise but now the Sorensens are eying bigger fish  next door neighbor Lynn Markham.Throughout the film a cop investigating Eloise's death will pop up out of nowhere Charles Drake as Lieutenant Galley spouting comeons mixed with veiled warnings while flashing bedroom eyes. Does he suspect murder or is he just trying to squash the competition by casting Drummy as a murder suspect? So who if anyone did kill Eloise Crandall? Drummy to get rid of her? The card sharks to make sure she didn't go to the police about the ruse? Someone else I'm not telling you about just to keep it interesting? Watch and find out. Watch and find out if Lynn thinks she's getting so close to the truth that she thinks she is in danger too.This is A1 latecareer Joan Crawford material all the way. great fashions good speeches Joan tough yet vulnerable and angry confrontations mixed with pure lust. Plus great beefcake shots of Jeff Chandler and the fact that no female seems immune to this beach bum's charms even though he's not exactly your prototype ideal man of the 50's ... or maybe that's exactly WHY they pant after him! After all Ward Cleaver clones might be dependable but variety is the spice of life. I highly recommend it if you can find a copy.".

You have to remember that she started out in silent pictures very few other stars from that era were still working by 1955. And she's so much fun to watch in this film! Very arch and sarcastic she tosses off a number of cutting one liners to great effect. Ah yes and of course she gets a couple of good slaps in too as she said herself I do that in all my pictures!. Man I do enjoy this film it's one of my favourites out of the thirteen theatrical features Crawford filmed during the fifties. Now it's rather seedy and trashy to be sure. After all just look at the setup you have a mature couple sponsoring a younger stud muffin for lack of a better termha! whose sole purpose in life is to serve as an escort in and out of the bedroom for older rich women in order to fleece them out of a bit of money. A slightly daring thing to put on film but by the midfifties the screenwriters could get away with a lot more than they could even a few years earlier even then the production code was starting to crumble.Beefy Jeff Chandler as the gigolo in question is ridiculously attractive and readily puts his assets on display throughout the film. I wonderwas it a bit unusual to so unabashedly and overtly portray a man as an obvious sex object at that time? Not that the audience is complaining! Some would say it's a pity that he was forced to shave and wax for the role which he complained about heck even back in the fifties fellows were manscaping and getting rid of the furry chests.The plot and dialog have little to do with realityone reviewer said Make no mistake Female on the Beach is a strange movie about strange characters doing strange things on the beach. But as I noted aboveit's so much fun. Campy to be sure but it's also a decent domestic thriller and an enjoyable fifties soap yep it's full of soapy goodness. Technical note oddly enough my DVD is presented at the standard Academy aspect ratio of 1.371 even though it was intended to be projected at a ratio of 21. 21 is a widescreen ratio that was used for a few films in the midfifties but which never caught on as one of the standards for widescreen pictures1.851 and 2.391 became the norm instead. So what this means is that we see a lot of extra picture at the top and bottom of the frame on this DVD there's a heck of a lot of extra headroom a larger portion of the great mid century modern interiors are on display than was originally intended by the cinematographer. As a result I found that using the zoom feature on your widescreen television to fill the frame televisions have a aspect ration of 1.781 actually improves the look of the film the compositions look very good when zoomed in.".
