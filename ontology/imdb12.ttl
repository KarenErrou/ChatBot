It is a very faithful adaptation given Hollywood's history of adapting for the screen and one of my favorite movies. It is not entirely faithful i.e. Operation Bareback which I would have enjoyed was forgone probably due to the mass nudity that it would entail. The love interest the storyline and the characters were very close to the novel. Some criticize it as a ripoff of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers but the novel actually predates that work so who copied from whom? The scope of the movie was scaled back and little mention was made of landings and conflicts in other countries but this may be due to editing exigencies. The aliens are suitably creepy as my wife will agree as she still refuses to watch it again and it manages without the gore of many similar movies although it is rather violent.Compared to another recent Heinlein adaptation Starship Troopers this film was much truer to the author's original work and is a thrilling and thoughtful treat.

Like so many new scifi films made from older literature classics the fiction has been cut out like some sort of hideous tumor and the science has been exaggerated to make sure the audience knows it's SCIENCE fiction. The fact that the science is largely irrelevant is lost on most modern screen writers  and this movie is no exception.Another example of a perfectly good story that has been shredded to make it 'fit' Hollywood's version of sciencefiction which is largely made up of clanking robots flashing lights and explosions.The Faculty was a good SF movie. And it was right  Body Snatchers is a ripoff from this story but it never pretended to be anything but. Faculty had some enjoyable sequences. It wasn't perfect and elements were laughable but despite this it was true to itself...this film was just the massacre of a perfectly good story.I only hope anyone else who ever tries to make a movie of a Heinlein classic will stick to the book and make a decent movie not rehash the story until it sounds good  because they sounded good before.".

Also like Stpehen King the results of adapting Heinlein's work into the format of film rarely live up to the potential set by the material. The major difference between the two authors is that an adaptation of Heinlein usually gets better the further it strays from the source so long as it sticks to the spirit. Ironically the VerhoevenNeumeier adaptation of StarShip Troopers remains the best that Hollywood has come up with so far.The problem with The Puppet Masters as a film is that after a wellconstructed setup in which the aliens are made entirely plausible even somehow real it descends rapidly into yet another actionscifi hybrid in the vein of Predator or Aliens. This in itself wouldn't be so bad except for two things. One Heinlein's stories were always intended as the exact opposite kind of sciencefiction. Two the mixture of the two elements leaves the film unbalanced. The second half feels very disjoined from the first.The scientific concepts shown in the film are not perfect but they give it an atmosphere that many horror films of the era lack. However the science of the film is not the only key to making a great story. Where it falls down is in the Transition. The Transition from one moment to the next leaves gaps of logic that disconnects the audience from the story. The questions of how on Earth one thing got here or there are never adequately answered. Telling us that something escaped never works as well as showing us and unfortunately this production of The Puppet Masters never does enough of the latter.The acting doesn't help matters a lot. Donald Sutherland is very competent as usual but the script gives him little to distinguish his character from the other several dozen that he's played in an almost identical manner. Julie Warner stands out as the character who grabs the viewer's attention by fair means and foul. Eric Thal on the other hand is like Keanu Reeves. You could replace him with a wooden plank that has a mean face painted on it and nobody would know the difference. Richard Belzer stands out in an almostwordless cameo. Anyone else in the film never gets the chance to distinguish themselves.The second half and inadequate characterisation of the film would have been easy to overcome if only one of them were present. The only problem is that third fourth even fifth problems are added. One major problem is the sheer volume of exposition that is delivered through dialogue. It is one thing to tell us how character X felt sensation Y at moment Z. To do this without flashbacks or recapping footage from new angles is a difficult ask at best and with a cast of this calibre it simply shouldn't be done.Ironically the concept of The Puppet Masters was done slightly better in a directtovideo sequel to StarShip Troopers. The concept of an alien parasite using a host for a sinister purpose was also done better in The Thing. If you've already seen those films then The Puppet Masters is worth checking out. If not I'd recommend checking them out first. A 5 out of 10 from me.".

They do nice work  Orme provides a tense and pacey first half Tickner's very fine work lends a stylish visual sheen and Towns' music is lushly complex.However although it starts out well the flick loses some energy and traction around the middle and doesn't get it back. Its potential begins to slip away and I'm not quite sure why. Maybe budgetscript cuts. The last third in particular with its underpowered action setpieces and somewhat perfunctory ending suggests that the film had hit the glass ceiling of its production resources... or perhaps even its creators' full interest.Nevertheless it's an enjoyable scifi thriller for a good part of its running time. Might make a nice viewing companion with The Hidden 1987 or certainly any number of old X Files episodes!".

A special Government agent named Sam Nivens Eric Thal meets his Father Andrew Donald Sutherland a biologist named Dr. Mary Sefton Julie Warner  a bodyguard Jarvis Richard Belzer at an airport. Andrew informs Sam that there has been a report of a UFO landing in Iwoa  has satellite photo's to back this claim up they are all on their way to investigate. Once they reach the landing site they find the three boys have made a UFO of their own out of tin  dustbin lids  are telling everyone it was a publicity stunt. Our four Government agents come to the conclusion that they are lying because some of the ground is burnt which for some reason definitely means a UFO landed there  the boys didn't look at Mary's breasts like every 'normal' male would have. They decide to interview TV station reporter Mr. Barnes Bruce Charchow since he was one of the first on the scene. Again he doesn't look at Mary's breast so he must be an alien Barnes takes a gun out of his desk but is shot by Sam before he can use it while lying injured on the floor an alien parasite of some sort jumps from his back  attacks our agents but is electrocuted. Back at their labs top scientist Dr. Graves Will Patton  Mary examine the alien they come to the conclusion that it has the ability to control the mind of it's host  that anyone could be a carrier. Soon the aliens make an attempt to take President Douglas Tom Mason but fail it quickly becomes apparent that the aliens are hostile  want to wipe out the entire human race. As they reproduce  take control of us at an astounding rate someone very good at maths calculates that within days there will be as many as 250 billion of them. The time to defeat this enemy is now but how exactly...?Directed by Stuart Orme I thought The Puppet Masters was average at best but isn't too bad as far as mindless entertainment goes. The script by Ted Elliott Terry Rossio  David S. Goyer based on the novel by Robert A. Heinlein is not the best if these aliens need to be on people's backs why not just have everyone important walk around topless? It sounds silly I know but it would be totally impossible for any alien to go undetected wouldn't it? Problem solved. Anyway wouldn't anyone with one of these things on their backs have a big bulge in their clothing? Why does Sam conveniently survive an alien being on his back with no ill effects when Jarvis didn't? Why do these aliens need to go to a central hive? How can an alien telepathically transmit a disease which luckily for us will kill them all within about 30 odd minutes but not us their hosts? Why do the aliens make themselves so visible? Why do they want to take over Earth anyway? The Puppet Masters reminded me of The X Files 1993  2002 with it's shadowy mysterious Government agency it's male  female leads who don't look dissimilar to Mulder David Duchovny  Scully Gillian Anderson. Many of the ideas brought up in The Puppet Masters are not fully explored or developed  as a whole the film feels very small scale  low budget. This is infinitely inferior to Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978 in the similar themes issues  ideas they both set out to explore  achieve. The aliens themselves look like stingrays with a tentacle that impales itself on the back of it's intended victims necks the special effects are OK if a little rubbery  a scene when one of these aliens is being spun around on a ceiling fan is actually quite funny  stupid looking. There is no gore  very little action as it's mostly dialogue driven unfortunately the script tends to make who is infected  who isn't painfully obvious which means it loses a lot of the potential paranoia which worked so well in the Body Snatcher films. Technically The Puppet Masters is well made but extremely bland  forgettable it has the feel of a cheap TV film written all over it. The acting is soso  no one embarrasses themselves too much. On a positive note it moves along at a nice pace  is never boring the idea is very good  quite creepy when you think about it  generally speaking it entertains for an hour  a half if you don't have too high an expectation. Worth a watch if you can catch it on TV for free or find a copy going very cheap somewhere mine cost about 30 pence at which I can't really complain at!".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be surprised if you get a feeling of dj vu while watching this alien invasion thriller as it's a film which takes bits and pieces from lots of other films along the way to form one loud unoriginal whole. Saying that it's still a fairly exciting movie with an above average cast but the feeling of been there done that which hangs over it stops the film from ever rising above the norm for the '90s. THE PUPPET MASTERS is a lightweight popcorn film at best offering up a few thrills along the way but nothing of substance...INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS a blindingly obvious influence here this isn't. Instead it plays more like Abel Ferrara's BODY SNATCHERS remake  shallow lightweight and pretty much pointless.It's actually pretty good to begin with but soon the air of paranoia and oppressive atmosphere is dropped in favour of allout action and clichd situations. Funnily enough the film is best when imitating INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS but when it turns into a low budget ALIENS wannabe towards the end it loses all credibility. My hopes for a subtle chilling flick were dashed twenty minutes in when we get our first exposure to the aliens after its host is shot dead and the flying creature leaps on to a window. These aliens resemble giant slimy slugs and the influence of the facehugger creatures from ALIEN is also clear. Granted the special effects are decent but I would have preferred the creature as something a little more than slime and tentacles.From this point on our heroes are pursued by unstoppable alieninfluenced killers and the scene is set for a great many entertaining fights and plenty of violent action. Things move sluggishly from one set piece to another until the uninspired showdown which sees two of our armed heroes storming the alien base making their way through lots and lots of slime and gooey stuff and saving the day. This is where the film resembles ALIENS the most and the design of the two nests is almost identical. The saving grace of this part is the nifty entrance to the nest done with the aid of a simple yet effective computer graphic.Donald Sutherland takes the lead and having previously starred in an alien invasion movie in the '70s he knows exactly what to do. Sutherland is fine in this kind of authorative role although he isn't exactly stretched instead content to fall back on the smirking persona he so often employs in his '90s films. Eric Thal is the muscular leading man displaying little acting skill or ability instead yet another wooden leading man. Julie Warner is the glamorous predictable love interest who finds a simple reason to gratuitously walk around in her underwear. Criminally poor Keith David who starts off as a solid action man at first becomes a rampaging alien takeover yet another case of the black guy getting it in a film of this kind. On the other hand Yaphet Kotto is wasted given only a few scenes and minimal dialogue. I will be fair and say that the supporting actors and actresses are all fine though.The atmosphere of this film is close to that of THE XFILES and the television series and this film do share a lot in common from the malefemale partnership right down to the tagline. Although it could have been potentially interesting THE PUPPET MASTERS is spoilt by pedestrian workmanlike direction from Stuart Orme which gives it a kind of television movie ambiance. It's a shame as I usually really enjoy films of this sort...sadly it's just a case of a cheap '90s cashin on some classic movies.".

Only rarely do you encounter ones that fall somewhere in between but Puppet Masters fits that bill.  It is not a great movie.  But neither is it awful.  I have certainly seen many many sci fi flicks that were much much worse.     While its based on a different book this is basically the third and least effective version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  And it does a reasonable enough job of building suspense that its strong source material can carry it along.  Its not as goodscary as the original Body Snatchers nor even as goodscary as the remake but its still pretty decent sci fi. Heck it even gets a rare decent performance out of Donald Sutherland who for once does not appear to be mailing it in.  The movie is marred by a weak ending but if you're a sci fi fan its not a bad little time waster.".

What was funny or topical at that time might well go over our heads today. The plot isn't gripping but it will keep you amused and the film really buzzes in places. Astaire dances to his usual excellent standard with some unusual and snappy routines but for the first time he really has to compete for the stage with his partner. Miss Hutton not only keeps up with Astaire she actually manages to upstage the 'Master' in the dance routines. You'll have to watch the film four or five times before you start to look at Astaire when they dance together. Betty Hutton is totally magnetic you can't stop watching her for a moment. Although she may not have quite the technical abilities of some of Astaire's previous partners she more than makes up for that with her enthusiasm and dynamic personality. It's like tossing a grenade into a vat of champagne  an explosion of sparkle and fizz. And make no mistake about it...That gal can dance! Well worth seeing.".

It starts out with a bang and rides along on a fun and energetic high for the first 23 of the film. Then the storyline of Hutton trying to retain custody of her child starts to drag on too long. As if to make up for the slow last third of the movie the director then tacks on a short and overly simplistic ending as if he wasn't sure how to get out of the film. Even with these problems though I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun this was. Hutton had tremendous energy as a comedienne and singer and she sparkles through most of the film. Astaire also seems to be having a great time and shows a zany side that's quite delightful. There are several good musical numbers and two mustsee dance pieces. In the first Fred dances around under on top of and inside a piano and he also gets to show off his lesserknown but fairly impressive skills as a pianist. This number has to rank among his alltime most enjoyable. The second great number has Fred and Hutton dressed as cowboys in a saloon and it's a hilarious and wonderful routine. I cringed a bit when I read that Astaire was doing a cowboy number but he's just as great in boots and blue jeans and he was in top hat white tie and tails. There's some very good comedy writing in the film and the secondary actors all do a fine job. Despite its slow and repetitive last section Let's Dance is definitely worth watching. And some of the dance numbers deserve repeated viewing. An unexpectedly fun and funny film.".

She was 30 years old and Astaire was 51. I suspect the age difference was the problem he really was old enough to be her father. The plot is a little too simplistic and there aren't many surprises. Betty is more interested in keeping her child from the hands of a vindictive motherinlaw than in her romance with stock brokerentertainer Astaire. What is great in the film is Betty Hutton's performance. She is hilarious energetic and in super form dancing and singing. She did it between Annie Get Your Gun and The Greatest Show on Earth.

	schema:headline " Not too bad not too good and it's definitely Betty Hutton's movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's Dance is a Betty Hutton movie. Fred Astaire may have equal billing but Hutton dominates the picture. Her mixture of tomboy boisterousness and unrelenting brashness makes the casual and easygoing Astaire seem as relevant as Percy Kilbride trying to catch up with Marjorie Main. During the Forties audiences loved Betty Hutton. She was hugely insecure which probably accounted for her need to give 150 per cent when 90 per cent would have served her better. With Let's Dance It's almost startling to see how Fred Astaire has difficulty establishing his presence against Hutton's unremitting energy. It doesn't help that the songs written by Frank Loesser are tailored more to Hutton's strengths than they are to Astaire's. None of the songs are noteworthy and they often blend heavy rhythmic repetition loudness and jitterbug style with ample opportunity for Hutton to mug and exaggerate. Even the one romantic song Why Fight the Feeling is given to Hutton first to deliver as a comic vamp. Loesser had written for Hutton before and he knew her strengths. The story is about Kitty McNeil Betty Hutton an entertainer for the troops who marries a rich socialite Army pilot in London in 1945. He dies shortly after shot down but not before Leaving Kitty with child. Fast forward five years later when Kitty and her son are living with the boy's very rich great grandmother. The woman snobbish and high in society believes Kitty is unsuitable as a mother to the boy. But Kitty escapes the mansion with her son and after a few tribulations gets a job as a cigarette girl in a nightclub. But guess what? Her partner during the war years had been Don Elwood Fred Astaire. They had sort of loved each other. They met by accident in a cheap diner after Kitty had kidnapped her son. It was Don who helped her get the job in the nightclub where Don did some dancing while he tried to establish himself as a financial whiz. The story goes on and on. For Kitty she must fight off her son's great grandmother and the woman's lawyers. She has Don to help her. Of course all the people in the nightclub from the owner to the cooks to the dancers fall for the little boy and try to help Kitty too. All the while she and Don are edgily moving closer...a kind of boy and girl love each other boy loses girl then repeat three times. Finally boy gets girl along with a fiveyearold stepson. But this is an Astaire movie sort of so what of the singing and dancing? I Can't Stop Talking About Him is the opening number sung and danced before the troops in 1945 by Kitty and Don. Kitty is in a bright pink dress Don in drab Army brown. Your eyes tend to focus on Hutton and the dress. Hutton sings the song and she and Astaire dance. It's all in the Hutton style loud. Astaire dances a rehearsal number with two pianos clambering over and under them and playing some piano himself. Jack and the Beanstalk is a hip version of the old fairy tale which Astaire sings to Kitty's little boy. It's not that bad and Astaire gets to make a long bean stalk out of a newspaper while singing it but it's little more than specialty material. Oh Them Dudes is a raucous cowboy song and dance with Hutton and Astaire gussied up like oldtime mustachioed cowboys. Astaire did this kind of thing better with Judy Garland in Easter Parade's Couple of Swells and would do it better again with Jane Powell in Royal Wedding's How Could You Believe Me.... Why Fight the Feeling Astaire has said was a song he liked a lot. In Let's Dance it just doesn't get a chance to establish itself. The movie's finale Tunnel of Love is another loud production number tailored much more to Hutton than Astaire. They sing and they dance but Hutton is mugging all the way. Let's Dance features some pleasant comic turns by Roland Young and Melville Cooper as well as solid character actors such as Ruth Warrick Shepperd Strudwick Barton MacLane and George Zucco.".

Kitty is in a bright pink dress Don in drab Army brown. Your eyes tend to focus on Hutton and the dress. Hutton sings the song and she and Astaire dance. It's all in the Hutton style loud. Astaire dances a rehearsal number with two pianos clambering over and under them and playing some piano himself. Jack and the Beanstalk is a hip version of the old fairy tale which Astaire sings to Kitty's little boy. It's not that bad and Astaire gets to make a long bean stalk out of a newspaper while singing it but it's little more than specialty material. Oh Them Dudes is a raucous cowboy song and dance with Hutton and Astaire gussied up like oldtime mustachioed cowboys. Astaire did this kind of thing better with Judy Garland in Easter Parade's Couple of Swells and would do it better again with Jane Powell in Royal Wedding's How Could You Believe Me.... Why Fight the Feeling Astaire has said was a song he liked a lot. In Let's Dance it just doesn't get a chance to establish itself. The movie's finale Tunnel of Love is another loud production number tailored much more to Hutton than Astaire. They sing and they dance but Hutton is mugging all the way. Let's Dance features some pleasant comic turns by Roland Young and Melville Cooper as well as solid character actors such as Ruth Warrick Shepperd Strudwick Barton MacLane and George Zucco.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film was hurried into production to take advantage of Fred Astaire's availability part of the agreement MGM signed with Paramount in order to get Betty Hutton on loan to do Annie Get Your Gun at Metro. It is such standard fare that it pales when one thinks of Hutton's great triumph earlier in the year with Annie. She and Fred Astaire were poorly matched given his sophistication and her frenetic singing and dancing. If only the musical comedy had some decent songs it could have gotten by on those alone. Unfortunately there are few songs and they are mostly unforgettable save Astair's dance routine on over and under a grand piano and with a hat rack. There is a comedy song and dance number Them Thar Dudes in which the two stars dress up as a couple of western dudes  both with fake mustaches  and sing and dance a fun and funny number. However Astaire looks positively pained having to slum as low as this while Hutton steals the song because it is up her alley. There is an embarrassing number for Hutton when she starts singing a love song while her dress  in the rear  gets overheated. This film shows how brilliant Hutton was when she was given good material. The most accessible direct and embracing singing voice of her time Betty Hutton always surpassed her material when singing but as with this film was given to slapstick and overacting when clearly a director did not have control over her. Such is the fate of this film. The film is engaging because it has at its core the old mother running with her child from the evil relatives while the Knight is on his way and may or may not make it in time plot. Because of the material Hutton comes off as Hutton while Astaire suffers badly saved the minute he begins to tap his feet or open his mouth to sing. Two legends in a mediocre film make it a must see if you are a fan of either or both of the legends.".

The rambunctious Betty tries to bring it down a notch but she would have better luck working with Paramount's stable of leading men rather than Fred loaned here from MGM. Betty scored huge the same year in MGM's Annie Get Your Gun opposite Howard Keel but Fred seemed out of step with her large talents even though his talents were pretty huge as well just in a different way.Certainly Fred had some partners in his time who seemed to be a contrast to his white tie and tails but in the case of Ginger Rogers their differences complimented each other rather than show how different they were and Rita Hayworth his most magnetic partner could heat up Frosty the Snowman. Betty dominates the storyline here as a widow with a young son who goes against her late husband's grandmother an imperious Lucille Watson determined to raise her great grandson in her home with or without Betty present. The future Phoebe Tyler Wallingford Ruth Warrick plays Betty's likable sisterinlaw who dares to stand up to her grandmother but her character lacks the punch of her future legendary All My Children matriarch who was ironically pretty much like Watson is here.Musically this isn't one of Fred's best and his big number with Betty Them Dudes Were Doing Our Dance is embarrassingly corny. They do better with the carnival finale The Tunnel of Love which is interrupted by dialog wrapping up the plot. Betty has a great opening number showing off her loud mouth Can't Stop Talking' 'Bout Him showing how her voice can be threatened to be heard over a bomb signal. She also has a sweet love song and Fred gets one of his typical propdriven dance numbers to the tune of Hold That Tiger.There are some great comic moments such as Betty's two attempts to get her son out of Watson's mansion one during which she has the poor kid in a pillow case then is forced to chase the cab all the way to the theater where she is performing. Astaire's character is combination dancer and legal counsel an odd combination of professions and isn't as well developed as Betty's. Any of Paramount's second string leading men could have played this role but then you wouldn't have the dance numbers Fred does do.".

And the plot of the story revolves around Astaire trying to make it a romantic partnership as well.In fact he announces to the audience at a USO show during World War II that he'd like to marry his partner. Small problem though Hutton tells Astaire in the dressing room. She's already slightly married some months earlier in a whirlwind romance. The act gets broken up as well.Flash forward to five years later. Hutton is a war widow raising her young son Gregory Moffett in some affluent Boston surroundings presided over by her husband's mother Lucile Watson. Watson is a wealthy WASP dowager who's just about gotten used to the fact that her son married an entertainer but she insists that her grand kid be raised as a proper Bostonian. Not for Betty who's bored stiff with polite society. She takes off with Moffett.In New York she hooks up again with Fred but it's romantic rocky road with a couple of detours for Fred it's Ruth Warrick and for Betty Sheppard Strudwick.I don't think that there was any surprise that there was no demand for the return of the team of Astaire and Hutton. They perform their numbers well although I agree with other reviewers that the film is tilted for Betty from the gitgo. The fact that this was her home studio of Paramount no doubt helped there. I do agree that composer Frank Loesser having dealt with Betty before wrote for her. He had already given her I Wish I Didn't Love You So from The Perils of Pauline. Loesser himself was getting his songwriting career into high gear. He had just had a big Broadway smash in Where's Charley and would the following year have his biggest hit of all with Guys and Dolls.Nothing here was nominated for an Academy Award. Can't Stop Talking About Him is Betty's best number definitely in her style. Fred looks a little silly trying to keep up with her. He's shown to best advantage in the piano dance dancing on a Steinway and in a hoedown western style dance number with Betty in Them Dudes Were Doing Our Dance.Some interesting casting here. Two guys who usually were villains in films play good guys with Barton MacLane as the gruff but kindly club owner where Astaire and Hutton are playing and George Zucco as the judge before whom the custody battle is fought. Lucile Watson is her usual imperious self and has a crack legal team at her disposal with Roland Young and Melville Cooper.Let's Dance was a good film for Betty Hutton. It didn't do too much for Fred Astaire however.".

However Frank Loesser did compose 6 new songs for either Betty or Fred to sing andor dance to. An additional song was composed by others for Fred to dance to.During the opening London air raid siren scene the Blond Bombshell explodes with Can't Stop Talking About Him. Fred chimes in later with song and dance although clearly it was composed with Betty in mind. Quite an energetic and fun routine! They have 2 other musical numbers together. In the middle they perform the comical Oh Them Dudes impersonating a couple of western gunslinger caricatures shooting up the saloon. In general style it much reminds of the skit in Easter Parade A Couple of Swells in which Fred and Judy clown around dressed as a pair of hobos. Their final musical number together occurs in the finale when they are riding in a gondola singing and later dancing to Tunnel of Love when they are considering an imminent marriage. Betty has a solo song Why Fight the FeelingHelp! My dress is burning! Fred has 3 solo songs or dances. In the Piano Dance he dances around on and in a piano as well as some chairs disturbing some cats hiding in the piano. He sings and cavorts around the bedroom to entertain Betty's son Rickie with Jack and the Beanstalk. Lastly he cavorts around the pool area by himself having visions of Betty and pretending he's dancing with her. In function this reminds me of Gene Kelly's ballet in On the Town in which he is expressing the fear that he has lost his new love. Here the situation is that another man has announced that he and Betty will be married soon. The drama largely relates to the question of whether Betty or her socialite grandmotherinlaw is going to raise Betty's boy Richie the son of her deceased husband who died in war soon after they were married. The grandmother argues that as a single working mom Betty can't properly take care of Richie. This conflict ends up in court where Richie demonstrates he's been learning languages and math even though not attending school. The other question that continues through the film is whether Betty is going to respond to Fred's inquiries of marriage. Twice Fred announces that they will soon be married without consulting Betty to her disapproval. In the finale it's Betty who makes the announcement.A few reviewers claim that Betty and Fred had incompatible acting and singing styles thus were a mismatch as partners in such a musical comedy. In theory this might be so but I didn't detect any major problem in their relating to each other. We had two great talents who largely complemented the talents of the other. As another reviewer mentioned the finale did seem a bit rushed with Fred Betty and grandmother suddenly resolving their differences grandmother relenting on her claim that Betty was an unfit mother because of her poverty and lack of husband.See it in color at YouTube.".

	schema:reviewBody "I take a back seat to no one in my admiration of Fred Astaire and Frank Loesser and on paper the idea of Loesser writing a score for an Astaire movie was irresistible. Alas this has to be the weakest score Loesser ever turned in. He was in the thirties forties and early fifties a staff writer at Paramount and worked on several Betty Hutton movies including the Perils of Pauline whose fine score included one of the great ballads of the twentieth century I Wish I Didn't Love You So. Part if not all of the problem here is the casting matching Astaire with Hutton is like matching cashmere with denim it's never going to work and was in fact a misconceived 'deal' when Judy Garland wasn't up to completing Annie Get Your Gun MGM turned to Paramount who agreed to 'lend' Betty Hutton in return for MGM 'lending' Astaire. Not a lot wrong with that it was done all the time but having secured Astaire's services Paramount squandered them in this pedestrian effort. The optimum costar for the manic Hutton would be a cross between a fire cracker and a Mexican Jumping Bean not the urbane sophisticated Astaire the epitome of Style.

	onyx:emotionText "I take a back seat to no one in my admiration of Fred Astaire and Frank Loesser and on paper the idea of Loesser writing a score for an Astaire movie was irresistible. Alas this has to be the weakest score Loesser ever turned in. He was in the thirties forties and early fifties a staff writer at Paramount and worked on several Betty Hutton movies including the Perils of Pauline whose fine score included one of the great ballads of the twentieth century I Wish I Didn't Love You So. Part if not all of the problem here is the casting matching Astaire with Hutton is like matching cashmere with denim it's never going to work and was in fact a misconceived 'deal' when Judy Garland wasn't up to completing Annie Get Your Gun MGM turned to Paramount who agreed to 'lend' Betty Hutton in return for MGM 'lending' Astaire. Not a lot wrong with that it was done all the time but having secured Astaire's services Paramount squandered them in this pedestrian effort. The optimum costar for the manic Hutton would be a cross between a fire cracker and a Mexican Jumping Bean not the urbane sophisticated Astaire the epitome of Style. Watchable for Astaire but that's the best you can give it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Even a lesser Fred Astaire film is worth watching still and like The Belle of New York and Yolanda and the Thief Let's Dance is one such example of lesser Astaire still being worth a look.Let's Dance falls down the most in the story which is particularly weak in the final third where it really does drag and overcaked in overworked sentiment. The subplot itself is one that is easy to identify with but didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the film and just bogs it down and more interesting could have been done with it. The ending felt incredibly rushed and tacked on like the writers didn't know how to end it and came up with the most convenient ending possible regardless of whether it made sense compared to the rest of the film.Personally also didn't care for the Them Dudes routine the song itself isn't bad but it was in this number where the film betrayed two different performing styles not meshing well with one another Astaire's more graceful approach with Betty Hutton's brasher more comedic one. It's also repetitiously choreographed and while Hutton comes off well the choreography does nothing for Astaire's talents and he doesn't look entirely comfortable doing it.On the other hand as aforementioned Let's Dance is by no means a bad film. It's shot in nice Technicolor and has some beautiful costumes and sets. The score is musical and energetic and the songs while none of them classics are more than pleasant Jack and the Beanstalk and Tunnel of Love have a lot of charm. Choreographically the highlight is the Piano Dance not spectacular but still entertaining and inspired and shows off Astaire's skills more than the rest of the songs. Jack and the Beanstalk comes off very attractively as well.The script is witty allowing for some genuinely amusing moments and wellintended and the twothirds of the film have a decent amount of energy. It's directed reasonably neatly until flagging in the final third and the performances generally come off well though Hutton and Astairewhile hardly disastrous don't match as well as some of Astaire's other partners and there could have been more of Astaire and a little less of Hutton. The supporting turns are solid with some funny comic turns and a splendidly stern Lucille Watson. Astaire is as graceful and charming as ever and Hutton really does look like she's enjoying herself her 'mugging' being nowhere near as painful as it could have been.All in all lesser Astaire but has enough strengths to get a partial recommendation. 610 Bethany Cox".

The plot is all about Betty's character the numbers play to her strengths rather than his. Paramount knew all about how to present Hutton.

A wonderful ballad Why Fight The Feeling is not given enough of a showcase. Could've been a highlight particularly if it had been sung to Betty by Fred with an accompanying dance number. Lastly who thought Hutton and Astaire would make a good team? Not that it was impossible but more cleverness was required in presenting this odd couple. Their hugely different images  brash vs. subtle brassy vs. classy  needed to be addressed. We should have been eased into it given reasons why they belonged together despite their seeming incompatibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first time I sat in a theatre to watch a Twilight movie. I think the theatre experience maybe helped me enjoy the film more than I should have. Nevertheless Breaking Dawn Part II is not only the best entry in the franchise it's also the worst. How can that be? For a good 20 minutes the film tries to be daring and does something different. Yet it is all undone by playing it safe and ruining what came before it. I have to stress that yes this film did NOT have to be broken up into two. The first film was an hour and a half of filler followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness. This entry is an hour and a half of buildup followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness X10 followed by the worst decision the series has ever made to date.I have seen every Twilight movie I'm not a fan nor am I a hater. I'm always objective when it comes to these movies. The highest rating I've given one of them is a 5 that went to Eclipse. Breaking Dawn Part II could have easily gotten a 7 from me had they had the balls to go through with what we were witnessing. A twist so inane that it actually made me boo at the screen. I don't think I've ever booed at any movie in the theatre before so congratulations Breaking Dawn Part II you achieved something. Now that awesomeness that I was speaking of it is indeed awesome. I was cheering I was laughing I was having a blast. The people around me I'm assuming fans were gasping at the carnage they were witnessing. I had a giant smile on my face. Did the creators finally take the series in a bold direction? Did they finally have the balls to do something different? Yes they did but then they ruin it. I can't stress how awful that made me feel.KStew finally has something to do other than swoon over Edward resist the urges from Jacob and act like a whiny teenager. She is a vampire so she has to learn to be one although it seems she has no problem with the thirst and heightened senses. There is no struggle for her which makes this whole aspect a bit shallow. Jacob unfortunately has nothing to do in this entry other than glare at everyone who comes near Renesmee. So the character shifts his focus from one girl to the next nothing more for him to do yawn. Speaking of Renesmee stupid name we have what is probably one of the creepiest babies to ever grace the silver screen. Why they chose to use CGI for the face of the baby other than using a normal one is beyond me. It looks unnatural and comical. The movement doesn't flow and for some reason they decide to keep this CGI face with the kid as she grows older until they finally have the older actress in the role.As with every Twilight film there are moments of unintentional laughter bad acting dialogue and CGI. Michael Sheen seems to be having fun acting like a complete weirdo and the others seem to be happy they are finished with this series. Now to be completely honest this entire saga could have been told in three movies. Twilight for the set up Eclipse for conflict Breaking Dawn for the closure. Eliminate the pointless New Moon and condense these two movies into one. Twilight is finally over. No more sparkling vampires no more team Edwards or team Jacobs and no more shirtless scenes of young men. Good bye Twilight I do not look forward to the inevitable remakes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has finally come...yes the final installment of the gushy billiondollar making series made famous by Stephenie Meyer. Mehtunately a cross between unfortunately and fortunately I have read the books and knew what to expect. Unfortunately I have seen all of the movies with some different opinions. I found Eclipse to be the best even though it is quite mediocre. Twilight was too dull with boring actors New Moon was just a repeat of that except with wolves and Breaking Dawn Part 1 was two hours of three things 1. Bella and Edward getting married 2. Bella and Edward having very unessential foreplay that results in a pregnancy and 3. Bella sitting on a couch moaning and groaning with said pregnancy. I will say I did not have many great expectations for this final installment. But I did see it. It did not raise the bar nor did it lower it. To me it was just another Twilight movie.Bella and Edward are now married. Hooray. They have a newborn halfmortal halfimmortal vampire baby. Hooray. Bella is now a vampire. Hooray. The baby or Renesmee is the driving force of the otherwise tedious plot of this movie. The Volturi is given false reasons to believe that this baby will somehow in its later life kill many people and expose the other world that humans don't know about. The Cullens set out to bring in other vampire clans to defend themselves from the Volturi. The short plot summary that you can find on the front page of IMDb practically summarizes the entire movie After the birth of Renesmee the Cullens gather other vampire clans in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts the family in front of the Volturi. You can basically just use your imagination to fill in the blank spots. That's the whole plot. This isn't a very strong plot to work with and thus gave me a sense of boredom throughout the whole movie except for the end but we'll get to that.The bad...well the usual. The only new bad that I can't seem to get away from is the pacing of this movie. The pacing was terrible. If I were to guess they covered the first 100 pages of the last half of the book within the first five minutes. Each scene felt like it was missing a beginning and an end and the transitions between each scene were nonexistent. Along with that you have the acting which mainly focuses on Kristen Stewart's one facial expression. The rest of the acting is decent and the only good actors have very minor parts. The script needs more to add more dialogue. Within three lines of dialogue they tried to cover as much as they could and when they weren't talking about significant things the dialogue was weak and uninteresting. The special effects now were atrocious. With the two billion dollars that this series has made you would think that the special effects would be somewhat believable. Nope. I'm a very negative person I know and I'm probably going to get hated on but notice that I've given this movie a three star rating. There was one thing in this movie that was worth that which if you think about it is a lot if you are talking about a fulllength movie. The ending. There will be no spoilers but I can only say that the ending was absolutely sensational. They changed it from the book in such a huge way and such a good way that I thought the movie was going to redeem itself in its final halfhour. Obviously it couldn't make up for all that was bad but the ending was absolutely amazing. That's all I can say.Overall fans of the series...I mean single teenage girls will enjoy the final installment. It has the same elements of the other movies that made it so popular so there's nothing to complain about with fans of the series. It's just not my cup of tea but who am I? I'm just one person voicing his opinion.310".

The short plot summary that you can find on the front page of IMDb practically summarizes the entire movie After the birth of Renesmee the Cullens gather other vampire clans in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts the family in front of the Volturi. You can basically just use your imagination to fill in the blank spots. That's the whole plot. This isn't a very strong plot to work with and thus gave me a sense of boredom throughout the whole movie except for the end but we'll get to that.The bad...well the usual. The only new bad that I can't seem to get away from is the pacing of this movie. The pacing was terrible. If I were to guess they covered the first 100 pages of the last half of the book within the first five minutes. Each scene felt like it was missing a beginning and an end and the transitions between each scene were nonexistent. Along with that you have the acting which mainly focuses on Kristen Stewart's one facial expression. The rest of the acting is decent and the only good actors have very minor parts. The script needs more to add more dialogue. Within three lines of dialogue they tried to cover as much as they could and when they weren't talking about significant things the dialogue was weak and uninteresting. The special effects now were atrocious. With the two billion dollars that this series has made you would think that the special effects would be somewhat believable. Nope. I'm a very negative person I know and I'm probably going to get hated on but notice that I've given this movie a three star rating. There was one thing in this movie that was worth that which if you think about it is a lot if you are talking about a fulllength movie. The ending. There will be no spoilers but I can only say that the ending was absolutely sensational. They changed it from the book in such a huge way and such a good way that I thought the movie was going to redeem itself in its final halfhour. Obviously it couldn't make up for all that was bad but the ending was absolutely amazing. That's all I can say.Overall fans of the series...I mean single teenage girls will enjoy the final installment. It has the same elements of the other movies that made it so popular so there's nothing to complain about with fans of the series. It's just not my cup of tea but who am I? I'm just one person voicing his opinion.310";

Not on sets or locations since it's mainly set in the woods. Elegant costumes to be sure but you're not gonna blow 9 digits' worth of bucks on epaulets. The effects are sparse and nothing special. Fersher not on the writing execrable screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg.So it has to have been on the actors. And boy did they ever NOT get their money's worth. The entire film consists of people standing around like statues reading dialog to each other with an occasional flicker of attempted facial expression. Really this is not an exaggeration. 80 of the film is literally people just standing there like an array of departmentstore manikins spouting inane vapid dialog.The entire premise of the film is based on the idea that the Volturi selfappointed overlords of the vampire world will not tolerate a human child being turned into a vampire with some justification based on terrible experiences in the past when the tykes had tantrums and couldn't control their appetites. And now the Volturi mistakenly believe that Bella and Edward's new child the regrettably named Renesmee is one such and they're coming to wreak vengeance on her and the entire Cullen clan having politely given several weeks advance notice. All of this could have been cleared up with a little home video or perhaps a Skype call. Ditto for the Cullens' attempts to round up witnesses to little Nessie's amazing growth spurt newborn to an apparent age 6 in a couple of weeks. Could they just ring up their friends on their cell phones or email them? Nooooooo gotta travel twice around the world to ask them in person. And then they all show up in the Pacific northwoods where they get to stand around like statues like everyone else. When there finally IS a flurry of action the cameras move so rapidly and jerkily that you can't get any sense at all of who's doing what to whom.This is a terrible movie all posing and posturing and protestations of undying love less sincere than a Twinkies commercial.".

There is hardly anything that happens apart from the trademark Edward and Bella moments and a little bit of shirltess Jacob. There is also a poorly done CGI baby which is called Renesmee Edward and Bella's daughter. Just when you contemplate walking out of the cinema hall you get to see something that can be perceived as a successful attempt to placate the disappointed audience. There is a very wellexecuted battle sequence with a clever twist that makes you wonder why such scenes were so sporadic throughout the series. Yes the battle sequence was effective damage control.The performances were mediocre as opposed to the hitherto awful monotony that the cast put up in the past four movies except Pattinson. who still continues to look jaded but you can't really blame him. On the whole for an nonfan this movie would visually punish you for a while and then give you a breather during its last 20 minutes.

Also returning are Billy Burke Ashley Greene Michael Sheen Dakota Fanning Peter Facinelli Jamie Campbell Bower Nikki Reed Kellan Lutz Maggie Grace Jackson Rathbone Christopher Heyerdahl Elizabeth Reaser Booboo Stewart and Julia Jones. Mackenzie Foy appears as Reneesme the daughter of Bella and Edward.The plot of this second part which is definitely NOT a moneymaking scheme by the way guys is that The Volturi vampire police find out about the kid and think it is a vampire so start walking as slowly as they can from Italy to NorthWest America over a couple of months conveniently giving the Cullens plenty of time to build up forces and defences. Bella will then do anything to protect her child from them causing the Ultimate Showdown of Destiny.However that is not true. They could have condensed all five films into an hourlong TV film featured occasionally on the Syfy channel omitting as much as possible. As with previous films nothing much happens with plenty of staring people holding hands kids touching people's faces pale creepy men making weird noises incomprehensible zoomingin on body parts andor inanimate objects and a new addition lots of faces being ripped off. Although there is no blood here to allow as many people as possible to contribute to the obscene amounts of money being made by the 'films.' As per every Twilight film I tried to give this one a chance. No such luck however. Within the first 5 minutes there is everything that makes a Twilight film  subpar emotionless and frankly diabolical acting inane banal and boring dialogue and some horrible visual effects. When the vampires jump they are clearly small poor CGI models and the directing greenscreen shots and general camerawork is poor.

Oh I knew how it would end going in. I've watched and read reviews from sources I trust. There have been countless parodies. Even with no investment whatsoever the ending to this wretched movie is a slap in the face. It broke something inside of me that I never knew was there until it pleaded for aid with its final bit of strength. Literally nothing happens. The entire series was building up to this. This...unholy abomination sports a runtime of 115 minutes most of which is spent building up some wouldbe tension for the central conflict. There will be a showdown between Martin Sheen with his band of LGBT vampires and the Cullens who amass a vampire version of the XMen.

It was just a vision for for the sake of Martin Sheen. None of it actually happened. They decide to part ways amicably which makes every choice every action and every scene up to here entirely pointless. And that's when I realized that it's all pointless isn't it? Whether you live or die whether you're good or bad whether you watch a movie or don't. None of it matters. We are but specks of cosmic dust briefly granted sentience in a universe so vast that our entire planet could fall into the sun and nobody would notice or care.

When Irina Maggie Grace spies close friend and werewolf guardian Jacob Black Taylor Lautner out for a snowy stroll with the rapidly growing Renesmee she assumes the young girl was turned into a vampire as opposed to being born  which in vampire lore represents an unignorable dilemma from permanent immaturity potentially destructive tantrums and general untrustworthiness. Betraying this inaccurate vision to the inflexible Volturi leader Aro Michael Sheen she incites a war between the Cullens and their sympathizers and Aro's army of skillful followers.There's something exhilarating about the Twilight Saga finally coming to a close. The repetitious nature of witnessing Lautner dramatically remove his shirt seeing scantily clad forest people metamorphosing into oversized werewolves that appear entirely too cuddly despite gritted canines and looking at Stewart's blank face trying desperately to emote has equated to a tiresome journey. The numerous problems plaguing the series haven't been solved once again demonstrating the excruciating preposterousness of vampire strength and speed and now more conspicuously the feeding on wild game unconvincing computer graphics isn't this franchise much too lucrative to ignore possibilities outside of Rodeo FX and Hydraulx? and an overabundance of comic relief.The pervasive humor in Breaking Dawn is perhaps the greatest scourge of the production. The first halfhour is so blanketed by oneliner riffs that it's difficult to understand the intent. These constant little jokes don't progress the story and only serve to pollute the tone which gravely requires seriousness to market sense for the wildly fanciful fairytalelike characters. Imprinting the love triangle a very PG13 sex scene Bella armwrestling to prove her fortitude  all of these and more are purely comedic while aspiring to be expectedly essential and further detract from the severity of quenching bloodlust rearing an enigmatic child and engineering an army for an epic closing battle. The casting of Michael Sheen is easily the most garish selection bestowing upon the goofy role expressions dialogue and cackles that garner awkward laughs. Later the elaboration of special powers beyond merely being immortal bloodsuckers the mastery of electricity elemental distortion mind control etc. is presented as pathetically derivative of XMen mutants. The lengths the vampires will go to conceal their vampirism has apparently made it necessary to exploit flashier abilities akin to superheroes. Jacob even comments of Bella's Jedi training. Admittedly it's amusing to see the muchawaited culmination of the Volturi's mercilessness and the Cullen's protective righteousness. The highly anticipated skullripping campaign isn't without unexpected and momentous casualties. An unfortunate twist surrounds this momentary enthusiasm and welcome realization of acerbity and violence however revealing a method of misdirection tantamount to storytelling treason  which will unavoidably displease the casual or uneducated viewer namely those not familiar with the book should they exist in crowds for this release.

	schema:headline " A satisfying conclusion...";
	schema:reviewBody "After the movie's opening credits the use of red black  white combined with the images we see are so artfully donevery beautiful we pick up right where we left off  on new vampire Bella's red eyes. While Part 1 may have been slow to get going for some Part 2 wastes no time getting into the important stuff like Bella learning to control her strengthbloodlust as a newborn. Then there's the rather amusing scene where Jacob breaks the news to her that he imprinted on Renesmee Bella's initial reaction will satisfy those with similar concerns about what 'imprinting' ismeans but she eventually comes around to understanding what it actually means. After we get past the creepy CGI infant version of Renesmee it tries its hardest to look real but still looks freaky we thankfully move onto fine little actress Mackenzie Foy playing the role. Charlie gets brought in on a 'need to know' basis and before too long everyone's in danger when the Volturi are under the impression that Renesmee's an immortal child a big nono thanks to Irina.Kristen Stewart does some of her best work in this film I think. Everything's been leading to her getting to play Bella as a vampire and she's more than up to the task. She looksacts very different including mannerisms  she sells both that and the animal nature Bella's now fighting against. The movie goes to lengths to show what being a newborn is like for her. She  Edward are on more equal footing now gone is the imbalance between them. She also seems happier than she ever was as a human. She's not the only one. Edward smiles I think more than we've ever seen previously. It's such a relief for him that his easily breakable Bella is now strong and confident. Pattinson also gets to have more fun in his role than we've seen in a while. The two are perfectly matched. I was happy the Cullens got a bit more focus. Their charactersfamily dynamic has always been interesting to me. I liked seeing Rosalie's lighter side Emmett challenging Bella to an arm wrestle and Alice playing a major part in the conclusion of the film as well as kicking some major butt  which all Alice fans should be glad to see. All the actors are great. Those who might've seemed unusual choices in the beginning have become their characters and I can't imagine anyone else in their roles.Taylor Lautner finally gets to play Jacob free of his Bella obsession. A great weight has been lifted and now his role is that of protector towards young Renesmee we get a vision of her grownup too which is when they'll eventually become more. Jacob proves how much more likable he is when he's not lusting after Bella and can get along with Edward their dynamic is so good. Charlie the father who you can't help but feel sorry for does what he does best makes you laugh  tugs at your heartstrings thanks in no small part to Billy Burke such perfect casting. Given what he goes throughlearns in this movie Charlie should be up for a Best Dad Ever Award. The Quileutes don't get much to do in human form they kick Volturi arse in wolf form though. The new characters introduced are the different vampire covens. Some are more memorable than others but all get their moments. I especially liked getting to know the Denali Clan more after their brief appearance in Part 1. Tanya  Kate are more developed and we even see the start of a relationship form between Kate and new addition Garrett. The training scene as they all hone their abilities for battle is especially good. The big development is Bella learning of her 'shield' that can block other vampires' abilities.If you don't know about how this film differs in the climactic confrontation scene to that of the book then you're in for a hell of a surprise. If you have heardread about it...then you're still likely to be quite shocked. Those who read the book  were dissatisfied with the lack of any actual fight will be pleased with the mother of all vampire battles we get to see play out here. There are major casualties on both sides. Unexpected or not it's heartpounding stuff. There were more than a few gasps in my theatre. If however you feel an actual fight was unnecessary then rest assured the book has not been drastically altered just to meet the demands for more action. It's not so much a 'change' that's been made but rather just filling in the blanks ie. what was mentioned in the book but never seen. The films have always done this really well. Inevitably things are bound to be left out in all booktofilm adaptations. But the Twilight Saga has always been pretty good at hitting the majority of mainimportant points from each book including dialogue. Not everything you may want may make it in but the films have ensured the essence of the story remains intact.The music throughout as always is exceptional. The movie soundtracks have never failed to fit the films perfectly. They're always the right songs for the right moments. Director Bill Condon shows he was more than up to the task of tackling this tricky twoparter. It looks exquisite. The direction has obviously been made with care and love for the source material and its fans. You need look no further than the film's closing credits which give everyone of all the movies their due even ones not present in this film. The inclusion of actual pages of the book was a nice touch. I'll greatly miss these characters who I've enjoyed seeing brought to life for five films now. For those who appreciated the books the films and the actors involved this should be a satisfying conclusion for you. I know it was for me.".

	onyx:emotionText "After the movie's opening credits the use of red black  white combined with the images we see are so artfully donevery beautiful we pick up right where we left off  on new vampire Bella's red eyes. While Part 1 may have been slow to get going for some Part 2 wastes no time getting into the important stuff like Bella learning to control her strengthbloodlust as a newborn. Then there's the rather amusing scene where Jacob breaks the news to her that he imprinted on Renesmee Bella's initial reaction will satisfy those with similar concerns about what 'imprinting' ismeans but she eventually comes around to understanding what it actually means. After we get past the creepy CGI infant version of Renesmee it tries its hardest to look real but still looks freaky we thankfully move onto fine little actress Mackenzie Foy playing the role. Charlie gets brought in on a 'need to know' basis and before too long everyone's in danger when the Volturi are under the impression that Renesmee's an immortal child a big nono thanks to Irina.Kristen Stewart does some of her best work in this film I think. Everything's been leading to her getting to play Bella as a vampire and she's more than up to the task. She looksacts very different including mannerisms  she sells both that and the animal nature Bella's now fighting against. The movie goes to lengths to show what being a newborn is like for her. She  Edward are on more equal footing now gone is the imbalance between them. She also seems happier than she ever was as a human. She's not the only one. Edward smiles I think more than we've ever seen previously. It's such a relief for him that his easily breakable Bella is now strong and confident. Pattinson also gets to have more fun in his role than we've seen in a while. The two are perfectly matched. I was happy the Cullens got a bit more focus. Their charactersfamily dynamic has always been interesting to me. I liked seeing Rosalie's lighter side Emmett challenging Bella to an arm wrestle and Alice playing a major part in the conclusion of the film as well as kicking some major butt  which all Alice fans should be glad to see.

In the end I decided to eventually give in and pay a ticket price of 5.70. 5.70? for a twilight ticket. OK I'm not gonna get into that but I was expecting good things. So the good points first Taylor Lautner puts in a decent effort. Michael Sheen makes for a good villain. Taylor Lautner is not what I would call one of the current rising stars. He just doesn't have the talent but...having said that he was the only good guy in the movie who was believable. Michael Sheen is very worthy as a good villain. He has an air of insanity yet I can't put any fault on his performance. For example I can't say that it was Over the top or just a screaming role In which case Shia LaBeouf should have been cast for that.Now the negative points Kristen Stewart can't act for her life Dakota Fanning was so unconvincing. Rest of the cast was mediocre CGI and special effects are underwhelming and an absolutely insulting ending.Kristen Stewart spends the vast majority of the film pulling a stupid childish pout and frown which is not what you want to see from a hit film's protagonist. All of her lines are cringe worthy and poorly written. Her career is failing and her film selection Snow White and the Huntsman? what the hell was that? isn't helping her. Dakota Fanning has always annoyed me as an actress. I have nothing against her personally but her Shia La Beouf type role in War of the Worlds just killed it. However Coraline was a revelation on her part and renewed my faith. However she has no stage presence so to speak. Her one line in the film was like something from a family guy cut scene. The rest of the crew were poor and why the hell was baby Renesmee horrible name a CGI baby? It just made this film look even more ridiculous.The whole vampire thing just got ridiculous and the ending? Oh my god the ending....I will not spoil anything but it was so poor. To finish I will never watch this again. Ever. Fans will probably love it because it's the end and they naturally will defend from criticism with their lives. Anyone else will stop watching after about 10 minutes and I don't blame them. Twilight...the hit series...was an absolute bloody waste of time and money.".

Breaking Dawn Part 2 does not bring forth one redeemable quality in my eyes from beginning to end. It starts with our lovable hero and heroin kindling around their new born hybrid baby in what appears to be a cabin generally reserved for families vacationing deep in the Colorado mountains. It pretty much retains this general setting for about 7580 of the movie this is definitely not a good thing. The main problem presented in this movie is whether or not the world can accept their mixed child not kidding. THE ENTIRE MOVIE 2 hours IS SPENT ON THIS....and yet somehow they never seem to move in any real direction. They acquire witnesses for about 35 minutes generally only detailing what their specific power is. Then we spend about 30 minutes on a scene that doesn't happen and everyone walks away peacefully. The special effects and CG were just atrocious. I mean really the baby in the beginning? How they are shown moving quickly I know I know it isn't really but damn...common. Lastly don't even get me started on the script the dialog was abysmal. You named my kid after the lochness monster is an actual line from 2 minutes into the movie. Acting wasn't much better outside of the main 2 characters everyone was bad...real bad. I just don't understand how anything so atrocious so nefarious and so desperate ever got the almost cult status this had received. Makes me really worried about our countries youth..".

	schema:headline " The Twilight Saga  Part 4B";
	schema:reviewBody "With a plot only a Twilightmother could love The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn  Part 2 is unintentionally one of the funniest movies of the year to the point where any sane moviegoer would suspect that most of the scenarios here were played for laughs and parody. OK so if you enjoyed the final novel in Stephenie Meyer's series word on the street is that you'll enjoy this installment the best. This might have something to do with Bill Condon being the first director to fully embrace the campiness of a world predicated on werewolf pedophilia and unprotected vampire sex and also creating the most visually off the wall adaptation yet with no regard to the viewing audience. But for every nonTwihard out there The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 2 will stand as one of the worst films of the year in a series that has only gotten progressively worse.Why this is clearly the worst film of the series The film begins with Kristen Stewart doing her best mountain lion impression as she crawls along the forest floor hunting a deer and only goes downhill from there. I'm not going to bore you with what you already know a la this film contains a wealth of bad acting from the likes of Stewart who should never work again Taylor Lautner who probably will never work again and Rob Pattinson who throughout this movie couldn't look more ready to be done with the series although Michael Sheen does give an eccentrically interesting performance as Aro. What I will be addressing here is the cornucopia of other problems which make this film almost unwatchable. Just a heads up some of my points will contain plot spoilers so skip to the Final Thought if you are still planning on watching this film.1.This movie contains some of the worst special effects of any big budget film yes including The Green Lantern in the past decade. I won't bother to touch on every terrible CGI fiasco which occurs here the vampires running effects the vampires leaping tall buildings in a single bound effects or the laugh out loud tearing of people heads off effects for fear of ramblingon more than I already am. But that doesn't stop me from asking the one question that is on everyone's minds. What's up with that baby's face?! When Renesmee is an infant while it is obvious that a real baby is used for some reason her face is completely computer generated with halfassed CGI at that. The baby's face is so obviously fake extremely creepy and immensely distraction that it is sure to haunt your dreams long after you've left the theater. 2.There is pretty much one human in the entire film and he is an idiot! The human I mention is Charlie Swan Bella's father. The issue with him in this film is not necessarily the character himself but the sloppiness in which he is almost written out of the story. When we first see him he is obviously concerned for his daughter since he doesn't know if she is dead or alive. When he finally sees that she is all better with what looks to be a one year old infant in her arms he seems to be brimming with questions. But when he demands answers from Bella and she dismisses him this would make more sense if you saw it Charlie does what any worried father would do he accepts the fact that she can't tell him anything and leaves her with the vampire family. 3.From a bland joke about the Loch Ness Monster to all of the laughable monologues the script contains some of the worst dialogue outside of an ABC Family show. And must mention that about 50 of this movie consists of dull voiceover narrations from Stewart and Pattinson attempting to either explain backstory introduce new characters which there are many or simply explain what is going on in the scene.4.The ending is a copout. Now I don't want to give too much away for the few who still want to watch this but there is a final battle sequence that occurs FINALLY!!! which in turn is the best part of the movie. And is absolutely ruined by a twist ending which comes off as nothing more than a convention to soothe any crying teenagers not ready to witness a violent movie about dreamy vampires.5.One word PEDOPHILE. Imprinting is a huge aspect in the novels. If you don't know what that is it's an involuntary mechanism by which werewolves become unconditionally bound to somebody i.e. a soul mate for the rest of their lives. Thank you Twilight Wiki page! The problem here is that throughout past films in the series imprinting has been equated to not so much finding a soul mate or becoming someone's protector but more so finding a mate or lover. So when Jacob Lautner imprints on Renesmee with implications that he is in love with a child visually it comes off as gross and super creepy at the very least. Truthfully at any moment I was expecting Jacob to yell You can't leave Bella! I'm in love with your baby! Written by Markus Robinson Edited by Nicole I. AshlandFollow me on Twitter moviesmarkus".

Sure they're terrible terrible films and books I assume the popularity of which paints a sorry picture of the tastes of today's youth but now that all is said and done on reflection it was worth enduring the first three insufferable disasters Twilight New Moon and Eclipse to get to the unbridled mayhem of Breaking Dawn my thoughts on part one can be found here.After seeing part one it was difficult to see where the story had left to go. We had seen the unending wedding of Edward and Bella the banal South American honeymoon the shocking and genuinely upsetting pregnancybirth and the werewolf falling in love with the baby. It seemed like an appropriate place to end it but Summit and Stephenie Meyer obviously had other ideas hence we have Breaking Dawn part 2.While perhaps not as offtheleash nutty Breaking Dawn part 2 maintains a lot of the weirdness of the preceding chapter. Picking up exactly at the point where part one ended Bella Kristen Stewart finds herself having to adjust to her 'newborn' vampire status learning to control her superhuman strength and fighting the urge to hunt humans. Edward Robert Pattinson begins to assume a mentor role but for whatever reason Bella learns so quickly that the learning plot is pretty much dropped.Here's the first and biggest of the many problems of Breaking Dawn part 2. For at least the first two thirds of the film plot threads and characters are introduced with enough fanfare to make one think they're going to be important cogs in the larger machinery of the story only to be forgotten or abandoned with zero explanation. Perhaps it's fan service and people familiar with the novels will be able to link things up but for newcomers it becomes increasingly hard to keep track of who everyone is why they're involved and what on earth is happening from one scene to the next.The character of Alistair Joe Anderson is a good example. Following the development that the Volturi the ruling council of vampires last seen in New Moon are coming after Edward and Bella's daughter Renesmee the Cullen clan assemble a team of vampires from across the globe to defend the child the last of which is the enigmatic Alistair. Yet after an introduction to suggest he will be a character of some importance he merely ends up lurking in the background and popping into one random and pointless scene with Bella. He's always there but doesn't actually do anything significant.It's this scattered and overloaded approach that really damages an already abysmal film. On top of the lack of charisma in the stars the questionable storytelling is a real hindrance for anyone set on enjoying Breaking Dawn part 2 at all not to mention how simply ugly the thing is. There's an overreliance on terrible greenscreen work shoddy visual effects and whatever lunatic decided that an almost completely CG Renesmee was a good idea needs to be removed from the business of movie making.However much like the last film a part of me loved Breaking Dawn part 2. As I said it may not seem as insane as part one but in some ways that's a good thing. I loved part one because I was caught completely off guard by the madness but was appalled by it because much of the content really shouldn't be part of a film made for preteen girls. Part two dials back the more troubling aspects of the previous film and just revels in the stupidity of Meyer's writing. It's weird as hell but really pretty harmless aside from all the decapitation. Oh boy there's a lot of decapitation.Director Bill Condon and his cast seem to be having a lot more fun here. The most ridiculous thing about the first three films in the series is how unwaveringly serious they are but with both parts of Breaking Dawn it feels like Condon and Pattinson in particular are winking at that portion of the audience who like myself are simply there to see how off the reservation this daft franchise can go. It manages to achieve a delicate and kind of wonderful balance of satisfying the true fans the Twihards with its creepy romantic melodrama while clearly acknowledging the bizarre and quite frankly awful story Meyer has crafted. The awareness of this final chapter is perhaps its greatest asset and if you're willing to abandon all logic and actual critical appreciation then Breaking Dawn part 2 delivers a great time at the cinema.tinribs27.wordpress.com".

The books were very well written and enjoyable for any age. Then the first movie came out. I agree with anyone who complains about Kristen Stewart's acting. She IS terrible. She acts like she is trying to force everything out of her mouth. The acting from everyone in the first couple of movies was pretty blah. Come Eclipse and Breaking Dawn 1 things were getting better with the exception of Kristen.I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I had been told that they had pretty much rewritten 13 of the book but as is tradition for me I had my ticket for the 10pm showing on 1115. I was in love with the movie. Even Kristen Stewart had improved with her looks and acting. She still wasn't great with her acting but it was better than before.The casting was great. However the character of Alistair wasn't how the book portrayed him and that was disappointing. Lee Pace as Garrett is by far my favorite casting. Talk about Hort!!! McKenzie Foy playing Renesmee was so great. She is a beautiful talented little girl and has a very bright future ahead of her.Now I will admit I was ready to walk out of the movie when the fight scene started. The moment Carlisle was killed I wanted to run. I couldn't believe that they had changed the book that much. That was going overboard. In the back of my mind though I had a feeling that it was all a ruse.The director sure did a fantastic job sending the saga out with a bang. I have already seen it twice and can't wait to see it again and again and again.".

As a fan of the twilight movies having watched the first one more than once I can say with certainty that this one was the worst one. Surelly the movies decreased of quality and interest as they go with the New Moon being not as good as Twilight and Eclipse even less so the two parts of Breaking Dawn were difficult to watch. I don't know if it was the story itself that lucked of interest or the many other things that made it impossible to like but the very last one was a big disappointment considering how strongly the saga started. For the Breaking Dawn part two now. The visual and special effects were way out of normal. They looked like they were made by someone twenty years ago who didn't know how to use them. I mean the movies today can use the special effects so perfectly that they can look so real. But for Breaking Dawn they just didn't work. For me the baby was the worse one as it was creepy and looked very unreal. The make up wasn't that good also. The vampires looked uncomfortable and more like zombies than the undead. The performances were really horrible as well with the actors looking like they didn't really want to be there. Of course the script didn't help them as the story drag on and on and some parts of it were simply unnecessary. And finally the battle scene. To be honest when the first vampires started to die I've got really excited as that would have been something very original and interesting. But the twist just took all that away. And so the last twilight movie ended up a poor finish with many clichs a wick plot a horrifying baby and non chemistry actors. And that's why I'm giving it a 1 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "...but it was just too much.The movies in this franchise just got worse and worse. Probably because the books did as well. I have some serious issues with the twilight books including but not limited to the message that it sends to teenagers. Mrs. Meyer has written a book that makes young people think that physical and emotional abuse obsessive behavior and manipulation are acceptable parts of a relationship romantic or not and the majority of her readers adore her for it. How this became one of the most successful bookseries is beyond me.Now the film...The plot is flawed and told very poorly. The writers of this script dropped the ball big time. I know they tried to be faithful to the book but it was painfully boring and contrived. Ugh the dialog is awful.Kristen Stewart's acting is bland and emotionless at no point is she believable as a mother. She reminds me of how I feel when babysitting a child for the first time. The relationship between Bella and Renesmee is awkward at best. The casting of Renesmee could have been better. I liked how she looked but felt she was too old. In the books she's supposed to be aprox. as tall as a three year old and Mackenzie Foy reaching to Stewart's shoulder just made the whole thing even more unbelievable. Robert Pattinson seems to know he's in a crap movie saying crap lines but embraces it. Like Michael Sheen he doesn't take his character too seriously and I like them for that. Taylor Lautner proved again that he's mainly there to run around without a shirt. The other actors didn't have much to work with and looked bored at times. They mostly just stood there looking pretty.I had hoped that the film would at least look good and have some decent CGI but even that was too much to ask for. They have had 3 films to practice with the wolves and still they couldn't do it right. The vampire speed thing looked weird and that baby was just creepy.The only thing they did right in my opinion was the massive fight scene. I was pleased that they took a risk and then disappointed when it turned out to be a vision. Seriously? Wat a copout.I give one star for Pattinson and Sheen who made me grin and one for the fight scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that I would claim these movies to be in the best of cinema category if they just changed the genre from drama romance horror to comedy. That's seriously all they need to do because the awful dialog is back the horrendous story and the terrible characters are back. You know the funny thing is the story actually has some extreme potential to be a great horror story with some in depth drama and dimensional characters with a powerful conflict. A vampire has sex with a human impregnating her with a child that will most likely kill her but she doesn't want to give the baby up so easily. But this is Twilight where Bella Swan likes to play boys back and forth like a pin pon ball and the boys are chumps.The newlyweds Bella Swan and Edward Cullen are finally together forever as they are wisked away to a private island where they make love for the first time but everything is cut short when a series of betrayals and misfortunes threatens to destroy their world. Bella soon discovers she is pregnant and during a nearly fatal childbirth Edward finally fulfills her wish to become immortal. But the arrival of their remarkable daughter Renesmee sets in motion a perilous chain of events that pits the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi the fearsome council of vampire leaders setting the stage for an allout battle. In the end of the movie Bella with her baby cut out of her and injected with vampire venom finally wakes up from a coma. But will she turn into a vampire in time to raise a cute little CGI vampire baby? You'll have to wait another year to find out.I swear on my life Bella Swan would have made a great Shakespeare villain somewhere. This is the most selfish manipulative self righteous little you know the B word that I cannot say on IMDb ever in the history of books or cinema. She finally gets her wish she's married Edward with the same enthused look that she always has with that dumb open mouth grin with bunny teeth and yet she's STILL flirting around with Jacob sometimes in front of her husband! She's made every bad decision known to man yet she still continues the same path where she wants to remain human for a few more nights because she doesn't want to hurt on her honeymoon umm you've been begging to be a vampire and picking at Edward every chance you get and when told that he could kill you she's like yeah it's cool. He hurts her with bruises and she's like the abused wife no it's OK I know he loves me. Then she gets pregnant and everyone is begging her to get rid of the baby as it will kill her she says with the same dumb grin and expression of monotone voice it's a miracle. Oh my God how this is supposed to be the woman that these two guys are fighting over? She's so boring so awful not pretty doesn't have any special talent what is wrong with this world that they think she is worth fighting for?! All these immortals are risking their lives for this girl who is the blandest character you've ever seen.Jacob comes into Edward's home disrespects him and cuddles up to Bella and Edward is cool with it almost encourages it. Taylor Lautner I give him a little credit because during this one sick scene where Bella says she'd name the baby if it was a boy Edward Jacob and he has a look of disgust that I had too. Finally someone almost stood up to Bella! I'm not crazy! They use full songs during the movie that are so random and out of place that it felt so awkward. The story is 30 minutes long into a 2 hour movie that isn't interesting and is an unintentional comedy. Billy Burke is the only actor who seems to give any kind of emotion to his role and I think he's just playing it like he's expressing in real life that he's just sick of this franchise. I give the movie credit for making me laugh hysterically I needed a good laugh and Breaking Dawn definitely gave that to me. No matter which director they get this series is doomed and tame. They are milking it for every penny by splitting a book that was written by a 5 year old into a 2 part movie that is drawn out with no suspense or interesting moments. I don't know why womenI'm a woman by the way love this franchise it's insulting and absolutely horrible. I have to cut the comment off but just trust me I could go on about how bad this movie is but we'll sum it up by saying skip it.110".

But the arrival of their remarkable daughter Renesmee sets in motion a perilous chain of events that pits the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi the fearsome council of vampire leaders setting the stage for an allout battle. In the end of the movie Bella with her baby cut out of her and injected with vampire venom finally wakes up from a coma. But will she turn into a vampire in time to raise a cute little CGI vampire baby? You'll have to wait another year to find out.I swear on my life Bella Swan would have made a great Shakespeare villain somewhere. This is the most selfish manipulative self righteous little you know the B word that I cannot say on IMDb ever in the history of books or cinema. She finally gets her wish she's married Edward with the same enthused look that she always has with that dumb open mouth grin with bunny teeth and yet she's STILL flirting around with Jacob sometimes in front of her husband! She's made every bad decision known to man yet she still continues the same path where she wants to remain human for a few more nights because she doesn't want to hurt on her honeymoon umm you've been begging to be a vampire and picking at Edward every chance you get and when told that he could kill you she's like yeah it's cool. He hurts her with bruises and she's like the abused wife no it's OK I know he loves me. Then she gets pregnant and everyone is begging her to get rid of the baby as it will kill her she says with the same dumb grin and expression of monotone voice it's a miracle. Oh my God how this is supposed to be the woman that these two guys are fighting over? She's so boring so awful not pretty doesn't have any special talent what is wrong with this world that they think she is worth fighting for?! All these immortals are risking their lives for this girl who is the blandest character you've ever seen.Jacob comes into Edward's home disrespects him and cuddles up to Bella and Edward is cool with it almost encourages it. Taylor Lautner I give him a little credit because during this one sick scene where Bella says she'd name the baby if it was a boy Edward Jacob and he has a look of disgust that I had too. Finally someone almost stood up to Bella! I'm not crazy! They use full songs during the movie that are so random and out of place that it felt so awkward. The story is 30 minutes long into a 2 hour movie that isn't interesting and is an unintentional comedy. Billy Burke is the only actor who seems to give any kind of emotion to his role and I think he's just playing it like he's expressing in real life that he's just sick of this franchise. I give the movie credit for making me laugh hysterically I needed a good laugh and Breaking Dawn definitely gave that to me. No matter which director they get this series is doomed and tame. They are milking it for every penny by splitting a book that was written by a 5 year old into a 2 part movie that is drawn out with no suspense or interesting moments. I don't know why womenI'm a woman by the way love this franchise it's insulting and absolutely horrible. I have to cut the comment off but just trust me I could go on about how bad this movie is but we'll sum it up by saying skip it.110";

She loved this one. I did not.The problem the biggest problem to me is that it's very very very boring. NOTHING HAPPENS! Let's see we see Jacob take off his shirt in the first two seconds of the movie and then Bella and Edward awkwardly have a wedding with fake smiles on their face. Then she has nightmares possibly to show some form of entertainment throughout this boredom of a movie and then there's the reception. That was the only scene I liked in the movie. At least it provided some humor. Then they go off to Rio... and nothing really happens. Yeah they keep having sex and Bella just keeps wanting more. She calls her dad who is the only likable character at least to me in the whole series and then she finds out she's pregnant with some hell spawn I guess. And vampires and werewolves get ticked off.Then the dumbest moment happens. The wolves talking to each other. I swear it looked like a Saturday morning cartoon because they were so faked CGI and their voices was so Saturday morning cartoonish that Twi hards should be offended! Anyway the movie just drags and drags and I caught myself falling asleep. I held my date's hand and practically made out with it just to keep from falling asleep. I made it through the film. Thank God for that.After the film she really looked at me in hopes that I would love it like she did. I really couldn't lie to her and I hate telling her how much I couldn't stand the film. She explained the whole lore of the Twilight series and I still don't get it. I hate these movies. Unfortunately she is dragging me to part 2. At least I can spend more quality time with her.".

That is the scope of her acting abilities. The character development was good. The plot was good. And there was enough suspense mystery and action to make the movie solid.New Moon introduced the werewolves and Volturi which added new mystery and suspense. But the Volturi were never heard from again.In Eclipse no werewolf makes an appearance until over an hour into the film. And you are already snoring within 40 minutes.Finally Breaking Dawn. In the first hour we see a wedding and honeymoon full of pathetic dialog weak acting and ZERO imagination. It was slower than a Lifetime production with less romance mystery intrigue suspense and action. Stewart's character states it was the best night of her life yet still not even a smile. She would be fantastic if casted as a corpse.After watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes the CG werewolves look like they were rendered in 1991. They look to be about 1200 pounds. They snarl and human voices are heard... but their bark is worst than their bite as no one dies or even gets injured. There movements and interaction with their environment look extremely fake.The final 10 seconds of the film hold the only suspense or intrigue in the entire movie. These greedy bastards just want teens to pay for two movies when they could have rolled it into one. They could have started the movie with I Do shown a quick scene of Bella getting knocked up and getting morning sickness then the 15 minute finale. This movie was simply a 20 minute prelude to Part Two stretched into 2 hours.Get your neighbor to rent it borrow it for 30 minutes and watch the last 15 minutes and you are ready for Part Two.".

It was a tough decision because that would imply that there's some sort of plot line that I may ruin inadvertently... rest assured there isn't. I mean we knew Bella and Edward were getting married and the previews showed there may be a baby in the works and well there you have it. But after sitting through this.... thing....for two hours I thought that I simply MUST write a review. I haven't felt this motivated and energized to write a review in ages! I simply had to start typing as soon as I got home! My goal to stop just one person from seeing this film. If I do I will have done my good deed on this earth and my work on this planet would be done. I know it's such a minor thing but hey it's the little things that count.The movie starts by a few excusable facial closeups as we see one actor after the next sigh or smile or look wistfully or longingly here and there while the camera lingers on them 30 seconds too long sometimes with a sarcastic smile which says I'm really sad inside but I'm putting on a brave face for you or a mirthless smile that says I'm thinking about a grilled cheese sandwich right now but I'll just smile and look past you to give the impression that I'm really deeply moved by what you're saying. Now and then the REALLY good actors get to throw in a little knowing crooked half smile to add some REAL gravity to the scene! I could only imagine what deep ironic thoughts they must have been projecting but alas it's one of those things that if you have to ask you're just not cool enough to know. Well! Just when you think you've seen every possible mellow dramatic look and cheesy music combo possible... the director decides to do it again and again and again and again and again and again and just when you thought it couldn't possibly happen again it does! And then again and again and again .... Oh and once in a while the director gets in his helicopter and does a senseless nature flyover scene just to break things up a little and to get a way from the set.Since I had lots of time during the film to contemplate life the universe and everything while I listened to the cheesiest musical scores to ever accompany a film while actors sulked and stomped and pouted glared and tried to outoveract each other I wondered why would this director resort to this inanity? It then hit me! The entire plot could easily be filmed in 30 minutes and he had a whole hour and a bit to fill! I then empathized with the director as I imagined his moment of panic... it must have been a spot of genius when he realized he could fill the rest of the film with meaningless nature shot after nature shot and the abovementioned let's throw in another drawn out look scenes. At various points in the film I drifted and started to fantasize that sudden weird things would happen to change up the deadening tempo to spice up the film like Bella would trip over her wedding gown or Edward and Jacob would profess their love for each other and leave Bella to quiver lip herself into oblivion on her own while nobody cared but sadly nothing like this happened to save the day. There was one saving grace I must say. Even though the theatre was filled with teenage girls about halfway through the film one then another then another started to laugh out loud! Pretty soon those of us who weren't comatose or braindead joined in. It was something akin to a Christmas miracle! It was just like it happened in Whoville when everyone started to sing together! We the brave and the few in our darkest hour we came together in laughter and through our laughter whispered to one another it's OK we're in this together we can make it! And we did. When you get to the very end of the film there's this nailbiter to end all nailbiters.... you'll go through five to ten minutes of nail biting dramatic mastery there's changing camera angles and zoom ins and zoom outs and music and really really bad effects ... all inching towards the final finale and the answer you must know will she live or is she dead? Don't worry I won't spoil it the real spoiler is this when you get there you just... won't... care!

She gets pregnant which shouldn't be able to happen and some potentially evil demon baby is sucking the life from her. The films biggest crime is that nothing happens for so long. This series has had a tendency to drag on and on. With New Moon seeming totally unnecessary. What happens here is that we get one book split into two films. This film has about 30 minutes of material in it. Characters have the same conversations they've had a thousand times before with nobody evolving. Bella and Edward feel the same way they've always felt as does Jacob. The sex scene is embarrassingly juvenile with a quick cut to something from a parody. The film doesn't let up in the absurdity department as some animated wolves have a conversation with each other but with mindless growling and dialog it sounds terrible. What any other film would have shortened into a montage is played out to a variety of banal songs that all sound the same. Finally we get towards the end and the graphic grotesque birth scene is barely shown at all. It leaves us with a finale in which a wolf imprints himself onto a newborn baby in a scene more disturbing than anything The Human Centipede could muster. If you like characters that whine about everything actors that have no emotional range and watching slideshows of other people's honeymoons then you may enjoy this laughable effort.".

	schema:headline " Breaking dawn beds and bones...";
	schema:reviewBody "Bill Condon has achieved the seemingly impossible task of filming that which had been deemed 'unfilmable'. The book ending for Eclipse with Jacob running away after receiving the invite to Bella  Edward's wedding which was left out of the Eclipse film is where we begin this movie. Breaking Dawn Part 1 thankfully takes its time with most of the important moments from the book. The preparation for the wedding the wedding itself most intricate back of a wedding dress EVER the honeymoon complete with legshaving! and everything involving the pregnancy  these sections of the film are the most focused upon. That said there are some things left out that may upset some fans. Jacob's section of the book? Condensed. Considerably. Hope you weren't expecting to see the stuff involving him going off to look for somebody to imprint on. It's not here. Sadly one of the parts I liked most about the book the stuff with Jacob Seth  Leah has been vastly shortened. But at least the major points are there. Maybe we could of got more of them instead of that rather pointless fight scene between the Cullens and the wolves? Regarding the sex scene and birthing scene which everyone wants to know about Well Bella  Edward having bedbreakingly good sex is included but you can sort of tell there have been cuts. The birthing scene fares a bit better. There is more blood in this scene and a nightmare Bella has early in the film than the whole of the three previous movies combined. I can see how this would have been trimmed down also but I think they really did include as much as they possibly could given the rating here's hoping for an unedited DVD release. It is definitely an intense emotioncharged scene. Clearly giving birth to halfhuman halfvampire offspring is no picnic. Dawn isn't the only thing breaking in this movie. There's also the breaking of Bella's bones thanks to the spawn crushing her from the inside out. One thing the movie nails is making Bella look as sickly as possible. She's so skeletal it's disturbing.Kristen Stewart is put through the wringer in this film. There's a vast array of feelings Bella has to tangle with. And yes she does smile though the happy feelings don't last very long. Edward or 'The Hair' as Jessica calls him matches Bella in regards to the number of emotions she goes through. He has to carry all this guilt over the one he loves most and it clearly takes a toll on him emotionally as much as the pregnancy does on Bella physically. Poor Jacob meanwhile isn't having any fun either. These three characters deal with so much throughout the film. Stewart Pattinson and Lautner with new stubble all sell it.Most characters get at least a brief moment to shine. Some Cullens who aren't Edward get a bit more dialogue than usual Elizabeth Reaser as Esme is probably the most happy about this. I especially liked seeing some conflict between Alice and Rosalie in regards to Bella's child. The wolves have a few brief scenes here and there. I was thankful for more Seth and Leah in particular. And we finally get to hear what werewolf telepathy sounds like. It's definitely chaotic which makes sense. Billy Burke and Sarah Clarke as Bella's parents get some great moments both emotional and humorous. Even new characters like the Denali clan get some screen time. Keep an eye on that Irina Maggie Grace who manages to do a lot with a little amount of screen time she'll be important in Part 2. Bella's friends maybe get a line each. Jessica Anna Kendrick who still steals every scene she's in gets the most. She along with various other characters add humour. Given how heavy the storyline is in this film the humor is a muchappreciated relief.Things do get very dark posthoneymoon. And one must admire Condon for taking on this film and tackling such touchy subjects as the fact Edward can't be with Bella completely while she's still human without causing bruises. Does he let Bella die giving birth to their spawn? Does Jacob remain loyal to his tribe or side with those he has hated for so long in order to protect Bella? And what of the allimportant 'imprinting'? Thankfully we get a look at what Renesmee will look like when she grows to adulthood which will be when Jacob starts thinking of her in THAT way. So don't get your panties in a twist about it. If you paid attention you will know how imprinting works and it won't seem as freaky as it initially sounds.Condon should also be commended for his direction as his choice of shots add so much to the film. We even get a look inside Bella to see how the venom changes her. The effects on display during her transformation are really something. I also liked that they included flashbacks to the previous films as we hear Bella's Lullaby play.If you don't like anything to do with the Twilight franchise then you're not going to change your opinion by this point. Haters will hate. But for those of us who appreciate it this movie is a fine interpretation of the first half of the book. As well as the choices of music used something else these films have always done right is remain true to the source material including most of the important dialoguemoments from the books. Things end in a logical place and leave you anxiously awaiting Part 2. And if you stay for a little while after the end credits start there's an extra scene involving the Volturi.".

	onyx:emotionText "Bill Condon has achieved the seemingly impossible task of filming that which had been deemed 'unfilmable'. The book ending for Eclipse with Jacob running away after receiving the invite to Bella  Edward's wedding which was left out of the Eclipse film is where we begin this movie. Breaking Dawn Part 1 thankfully takes its time with most of the important moments from the book. The preparation for the wedding the wedding itself most intricate back of a wedding dress EVER the honeymoon complete with legshaving! and everything involving the pregnancy  these sections of the film are the most focused upon. That said there are some things left out that may upset some fans. Jacob's section of the book? Condensed. Considerably. Hope you weren't expecting to see the stuff involving him going off to look for somebody to imprint on. It's not here. Sadly one of the parts I liked most about the book the stuff with Jacob Seth  Leah has been vastly shortened. But at least the major points are there. Maybe we could of got more of them instead of that rather pointless fight scene between the Cullens and the wolves? Regarding the sex scene and birthing scene which everyone wants to know about Well Bella  Edward having bedbreakingly good sex is included but you can sort of tell there have been cuts. The birthing scene fares a bit better. There is more blood in this scene and a nightmare Bella has early in the film than the whole of the three previous movies combined. I can see how this would have been trimmed down also but I think they really did include as much as they possibly could given the rating here's hoping for an unedited DVD release. It is definitely an intense emotioncharged scene. Clearly giving birth to halfhuman halfvampire offspring is no picnic. Dawn isn't the only thing breaking in this movie. There's also the breaking of Bella's bones thanks to the spawn crushing her from the inside out. One thing the movie nails is making Bella look as sickly as possible.

Many of the scenes were obvious fillers with terrible dialogue. The acting was soso from most of the lead performers with the sole exception being Billy Burke Charlie who appears to be a very good actor. About half way through the film I kept looking at my watch hoping the 117 minutes would be over soon. I am being forced at this point to continue writing when in fact I have nothing more to say about this boring sequel of a film called Breaking Dawn. According to the rules ones' review must be at least 10 lines minimum. So what you're reading right now is the completely unnecessary and unpleasantly annoying filler mandated by IMDb.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am neither a Twilight fan or a Twilight detractor. This said I am indifferent to the franchise. As far as the movies I still think coming from someone whose knowledge of the books only comes from my sister being a fan and me reading a chapter of one and putting it down that the best is Eclipsenot saying much and New Moon the worst. But that is not a consolation really. Breaking Dawn Part 1 is not quite among the worst of the year and nowhere near among the worst ever however it suffers from some major problems that I will get to later in the review. So what was it that got me seeing Breaking Dawn Part 1 in the first place? The answer was its director Bill Condon. I am familiar with his previous films and find him a promising director and writer finding his films well written observed and acted. Gods and Monsters is amazing and one of my favourites Kinsey was interesting and Dreamgirls elevated by the soundtrack and cast was quite decent. Did Condon do a good job directing? For me I am not sure. I'd say of the four Twilight movies so far Breaking Dawn Part 1 has the most cinematic feel to it on the other hand there is not much here that made Condon's previous films so good and I'd go as far to say it is the film of his that engaged me the least.Are there any redeeming qualities to this instalment? I think so actually. Although there are moments of sloppy editing I did like the look of the film. At some points it was quite Gothic and at others it had either an evergreen or autumnal feel to it. The scenery often does look stunning the effects are okay I guess and the cinematography especially with the closeups of the back of the wedding dress and the final shot is some of the best of the franchise in my opinion.I also liked Carter Burwell's score. I like Burwell a lot his music has a hypnotic and quite hauntingly beautiful quality to it. For my tastes though some of the pop tunes are on the insipid side however the score itself was pleasant with a lot of what I like about Burwell evident.Much has been said about the sex scene. In all honesty I was expecting it to be of hilariously cheesy quality but somehow Condon brought a little more subtlety than I was expecting. The last thirty minutes was perhaps the most exciting Breaking Dawn Part 1 got as some of does have purpose and intensity which was something that the first half of the film did not have.There are also two good performances Billy Burke and Michael Sheen the latter being another point of interest. Burke as always is amusing with some of the better lines of the filmthough is that saying much do you think? while Sheen ever the great actor adopts a menace and magnetism as Aro without overdoing it too much. Ashley Greene is also quite good if not great.I have to say I still don't think much of the acting of the central trio. Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon with much less of the moping and dead pauses but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless. It doesn't help though that Bella is a rather dull character.Robert Pattinson has more to do than he did in New Moon and is less hammy than in the first filmthe looking into the camera moments brought moments of unintentional laughter when I first went to see Twilight when it came out. As a matter of fact this is perhaps his best performance of the series and he is certainly the best of the central trio but like Stewart some of the line delivery could've been more inspired.Taylor Lautner on the other hand is getting worse and worse. He is hunky to be sure but does that alone make you a good actor? Not to me. I will give credit and say he is better than he was in this year's Abduction where both the film and performance were awful but the more dramatic moments from him felt forced and overplayed and throughout there was a very stilted nature about him. A lot of the problem is to do with the writing. The dialogue in the Twilight franchise never was particularly good saying this though in terms of written quality this is Twilight at its most banal its most clunky and its most cheesy. The characters are clichd and underdeveloped too and at the end of the day you don't care for anybody. Oh and the talking wolves were poorly done and unintentionally funny.The story is very bland and unengaging not to mention thin structurally and in content. The whole of the first half reads little more than ponderous melodrama. Was the wedding lavish? Yes it was. But it was also plodding and overextended. The second half fares better still with the clunky dialogue uneven acting and cheesy underdeveloped plot points and characterisations but as I said the last thirty minutes or so serves as the highlight of the film. But for me what killed the film was the pace. Mind you I have seen movies with slow pacing but they are often paced deliberately and with strong meanings great acting and dialogue and identifiable characters. With little of that here Breaking Dawn Part 1 not only is dull and plodding but also uninteresting and without bite.Overall despite my admiration for Condon and Sheen this didn't work. The ending is highly suggestive of a continuation which I understand is happening. If so I do hope it will be better than this. 410 Bethany Cox".

Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson bring atrocious performances as the leading couple while the rest of the cast seems to be there only in order to charge a paycheck.The previous filmography from director Bill Condon includes two excellent films Gods and Monsters and Kinsey but it is obvious that he made The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn  Part 1 as a mercenary because his work feels absolutely listless and lacking of any vision.I have to mention that The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn  Part 1 offers some moments of involuntary humor. From the pathetic performances brought by Stewart and Pattinson to the weak special effects there are some opportunities to laugh at the technical histrionic and narrative blunders from this film. And since I just mentioned the special effects the werewolves look totally fake and they appear in one of the worst scenes I have seen in a long time...one of those which provoke an absolute embarrassment combined with the incredulity of knowing that someone considered that a good idea.In conclusion The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn  Part 1 is an unbearable film which made me snooze very frequently and made me feel like wasting my time. I know that this film is having many female fans...I respect them but I honestly do not understand them.".

	schema:reviewBody "To rate this movie I think I should split my opinion in two The twilighter side and the neutral side. Read the part that better mirrors your attitude.NEUTRAL The movie has no cinematographic value at all. Just a lame slow in places disgusting report of how a vampirehuman marriage could be in the first part and a badly directed with some very awkward moments plot development in the second part. I could not help noticing the derisiveness of some scenes e.g. the one in which the transformed Jacob addresses his other fellows I thought the movie was turning into a joke at that very moment! and the one in which Bella makes the bloodshake fall to the ground and kind of breaks her back. A praise goes to the actors the acting is not bad is not bad at all considering that in my opinion nothing better could have been done Kristen Stewart's performance is not bad and I found very convincing the character of Jacob. Another criticize goes to the movie slowness in fact those who are not very fond of Ed and Bell's love story might probably find the fully detailed and slow part in which the two get married really annoying. Finally I would rate this movie in this case with 45 out of 10.TWILIGHTER I do think very few fans will be disappointed by this installment. Let's be onest I was almost crying during the scene of the wedding and I'm a male!!! mainly because of my affection for the series I was platonically in love with the story when the first Twilight movie came out. That's the truth this movie's been made just for those who have always followed and liked the Twilight saga. I don't expect anyone to suddenly turn up and say I've never given a  about this series but I've found the movie absolutely awesome! This movie is for us Twilighters all around the world. Because all those scenes have an emotional meaning only in case you are very fond of the series. In this case I can and want turn many blind eyes may I say it? haha in the name of my affection for the saga. I enjoyed the Ed and Bell's wedding night all those particulars they even play chess! that made me feel good during the projection of this movie. In this case I would rate the movie with 9 out of 10.That's all according to my opinion. Thanks for reading.".

	schema:headline " Breaking Dawn  Part 1 Serves As A Mediocre Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Last night I went to go see The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn  Part 1. I should lay a few facts out on the table. First I have read and own all of the books. Second this is the first of the movies that I have not seen at midnight. Third I waited until almost a month after its release because I could not get through that trailer without bursting out laughing and I did not want to be attacked by rabid Twihards. Fourth I consumed half a pitcher of a Donnie Daiquiri at my local Cinebarre while viewing this film. Now that I have put that out in the open onto the review.The fourth installment of The Twilight Saga brings us to the event many avid fans have been waiting for the wedding of Bella Swan Kristen Stewart and Edward Cullen Robert Pattinson. The movie begins by showing us a sequence of people getting the waterproof invitation to aforementioned wedding set to an unnecessarily sweeping score. Of course young Jacob Black Taylor Lautner is not happy about this turn of events and morphs into a werewolf to deal with his troubles. They get married finally have sex and 13 days later it is discovered that Bella is pregnant with an aggressively kicking little... something That Bella insists on carrying despite the fact that it is killing her.Visually this is the best of the franchise. Bill Condon Dreamgirls brings polish to the film that the others lack. There is a sense of balance and purpose to his shots. It t seems as if Condon was trying to make something out of very little. Other props go to the special effects used to show Bella's transformation from healthy 18 yearold to a literal corpse. There are moments where they show her bones looking as if they are trying to poke through her skin and her complexion looks more like that of a zombie than a human. That however is where the positives end.The script written by Melissa Rosenberg at times feels more like a prolife argument than entertainment. While some characters acknowledge that whatever is growing inside of Bella is slowly draining her life and should not be carried to term others insist that Bella should sacrifice anything for it. They even go so far as to correct anytime someone says fetus or thing repeatedly saying that it is a baby. The first time it was not annoying it merely clarified how the different characters viewed what was growing inside of Bella but after the 5th time it felt a little redundant. Add into the mix some fight scenes that have so much CGI it is difficult to distinguish who is fighting who and it makes you miss the moments at the beginning where Bella seems to be terrified of getting married and the 10 minute sequence of her trying to entice her new husband to have sex with her.The acting in this movie remains mediocre which is a rise from where we began in Twilight. Stewart still does not know how to show emotion unless it is complete discomfort Pattinson still has a blank stare and slight grimace on his face at all times even as his wife is dying and Lautner is trying.This movie tries to act like it is a lot more epic than it is so here is the warning Despite what the music will have you to think nothing in this story is really epic nothing in this story is good nothing in this story is really compelling at this point. However if you liked the previous installments go see it. Or if you want to get drunk and laugh your ass off for two hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "1. And God said Since AIDS didn't teach you I bestow 'Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1' upon you. 2. The cast's acting ability is equivalent to a possum under attack. 3. Shouting out You did THIS! to a man who recently impregnated his wife isn't just insultingit's obvious. 4. While playing chess it is appropriate to gleefully proclaim I win! like a fiveyearold verses the ohsoancient checkmate. 5. According to the morals of somewhatwriter Stephanie Meyer it is acceptable to kill humans as long as you're in the healthy position of playing both judge and executioner. Longlive mormons. 6. If it was previously okay for someone over 100 to woo someone under 18yearsold then I guess the same could be done for a teen to an 18minuteold infant. 7. 'Twilight' contains as many vampires as the Republican Party contains Christians. 8. Within 3seconds of the start time Jacob rips off his shirt. Release the horny and lonely 50yearold moms! 9. Werewolves tend to get sick at the sight of blood apparently. 10. You know you have script problems when George Lucas himself has dialogue suggestions. 11. The original subtitle of 'Breaking Wind' was questionably rejected. 12. Soap Operas left and right are being cancelled and yet this has a theatrical release? My apologies World. 13. Mercifully to cut some costs on lighting the moon is full in every night shot despite the continuity of scenes. 14. If this is the AntiAbortionAdvertisement it screams I will pull the hanger myself. 15. More got accomplished in the 16 Republican debates than in two draining hours here. 16. I've heard the same bed that breaks in the movie during Edward and Bella's sex scene happens in the book. Big deal I used to call that Tuesday Night. 17. Worried your unborn child might become a demonic offspring? Turn to Yahoo on an Apple laptop for all your answers. 18. Who knew a pack of talking dogs could be this funny outside of Pixar's 'Up'? 19. The Mayans calendar has been recalculated to narrow the end of days to 21112. In a completely unrelated story 'Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1' is being released on video that same day. 20. Wincing as hard as you can and uttering the line Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am? isn't the most believable pose to convince someone they're good in bed. 21. Finally a movie I can agree actors deserved a 30 million paycheck. Isn't that the going rate for a soul? 22. I believe in Guilty Pleasures. Although to call 'Twilight' that would only be halfright.23. Some women are undeniably psychic when it comes to pregnancy. For example Bella acts constipated for roughly 2 weeks prior to her actual conception. 24. I admit I've never been to war. But I can imagine watching this is what it's like seeing someone's arm getting blown off.25. Howcananyonekeep a straight face with dialogue such as 'Kind' is my middle name? 26. Pitching a movie in Hollywood should always take longer than the writing of the screenplay. Right? 27. Breakfast of champions Chicken Peanut Butter and Vomit. I wonder if she's pregnant. 28. Failed attempt at positivity It's not as bad I thought it would be. It's worse.".

But then I thought about it and realized it's just like going to McD or BK or any places like this. You go there because you fancy a hamburger or cheeseburger take your pick. While you're eating it you think it's not bad but afterwards you're wondering what was it that I ate? What is that hamburger made of and that cheese tasted like garbage... It's exactly the same with this film. You watch it because you fancy a nice emotional nonintellectual random film. Afterwards you'll find yourself thinking what the  was this? The first hour mainly contained Stewart and Patterson making out and making out and making out even more! Not even at the wedding Stewart looked happy nor at the honeymoon. I was disappointed by the cheekiness of the film especially the first half. It was so bad! Seriously take a bowl you're going to puke. And not because of the amount of blood because frankly it's hardly there. The second partI admit was slightly better. Lautner was also disappointing to me though his acting doesn't come through to me. It just stays on the screen. The wolf part was actually quite cool where Lautner would stand up for Stewart and her child and when he could hear voices. But the vampires fighting with the wolves? Not so much I found myself thinking whatever. Seriously. Awkward when Patterson realized that Lautner had imprinted on his daughter. If I were a father I'd freak out. Honestly he fell in love with Stewart who is his age and then falls in love with her daughter? I wouldn't sound cool. At all. The best part was the transformation. How on the outside she lookes dead and the shots from her veins where you see the venom spread is very well done. Well done Condon I knew you had it in you. Please show more of your incredible director skills in the next part. Frankly you can do so much better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those not familiar with the rules of the Official Twilight drinking game they are as follows.Take a shotsip when... 1. Someone says the word vampire or wolf or any variation including newborns. 2. Whenever someone sparkles. 3. When the father appears in police uniform. 4. Whenever someone is brooding. 5. Whenever an obnoxious hipster indie song is being played in the background. 6. Whenever someone doesn't have his shirt on. 7. Whenever someone gives an unrealistically generous gift does a foolishly gallant act or otherwise bends the rules of common sense for Bella.Drink the rest of the bottle when... 1. Someone unattractive or out of shape is on screen. 2. Something in a scene makes you feel anything other than sleepiness or the need to plant your face in your hands.Thus I delved into the world of Breaking Dawn Part 1. In this film Edward and Bella take the plunge so she can become a vampire like she's always wanted. Jacob pisses and moans and Bella has unprotected sex while still human resulting in her mutant baby trying to eat its way out of her womb. You know true love and all that good stuff.My roommate whose expertise on Twilight I value as much as one reasonably can filled in some of the holes that went unexplained or glossed over in the flick. Why can't they just turn her into a vampire while pregnant? Because it would kill the baby. Why is the act of sex with a vampire while human potentially deadly? Because their skins as hard as diamonds and they're super strong. How can these vampires live for eons amassing enough money to afford a private island off the coast of Brazil without the IRS at least knowing about it? And for that matter why would vampires want a vacation home in sunny Rio anyway? Just shut up and watch the movie!My roommate did bring up an interesting notion that was not explained in the movie nor she believes explained in the book. How can they even have sex? Vampires have no pulse so they have no blood actually coursing through their veins. It only stands to reason that Edward can't get his little Dracula to stand at attention. So Bella is waiting to be turned just so she can have human carnal knowledge of a cold corpse with a flaccid iditarod. Perhaps if you're being turned into a bloodsucker while you're performing its been known to happen in vampire movies then you'd have a fully erect projectile for always and forever but that would be a very inconvenient case of rigamortis. You'd never be able to wear mesh shorts birds would always want to perch on you and all your vampire friends would always call you Vlad the Impaler. But on the positive side you'd actually achieve every pubescent boy's deep seeded fantasy you could use you're dingus as a weapon!Of course its all fun and games until someone gets pregnant. That's why its important kids to make and keep important commitments to your loved ones. In this case commit to spending the rest of eternity with a manipulative Gothic horror monster before getting jiggy with it or else be forced to drink O slurpees while your ribcage and spine breaks from the force of your bloodthirsty monster child. By the way the baby's name is Renesmee a mix of Bella's mother's name and the punchline of a cruel practical joke. The newborn is also imprinted by Jacob which is a way for a werewolf to leave his marking that disappointingly doesn't involve rising his hind legs.In the end Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a vapid stupid glacierly paced movie with very little going for it other than the welcome sight of Bella withering away. So its a substantial improvement from the rest of the series. I actually look forward to the next and hopefully final chapter in the franchise. Maybe if I get liquored up before the premiere or during I would only remember the good parts like the credits.httpwww.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

There just isn't enough material to do so. Hell the whole story of the first part could be summed up in one sentence. The characters just aren't deep and real enough to carry the movie. They aren't supposed to be they need to be interchangeable with any teenage movie viewer who fantasizes about some unreachable love story.And the plot is just dragged on and on...It's like the director has given up of making a good movie. What's the point anyway? The emoteenagegirl the franchise is supposed to speak to will go to see the movie either way. It will earn money whether you put in the work or not.And the last book was so filmable I was already imagining the movie in my mind. It had enough action enough new elements that weren't already shown in the past parts. But again it was more important to milk the audience for just one more time then to make a halfway decent movie.I still like the story and will go to see the second part but I'm just disappointed this movie is just a reminder of today's capitalist society with no interest than money and financial gain.".

If I had paid money to see it I would be going postal on everyone who conspired to take my money from me. It was absolutely awful! I only watched this because a I'm a completist when it comes to all things vampire and I've read all the books below mediocre and watched the previous films and b I figured it couldn't get any worse than the last one. I was wrong. The series started poorly and went downhill fast. There are SO many things wrong with it that it would be impossible to list them all but a couple are that the CGI wolves are even worse than the ones they had in The Day After Tomorrow and they were bloody awful! and there were several instances where vamps had sunlight shining directly on them and there were absolutely no sparkles but then I think VAMPIRES SHOULDN'T SPARKLE anyway. I could wax lyrical on the poor performances and go into detail about just how badly the scene where the wolves were all talking telepathically sucked but I'd just bore everyone.The soundtrack to this one is pretty nothingy as well. And the music is pretty much constant. It reminded me of when I tried to watch Twin Peaks but couldn't because the constantlypresent music was so loud I could hardly make out what the characters were saying. In this instance I COULD hear what was being said but the music playing ALL THE TIME was still very annoying. Sometimes there's a lot to be said for background SILENCE or just natural sound instead of music. I honestly cannot recall a single moment in that film where there wasn't music playing  it drove me absolutely nuts! It possibly doesn't help that the other film I watched last night The Ides of March was nothing short of brilliant and in my opinion a definite contender for several Oscar nominations so BDP1 suffered even more in comparison. At least my whole evening wasn't a complete bust! I would have happily paid twice for The Ides of March  it's THAT good!".

It's nothing like Ed Wood but has the same way of enchanting the viewer by how terribly it is.The movie starts out with the werewolf getting mad and Bella's dad worries because Bella Swan is getting married. And despite a lot of horrible nightmares about the wedding she goes through with it. It's as if she takes every good advice from her father and friends and does the complete opposite. Which of course tuns out badly for her. The movie is filled with stonefaced acting overly dramatic music and voicedover wolf talk. Even the makeup is bad. But the absolute worst is the simple and ridiculous story by Stephanie Meyer which proves that books can be a waste of paper.So why watch this movie? Well if you're bored and want a laugh about the stupidity of those people who like these films I think this is the perfect movie for you. Just don't spend any money on it.".

Sammo Hung also a chinese immigrant living in Barcelona works as a very badly dressed PI. Sammo is hired by a dubious looking gentleman in a bowler hat to track down a Spanish girl who it just so happens is the daughter of Yuen Baios dad's girlfriend. This sets the scene for amongst other things a bizarre retro skateboarding sequence a ludicrous carvan chase and a top class fight at the end.For me Wheels on Meals represents the ultimate combination of comedy kung fu and naive slapstick humor.  It's worth pointing out that this film isn't as good a Martial Arts flick as some of the earlier works that it's three main stars were involved in Young Master Magnificent Butcher Prodigal Son etc.  However the main strength of Wheels on Wheels is it's ability to get new mileage out of some very old gags and it also proves once and for all that unusual hats can be very funny.I give it nine out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first heard of this when TNT was showing it after the TV premiere of Rumble In The Bronx. I couldn't make it through the first 10 minutes because of the bad dubbing and the mixing around of scenes The very first scene was Jackie and Yuen skateboarding in Spain rather than them waking up and getting into their morning routine. A couple of months ago I got the Hong Kong DVD and loved it. The movie is about Thomas Chan and David Biao two Chinese guys who run a successful food truck business in Spain. They get caught up in wannabe detective Moby's Hung case to find a Spanish heiress and the fun goes from there. The chemistry is great between the three brothers and Lola Forner is a great distraction. The writing is funny and Sammo's direction is right on target. The fight scenes are great. If you want to watch vintage Jackie watch this film as he can move quick. The much talked about fight between Chan and Benny The Jet Urquidez does not disappoint. Want a lesson in how to do a fight scene? Watch these two guys go at it They would have a rematch a few years later in Dragons Forever. For all of you fans of JC credit outtakes there is none JC didn't start using them until Police Story. But in a funny action packed movie like this you won't care. It is one of The 3 Brothers best and it will leave you wanting more.".

Sammo Hung is really quite a character good acting skills and a unique look not to mention he is a skilled Martial Artist.

	schema:reviewBody "If Sammo could ever do anything right he could choreograph. He's a master of martial arts choreography and many of Jackie's and Biao's best films come with Sammo doing the choreography. This movie is a prime example of this.The film deals with two Chinese men in Spain who run a food truck. They meet a pickpocket who turns out to be heir along w her institutionalized mother to a large fortune which is coveted by some nasy goons. Sammo plays a detective that's on the case. All this builds up to an excellent climax at a Spanish castle.One thing that I did like a lot about the movie was the script. The rapport between Yuen Biao and Jackie Chan was excellent and they get a lot of witty comments comebacks and responses to supposedly stupid questions. You have to see the subtitled version to understand.Like I was saying the choreography in the film is great. Unfortunately there are only about 4 fight scenes or so before the climax that are all really short. It really left me craving a lot more. The finale is a true piece of work. Jackie takes kickboxing champ Benny The Jet Urquidez in one of the best oneonone's ever filmed. Yuen Biao takes on Keith Vitale another karate champ. Sammo takes on the lead villain in a Chinese variation of European fencing.The action isn't walltowall but what's there is excellent. The relationship between Yuen and Chan is also great. It's a Jackie Chan film worth seeing.".

It's a narrow thought process for me as it comes down to Dragons Forever and the weirdly titled Wheels on Meals. Both films feature the amazing trio of Jackie Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao...'brothers' since their early days and all film stars in their own right. But the comedy in Wheels on Meals works the best and the action scenes are amazing with Biao really strutting his mobility.The plot is thin Jackie and Biao are cousins who works a 'guttruck' in Spain. Sammo is an acquaintance who takes over his employer's private detective agency when his boss goes on the run. Someone hires Sammo to find a beautiful girl Lola Forner  also seen in Armour of God whom Jackie and Biao have already had the pleasure of meeting. She's a pickpocket and the daughter of Biao's dad's girlfriend the dad and the mom met at the local insane asylum. What love!. Anyway it seems that Silvia is being chased by mobsters so she can't claim a lot of money that should be coming to her. Bad guys give chase Jackie and Biao help her and Sammo runs in to try to get his way.The three have been in a number of films together Project A being the other film that features the three as equals but even with the notso great plot you'll be surprised at how well the acting is how the jokes are still funny even while you are reading them and don't go for something dubbed the film is much better in Chinese and how great the kungfu scenes are. You'll be surprised by Jackie and Biao's skills on a skateboard and while the Jackie Vs. Benny the Jet fight scene in Dragons Forever might be a bit better you still HAVE one in this movie.For amazing comedy action and great kungfu that is directed by the pudgy Sammo and taking the three men out of Hong Kong a la Way of the Dragon  this is the film for you. Fans of Jackie Chan Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung will be hard pressed to find something better though Dragons Forever comes very very close.".

What makes this film stand out from some their other films is that some of the actions scenes in this film are iconic of the martial arts actionI cannot deny t that Jackie Chan and gang bring and have been bringing to the screen.The action sequences are iconic because this is one of the films where people might have seen a cut scene and say wow that sword blade was really close to him! and such. Some of the martial arts action sequences are incredibly well done. The strikes are so close and done so well and filmed well that the fight choreography had to be precisely timed. There were a couple stunts where I thought if he didn't complete that stunt or fight sequences successfully he would probably have been dead or very very hurt. Also there's a lot of gags and comic relief in the film as well as innovative props such as the food truck they drive around. Some action and scenes take place on Spain's some tourist traveled areas. The way the story is actually a very good work in its own since they take literally a few stories that eventually intertwine. Sylvia the main protagonist of the film is a conniving young lady who cheats and steals money from men who think they will be sleeping with her. Sylvia is no stupid girl and out schmoozes her way around men taken by her beauty and charm but she's very divisive and causes a lot of trouble.Good flick it is a different film from My Lucky Stars which is more dramatic comedy with physical comedy. This film is an action comedy with great martial arts sequences. I do recommend this one it is a fun watch if you're into the jackie chan genre of movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another winner from the prolific Jackie Chan not as slick or as big budget as his later productions like POLICE STORY but still packing a mean punch in terms of martial arts sequences. This time the reliable Sammo Hung directs the film as well as costarring as an idiotic and bumbling private eye who ends up helping hero Chan and his partner Yuen Biao in saving a beautiful heiress  as played by the genuinely charming Lola Forner  from a gang of thugs.Once again the plot is trivial stuff in which the trio of Chan Biao and Hung are up to all kinds of slapstick shenanigans whether engaging in typically illfated battles with hired goons or making trouble between themselves. The emphasis in this lowbudget film is on the comedy and you get it in spades. This time around the inmates of a mental asylum including the alwaysgoodtosee Richard Ng and John Shem are the basis for some crazy humour and our three unlikely heroes add a Three Stoogesstyle manic humour to their scenes. In fact I'd argue that this is the closest the three stars get to paying homage to the old ensemble comedy productions of the '30s.For a change this presentset production was made in Spain which offers up some nice locations which are highlighted in a lengthy carvan chase which offers up some excellent slowmotion stunts and typically unlikely comedy antics involving flying cars. The pacing is fast and furious and never lets up even during the slow spots in the story where nothing much is happening and the script is consistently funny.The various fight and action scenes are a delight to watch and make fine use of props like motorbikes tables skateboards chairs and the usual. After a few minor battles with the bad guys things pick up for the excellent finale in the castle in which our heroic trio find themselves up against two powerful thugs and a fencing champion. The resulting battles are frenetic stylish and occasionally awesome to behold benefiting from the presence of reallife champions Benny 'The Jet' Urquidez and Keith Vitali to add to the superfast realism of the action. In fact the battle between Chan and Urquidez is one of the fastest and best I've seen on film full stop not even surpassed by their rematch in DRAGONS FOREVER. Although not one of Chan's top movies this can best be described as a solid addition to his filmography with three winning turns from the leads. Instantly disposable but fun with it!".

They then see her again as a prostitute in the red light district while they are serving food to customers and she uses there van as an escape because she has been caught pick pocketing a punter. They then decide to take her in but her stealing ways get the better of her and she ends up taking there money and there next door neighbours car. There good friend Moby Sumo Hung has been asked to look after a detective agency and he's been given a case to find the girl who stole from Thomas  David. Very confusing! Anyway it turns out that the girl is an heiress and she is due to inherit a lot of money from her dead father within 14 days so Sumo Hung has to find her so her fathers brother doesn't inherit the money. The brother then sends out his elite squad to kidnap the girl so he can inherit the money but Thomas David and Moby come to her rescue by fighting off the many goons that are out to get her. I must admit a lot of these silly films that Jackie Chan starred in earlier on in his career had some detailed story lines that would be good movies if they were taken seriously. This film wasn't as bad as a lot of the other movies that I have seen during this Jackie Chan season but it still could have been a lot better if it wasn't for the awful comedic script. Like I have said many times before the action scenes are impressive along with the death defying stunts and the attention to detail during the car chases but I'm struggling to find the comedy funny. The acting wasn't as bad as I was expecting and I liked the training scenes at the beginning but I'm still struggling to keep my eyes open during some of he's movies. Average!RoundUp This is another movie directed by Sammo Hung which might explain the silly comedy throughout the movie. As usual the chemistry between Chan Hung and Biao is great and you can tell that they have made many movies together. It seems like Chan broke up there tight family when he moved to America to try and conquer the English market with movies like the Medallion the Rush Hour franchise and the Tuxedo. Anyway this was a watchable movie but the comedy was awful.I recommend this movie to people who are into their actioncomedycrimemartial arts movies starring Jackie Chan Biao Yuen and Sammo KamBo Hung. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Cousins Thomas and David run a mobile restaurant in Barcelona where David's father is currently recovering in a mental institution. With an uncanny ability to get into trouble they manage to fall in with the mysterious Sylvia who looks like a princess steals anything she can get and may be a prostitute. Despite this David is besotted and tries to help it when it is clear someone is out to get her. In fact more than one group is looking for her and another party has employed local bumbling detective Moby to track her down. With none of them sure why she is being targeted but each with their own agenda David Moby and Thomas all try to keep her safe and uncover the truth.A key thing to know going into this film is that the plotting was not anywhere near the top of the priority list and that it does show in the final product. The story is a really convoluted mess that has characters and scenarios that seem to exist only to allow the overall flow to continue specifically the entire mental institute thing and that even with this it has plenty of logic jumps to keep things going. This isn't a massive problem though because generally the film is a comic genre film and it is possible to accept this as coming with the territory. So it goes forward with this constantly playedup comedy air that is always silly but mostly quite amusing  I never really roared with laughter but I had frequent chuckles to myself.A big part of this is down to the acting rather than the material and although very much of the genre it does work. All three of the leads do well with the comedy all overacting and exaggerating facial expressions to emphasis things  hence it being a bit silly a lot as well. Sammo does this the most but at the same time does get the most laughs. Chan is good but doesn't have as much pure comedy in his character while Biao has more of the romantic sap to carry but works. Where they naturally excel is in their physical action work. Sammo has the lesser part of this and his main efforts are in his admittedly impressive reactions to the many kicks and punches he takes. Chan gets a great scene with Benny Urquidez to show his skills and Biao is amazingly agile. The one problem with the martial arts action is that there is not quite enough of it. The end of the film is the big scene but up till then it is not quite what you would be used to from the genre  where amazing fight scenes are scattered throughout as well as a big finish. So at times I was coasting on the odd chuckle but the final scenes are tough and impressive  particularly Chan doing his usual stuff but instead of making it a bit comical he makes it a lot more brutal than I have seen him do.The support cast all overact accordingly and mostly fulfil their roles without their average acting skills mattering eg a goon is a goon and the main fighters are very good fighters etc. Forner is not too bad as Sylvia although her role as woman of intense beauty isn't helped by the impact of dating on her looks and outfits. The one supporting performance of real note is from Ng I think  he was the mental patient who was mentally ill  not stupid he has two main scenes both of which are funny due to his material and his performance.The end result of all this is not a brilliant film but still a silly and enjoyable one that never quite has enough of any one thing but still works overall with consistent chuckles and when it comes engaging and impressive fight sequences.".

This one is set in Spain where Jackie Thomas and his best friend David operate a mobile food van and service one of the market places in the country. It is a little unusual to see an Asian population in Spain particularly when David's dad is in an insane asylum where he is now in a relationship with a woman named Gloria.At first it seems that things are disconnected. David's Dad's relationship with Gloria a pickpocket and a rather hopeless detective hired to find a girl whose only photo is when she was 12. However as the movie progresses things quickly fall into place. At first it appears that people are after the pickpocket simply because she is a pickpocket however it becomes evident that she is actually the heiress to a fortune a fortune whom the brother does not want going over to her because it brings shame to the family name not that shame is a huge European quality.It is interesting how the concepts of shame and the actions of a guest play strongly in Asian movies but it is something that is important to their culture that does not interplay strongly within our culture. We have a guilt based culture where if we treat people wrongly we will feel guilt but then guilt is always tailored to our existential view of reality. To the Asian shame is something that one seeks to avoid and thus will act so as not to bring shame onto their name or that of their family. Family is another important aspect as we in the western world are an individualistic lot. We bring guilt upon ourselves but not onto our family however the strong family ties in the Asian world mean that they will act with their family's honour in mind.This does not necessarily mean that the Asians are better than us but it is a culture that I have a deep respect for because it acts in a way that is far more honourable than the actions of those of us in the west.But onto the movie not that there is much more to write on this film or whether there are any really deep themes in here. There aren't. This is a typical and enjoyable Jackie Chan film with sight gags and the standard martial arts. Sammo Hung who directed the film also plays a major role as the bumbling detective. The bumbler is a character that Sammo seems to always play and I must say that an Asian with a perm does look rather odd but then Sammo Hung once again always does seem to play those odd characters.".

It has better balance between the 3 dragons rather than Project A which was more of a Jackie flick. The international feel with the Spanish and Chinese is great fun too. I love the soundtrack as well.The action scenes are the best though. Sammo Hung has slightly less screen presence than Jackie and Yuen but its fine because he does a wonderful job of directing. His swordplay in the climax is fantastic as well. Yuen does a very good job in the movie and is very charismatic as the innocent guy fallen for the pickpocket. Jackie's climax battle with Benny is still hailed as one of his epic best which is true. Lola is very sexy in her role. Keith and Benny do a fantastic job as the thugs.If you want to laugh out loud and be wowed by some fantastic stunt work and fight sequences Wheels on Meals is just for you.

Though the plot is really nothing new it is the movie's fight scenes which are a delight to watch as ever as well as the humour and the narrative this of which becomes a dominant aspect of Wheels on meals. Viewers of the US show Martial Law will recognise Sammo as the cousin's friend and P.I. The camaraderie of the three male leads is always great to see and the performances are spoton as usual. The script is well written the comedic elements add a nice touch to the film and the humour works well to good effect. The climax of the movie reaches fever point towards the end with the fight to the death between the impressive Benny Urquidez and Jackie himself. All in all though Wheels on Meals is a culinary lighthearted 'kick ass' romp and one of which has some of the most amazing stunts and battles ever featured in a martial arts comedybased movie.

It isn't your usual Jackie Chanstyle but if he wants to try something different then I will gladly support him. I found 'Gorgeous' funny although others will disagree. There isn't much action but when there is it is excellent. The two fight scenes with Brad Allan are some of the best fightscenes Jackie has ever filmed. They really are incredible but in the end this really is more of a 'feel good' movie than anything else.Apparently the version I have is cut by 20 minutes missing a cameo Stephen Chow. Damn. Stephen Chow is cool. 'Gorgeous' isn't for everyone  fans of the Chanman should check it out but I'm not guaranteeing you'll enjoy it as much I did. 710".

Sure there are other Jackie Chan films with hints of romance and there is always lots of fun and excitement but this movie is different because unlike a lot of his other movies this one is based on a romantic story yet still has a lot of great martial arts and some laughs to offer its audience.What makes this such a great movie for me is that the choreography for the fighting I thought was excellent. The romantic storyline is simple yet effective. It is an easy movie to to watch and enjoy.Now the rating.... a lot of people probably thought this was going to be an action packed movie. Now there is quite a lot of action considering this movie was intended to be a romancecomedy. It just proves that Jackie Chan can pull off a romantic comedy really well.".

Jackie said this would probably never get shown in the States because it was too Asian for a western audience but Columbia TriStar picked it up and I bought it when it was priced to buy. I thought it was a good story with a few good fight scenes but the dubbing was awful. The voices were all overplayed and Jackie didn't use his own voice for this one. Bradley James Allan makes a huge splash in the fight scenes he's in with Jackie. Shu Qi is great as the innocent and childlike Bu as she sees everything as a fairy tale. I think the reason a lot of people didn't like this one was because Columbia TriStar hyped it up as an action flick rather than a romantic comedy. Even the back of the video box makes it out to be a action piece. I knew long before I saw it that it was different so I knew what I was getting into.I got the Hong Kong DVD of this movie today and it was much better. There is more detail to the story rather than the story jumping around like it does in the U.S. edit. The DVD also has lots of features on it. These features include a trailer an interview with Jackie and director Vincent Kok a making of featurette where Jackie states he enjoyed making it more than Rush Hour and the music video to the song from the film Two versions actually Cantonese and Mandarin. Of course this will never be as good as his other movies like Police Story or Who Am I? but I give him credit for trying something different. It worked well for me and had enough fight scenes in it to amuse me.".

It is instead a romantic comedy which I will admit not too many Jackie fans will be expecting. I however applaud the fact that he branches out from the typical comedic chopsocky formula in this one. I think it would be terrible as an actor to endlessly have to come up with new they done me wrong so I gotta beat 'em up plots for movies. So all you folks who just want to see amazing stunts and so on I would advise that you watch something else. This movie does not contain much in the way of stunts or even fight scenes. However it does contain a couple of comedic fights with the Four Stooges of henchmen which might elicit a chuckle or two. It also contains two fights with Bradley James Allan which are fought within spaces about the size of a boxing ring and with only walls to run up and do backflips off as far as the acrobatics go. However these are amazing fights especially the last one because with Brad Jackie doesn't have to slow down. So it is blazing fists aflying and some of the best toetotoe single opponent action you will see in any Jackie movie. And I don't think they contained any wire work at all. Just straight honest action. Somewhat ironically one part of the last fight with Brad was the only part of the movie I got a full belly laugh out of. Admittedly this is kind of an odd movie but as long as you approach it in the right frame of mind I think you might enjoy it. Maybe think of it as a chick flick with some Jackie Chan action thrown in. This would be a great one to watch for instance with a girlfriend who doesn't usually like martial arts movies. It has both action and touching moments. And after she sees this one you may persuade her to watch some of the real Chan actioners with you. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Acrobatic martialarts superstar Jackie Chan and adorable Asian hottie Shu Qi star in this silly but likable romantic comedy about a young Taiwanese girl Bu who travels to Hong Kong in pursuit of love after finding a message in a bottle.She tracks down the sender of the message Albert Tony Leung a gay fashion photographer and not quite the potential soulmate she had hoped for. But it's not long before she really meets the man of her dreams whilst on a yacht trip with Albert Bu rescues millionaire C. N. Chan after he is attacked by a gang of thugs on his boat and the two fall in loveBut since the course of true love never runs smooth various obstacles are put in the way of the lovers' happiness a dedicated bachelor Chan finds it impossible to actually say 'I love you' which obviously upsets lovestruck Bu and rival businessman L.W. Lo constantly causes trouble for Chan by attacking him at every opportunity. Of course the film ends with a predictable happy ending in which Chan finally declares his love for Bu and his enemies are defeated.A schmaltzy and lightweight Lunar New Year offering Gorgeous meanders lazily through familiar romantic comedy territory relying heavily on the charms of its charismatic leads. Fortunately both Jackie Chan and Shu Qi have bucketloads of charisma to spare and the film manages to be a lot of fun despite the insubstantial plot.Although this may not be your typical Chan outing fans of his fight flicks should still take note this film features some of his best martial arts scenes since his heyday in the 80s. A somewhat lacklustre first battle which takes place on a boat may make viewers think that perhaps with Chan now in his 50s 'the Man' has lost his edge. Fans however have nothing to worry about because later fights definitely deliver the incredible martialarts acrobatics Jackie Chan is famous for.A confrontation with four mask wearing thugs wielding baseball bats is absolutely amazing featuring complex choreography that requires splitsecond timing and two later showdowns against the diminutive Bradley James Allan must rank amongst the best Chan fights ever filmed!This may not be classic Chan but given the choice between another Rush Hour or Gorgeous I'd take the latter any day.N.B. This review is of the Columbia Tristar DVD which has a runtime of 95 minutes. A longer HK release is available which also features a cameo from Stephen Chow.".

It is cute and sweet throughout. If you can get through that then this movie will entertain you. If you're looking for a fistful of action you will be disappointed.First we meet Hsu Chi who plays the innocent country girl from Taiwan who looks toward the big city for romance via a message in a bottle The Chinese name of the film Glass Bottle is more appropriate so why they renamed it for the foreign release is a puzzlement.. Hsu rushes to Hong Kong in search of love and finds Tony Leung a gay makeup artist. She sees Chan in one of his flourishes escaping Emil Chow's men on a yacht and quickly falls in love with this dashing adventurous character. Hsu and Jackie meet up when Hsu rescues Jackie from this predicament. Richie Ren appears as the comic relief playing Hsu's suitor from Taiwan.The movie focuses on the relationship between Bu and C.N. Hsu and Jackie and the events they go through while developing their love. There are a couple of fightingsparring scenes where Jackie takes on Bradley James Allan one of Jackie's own stunt monkeys. These two fights are wellchoreographed and fill in for those who are jones'n for a Jackie fight scene.The direction by Vincent Kok is well handled. Jackie made the right choice in getting a comedy director to take the reigns. The art and set design were also well done.Although I too love Jackie's action flicks this movie is a departure into the romantic realm. It is a wellmade film that is engaging and sugarsweet. The soundtrack is also quite cloying. And unlike many of the recent Jet Li movies that have been dubbed for American audiences Gorgeous keeps its soundtrack and theme song intact which made the dubbed version more tolerable. Jackie seems to be making the transition to more adultbased films that divert slightly from his typical kungfu knockabouts. This film was a welcome change of pace.".

While talking to her dolphin friend she finds a message in a bottle that says 'I'm waiting for you in Hong Kong' and heads off for that city only to find that the guy who sent the message Tony Leung bats for the other team and the message was intended for a guy. Crestfallen she teams up with him while he's doing a photo shoot and meets following a kung fu fight CN Chan our Jackie. They both get stranded in a boat and start to fall in love or do they? CN's a bit emotionally stunted. He's a killer businessman but can he be romantic to boot? CN's got other troubles. His exfriend and business rival is out to humiliate him and keeps setting up fights with a martial arts champion. So not only does Jackie have a complicated love life but he's now got to get in shape to fight this guy who has just beat him up in a car park.Gorgeous doesn't feature over the top stunts or your usual Jackie mannerisms but those looking for a bit of action may do well to stay to the end when Jackie fights the tiny but deadly Brad Allan. This is truly one of the great fights of Jackie's career moving at breakneck speed with both opponents flying through the air. Brad Allan also does a triple kick in midair which is bound to impress. So add that into the mix with soon to be mega star Tony Leung literally gorgeous cinematography a nice light hearted tone and you've got one of Jackie's most enjoyable films. It's my wife's personal favourite so does that mean it's a Jackie Chan chick flick?".

And if the title referred to herwell she was.But the comedy the fighting the romance the mysteryall were enjoyable. Jackie Chan's character was quite appealing. Not really as miserable as Bu seemed to think. But Bu brought him out of his misery and we had to wonder would she end up with him or one of the other guys? When I saw this it had a TV14 rating. Totally uncalled for. What violence this movie had was mostly slapstick. Even one of the two serious fights turned slapstick at one point and that was great.Bu's parents were quite appealing too.

Jackie mentioned in the DVD commentary that he hadn't wanted to do the movie because he can't do drama.  I think he sells himself short.  If he ever decides to get away from the stuntwork I think he'll still have a place as an actor alone.  Check out the scene where C.N. and his rival are commiserating near the end of the film.

In retrospect this is a very good movie  and the romantic angle was done really well and in a decent and sweet fashion  no one night stand sex scenes ala the rest of Hollywood  this was much more sincere than that. The guy playing Alan is a tremendous performer and should be given a chance for more starring roles he stole the show from Chan in both scenes.

There is little plot to speak of other than Shu Qi going to Hong Kong because she finds a note in a bottle. The rest is pure rubbish. It is one of those Ernest films where the henchmen all look at each other grab their faces and scream at least 20 times in the movie. It was funny when the 3 Stooges did it back in the 40's but it is no longer even remotely humorous.Just about the only thing I can say about this horrid film is that the female lead is very attractive hence the title. Other than that this picture is a dog. The sparse action scenes have all been done by Jackie Chan no less in many other movies and done considerably better. There is really nothing at all to the love story it is so incredibly contrived that it just comes off as a big joke.Very very poor outing for Jackie Chan.R.".

With no compromise on commercial aspects the movie literally relives the lives of the famine stricken people of southern India under the rule of the British.One can watch this movie simply to enjoy the language and the Tamil slang the people of that age used.At the end of the movie one would have gone through all emotions happiness sadness laughter pain fear pity. Though the story is adapted from 'Eriyum Panikadu' a Tamil translation of the 1969 novel Red Tea by Paul Harris Daniel this film has got a flavor of its own. The narrative style of the Director makes you feel as though you are one of the characters in the movie. The movie actually sucks the audience into it for its entire length leaving the audience much to think about in the end.Any person who enjoyed the movie would want to read the novel any person who has already read the novel will enjoy the movie even more. Coming to the technical aspects the film has already won the National award for Best costume designs. The Camera work is noteworthyspecially in the initial scenes. The background score is descent and the songs go well with the flow of the movie. The lead characters have excelled individually however the rest of casting could have been a little better.All in all Paradesi is a movie to watch a movie to livea movie to learn from..".

	schema:headline " A Period play from the house of Bala";
	schema:reviewBody "Paradesi 2013 Review Joining the genre of adapted screen play Paradesi opens up as an authentic period play. This is a true story adapted from a Tamil novel named Eriyum Panikadu which is the Tamil version of the novel named Red Tea. Bala has given us yet another close to nature realistic story of the natives of Saalur village. The story line time travels back to the year 1930 when the British government basically involved in the business of tea plantation. The entire movie shows how Indians have been brutalized by the British lords. Director Bala has depicted clearly about the slavery treatment and the harassment in all forms may it be to the sexual abuse or the merciless punishments and thrashing the Indian slave employees. Interestingly we also observe how in those days poverty was taken advantage for religious conversion. Director Bala for sure has done tremendous research to showcase this film.After the king maker the director let us see how casting has helped out in this movie. Coming to the lead role by Adharva Murali has shown such matured acting in the role of Raasa allies Otti Poriki. He has lived the role and it shows how he has been moulded by the director. He can now proudly join the Bala stars Band wagon along with Vikram SuryaAarya and Vishal. The lead ladies done by Dhanshika and Vedhika C Kumar both of them have done picture perfect.Dhanshika reminds us of Muthalagu with her commanding base voice tone and Vedhika did perfect on her role but could have maintained her tanned look evenly throughout the movie. Other small 200 characters has lived really and added strong basement to the story. Special mention would be the newly married couple. Dialogues by the Ace Tamil writer Naanjil Naadan were too raw in certain places. BGM has been a definite plus to add the grieving silence in the movie and songs as well by GV. Very nice cinematography to show the period colour on celluloid. The editing was little dragging towards the end. Verdict On the whole get in for a 2hour 5 mins film stripping and showcasing the black pages of Indian history. Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandranbsiva84gmail.com".

Of course labourers were free to leave although those with debts would still need to find a way to pay them off. The idea of night patrols chasing down run aways and mutilating them is pure fantasy.The head planter on the estate was not even played by an Englishman and speaks with some odd AmericanGerman accent. There was little effort to replicate the fashion and costume of the time with him wearing American aviator shades in one scene. Perhaps this film does provide a little insight into the hardships of the Tamil tea pickers and the cinematography is quite delightful throughout but it is too theatrical and too historically inaccurate to appeal to me.".

When Paradesi was announced I was happy but not convinced by the initial trailers but the images were riveting and pulled me to see this film. And was it worth it yes it was. This is a comeback film for Director Bala. Bala has transformed the actors in the film into real life characters. Hats off to Director Bala. He not only made characters out of actors but even pulled out a masterpiece from G.V.Prakash the music directorHis background score and songs were truly amazing. Special credit should also be given to the cinematographer Chezhiyan who has managed to capture all the essential elements for the film.After being responsible for careerdefining roles for actors like Vikram Suriya Vishal and Arya . Bala has also transformed Atharvaa from a boy next door to a mainstream actor who can perform. Both the female leads played by Vedhika and Dhanshika have performed well in the film. The first half of the film has lifelike characters that draw you into their lives with their realistic performances making it fast and crisp while the second half of the film exposes the pain anguish and suffering over and over and makes it tough to sit through . Although there was some cheap relief in the second half given to the audience by the dance master Shivshankar .But an edit of the film to a 90 to 100 minutes would make it watchable without pain.".

	schema:headline " A harrowing account of life in a conquered country";
	schema:reviewBody "P A R A D E S IA Review by Dr Deena PadayacheeNot long ago I read Orwell's perceptive and brilliant Burmese Days. The book had belatedly given me the best insight that I had ever seen about how Empires operate how they destroy the souls of the conquered and how they help the venal to flourish while they eviscerate the most noble few and far between as they are among Homo Sapiens among the conquered. Orwell shows how empires inevitably corrode the spirits of the conquistadors even though since they control the media they might fool themselves and the defeated that what they are doing is moral upright ethical and even religious.There is a movie on circuit at present which should strike a chord with most of my readers as it dramatizes living conditions in rural southern India in the early twentieth century and shows us the challenges faced by workers on a typical Britishowned tea plantation. The poets among you and even some of the rest of you will love the poetry which spices up the exquisite songs and elevates this movie to a higher level so that it becomes more than a simple narrative. The music is haunting and for me absolutely gorgeous. This is a film which I have to see again. It is that good.PARADESI is a subtitled Tamil language film which is a carefully crafted masterpiece set in Britishoccupied Dravidian India. The writerproducer is called Bala. What struck me is that for Bala there are few if any 'noble savages'. The often primitive peasants are as cruel and unfeeling as any plantation manager or pampered lord. The movie centres around a big buffoon Rasa He looks like a laidback subnormal clone of Kumi Naidoo who is the butt of everybody's jokes he is the twit of the village.Amicable despite being violated by just about everybody including the woman who secretly likes him the muscular wretch is like a caricature of India. There is something infinitely tragic and sad about the way this amiable giant allows so much abuse to be heaped upon him.He is a metaphor for most of the planet that was owned by the 'free West' at that time  before the Germans Italians and Japanese were let loose upon them.Then there are the cunning devious sly Indian collaborating class whose existence depends upon their being treacherous traitors spies informers whores and pimps in the rape exploitation and destruction of their own country and its wretched people. They reminded me of a few venal local academics journalists and even writers who cozy up to the ohsoclever white academics in the hope of getting the odd smile here and the crumb there.The plantation manager has his whores among the workers in the tea plantation. The English did something similar to the conquered Scots and other numerically disadvantaged defeated peoples in the British isles and elsewhere.

	onyx:emotionText "P A R A D E S IA Review by Dr Deena PadayacheeNot long ago I read Orwell's perceptive and brilliant Burmese Days. The book had belatedly given me the best insight that I had ever seen about how Empires operate how they destroy the souls of the conquered and how they help the venal to flourish while they eviscerate the most noble few and far between as they are among Homo Sapiens among the conquered. Orwell shows how empires inevitably corrode the spirits of the conquistadors even though since they control the media they might fool themselves and the defeated that what they are doing is moral upright ethical and even religious.There is a movie on circuit at present which should strike a chord with most of my readers as it dramatizes living conditions in rural southern India in the early twentieth century and shows us the challenges faced by workers on a typical Britishowned tea plantation. The poets among you and even some of the rest of you will love the poetry which spices up the exquisite songs and elevates this movie to a higher level so that it becomes more than a simple narrative. The music is haunting and for me absolutely gorgeous. This is a film which I have to see again. It is that good.PARADESI is a subtitled Tamil language film which is a carefully crafted masterpiece set in Britishoccupied Dravidian India. The writerproducer is called Bala. What struck me is that for Bala there are few if any 'noble savages'. The often primitive peasants are as cruel and unfeeling as any plantation manager or pampered lord. The movie centres around a big buffoon Rasa He looks like a laidback subnormal clone of Kumi Naidoo who is the butt of everybody's jokes he is the twit of the village.Amicable despite being violated by just about everybody including the woman who secretly likes him the muscular wretch is like a caricature of India. There is something infinitely tragic and sad about the way this amiable giant allows so much abuse to be heaped upon him.He is a metaphor for most of the planet that was owned by the 'free West' at that time  before the Germans Italians and Japanese were let loose upon them.Then there are the cunning devious sly Indian collaborating class whose existence depends upon their being treacherous traitors spies informers whores and pimps in the rape exploitation and destruction of their own country and its wretched people. They reminded me of a few venal local academics journalists and even writers who cozy up to the ohsoclever white academics in the hope of getting the odd smile here and the crumb there.The plantation manager has his whores among the workers in the tea plantation. The English did something similar to the conquered Scots and other numerically disadvantaged defeated peoples in the British isles and elsewhere. A newly married woman is coveted by the white manager and he decrees that 'she must not have sex with her husband but she must be given to him'.When she resists the white manager's fury is unleashed on a horrible venal labour recruiter the Indian collaboratorpimp has to implore the white Master in the most servile and nauseating way to allow him to 'set matters right'. He will get the married woman to be a whore.What a metaphor about what happens to a conquered country!

If you are fan of mindless cheap movies like Kalakalappu Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya etc stay away from 'Paradesi'. If you are expecting a movie with commercial songs for you to give a reason for smoking please don't bother. After lot of expectations Bala's Paredesi has finally hit the screen on March 15th 2013 and I watched it in AGS cinemas Navalur 1st day  . Like many other Bala fans in theater I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and came out of the theater with heavy heart because of heart wrenching story. To my surprise Bala's 'Paradesi' running time is just 120 minutes unlike other Bala movies. OK lets jump into the review.Story  Bala's Paradesi is based on an English novel Red Tea by Paul Harris Daniel.Story is about the life and struggles of the exploited teaplantation workers during 1930's  40's. And it revolves mostly around the three characters' Atharvaa Murali Vedhika Dhansika including supporting actors Ritwika Uday Karthik Sivasankar Master and many other new faces. This is all the introduction you gonna get from me because this is a no spoilers review.Direction  Bala once again proved why he is the top director in the country and gives us the reason why Bollywood top director like Anurag Kashyap watch him with aw. Like his previous extraordinary works like Sethu Pithamagan and Naan Kaduval Paradesi too strictly stays away from commercial elements. The interval shotwhen the interval wording is displayed and final climax shot before film by Bala words are just mouthwatering visual storytelling to its finest. Not only in direction the master craftsman did wonders in all department including Screenplay Character selection and also production aswell.5 out of 5.Paradesi Atharvaa Murali and RitwikaCast  Atharvaa Murali Vedhika  Dhansika and all other casts did their job to perfection. They delivered their characters clear and grounded as in all other Bala movies. Thanks to Bala's reality treatment and Im pretty sure after watching the movie in big screen you all will thank as well.Music Though G.V.Prakash did a very good job in songs department sometimes I got the feeling his Bgm are overlapping with the scene. Most of the BGM is quite heavy or loud and it distracts the viewers from the scene. Maestro Ilayaraja would have did wonders don't know why Bala opted for G.V.Cinematographer 'Chezhiyan' former assistant of Ace Cameraman 'P C Sriram' worked very closely with director's vision and got the essence of the tea estate and all the actors emotions very well. Some of his previous works were 'Thenmerku Paruvakatru' and 'Magizhchi'.Art Costume and Editing are another plus. You cant point your finger once for any wrong reasons. To my surprise the movie run at a very brisk space thanks to crisp editing.On the whole this is a Must Watch movie and definitely a land mark movie in Tamil Cinema. Congratulations to Director Bala and his team for making a honest film with universally appealing human emotions. Also Congratulation in advance for winning the National Awards.Movie Rating  5 out of 5. Watch it only in theaters.HttpMillionluck.comParadesimoviereviewfirstdayfirstshow".

G.V.P's music was a massive letdown Isaignani's touch was sorely missing. The only minus points would be the rather wooden 2 dimensional characterization of the Britishers and the unnecessary proselytizing song towards the end.

He comes across a friendly Kangani who then follows Rasa back to his village. The Kangani offers a work for the villagers at the British tea plantations at the hillside. He promises them proper accommodation and high wages. Like many of the villagers Rasa signs up with the Kangani hoping he can send home money every month for his ailing grandmother. Both Angamma and his grandmother are sad to watch him go. When Rasa and his villagers finally arrive at the tea plantation things are not as what the Kangani promised.

Paradesi is a professional acting course for Rs.120 provided by a National Award winning director Bala and it's a good platform for the lead cast such as Adharva Danshika and Vedikka who were given their best performance which they can along with good native art and props used in the film. Particularly Adharva's young performance which is unique and his characterization is merged with the script my heartily congratulation to Adharva and Bala. Bala played his role well as a director as well as the producer of the film. In particular the social satire of Christianity and the slaves of British were well scripted in the narration. Unfortunately poor adaptation and screenplay found in the film and the storyline is not so unique compare with other existingtypicalsingle perspectiveIndian cinema! Also the chemistry between GV Prakash and Bala is completely failed to create an impact on audience through out the film narration  its a major drawback for Paradesi. I love the opening title credits it's nice.It's obvious that the first half of the film is crafted with wit  humor along with the supporting neighbors especially the old grand mother who receives audience applause the most opposite to that the 2nd half of Paradesi which is painted with cry crying and more crying. Did audience crying for that? I am not sure about it!!! Still wondering why Bala showing the protagonist as an uncivilizedsocial animal! Did anybody know the answer? please...Paradesi A good fulllength short film!".

	schema:reviewBody "We know about director bala's films. Most of the films will have characters with different appearances and incredible acting. The films concentrate about suffering of a main lead character and people surrounding them and ends with an obvious sad ending. I was disappointed with Avan Ivan and Naan kadavul since everything followed the same plot and i expected more. The actors in his films perform so well that their brilliant acting wasn't supported with a nice script. Bala is so talented as a director and he is obviously one of the bests in Kollywood but he needs to write better scripts. Tamil directors need to adapt novels instead of trying to write their own script. I came to know this Paradesi film was said to be based on a novel Red tea by Paul harris Daniel. i don't know anything about that book but this film still seems more similar to his previous films. The film is all about sufferings of villagers who are tortured to work for British's tea plantations. All the characters have acted very well especially adharva and his role as hero just like Bala's previous films stays in our minds even after minutes after the film is over. The setting environment camera works and BGM selection all top class showing Bala's capability as a director. I like how his film stays out of usual commercial tamil filmmaking style which doesn't have 5 songs 5 fights comedians and punch dialogues. he takes tamil cinema close to Hollywood style and falls short. Paradesi contains many weird scenes especially my favourite part of the film where a new doctor comes to cure the coolies suffering from an unknown disease. Adharva will bring his roommate lady who lives with him on the hut suffering from illness to this doctors hospital. i expected he would cure her. Instead he suggests them to praise the almighty. Next day he and his white girlfriend starts singing and dancing for a Christian song for Christmas which kind of imitates the devotional songs in many of other tamil films where at the end of the song almighty will create a miracle such as curing a person suffering from sickness. But here this is Bala's film devotional Christian song which is nowhere sounding near the ones sang on churches instead very very hilarious ending with.. the patient herself dying! I wouldn't call it controversial but the reality.This film is almost close to be called a masterpiece. But it isn't because lacks something.".

Most visitors and tourists looked right through them but they were all there. Sexual perverts aka chickenhawks Pimps and of course the young kids coming off the buses from the heartland by the hundreds ready to be savaged. The music drug culture attitudes of too many parents and excitement of being a young all combined to make people think they could make it in an area like TS. So very many never made it to adulthood because of the lifestyle drugs beatings and assaults were so common. Those who survived were damaged psychologically as well as physically. Personally I never felt so overwhelmed in my life. While handling one case you just knew there were dozens more happening at the same moment in time. Midnight Cowboy was just one little slice of life on 42nd Street. An excellent movie.".

Midnight Cowboy was just one little slice of life on 42nd Street. An excellent movie.";

If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre Voight and Hoffman are a superb match welldrawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography you'll love this just as much as I did. Schlesinger paints a vivid always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street New York City.The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling. I've seen many ideas including the rapidfire editing the handling of the voiceover flashbacks the drugtrip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakers.The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it's homosexual underpinnings. I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or not.MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave moving film of magnitude influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years so if you haven't seen it you're really missing out on a true American classic.

	schema:reviewBody "It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but 1969's Midnight Cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain.The meandering plot follows Joe Buck a naive young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a studforhire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical sickly petty thief named Ratso Rizzo who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic druginfested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile Rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.In his first major role Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paperthin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean postcollege image from The Graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely outoftowner.The twodisc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc  a lookback documentary After Midnight Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later which features comments from Hellman Hoffman Voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight's screen test Controversy and Acclaim which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director Celebrating Schlesinger.".

I was alone as I had gone for a walk but discovered I was in time for the matine. It was one of the great cinema experiences of my teenage life and left an impression on me that still resonates. After the screening it was freezing and foggy outside and almost dark. I walked to a nearby park in the freezing fog sat on a wet bench and cried and cried until the tears began to freeze too. I wiped them away and went home for dinner. Nobody the wiser except me. Recently I was the film again for the first time in 40 years. I am simply awestruck at the sense of NY 1969 that floods from the screen the sense of the time anywhere in 1969 and the fact that the film is shattering in it's depiction of poverty and friendship in a bleak city. Recently I also went to NY and found that as fascinating for I felt NY was completely safe and totally unlike the squalor seen in their lives in the film. NY today is very pretty and epic and like a fun park. I have enduring respect and admiration for this extraordinary film. I hope you do too. The performances by Voight and Hoffman are award worthy and Joe Buck like Forrest Gump is the sexy flip side of the American Everyman. Directed by a Brit John Schlesinger whose International eye for NY and the tawdry but fascinating life of USA 1969 has allowed this film to be as great as it is only made one other great American films and that is the equally tangible and shocking Hollywood pit of 1937 called DAY OF THE LOCUST. Both films have trailers which every young film maker today should study for a perfect lesson in 'preview' creation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Joe Buck Jon Voight decides he's going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City. The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tuttifruttis. Wideeyed he comes to New York City not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other. In the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends Rico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffmann a homelesslooking man who lives in an apparently condemned building.There isn't much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck's plights in the City but also intercut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semipsychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie Jennifer Salt who was gangraped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money.

In the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends Rico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffmann a homelesslooking man who lives in an apparently condemned building.There isn't much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck's plights in the City but also intercut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semipsychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie Jennifer Salt who was gangraped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money.

From the moment you are introduced to the seemingly scummy character Ratso to Hoffman's infamous im prompt tu line I'm walkin' he'e! right up until his last moments there is an ominous cloud of despair hanging over the heads of our two main characters.The second main character is Joe Buck played by an adorable Jon Voight. How can you NOT think he's adorable when Ratso accuses him of being a fag? Joe's dumbfounded hesitant response was . . . Uh. John Wayne! You think he's a faggot? Voight plays his character almost perfectly too capturing from the getgo the naivety Buck has towards the real world something that was perhaps exacerbated by his tumultuous upbringing shown in sporadic nightmarish flashes throughout the movie.But as an audience we don't just love Joe Buck because of his boyish Texan charm. He also has compassion. He manifests this feeling in awkward confusing and often harmful ways but nevertheless Joe is constantly thinking of his only friend. To give examples each time Joe pays a special visit to 42nd St. he does so to gather mony for both himself and Ratso. He could take the money and run though where to remains a matter of speculation but instead he buys medicine soup etc. for his friend and not himself.Our sympathies are manipulated more in our main characters' favor at the end of the film on the bus ride. Joe being the postadolescent that he is finally gets Rico's name right while monologuing in the middle of a fixed camera shot. At this point the ominous cloud hanging overhead has turned black and we all of a sudden know that Rico will be dead by the time the camera moves over to him despite our deepest hopes that the fixed camera angle is some sort of cruel joke the film DOES seem peppered with pitch black humor after all we try to rationalize.But our rationalizing is vain. Ratso's unmoving eyes and still sweat on his brow say it all. Then we look at his tropical shirt and we try to feel happy for him. We say to ourselves At least he made it back to Miami but even this does no good. The blow is simply too great. There is an unnecessarily long black screen and then the credits roll. Nothing relieves the terrible feeling that everything we're doing is pointless and despondent.Nonetheless this film showcases superb actingdirecting and at least we can use that little boost to appease that depressing feeling. This is definitely a must for any cinephile.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Cowboy 1969This is such a gritty touching story of two ordinary vulnerable young men told with such honesty it's impossible to criticize it taken whole. Midnight Cowboy is a terrific movie. It's terrific because of the two actorsan astonishing Dustin Hoffman still a new name in Hollywood but already famous from The Graduate in 1967. And an equally astonishing Jon Voight making his first large role in a movie. Each is a type of struggling man living on the fringe of New York barely surviving in a boarded up building extreme but never a caricature. They gel as a pair helping each other but with a bit of reluctance because neither wants to quite admit they need help.It's terrific further because of the filming with lots of available light magic in dingy places. The cinematographer Adam Holender is remarkably making his first film here though that might explain the freshness to a lot of the filming. There is in particular a lot of long lens telephoto shooting between more intimate scenes showing layers of people and isolating the star in a moving world a difficult thing to do with good focus. It's also terrific for the writing not just for the story but for the dialog. It strikes so subtly to some truth you don't quite expect even though it's simple and almost obvious. The screenplay won an Oscar as did the movie Best Picture and director John Schlessinger Best Director. It's worth noting that Schlessinger is a British director with some very tightly conceived movies already under his belt including the fabulous Darling and here he seems to make New York as familiar as if he'd grown up here. Along those lines Voight playing the naive cowboy to a perfect pitch is a native New Yorker. And Hoffman though familiar with the city is an L.A. kid.Where does the movie run into trouble? Why isn't it in the top ten of all time? I think it might boil down to three kinds of inserts into flawless the main narrative. The first is a series of flashbacks that in various ways try to explain or fill in the psychological background of Voight's character. As if it needs explaining. Or if it does benefit us all to know how he got to his beautiful troubled state maybe there is something shocking and sensational about the inserts as effective as they are on their own nightmarish terms.A second insert is a series of short sunny daydreams Hoffman's character has envisioning life in Florida in the sun. It's comic relief and it mostly works but there are cracks there. Finally there is a section of the actual narrative where the two men go to a party they've been invited to for spurious reasons weird luck mostly. It's too obviously an excuse to film a scene in a drugaddled Warholesque party. The hosts are effete artist types who want to film some strange New Yorkers out of context and so we see the film film these filmmakers and so on. A great scene but weirdly out of place.But all of his is to be taken in stride as the meat of the story kicks back in each time. And here with a melancholy soundtrack you will be moved and entranced. Amazing stuff. Brave and a lesson in how a film can be adventurous and heartfelt and not painfully slick all at once. And succeed artistically and commercially.".

	schema:reviewBody "I sat down to watch Midnight Cowboy thinking it would be another overrated '60s'70s movie. Some of my favorite films come from the '70s in the same vein as Midnight Cowboy Taxi Driver Mean Streets Panic in Needle Park etc. but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking  unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today. I sort of feel this way about Easy Rider. Although it too is one of my favorites.So I didn't expect much from Midnight Cowboy but got a lot back. It's a touching story wellmade and welltold with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman as Enrico Ratso Rizzo gives one of his best  it's a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks  maybe because of the LennySimpsons connection but Hoffman is entirely convincing. Half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the secondbilled Jon Voight as Joe Buck the cowboy who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named Ratso  who offers to become Joe's manager for a certain percentage of profits.The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long. Some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because as it's been said in Easy Riders Raging Bulls the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material going on too long examining charactersscenesetc. that aren't important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party  it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug odysseys in Easy Rider and really harms its flow because it's not needed.Other than that Midnight Cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content Midnight Cowboy is a truly great motion picture an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late '60searly '70s. It's a depressing movie yes and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etc....but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long time.Highly recommended. One of the best films of the '70s. It was technically released in late 1969 but I'd still categorize it as a 1970s film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar being the first  and only  Xrated motion picture to do so. It was later rerated R on appeal.4.55".

	schema:reviewBody "The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic's Top 100. For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie indeed I had to look hard to find a copy I got the DVD version for about halfprice. Surprisingly it was only rated M15 the uncut version.I doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so I'll make it brief.This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I've seen partly because of the use of montages artistic filming very arthouse and the unusual theme. There are many things in the film I still don't understand I've seen it twice and it makes for an emotionally confusing film.The filming and acting were very good and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck a 'cowboy' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled conman Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and of course they become friends going through the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.I felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the start.I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes. The deprivation of humanity shown by the darkness of the city streets the breakingdown tenements. Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law a conman giggolo.etc yet you can't help liking them. Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film.I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very groundbreaking for its period. At the time And even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite arthouse. At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up.On a personal level I must say I quite liked the film. The imagery conveyed a dreamlike quality. I particularly liked the scene at the party the music images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking not really my style of movie in thrills. This is a film to be savoured and appreciated rather than a cheap thrills action flick.Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happygolucky young stud who suppresses his darker memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso although I fail to see where they have got the idea from. The theme of homosexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man but it has little to do with the main story.Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do. While it has a simple sentimental story to it disguised by a hard edge the beauty of the film is in the strange often psychedelic sequences.".

	onyx:emotionText "The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic's Top 100. For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie indeed I had to look hard to find a copy I got the DVD version for about halfprice. Surprisingly it was only rated M15 the uncut version.I doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so I'll make it brief.This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I've seen partly because of the use of montages artistic filming very arthouse and the unusual theme. There are many things in the film I still don't understand I've seen it twice and it makes for an emotionally confusing film.The filming and acting were very good and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck a 'cowboy' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled conman Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and of course they become friends going through the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.I felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the start.I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes. The deprivation of humanity shown by the darkness of the city streets the breakingdown tenements. Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law a conman giggolo.etc yet you can't help liking them. Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film.I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very groundbreaking for its period. At the time And even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite arthouse. At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up.On a personal level I must say I quite liked the film. The imagery conveyed a dreamlike quality. I particularly liked the scene at the party the music images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking not really my style of movie in thrills. This is a film to be savoured and appreciated rather than a cheap thrills action flick.Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happygolucky young stud who suppresses his darker memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso although I fail to see where they have got the idea from. The theme of homosexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man but it has little to do with the main story.Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do.

The direction and cinematography were highly unusual for that time and the use of montages and cuts and the trippy shots of the Warholesque party made the film even more disorienting. The film never sags and holds your attention throughout and the through line of the plot  the friendship between Rizzo and Joe Buck  has about as much emotional impact as anything else I've ever seen. Equally of interest is the psychological content of the flashbacks that show how Joe became the way he is.

	schema:reviewBody "'Everybody's talking at me I don't hear a word they're sayin' only the echoes of my mind ' well hearing these beautiful words echoed something very deep in mine. A few movies have been gifted with a song that captures their spirit to the point we can't tell which one defines the other elevating themselves to mirror more universal feelings. Midnight Cowboy Best Picture winner of 1969 is one of them.Harry Nillson's poetry responds to the torment of a society in both urban and mental metamorphosis torn between the past's heritage and the future's uncertainty between America's deepest roots  God Family Community Progress and an exhilarating fresh air of revolt and antiestablishment. In 1969 postindustrial societies were divided into a simplistic but no less significant dichotomy  the Old and the New order everything was defined by its ability to move on or to stay. The movie is about a man who's definitely moving quitting a lousy job of dishwasher in a Texan diner to go to New York City some sort of reversal conquest of the West. Joe Buck is his name. Joe has every reason to be selfconfident he's tall strong young healthy blonde not a real cowboy but one hell of a stud is his motto. New York resonates in his inexperienced mind like 'New World'. The opening farewell to the hometown conveys an inspirational freedom of spirit and movements incarnated by Joe's smile and constantly positive attitude. He can have all the chicks but he's more interested in old and rich ladies for hustling is the job he wants to do and for something unconsciously attracts him to older ladies. Maybe deep in his heart Joe is still a little child in quest of a strong motherly figure this sweet and innate innocence is even highlighted when he plays peekaboo with a little girl in the bus leading to New York. Joe realizes the gap between the world he wants to penetrate and his true nature and this is the source of his discomfort.Midnight Cowboy is punctuated with regular fastpaced flashbacks developing Joe's background story. Joe was raised by his grandmother Sally in an overly loving intimacy and one obscure episode involves a disturbing event that has probably perverted his approach to sex. He's moving but something keeps him connected to a nostalgic vision of childhood. From Joe's point of view nothing is wrong in his business he's only taking his share of the American Dream with what is at hands. But from our perspective he's simply lost the repeated first line Where's that Joe Buck? taking its full meaning.Jon Voight performance's perfectly embodies the excess of an idealism so childish it flirts with naivety and can only foreshadow great deceptions. After a few days in the racket Joe loses more than he wins money the height of irony is reached when he even gives one client 20 after she burst out to tears feeling insulted after Joe asked for money. Victim of his good nature again Joe will be disillusioned by a smalltime punk named Rico Rizzo aka 'Ratso'. For 20 Joe is sent to a supposedly future manager who'll reveal himself to be a pervert zealot asking Joe to get on his knees ... so they can pray the Lord. Besides the flashbacks the editing excels in tracing some interestingly subversive parallels. In one audacious scene for example  frenetic movements in bed activate TV channels with a remote control and a succession of pointless programs and manipulative ads shows on screen.TV appears like the Pandora box hiding the sad realities of the consumer society. Sex is part of this degeneracy where sacred values religion and family have been totally corrupted. And from the ambiguity of the on your knees line resurrects Joe's traumatic experience when he was baptized. The movie depicts religion in an incredibly revolutionary boldness as a rape soul. Everything is abuse consumption from the ultrarealistic bold and psychedelically dizzying direction of John Schelsinger winner of the best Director Oscar. A spiritless society where money urbanism sex and bigotry mix in a repulsive nocturnal orgy creating more frustration loneliness and perversity from a mother running a fake mouse around hers son's face to some old broads killing their loneliness by treating their dogs like human beings. For Joe who has no religion and no money the salvation will come from the most precious thing that could have enriched his life  a friendship.And this is where Midnight Cowboy emerges from the dirt and becomes one of the most classic and poignant friendship stories between two men whose backs are put in the wall by a cynical society. The image in the poster shows them as misfits but look at them closely and see how they complete each other one has the looks the youth the health and the strength but is like a child the other is streetwise knows the ropes he's crippled unhealthy and cruelly lacks in appearance but he's got pride. The iconic I'm walkin' here speaks to many lonely people rejected by society. Dustin Hoffman in a 180 degree turn from his previous role as The Graduate demonstrates here his incredible versatility. The friendship between Razzo and Joe will strengthen them in their daily struggles to overcome the most nightmarish aspects of New York City an alienating town whose depressing mood is incarnated by John Barry's iconic harmonica sound.Joe and Razzo ultimately appear as the only persons we can identify with victims of a ultraindividualistic urban world they don't belong to. In reaction all they have is to dream of running on the beach having fun together in other words applying the magic of Harry Nillson's song and 'going where the sun keeps shining' Whether they'll succeed or not is not relevant but no matter how hard they're freezing their asses in New York sun keeps shining in their hearts ...".

On the arrival he is lured by the crippled crook Enrico Salvatore Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman that takes some money from him. Soon Joe is broken and homeless without any client or money and he meets Ratso again on the streets that invites him to move to his apartment in a derelict building.

Joe and Ratso develop a friendship and Joe decides to go with his friend to Florida as soon as he gets the necessary money. Midnight Cowboy is a depressing tale of friendship and shattered dreams of losers. In flashbacks the viewer sees that Joe is raised by his grandmother that neglects him and is raped with his girlfriend who was actually a slut by a gang when he is a teenager. Further his grandmother's boyfriends are cowboys and he has very limited education. Therefore he has a wrong concept of women and love and believes that he will be a sensation with mature women in New York. Ratso is the son of an Italian immigrant that works as a shoeshiner and has had problems with his lungs for a long time. These two needy characters teamup to survive on the streets of New York and become better persons through their friendship. John Schlesinger has made a stunning classic that has not aged with an unpleasant story using magnificent screenplay and outstanding cast led by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight.

	schema:headline " Brilliant counterculture film";
	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Cowboy opens with a run down Drive In theater with the voiceover of the main character Joe Buck Jon Voight singing in the shower. He is singing a cowboy song the very thing he strives to be. Joe picks up his humdrum life living in Texas and moves it to New York City with the dream of lots of women and even more money. He dresses as the epitome of the cowboy but in a cartoonish fashion not even his friends take him seriously. He begins his journey on the bus to NYC and we can quickly see how diluted Joe is through his interactions with the other passengers. This is primarily a story of Joe's realization of the harsh realities of the real world.He starts off as a very nave southerner thinking he can make it in NYC just on his good looks. He has no other reason to think otherwise as they proved helpful in the past we learn this from the many flashbacks he has. In the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical. They are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance as they are they are coming out of his past. However as Joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of NYC we see more of his past which is no longer whimsical but gritty filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events. This is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted and her being raped. In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick. This mirrors the way in which Joe himself is falling apart the naivet that he once carried is falling off of him. He and Ratso Dustin Hoffman are living in squalor and barely able to get food to eat Joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks that there is a gritty underbelly of New York that he didn't envision. His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.Ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to Joe but in an opposite way Ratso is Joe's foil. Joe is a handsome strong man who for the most part has a good outward appearance. Ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to Joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite. He is short dark and always coated with a sheen of sweat. He understands how the world works that it is unforgiving and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did. They are living in the same world the same apartment even but they understand things on a completely different level.The theme of alienation one that is common of this era is very apparent in this film. Neither Joe nor Ratso fit into the culture surrounding them. Joe feels trapped in Texas and moves to NYC where he is still very much an outsider. Ratso living in the cold of NYC wishes to move to sunny Florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life. Even though this is his ideal in the fantasy we get from Ratso's perspective it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society. In said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him he is yet again an outsider alienated from society.It is not until the end that the gap between Joe and Ratso begins to narrow. Joe resorts to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for Florida for himself and Ratso. On the journey we see Joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film. He is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to Florida for vacation. He dresses Ratso the same way he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering but it is to no avail. Upon Ratso's death on the bus their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders. Even in this new culture they have entered they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film. Despite the Ratso's death and Joe's continued alienation the film ends with the hope that Joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in NYC. Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society and alienation with stellar performances by both Voight and Hoffman.".

This is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted and her being raped. In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick. This mirrors the way in which Joe himself is falling apart the naivet that he once carried is falling off of him. He and Ratso Dustin Hoffman are living in squalor and barely able to get food to eat Joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks that there is a gritty underbelly of New York that he didn't envision. His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.Ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to Joe but in an opposite way Ratso is Joe's foil. Joe is a handsome strong man who for the most part has a good outward appearance. Ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to Joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite. He is short dark and always coated with a sheen of sweat. He understands how the world works that it is unforgiving and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did. They are living in the same world the same apartment even but they understand things on a completely different level.The theme of alienation one that is common of this era is very apparent in this film. Neither Joe nor Ratso fit into the culture surrounding them. Joe feels trapped in Texas and moves to NYC where he is still very much an outsider. Ratso living in the cold of NYC wishes to move to sunny Florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life. Even though this is his ideal in the fantasy we get from Ratso's perspective it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society. In said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him he is yet again an outsider alienated from society.It is not until the end that the gap between Joe and Ratso begins to narrow. Joe resorts to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for Florida for himself and Ratso. On the journey we see Joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film. He is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to Florida for vacation. He dresses Ratso the same way he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering but it is to no avail. Upon Ratso's death on the bus their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders. Even in this new culture they have entered they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film. Despite the Ratso's death and Joe's continued alienation the film ends with the hope that Joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in NYC. Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society and alienation with stellar performances by both Voight and Hoffman.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let's just take a moment and evaluate the academy award winners for 1968 and 1969!! In 1968 Oliver which was an innocuous musical won for best picture. 1968 was a year of absolute tumultuousness.. Robert Kennedy was assassinated Martin Luther King was assassinated and there were riots on the streets of America from coast to coast on an ephemeral basis. Upheaval at the Democratic convention was an assertive rejection of the structured status quo by this nation's hegemony and our protracted involvement in Vietnam was emerging as a volatile avenue for an utterly pandemic disdain!! So!! what movie won for best picture in 1969? Midnight Cowboy.... Does this tell you anything? The 180 degree polarization of these two movies could not be anymore emphatic it is almost as if the occurrences of 1968 had a profound impact on the choice for best picture in 1969!! Such a radical difference in Academy Award winning pictures in just one year gave a crystal clear indication of how the social transition in America was indelibly ubiquitous!! Hence the radicalism of the 1960's was influencing virtually everything!! Midnight Cowboy is a film which depicts the sordid sexual behavior which was pertinent to the decaying American moral value system which erupted during the 1960's!! Such depraved and detailed immorality had never been illustrated on the silver screen before!! Jon Voight is tremendous in this film as he engages in precarious sexual theatrics which were the antithesis of his conservative upbringing as a means of supporting himself. What was so demoralizing about this whole endeavor is that supporting himself with this nefarious occupation completely backfired!! Dustin Hoffman's character goes beyond desperate and hopeless his situation is tailor made for society to shut the door on him and pretend that he simply does not exist... New York City is a cosmopolitan venue which has the formidable potential to effortlessly ostracize and socially obliterate their victims of sub level poverty!! The characters Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman play become metaphorically decimated by New York City's cavalier imperviousness.. This film serves as a five alarm fire wake up call for Americans to be aware of the actual United States they live in as opposed to the United States that is masqueraded around in front of Americans on the Fourth of July!! Significantly prescient for the prevailing paradigm for movies made during this era the film Midnight Cowboy presents a circumstantial set of tragedies which will not conquer adversity.. All parties concerned will go from bad to worse a scenario which directors were reluctant to bring to the American moviegoer's attention back in the late sixties!! John Schlesinger directs this film He is also known for directing films such as Darling Marathon Man and Falcon and the Snowman to name but a few he does an amazing job directing Midnight Cowboy!! Schlesinger won for best director with this picture in 1969! Dustin Hoffman is definitely in a category all by himself when it comes to his acting genius!! The theme song Everbody's Talking by Harry Nilsson made its debut in tandem with this movie!! In a nutshell Midnight Cowboy was a cunningly relevant tenet for admonishing societal despondence. This film was incredibly poignant as it denounces a bevy of socially callous philosophies in America!! Fabulous film!! One of my top fifty!! I recommend to everybody that they see this movie!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Midnight Cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic. You know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song 'Everybody's Talking' starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck naked and in the shower. We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him? This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary. As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish Anaconda is a source of pleasure.The film became famous and infamous almost overnight. It was a crowdpleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably 'real' it was the tailend of the sixties and all the characters rang true. It was also the first 'X' rated film to win the Oscar as the year's Best Picture. Adapted brilliantly by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first mainstream commercial American movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drugtaking in a matteroffact manner. Everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically. Voight's Joe Buck is an innocent abroad a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker. But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little conman called 'Ratso' Rizzo Dustin Hoffman fresh from The Graduate and he's a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipedream.Essentially it's a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows. Both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other Voight with his physical prowess Hoffman with his streetwise savvy. They are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others. Though 'straight' Voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself. The whole film posits a strangely 'Christian' attitude.It's also magnificently acted. While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles as well as John McGiver Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as sundry customers and hangerson beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while John Schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eyeview of the American underbelly without rancor and without criticism. On second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all.".

We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances.

Besides Mae and her precode innuendos it has Cary Grant's starmaking performance though Grant always disliked West's claim that she discovered him. It's the film that saved Paramount from bankruptcy. It's one of the films that brought on the code. Most interesting to me is the audiences loved it! These audiences would very soon like the next year be deprived of the sexual double entendre and morality found in this film. Rather than the early audiences being naive and unsophisticated it was the banning of certain language and situations in film that gave rise to the idea of a false world that once there were no shades of gray all unmarried women were virgins the bad guy always lost and no bad deed goes unpunished.She Done Him Wrong is a great chance to see a very young and handsome Gilbert Roland and Noah Berry Sr. whose son really resembled him in early film roles.An amazing artifact some hilarious lines and most of all  Mae.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mae West was a veteran of burlesque vaudeville and the Broadway stage by the time she made her first film in 1932 at the age of 39.  She Done Him Wrong' was her second film and her first starring role in an adaptation of her smash Broadway hit Diamond Lil'.  It was a play that West had written herself and it played to packed houses on Broadway for years.  This film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture and made Cary Grant into an instant star.  Mae went on to write nine of the fourteen screenplays for films in which she was to star.  Thus all those great quotes we've heard that are attributed to her were not only said by her but written by her as well.  By 1935 she was the most highly paid woman in America.  To this day she remains one of the female stars most often imitated by female impersonators.This film is among her best.  It is full of the bawdy double entendre that became her trademark.  She was the queen of sexual innuendo and suggestive dialogue and many of her lines have become part of Americana e.g. Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?'  And A hard man is good to find.'  And of course Come up and see me sometime.'The plot of this film is simplistic and it is clearly a vehicle for her enormous talent leading up to the now famous proposal by Cary Grant at the end of the film.  Mae commands every frame of the film with her incomparable combination of sex appeal and ribald humor.  Her sense of comic timing is impeccable making the funny lines she writes that much more hilarious by the snide way in which she delivers them.Before this film Cary Grant had appeared in half a dozen films and was building a reputation as a solid actor.  However none of his early films gave him the exposure that this film did due to its wild popularity at the time.  West handpicked him for the part saying that he combined virility with the bearing of a gentleman.  She wanted someone who would epitomize the now famous line Hello warm dark and handsome.'  Though his role in this film is minor compared to West's it made him a household name and a bankable star.This classic film is a piece of film history that shouldn't be missed.  I rated it a 1010.  It is among Mae West's best moments.  I highly recommend it.".

Though his role in this film is minor compared to West's it made him a household name and a bankable star.This classic film is a piece of film history that shouldn't be missed.  I rated it a 1010.  It is among Mae West's best moments.  I highly recommend it.";

It was adapted from Mae West's Broadway hit Diamond Lil and coupled with West's other 1933 hit I'm No Angel saved Paramount from bankruptcy.  The film was so loved by audiences that midnight showings were needed to accommodate the crowds and it was so lurid that seven countries banned the film altogether.  It was nominated for the best picture of 1933 and was West's favorite of all her twelve films.  The film introduced the famed line although it's uttered slightly different in the movie Come up and see me sometime.  Some of Mae's funniest work is here and she sings three great tunes.  Edith Head did all the costumes and Lowell Sherman directed.  Modern times have dulled the bluntness of this film but be assured it was an eyepopper in 1933.".

The script is jampacked with some of West's most famous lines including the memorable Come up'n see me sometime. I'm home every evenin' and You can be had. West throws her lines with style aplomb enough innuendo to make a censor cringe and considerable humorbut somewhat surprisingly the movie is not really a comedy.SHE DONE HIM WRONG is a hardknocks tale of Bowery bruisers who dance attendance upon the 'Lady Lou' and often resort to crime to keep her dripping in the diamonds she prizes above all else. But although she has one lover already locked up in jail another one mixed up in the white slavery rackets and still a third waiting to step into the gap the Lady Lou is more interested in seducing missionary Cary Grant... only to find him less interested in her body than her soul a circumstance that prompts West to utter one of the most howdidthatgetpastthecensors lines in 1930s cinema Maybe I ain't got no soul. This is a surprisingly tough little movie and in addition to West's zinging lines and occasional musical numbers SHE DONE HIM WRONG also offers a glimpse at a very young and still slightly wooden Cary Grant it also has an ensemble cast that plays in a very enjoyable grand manner truly first rate production values all the way and A surprisingly brisk running time. West did funnier films than this but the mix of her sharp wit and the rough story is particularly memorable. This is where the fire started really started and I recommend it very strongly.Gary F.

Although not pretty even by the standards of the day and much less so by today's standards she commands every man's attention by her very presence.  Cary Grant flashes star quality in each of his scenes as the ideal foil to West.  Filled with clever double entendres and disarmingly bawdy situations She Done Him Wrong is every thing a period comedy should aspire to be and more.

	schema:reviewBody "Set mostly in a bawdy saloondance hall in NYC during the 1890s this film is a showcase for the talents of Mae West. She plays Lady Lou a selfconfident sassy singer with a quick wit who entertains customers with songs that have a Blues theme and were popular in vaudeville.In this role buxom Mae West is at her best. She struts her stuff she wears tons of diamonds she smiles in a slightly mischievous way she rolls her eyes and she speaks in a voice that is more than a little nasal. Her costumes are glamorous and flamboyant. In short she presents an onscreen image that is wonderfully ... unique.The film's story is thin and largely irrelevant. It involves the people around Lady Lou some of whom are schemers and cheats. Implicit sexual references in the dialogue and the character of Lady Lou led the National Legion of Decency to push down our throats the Production Code a wretched policy device that censored cinematic content for some thirty years thereafter.If I have a complaint with this film it is that the story is too serious. Mae West is placed in scenes that allow her merely to recite dialogue. She is less an actress than a singer and onstage performer. I would have preferred a more lighthearted musical theme to play up her musical talents.And so for me the best parts of this film are the musical numbers few though they may be. Mae West sings Frankie And Johnny and a couple of other songs. One of my favorite sequences occurs about midway through the film. In what appears to be an authentically designed music hall set an Irish tenor with a big mustache sings Silver Threads Among The Gold a musical tearjerker popular with barbershop quartets of that era. The song's sad theme prompts a man in the audience literally to cry in his beer. Gas lights point upward to the stage. And behind the singing tenor a curtain sways back and forth with product signs that read Old Whiskey Dijon Burgundy among others. It's a sequence that is straight out of vaudeville. Marvelous!She Done Him Wrong is a film whose story almost gets in the way of the main character played by a legendary talent. The film is worth watching more than once but only to see marvelous Mae West and to listen to those wonderful songs from the bygone days of vaudeville.".

The story is interesting the characters are well developed and though you might have been expecting fluff you actually end up caring about what happens. West carries the picture as Lou the beautiful nightclub singer and object of every man's desire. Lou is unlike any other female character put non screen up to this point. She is sexy funny brave and blunt. She never relies on a male hero to show up and save the day no matter what kind of trouble she gets into. The rest of the cast is decent but nothing special. That includes Cary Grant who still had a long way to go. West makes them all look good though. That's real talent.".

	schema:reviewBody "SHE DONE HIM WRONG Paramount 1933 directed by Lowell Sherman offers Mae West her first starring feature role following a minor supporting presence in her debut film NIGHT AFTER NIGHT 1932 starring George Raft and Constance Cummings. In what became something of a screen test for her West obviously shined with her scenes but now the question was could she carry an entire movie on her own merits? Sources say that SHE DONE HIM WRONG did just that. Aside from elevating Mae West to star status and becoming the motion picture reportedly responsible in saving Paramount from bankruptcy it became the one and only Mae West movie to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. Aside from Mae West there's the presence of a very young Cary Grant early in his career and quickly on the rise. His name alone on the marque would be more the reason to see this film today but back then Mae West was all that was needed for theaters to sell tickets and guaranteeing instant success. Following the opening cast and credits with the underscoring to a popular oldtime hit Frankie and Johnny the introduction sets the pattern to the time frame to the story which reads The Gay Nineties When they did such things on the Bowery. A lusty brawling florid decade when there were handlebars on lip and wheel  and legs were confidential. Based on the 1928 play Diamond Lil written and starring West herself this reproduction from stage to screen of course had its alterations but beautifully captures the flavor of the Gay Nineties from background sets to authentic hair styles and costumes the latter compliments of designer Edith Head. As with many stage plays the opening devotes itself to supporting players and plot development before West as Lady Lou makes her star introduction scene riding a horse and buggy snubbing the women who look down at her but greeting the men who look up to her as she passes by. After she's greeted by a woman telling her what a fine woman she is Lou quips I'm the finest woman who ever walked the streets. This alone sets the pace to Lady Lou's personality popular with men regardless of age and background and one who not only has been around but still gets around. As the plot which is slight Lady Lou is employed at Gus Jordan's Noah Beery caf. Chick Clark Owen Moore a man who is crazy about her is serving time in prison thanks to villain Dan Flynn David Landau who had framed him for a crime so to have Lou for himself. In spite of having so many gentlemen friends her true love happens to be expensive jewelry especially diamonds usually supplied by her various casual acquaintances. Lou meets Serge Steinieff Gilbert Roland a protg of Russian Rita Rafaela Ottiano but of course allows him to get familiar with her especially. Next door to Jordan's Cafe is a mission house run by Captain Cummings Cary Grant whom Lou takes an interest in but cannot get him to resist her advances. After Chick escapes prison he comes for Lou only to find that she not only is carrying on with other men but cares nothing for him. Learning an undercover investigator called The Hawk whose identity is unknown is after Gus Jordan's counterfeit racket Lou plots on getting rid of Chick by placing him in a trap so he would get caught and arrested leading to a couple of murders in the process.The shortest of all Mae West movies SHE DONE HIM WRONG moves at a swift pace. Musical interludes with tunes from the Gay Nineties era are as with the film itself short and hot. Songs featured include Silver Threads Among the Gold male vocalist unknown Daisy and Lady Lou is Here sung by female chorus I Wonder Where My Easy Rider's Gone I Like a Guy What Takes His Time new score by Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger and Frankie and Johnny the final three sung by Mae West. Others in supporting cast include Dewey Robinson Fuzzy Knight Grace LaRue Tom Kennedy Arthur Housman and Robert E. Homans.Aside from some snappy dialog recited by West herself About the nude painting hanging in the saloon Yeah I gotta admit that is a flash but I do wish Gus hadn't hung it over the free lunch When women go wrong men go right after them she tells a troubled girl Rochelle Hudson when asked if she'd ever met a man who made her happy she says Sure. Lots of times or asking Cummings Grant to come up and see her instead of the misquote of Come up and see me some time there's enough ingredients to make this more of a verbal comedy than anything else. With drama being more dominant West goes through her usual channels with some memorable scenes particularly her fight to the finish with Russian Rita Rafaela Ottiano. Cary Grant who is not present at great length shines with his memorable scene Grant You bad girl. West You'll find out.SHE DONE HIM WRONG became the first of the Mae WestParamount features to be distributed on video cassette. Because of its reputation as Mae West's personal favorite favorites it was voted by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 greatest screen comedies. Other than being frequently broadcast on commercial television decades ago SHE DONE HIM WRONG turned up on various cable stations including the Movie Channel 1991 and Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere May 24 2001. However it stands today SHE DONE HIM WRONG remains a classic little film that succeeds solely on Mae West herself and by those who best appreciate her style of humor which pokes fun of sex and herself without being on the offensive. 12".

One of the great cinematic boundary pushers West is obviously enjoying herself tremendously in this period piece as she wins the heart of every male in the vicinity. The secret of her success was that she took her art sex very seriously but never herself. She was quite willing to become a selfparody if it made her modern' ideas of sensuality more acceptable. She perhaps did not foresee the immediate results  the iron thumb of the newly enforced Production Code would descend heavily on her movie career in 1934 making only her first few films true representations of her spirit.While West dominates the proceedings it is important not to overlook the film's other players. Beefy Noah Beery gives one of his typically fine performances as the saloon owner  crime boss who is Mae's temporary lover Owen Moore in a very small role is excellent as a criminal driven crazy by his jealousy for Mae's affections. Italian character actress Rafaela Ottiano scores as a fierce Russian white slaver involved in Beery's nefarious plots. As Mae's maid the wonderful Louise Beavers is able to steal a few scenes even from West.Pretty Rochelle Hudson appears as a desperate young woman betrayed by Ottiano  Beery. Dewey Robinson has one of his better roles as a big lug who is devoted to West. W. C. Fields' frequent sidekick Tammany Young can be spotted as a saloon patron and that's Fuzzy Knight as the jaded piano player.Cary Grant as a Salvation Army officer and Gilbert Roland as Ottiano's kept man both have very little to do except act as handsome foils to some of Mae's best oneliners. Both do come up  see her sometime' but it should be noted that Roland is the only male in the supporting cast who elicits anything approaching true happy excitement from Mae with his gift of diamonds. Grant's bestowal of a rather paltry ring in the film's final moments doesn't get nearly as much of a reaction.Movie mavens will recognize silent screen comic Heinie Conklin as a street sweeper Arthur Housman as an inebriate  Mary Gordon as a cleaning lady all uncredited.Mae West's attitude towards sexuality  forthright unashamed and in control  could be perfectly summed up in her three solo songs I Wonder Where My Easy Rider's Gone A Guy What Takes His Time and Frankie  Johnnie. Coupled with her obvious talent it is hardly a surprise that she became a Hollywood legend. What is not so often acknowledged is the high price she paid for her celebrity. Keeping up the facade of being the supreme Love Goddess for 60 years was not easy to do. Trapped by her fame Mae was unable to live a normal life. She never experienced the wondrous joys of motherhood true emotional contentment would not be found in an endless string of libidinous conquests and she had to increasingly fight back the relentless demands of Time on her body. In the end ancient  enfeebled even old age was not a comfort to her. The only release from her selfimposed imprisonment was death which finally arrived in November of 1980.".

Mae sings a few songs but they're terrible. Her voice or lack thereof is the pits. Obviously she has a lot of fans so this will hold more appeal for them than it did for me.

And since 1931 this play revolving around a prostitute and a Salvation Army officer who is really an undercover detective was on Will Hays' black list of 'restricted' plays  which meant plays that were by no means to be turned into a movie...And yet right after the Paramount bosses had finally made the decision to invite her to start a film career in Night after Night alongside her old friend George Raft they DID decide to make Diamond Lil a movie! Without even bothering too much with making changes to the plot only making Mae a singer instead of a prostitute and toning down a little the VERY obvious sexuality of the play they shot it as She Done Him Wrong  with the famous tale of course that Mae still looking for a costar stumbled upon young and still unknown Cary Grant at the parking lot and told her producer decidedly If he can talk I'll take him!...And so we find ourselves in the 'Gay Nineties' Mae's favorite era in a rather shady saloon when her boyfriend whom she visits in jail asks her what she's doing she answers Singin' at Gus Jordan's!  and adds immediately It ain't what you think!... where Mae now called 'Lou' instead of 'Lil' clad in shiny sparkling tightfitting dresses croons her risqu songs and is the star of the show and of course always surrounded by a whole bunch of men...

And although in the further course of the movie things finally take a more or less 'right' turn with all the bad guys of the saloon gang ending up in jail and Lou in a carriage with her detective who in fact DOES have something of a Salvation Army officer in him he makes Lou understand that she HAS got a soul in contrast to all those diamonds! with a modest engagement ring instead of all her huge diamond rings on the third finger of her left hand  this must have been something like a 'last straw' for Will Hays who'd been trying to make Hollywood films more decent in order not to 'corrupt' the average American cinemagoer's character and especially lately raging with the impudence of movies like The Maltese Falcon Baby Face and Of Human Bondage The Production Code a kind of Hays' 'Ten Commandments' on film morale HAD to be enforced.Mae West managed to push through another one of her great sex comedies before the Production Code was finally REALLY enforced I'm No Angel  in my opinion in some ways especially concerning the clothing even more daring than She Done Him Wrong but one thing's for sure they're both among THE great preCode classics today a part of film history... and even 80 years later still JUST as entertaining as ever!!".

Basically everything and everybody hovers around the busty Ms. West who warbles songs like a siren luring men to their demise. Reportedly the peroxideblondBrooklynborn bombshell had to be sewn into her lavish costumes bedecked with ornate jewelry. Men swoon for the opportunity to kiss the hand of Lady Lou and some who've been locked up in prison let their jealous rage drive them to escape so they can be near her. Meanwhile skulduggery of the worst sort white slavery and counterfeiting takes place in the saloons as well as streets of the Bowery while an clandestine Federal investigator known only as the Hawk quietly amasses evidence behind the scenes.Lady Lou Mae West of Night After Nightsings in Gus Jordan's saloon but she has no idea her benefactor is partners with Russian Rita in the white slavery racket as well as counterfeiting. He has to do so that he can keep Lou in diamonds. As far as Lou is concerned diamonds are a girl's best friend and she wants lots of friends. Next door to Gus' bar is a Salvation Armystyle mission run by Captain Cummings Cary Grant of Blond Venus who attracts Lou's eye. She asks him repeatedly to come up and visit. This scene alone tells you She Done Him Wrong was a chick flick for the 1930s. Gus Noah Beery Sr. of Riders of the Purple Sage doesn't have the slightest clue Cummings might pose more of a threat to his underworld empire than he does trying to reform Gus' customers. Later Lou's former boyfriend Chick Clark Owen Moore of A Star Is Bornbreaks out of Sing Sing and shows up at Gus' saloon armed and dangerous. Meanwhile Lou tries to help a despondent young woman who botches a suicide attempt in Gus' place. Rita and Serge take advantage of the girl and get her into a white slavery ring. Lou's good deal ultimately brings down the house.In his ninth role Cary Grant masquerades as a Salvation Army reformer so he can crack a counterfeiting ring while Latin lover Gilbert Roland plays Russian gigolo Serge Stanieff who falls in love with our sultry heroine. The ironic thing about She Did Him Wrong is that our protagonist doesn't wrong any man. Okay you might make a case for Lou doing Chick wrong but it doesn't hold water. Everybody that she consorts with is already notorious except for the Cary Grant character. Grant loiters on the periphery until he emerges as the Federal investigator and cleans up the Bowery. Basically Grant swaps one uniform for another and looks debonair wearing them. Indeed if Lady Lou did anybody wrong she does it to her rival Rita Fafaela Ottiano of Grand Hotel with whom she has a knife fight after Rita discovers that Serge has given Lou a pin that belonged to Rita. Accidentally Lou stabs Rita to death but our heroine never has to answer for her crime in a court of law.Classified as a PreCode pictureShe Done Him Wrong was made before the Hollywood Production Code Administration acquired teeth to enforce its rulings with the support of the Catholic Legion of Decency. Indeed the Code had exerted pressure on Paramount Pictures long before production commenced to alter the Broadway play Diamond Lil from which scenarists Harvey F. Thew of Sinner's Holiday and John Bright of The Public Enemy later derived their screenplay. Actually West had written Diamond Lil and performed it with considerable success on Broadway. The Code stipulated that Paramount had to eliminate references to the stage play particularly the title Diamond Lil. In his book Hollywood Censored author Gregory Black writes that the Production Code banned the play because 'of the vulgar dramatic situations and the highly censurable dialogue' which would result in an 'unacceptable' film. According to Black Paramount initially accepted the Production Code recommendations until the studio's economic predicament altered after it lost 21million dollars in 1932. Now the studio needed a hot property to turn around its ailing financial situation. According to Geoffrey Wansell in his Cary Grant biography Haunted Idol director Lowell Sherman rehearsed the entire cast for two weeks and then filmed all the scenes in 18 days without going over schedule. The film grossed 2million and saved Paramount from rough financial times. The Turner Classic Movies website states the She Done Him Wrong coined another million dollars in foreign markets.Meanwhile She Done Him Wrong isn't without its own notoriety. Ms. West constantly solicits sex from men in a sly way and there is a suicide attempt in the film. She sings three songs with salacious themes Frankie and Johnny Easy Rider and A Guy What Takes His Time. Turner Classics historian Frank Miller points out that the film  . . . also triggered renewed cries for national film censorship that led to the strengthening of the Production Code in 1934. Clocking in at a concise 66 minutes She Done Him Wrong doesn't wear out its welcome but then few movies with Mae West ever wore out their welcome.Charles Lang's black  white photography is good and the film's production values are exemplary. She Done Him Wrong not only received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture but it also helped ailing Paramount Pictures survive the Depression. Grant isn't in every scene and neither is West. The best thing about this otherwise standard melodrama is Mae West. She Done Him Wrong created Mae West and his wattage shines throughout every scene that she has. There is only one reason to watch She Done Him Wrong and it is Mae West.".

At the front of the class I walked her walk and talked her talk. I wore a boa and tap danced because at age five she danced in New York neighborhood functions. I loved reading her autobiography and other source material about her. I got an A in both the final exam and in the course. Mae was the original I don't care girl. I needed this advanced theatrical coursework for graduation. I graduated from Ohio State soon after that. 1010 for this film.Original review 2008Mae West coming on to Cary Grant. He had the nerve to refuse her. What an idiot! IRL Mae said she discovered him. I have been researching her life for a theatrical censorship class at The Ohio State University. Mae was about 11 years older than Cary. Call her a cradlerobber she wouldn't care what you thought. She knew a tall darkhaired and handsome hunk when she saw one. Some say censorship killed her career but perhaps it made a lot more audiences pay to see her movies and earlier her stage and vaudeville career. In 1927 she went to jail for writing a play with themes so 'naughty' that the local moral police decided to put her in the slammer. She was I'm sure laughing all the way to the bank. All the bad publicity only made people especially men attend her shows. After the 1929 stock market crash and then Great Depression Broadway ticket sales went into a deep nosedive anyway so Mae West decided to 'Go Hollywood' and try her fortunes out in lala land. She turned Hollywood on its ear. Nobody else came close to her sly writings and infamous double entendres.".

At the front of the class I walked her walk and talked her talk. I wore a boa and tap danced because at age five she danced in New York neighborhood functions. I loved reading her autobiography and other source material about her. I got an A in both the final exam and in the course. Mae was the original I don't care girl. I needed this advanced theatrical coursework for graduation. I graduated from Ohio State soon after that. 1010 for this film.Original review 2008Mae West coming on to Cary Grant. He had the nerve to refuse her. What an idiot! IRL Mae said she discovered him. I have been researching her life for a theatrical censorship class at The Ohio State University. Mae was about 11 years older than Cary. Call her a cradlerobber she wouldn't care what you thought. She knew a tall darkhaired and handsome hunk when she saw one. Some say censorship killed her career but perhaps it made a lot more audiences pay to see her movies and earlier her stage and vaudeville career. In 1927 she went to jail for writing a play with themes so 'naughty' that the local moral police decided to put her in the slammer. She was I'm sure laughing all the way to the bank. All the bad publicity only made people especially men attend her shows. After the 1929 stock market crash and then Great Depression Broadway ticket sales went into a deep nosedive anyway so Mae West decided to 'Go Hollywood' and try her fortunes out in lala land. She turned Hollywood on its ear. Nobody else came close to her sly writings and infamous double entendres.";

An adaptation of her stage play Diamond Lil SHE DONE HIM WRONG casts West as seedy nightclub owner giving her ample opportunity to dish out her zesty oneliners and even sing three songs. Although she was never physically attractive in the traditional sense West seemed to embody all of the sinful excesses that were deemed forbidden by general public of the time which truly made her appear irresistible to many men of the era. She was arguably the first female public figure who unabashedly enjoyed sex the importance of which in feminist culture cannot be overstated.The film is a terrific romp solely because it manages to successfully capture the essence of West's trailblazing personae. The actual plot of the film involving West's criminal exboyfriend escaping from jail and seeking revenge due to West's infidelity is incredibly thin but it works splendidly as a means of letting West loose to do her thing. West seems to have a ball playing off of a young Cary Grant then a contract player with Paramount who is fun to see cast in an uncharacteristically virginal role. No one else in the cast make much of an impression although everyone is acceptable in their respective roles and all of them manage to lend the appropriate amount of support to West without ever coming close to the danger of upstaging her.".

And seeing her with an upandcomer named Cary Grant doubles the pleasure of watching this. Part of the time it does threaten to get a little monotonous when the drama takes effect but where this goes was worth it and also you get to hear Ms. West singing her heart out especially when she gets to the Frankie and Johnny number.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this last month at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film Festival and myself being a Swede it's nice to see a feature film centered on the indigenous Scandanavian peoples the Sami who have populated the regions near the Artcic Circle of the countries of Norway Sweden Finland and the Russian peninsula and live off their vast reindeer herds for food clothing and trade. Set in 1852 this is based on a true story of an uprising against the authorities in the Sami territory of Norway. A story that has inspired numerous novels and nonfiction books over the years. Elen Skom AnniKristina Jusso is the film's protagonist who tells her story as the determined and strong willed wife of Mathis Asle Mathis Gaup who has become an alcoholic and is in debt to the the local merchant supply and tavern owner the villainous Carl Ruth Mikael Persbrandt. Elen and Mathis have a young boy called Little Aslak named after Mathis brother Aslak. Mathis best friend is Mons Nils Peder Gaup and Mathis Mons and Aslak will become the central characters in leading the revolt against Ruth and his sadistic henchmanturned sheriff Bucht and the newly installed preacher Stockflest who is in Ruth's pocket. Laestadius noted Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist in a small rolehad been the preacher of Kautokeino and his methods were bringing about an end to the rampant drinking and the end of Ruth's business. Ruth pulled strings and brought in a new preacher but the congregation wouldn't attend his services and conducted their own. They also stopped buying their merchant supplies from Ruth and made arrangements with a merchant in nearby Karesando for their supplies. Directed by writerdirector Nils Gaup from his story cowritten with Nils Isak Eira the story is close to Gaup's heart as he is a descendant from one who participated in the rebellion over 150 years ago. It's a good story with beautiful winter scape cinematography from Phillip Ogaard and production design from Karl Juliusson. It has an epic feel to it without actually being an epic film. I would give this an 8.0 out of 10 and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sami people had always been able to wander with their rain deer as they wanted. Then in 1851 the borders between Norway Sweden and Finland were closed and this made the samis dis gruntled. In addition the culture of the samis were looked down upon not respected. The asshole shopkeeper in Kautkeino were selling booze to the sami men making alcoholics out of them when they should be out and about tending the rain deer and protecting their families.

I will say that the themes in this movie are universal particularly the individual's struggle against injustice from those in power.I suspect every culture has a noted hero who struggled against oppressive authority e.g. William Wallace Rob Roy Pan Singh Tomar Tadas Blinda and Ned Kelly. Here the hero and victim is humble Elen Skum a simple rural woman who wished to worship in her own way and to protect her family from the scourge of alcohol. While not as exciting a tale as many of her fellow rebels' it is all the more poignant for its simplicity. Elen a simple rural mother and wife stakes it all to save her family. She and her family and friends are too innocent to understand the forces arrayed against them but they are a hard people tempered by an unforgiving climate. Each sides' refusal to give ground ultimately lead to tragic consequences.Story aside the acting is amazing. While there were a couple of editing hiccups early in the film the sparse beauty of the country and the surprisingly good performancesparticularly from Ms. Jusso more than make up for any such quibbles.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1852 Sami reindeer herders in the Arctic region of Norway were fed up with the Norwegian liquor industry exploiting their tendency to alcoholism local government officials seizing parts of their herds and a corrupt state church ignoring it all. They rioted beating the local priest and killing a merchant and government official. The two men considered ringleaders Aslak Haetta and Mons Somby were tried and executed. This incidence is littleknown in most of Europe but in the history of the Sami people it is one of the few tales of resistance to pressure from their southern neighbors and has gained a sort of epic status. Nils Gaups' 2008 film KAUTOKEINOOPPRORET The Kautokeino Uprising depicts this event. The main character of the film is Ellen Aslaksdatter Skum who with her husband Mathis Haetta was sentenced to long imprisonment. Ellen is played by AnniKristiina Juuso a Sami actress best known for her role in Aleksandr Rogozhkin's 2001 film KUKUSHKA. The film is multilingual with the Sami speaking their own language Swedish used as a lingua franca and Norwegian heard from a few outsiders. Mid19th century Norway is depicted in absorbing detail and watching the film I felt to some degree that I was sharing the challenges of the characters in the frozen north.The film takes a few liberties with history the whipping of the priest isn't portrayed and the rioters are stopped by what seem to be Norwegians instead of their own other Sami neighbors. Still it's generally factual and really inspires the viewer to go out and learn more about the event. What I really admire about the film is that it doesn't try to portray the murderers as bold defenders of national consciousness their uprising was something of an act of blind rage and they were betraying their own Christian ideals. Other depictions of the riots such as Launis' godawful opera Aslak Hetta give in to hyperbolic National Romantic feelings but Gaups' film keeps it on the level.".

Hooker wants to use Gondorff's expertise to take Lonnegan for an enormous sum of money to even the score since he admits he doesn't know enough about killing to kill him. They devise a complicated scheme and amass a talented group of other con artists who want their share of the reparations.

The framing the photography the pace all dovetail exquisitely and if you feel left outside of the game plan in your first viewing never fear the second time of watching you'll enjoy it just as much but it will mean more.

The framing the photography the pace all dovetail exquisitely and if you feel left outside of the game plan in your first viewing never fear the second time of watching you'll enjoy it just as much but it will mean more. Certainly it's a film you'll want to see a second time. At least. Oscars rightly by the handful and nominations are full deserved to combine for a winning performance by all concerned. Definitely in my top fifty of all time.";

Hooker'd rather ice Lonnegan outright but will settle for a big con with the help of a slightly wobbly but game scammer named Henry Gondorff played as only Paul Newman can.Newman and Redford along with director George Roy Hill had a lot riding on this pony given it was a followup to their earlier Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. To measure up they had to produce nothing short of another classic. And so they did. The Sting won the Best Picture Oscar in 1973 and remains the sentimental favorite among many in choosing between the two films.Comparing The Sting to Butch Cassidy is kind of overdone sport and tempers as Lonnegan would say run hot. But you can see why The Sting worked as well as it did by looking at how the director and the stars played it differently within the same basic framework as Butch Cassidy. Newman and Redford are again outlaws and underdogs. Period detail abounds here as it did with Butch Cassidy and there's another memorable score amid the proceedings Scott Joplin rags modernized by Marvin Hamlisch. The score even produced another hit The Entertainer to compare with Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.What's different about The Sting and what makes it such a classic in its own right is the way the stars service the plot. In Butch Cassidy Newman and Redford's comradeship was the story. Here the chemistry between the two actors is minimized in favor of spinning a yarn with enough red herrings to feed the Swedish navy. The tale here is better than Butch Cassidy which is a more elegiac film with grander cinematography and funnier set pieces. The Sting is an edgeofyourseat caper flick from beginning to end.You can't really call The Sting a comedy. Though there are many laughs especially when Newman hooks Shaw during a poker game Hill won't let the audience relax enough for that. What this is is a con game played on the audience designed not to cheat but entertain by means of clever hoodwinking and constant misdirection plays.You'll get no spoilers from me. This is one worth sitting through with no expectations. Five gets you ten you'll enjoy Newman and Redford and a terrific supporting cast one advantage over Butch Cassidy that includes Charles Durning Eileen Brennan Dana Elcar Harold Gould and Mr. Hand himself Ray Walston. There's another familiar face from Butch Cassidy Charles Dierkop Flat Nose Curry in Butch Cassidy and Lonnegan's right hand here. The best performance may be Robert Shaw's he exudes menace aplenty but some humanity too when he takes Hooker under his wing after learning he came from the same hard streets of Five Points Lonnegan sprang from.Terrific period detail too. The dialogue is great and feels real in its Runyonesque way while the cons are elaborate and logically played out. Watching this a second time is especially fun because once you know how the plot goes down you find yourself catching clues you missed the first time and enjoying the film even more for them.Why didn't Newman and Redford team up again? Certainly there was another good movie for them to partner up in but as Gondorff would have put it only chumps don't quit when they're ahead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman are grifters' or confidence tricksters in 1930s Chicago. Unknown to them however one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff and together they come up with an elaborate plan not only to cheat Lonnegan but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.Crime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic film noir' style with its dark brooding cynical atmosphere. In The Sting' however George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised as is the scenery and the division of the film into sections with titles such as The Hook' or The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in blackandwhite but in bright colour and the mood far from being heavy and brooding is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly Robert Shaw as the glowering menacing Lonnegan Robert Redford as the young idealistic Hooker insofar as a conman can be said to be an idealist and Paul Newman as the older more experienced and laidback Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.Despite the cheerful mood the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as heist' or caper' movies as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. The Sting' however is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt Snyder the one representative we see of the forces of law and order is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and moreover because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film which well deserved its Academy Award. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sting evoking a bygone era of gangsters and con men was the deserved Best Picture of 1973. The Sting won that Oscar plus a whole flock of technical awards. One award it didn't win was for Robert Redford as Best Actor.That must have been tough for the Academy voters because to single out Redford as opposed to Paul Newman must have felt a bit unjust. For though Newman was nominated many times over his career and finally did win for The Color of Money did not get a nomination for The Sting.Robert Redford is a small time grifter who while working a bait and switch street con takes off a numbers runner carrying the weekly take. The orders come down from the head man himself IrishAmerican gangster Robert Shaw to kill those who did this as an example.Redford's mentor Robert Earl Jones is in fact killed mainly because Redford starts spending a lot of that newly acquired loot that tips them off. Redford wants revenge so he looks up big time con man Paul Newman who himself is dodging law enforcement as is Redford also.They work the big con on Shaw and it's a beauty. The scheme they have is something to behold. They also have to do a couple of improvisations on the fly that lend a few twists to the scheme.The costumes and sets really do evoke Chicago of the Thirties and director George Roy Hill assembles a great cast to support Newman and Redford. My favorite in the whole group is Charles Durning who plays the brutally corrupt but essentially dumb cop from Joliet who nearly gums up the works and has to be dealt with.Special mention should also go to Robert Shaw. He's got a difficult part maybe the most difficult in the film. He's not stupid he would not have gotten to the top of the rackets if he was. But he also has to show that hint of human weakness that Newman Redford and the whole mob they assemble that makes him vulnerable to the con.During the sixties and seventies Robert Shaw was really coming into his own as a player getting more and more acclaim for his work. His early death was a real tragedy there was so much more he could have been doing.Can't also forget another costar in this film the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting. It probably is what most people remember about The Sting. Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president. Strange but it actually works.The Sting still works wonders today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Small time conmen Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman unwittingly scam a runner for Chicago main man Doyle Lonnegan.  When Luther is murdered Hooker goes on the run and seeks out Luther's old friend Henry Gondorff to help him put together a major sting to take revenge on Lonnegan.  However with so much heat on Hooker and the stakes so high can they pull it off and get away clean?Almost a follow up to Butch and Sundance this film partners the stars of the day Newman and Redford to good effect.  The story is a little less fun but still very enjoyable to watch as it builds to a great finale.  The use of chapters ran the risk of fragmenting the film into bits but instead it really helps set it out and makes it more manageable.  Although it is not as light hearted and jovial as the theme music suggests it still manages to flow nicely with the slightly darker drama not spoiling anything but only serving to make it feel more grown up.The cast are all very good and make the film easy to watch. Redford comes off the best in terms of characters and his role really suits both his carefree attitude the start of the film but also his more serious side the rest of the film.  Newman has a lesser role that perhaps doesn't suit him quite as well but he does have several really good scenes the hustles where he does very good work.  Shaw's accent is a little heavy at first but I got used to it and it worked for me and he was a really good foil for RedfordNewman.  The support cast including Durning Walston Gould Jones and others all do good work.The direction and use of music is really good and the sense of period is well crafted and doesn't just feel like it was painted on. I'm not sure if it deserved Best Picture or not because I don't know what the rest of the field was for that year but it is a really enjoyable film that is quite fun to watch several times even 30 years later  and isn't that the main thing?".

	onyx:emotionText "Small time conmen Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman unwittingly scam a runner for Chicago main man Doyle Lonnegan.  When Luther is murdered Hooker goes on the run and seeks out Luther's old friend Henry Gondorff to help him put together a major sting to take revenge on Lonnegan.  However with so much heat on Hooker and the stakes so high can they pull it off and get away clean?Almost a follow up to Butch and Sundance this film partners the stars of the day Newman and Redford to good effect.  The story is a little less fun but still very enjoyable to watch as it builds to a great finale.  The use of chapters ran the risk of fragmenting the film into bits but instead it really helps set it out and makes it more manageable.  Although it is not as light hearted and jovial as the theme music suggests it still manages to flow nicely with the slightly darker drama not spoiling anything but only serving to make it feel more grown up.The cast are all very good and make the film easy to watch. Redford comes off the best in terms of characters and his role really suits both his carefree attitude the start of the film but also his more serious side the rest of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "At first sight THE STING appears to be nothing more than a television movie.  It is entirely plotdriven with no real stand out characters or personalities.  What makes the film work is excellent production design and a delightfully clever plot filled with many surprises.  The movie is featherweight emotionally but the depth of the con and the way it is fashioned by screenwriter David Ward leaves you with a pleasant experience.This is more Redford's film than Newman's who reunite with George Roy Hill director of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.  The legendary actors were more flesh and blood in that film but here they are merely players who carry the story along.  With lesser actors THE STING may have been a forgettable piece of work.  Redford does all of the dirty work after Newman's initial hook but the omniscient presence of Newman as bigtime grifter Henry Gondorff exists throughout.  A mysterious gloved character a crooked cop the FBI and a seemingly bigger conman Doyle Lonnegan played by the late great Robert Shaw are some of the players who are involved in some events that seem to be manipulated by an unseen force.  Is Newman as good as he claims in trying to clean out Shaw?  We'll see.The film is shot simply by Hill.  No tricky angles or contrived camera movements are used.  The action takes place simply in front of us.  The production design by Henry Bumstead and James Payne recreates oldtime Chicago through the use of built sets matte paintings of a smaller skyline and some location shots.  It gives the film an almost artificial look which is fitting considering it is a direct homage to the 1930's and the gangster pictures that so dominated that decade.  The story is even furthered by title pages describing the setup the hook and the sting. They are turned like pages in a book adding a drop of elegance to a crooked world.  An iris is even employed in some scenes.THE STING is definitely lightweight entertainment.  It does not provoke much thought or insight into what is happening on screen.  Fun is the word for this amusing little film that depicts a masterful plan for a big steal which would be impossible to pull off today.  Look out for Ray Walston in a hilarious role announcing horse races and their results as they are happening just after receiving word of the real race results from a back room in the betting house.  These are good conmen.RATING ".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sting.The Sting 1973 is one of everybody's favorite films. Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.The intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago. It tells the story of grifters Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford respectively. They con the bad guy Doyle Lonnegan played by Robert Shaw. And at every turn they con the audience as well.The poker game is five card draw 'straight poker' in the film and is set on a train traveling from New York to Chicago. Newman and Redford are on the train along with Shaw. The game has been set up by Shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. We don't know how Newman and Redford know exactly what day and what train Shaw is taking from New York to Chicago but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. Shaw is a known card cheater but Newman will prove to be a better one. Once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. This time we'll love every minute of it.Newman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game through the conductor. He arrives sober but apparently inebriated. It is the perfect act consummately played in a boozy needling performance by Paul Newman. Shaw's character is a known cold decker a 'cold deck' is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands prearranged to break one of the players' and Newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game.One of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. Newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. During the play of hands we see Newman hold the cards close to his vest and at least once his cards disappear briefly below table level out of sight and back again. Newman knows Shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards and so Newman is gathering and holding out jacks.Newman immediately insults Shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game thus making sure Shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. When Shaw goes to the men's room to arrange to fix the cold deck Newman knows the time has come. In real life cold decks were nearly always arranged in men's rooms. They should have had a dedicated stall marked 'coolers made here'.The game is three handed at this point. Shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. In filming the cold decking the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck then there's a cut in the continuity. Then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in Shaw's lap leaving the cold deck on the table. I guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot.The detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. Newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest implying something is happening. But we never see Newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards.Newman is dealt trip threes and Shaw is dealt a pair of nines. The third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. Newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. Shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades.The planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. After the cards are dealt the cards on top of the deck are in order a three the six of hearts two nines and the ten of spades. It doesn't matter whether Newman draws one or two cards he'll make his four threes and in either case Shaw in drawing three cards will make his four nines.Now here's the unlikely trick. Newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. It would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he's held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won't have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines but in having to play over the top of the cold deck that gamble is unavoidable.Shaw's problem is that he can't call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin Shaw says to his lackey 'What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me in front of the others?'Shaw was able to get 10000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.The film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However we never see Newman clean up. So when he leaves the poker cabin one deck is short four jacks the other deck has four extra jacks and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next will have a few surprises.Despite its faults the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled greatest directed best acted and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.Silver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The Sting 1973A simple bold calculation that Rob Roy Hill directing two charming beautiful men in another period buddy movie would make big bucks was easy. The Sting was huge in its day. But lucky for all of us it also made a wonderful if not great film an entertaining film above all. And it gave us more time with Robert Redford and Paul Newman which is never a bad thing.The first film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 was sensationally popular and influential. And is and was a better movie. For one thing The Sting avoids any real tragedy. For another by the very nature of being left out of the main character's heads as they scheme away to leave us in suspense we are not drawn into their world their worries their characters. In a way this is the big let down overall. We are made to watch the movie not get absorbed into it. There is real romance. The Butch Cassidy good friends who don't know each other after all feeling with its poignancy and humor is missing here. And even their friendship which is confusing on purpose on screen is never for real. Everything top to bottom on the surface and deep is for convenience and for effect.That's not necessarily a bad thing. But in a way this is a return to the kind of early 1960s moviemaking that the late 1960s have become so famous for upending including Hill's own Butch Cassidy which is more raw and alive and beautiful than The Sting by far. Yet besides all the critical picking away The Sting is a fast layered well done movie with incredible period sets. The music is beautiful but odd ragtime is a pre1920s New Orleans style and the movie is post1920s Chicago but is maybe another example of how the director and team decided to go for sucking people in and having them enjoy themselves. And that's exactly what happens.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I type this this movie sits at 83 on the alltime greatest movies list. Almost makes me guilty for only giving it a 7 and possibly dropping it to 84 but to be honest it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen. But it also wasn't the worst.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are two confidence men con men or grifters in the 1930s who cheat at cards. They cheat at cards against a wealthy New York City man and then sucker him in for what is called a long con or big con. If you like the character Sawyer from Lost this is probably your movie. The whole second half of the movie is this long con and will they pull it off? You won't know until the end because the mafia and the FBI are both trying to kill them. And sometimes happy endings happen when the cops win and the cheaters lose. So don't bet on any horses until you know the score.Anyway it's a good film. Some parts are hard to follow in my opinion but in a twisted sense this makes sense  if they are conning the other cons surely we the audience should be getting conned too. It would be shoddy con work to let in ANYBODY even the audience. And the acting is of course perfect because it's Newman and Redford. But also the guy from My Favorite Martian Walston and James Earl Jones' father. So that's good.They claim the music really makes the film. I disagree. The music is appropriate but not because it matches the 1940s. Because it matches the cards used to separate the different scenes which by the way I think was a great idea. To cut a review short that isn't going anywhere this film is recommended. Not highly recommended. Not top 100 films of all time recommended. But you might want to see it anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the Sting was entertaining it is also astoundingly overrated.The music while setting a fun mood is incorrect as ragtime had fallen out of favor 2025 years before the film is set. Likewise the costuming and set design are cartoony and create a sense of time and place that never existed and will only be recalled by viewer who have little to no experience with the actual time and place and simply view it as oldtimey. The sets in particular stand out as being obvious studio backlots and the requisite editing to make chases and the like seem seamless are glaringly obvious.Most films based on cons tend to share the characteristic of keeping something back from the audience in order to keep a level of suspense up that would otherwise be lacking afterall the viewer is in on the con already. There are a couple of such cases in this film but they're all pretty obviously telegraphed and the ending feels a bit hollow as everything simply plays out before you just the way you thought it would. Even without knowing the details of some of the cons used they're all presented simply and obviously enough that it's no feat to tell what's going on. At times it feels like the film has intentionally set the bar a bit low so that the audience will feel special and clever for picking up on the supposed twists.Redford and Newman both do a decent job but especially in Redford's case neither seems to really inhabit their role. Instead it's just Redford playing the guy who's a conman rather than a legitimate character.At the same time it's still a fun and enjoyable film. A good way to waste away a lazy weekend afternoon. It's cotton candy though once you bite in there's nothing there and it's not going to stick with you for long.".

The acting is quite nice and it's interesting that the film won seven Oscarsand none of them for acting! And just like the first time the Scott Joplin tunes are terrific. The only real negative is that because I'd seen it before there were no surprisesand surprises are what makes this such an enjoyable film. Without the surprise the film lacks something the second timesomething that isn't true for all films. O Brother Where Art Thou? for example seems to get better each time you see itbut The Sting does because the movie is so dependent of surprise plot twists.The bottom line is that for firsttime viewers the film is very hard to beat and it's easy to see how this 5.5 million dollar film brought in over 159000000 domesticallymaking this is megamega blockbuster.

The film is historically stylized and the images work together with the Scott Joplin's piano rags to make a fun and contiguous whole. The film is logical and linear and very easy to watch which makes it all the more engaging. The viewer can then concentrate on the complete story and see exactly how The Sting' takes place.

Is it going to be like a harder edged 'Paper Moon' a 1930's version of 'The French Connection'? A film noir made in the 70's done right? Alas no. I thought it very cheesy overall.

How few films are there which affect the viewers on this level.  To say this film is powerful seems so weak a description.Part of the power of the film comes I think from a certain restraint in the direction.  So often films which aspire to move the audience quickly fall into melodrama overacting and overblown images.  Too much.  These often succeed in the immediate response usually crying but fail to impact the viewer on anything more than a surface level.  Here it is the small moments which fill the screen.  Everywhere all around is War but for these men as we witness them war does not begin with a capital W.  It is reality not a grand concept.  The director lets the story shock and horrify the audience not by forcing it but by letting the story just tell itself.

Patriotism for my own country would tend to make me hate the crew on this ship by definition especially if portrayed as typical mindless killing machine Nazis but these characters are so well developed and played like humanbeings facing difficult decisions that I find myself sympathizing with these guys.I love the flow and pacing of the Director's Cut it takes its time and does not feel like typical Hollywood formula first major plot point at minute 12 cookiecutter routine. Das Boot gives us plenty of time to know these characters discover how they kill time while waiting for orders how they feel about their job and each other. Then when the action finally starts how they deal with the possibility of dying deep underwater how they react to the sounds of a sub going deeper than it should the look on their faces as a destroyer is heard pinging them and dozens of little personality quirkssubtle details that bring the crew to life. It truly does feel like an epic about a submarine crew and I'm interested in some day viewing the 6 hour TV version.The underwater battles somewhat remind me of Sergio Leone in that Wolfgang Peterson takes forever and a day to get the fights started. Unlike Leone once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped the catandmouse game is ongoing and relentless but never boring.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine Das Boot is never boring to look at in fact it's a visually spectacular film given the dated special effects who hold up reasonably well and add to the oldschool charm. And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters  particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war  it is both haunting and beautiful.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his facehis concern for his own life ship and crew his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming oddswhile simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is in a word brilliant.The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances and trust me I could write an entire review on the film's characters and their portrayals. It's both disappointing and satisfying that I'm not given enough space to do so I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I've reviewed here on IMDb. I liked the entire crew of this Uboat the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these heroes the chief and his longing to return to his wife Johann and the story of his redemptionall well cast well acted and believable.Another aspect I adored about Das Boot  the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these talked about scenes. Granted the film does pose some moral questions but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print italics and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.I can go on for a long while Over three hours of wonderful visuals and strong performances a sparse but great score this film's lack of music is quite appropriate making the presence of music much more impactful in its key places. Realistic writing from people who lived the experience first hand. As I said I can go on for awhile but I'll sum it up and end this review with one statement Das Boot is the definitive submarine movie.".

	schema:headline " The best submarine film ever made.";
	schema:reviewBody "While it has been a very long time since I have seen this movie it is one of the very few that I own. Wolfgang Petersen's magnificent accomplishment in Das Boot is reiterating the dictum that war is hell no matter which side you look at it from and no matter where the battlefield is located. Minor spoilers The plot has been well described by other viewers so I won't rehash it again. But my personal observations as an exsubmarine sailor are that Petersen probably portrayed life on board the sub pretty accurately. I say probably because todays subs are hotels compared with the German Uboats and American submarines. The commonality between yesterday and today is how the crew deals with being closed up in a sewer pipe for weeks at a time. More importantly you as a viewer become an invisible crew member as the crew lives in very cramped conditions American WW2 subs used to be called pig boats deals with an unfortunately believable political officer deals with drills actual torpedo firings actual ships casualties and deals most frighteningly with retribution from the enemy. My own experience watching the depth charging of the Uboat was such that I was thinking stop it Stop It STOP IT STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT...!!!!! That's how real it felt to me. For the rest of you I feel certain you will too be dragged in and know what it is like to live on board a WW2 Uboat.This movie also shows how leadership is so important in keeping the crew and ultimately the sub together. Petersen's direction for Captain LehmannWillenbrock was masterful because it didn't portray the captain as a god. It showed him as a man who knows how to lead knows his submarine as if he were married to it and in many ways he is but isn't perfect at the job. It also shows that even with great leadership qualities Captain LehmannWillenbrock can not do the job alone he must have both officers and enlisted men who have the knowledge and skill to not just do their jobs but to also advise the captain. Petersen also managed to give each member of the crew their own separate personalities instead of the predictable cookiecutter personalities that Hollywood feels is needed.I could go on and on. So I will close by saying that with the plot direction cinematography acting sound music editing all being top notch this is one of the few movies that I can truly rate a 10 out of 10. I also preferred the German version with subtitles. I believe that this movie was either the first or one of the first to use Steadicam technology. It was truly amazing for me to see a camera zip its way through a submarine specifically through the open watertight doors without a break in the filming. Up until I heard what Steadicam was I was always wondering how Petersen managed to hide the camera dolly track or the wires the camera hung from.It turns out I was wrong Bound For Glory was the first.EDIT 12 OCT 2006 I have been corrected by an observant viewer. Wikipedia has the following comment on what I thought was Steadicam usageMost of the interior shots were filmed using a handheld Arriflex of cinematographer Jost Vacano's design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had a gyroscope to provide stability a reinvention of the Steadicam on a smaller scale so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mockup. Vacano wore fullbody padding to minimize injury as he ran and the mockup was rocked and shaken. So literally a Steadicam was NOT used in the filming of Das Boot. However a camera that resembled Steadicam in function in the way it gyroscopically leveled the filming platform was used. Even though todays submarines are far cleaner then their predecessors and we have refrigerators freezers air conditioning are able to take showers etc. there is one aspect of living in an enclosed space that still lives on the smell. While the smell of the pig boats of WW2 was truly atrocious even with todays ability to clean the atmosphere you can not escape the fact that any smell that is created from burned toast in the galley from the smell of the sanitary gasses to be kind to gasified hydraulic oil and diesel fuel all these particulates will eventually become absorbed in your clothing. You as a sailor may get used to it but when you get home your wife will most likely declare that you smell like a submarine and demand that whatever you are wearing get thrown in the wash ... immediately!".

At times the movie grows slow and drawn out but that is intentional to make you feel like you are trapped in an underwater coffin with nothing to do no where to go.

Very colorful contrasting characters and a script and plot thick with surprises and emotional dramatrauma. Topnotch direction action acting and sets.

Referring to Petersens Das Boot however I consider it justified to call it authentic and true. I think this statement can be strengthened mainly by the fact that Lothar Gunther Buchheim was consulted. He composed the novel this breathtaking movie bases on and he himself was employed as a war correspondent in the Second World War.The entire plot has no weak points. Starting at Bar Royal at the very night before the forces living journey of the submarine crew begins the director fittingly manages to confront the audience with the protagonists and their way of dealing with the pounding uncertainty. Once put to sea the character of the scenes changes abruptly. Every member of the crew and the audience as well comes into very close contact with the tightness of the action space. At this point it is necessary to underline the excellent work of the cameramen. The fast and partial hectic cuts draw an exact picture of the drama on board. Too do not forget the outstanding lighting. However besides this abundance of obvious suspense there are also a number of moments going into indepth psychology and thoughtfulness. To outline only a few of them At Bar Royal when the chief engineer reflects about the uncertain fate of his family or when the captain with a kind of 'Weltschmerz' in his eyes is astound and proud of the unbelievable efforts of the crew. It would probably be too laborious to refer to the decisive symbols the director uses therefore I recommend this movie to everybody especially those who are interested in the Second World War.It presumably sounds pretty weird yet I suppose that mankind gladly participates on the misfortune of others without being closely involved with it. This closing notion may account for the huge success of this movie.".

The start doesn't really remind you of a war movie but believe me thats armed forces behaviour all right. As WW2 progressed Hitler drew on ever younger recruits and the historical accuracies are in abundance for a change. This film makes modern junk like the new Pearl harbour look limp wristed.As shocking as the statistics are 30000 out of 40000 never returned It makes you wonder why so many young men volunteered for the Untersee boot 'Kreigsmarine'.

	schema:headline " Review Of The Director's Cut";
	schema:reviewBody "I've decided not to review the 1981 dubbed cinematic release of DAS BOOT . Instead I've decided to review Wolfgang Petersen's director's cut which is far closer to the miniseries version which most readers will be familiar with When someone makes an anti war statement it's important that they differentiate between being  anti war  and  anti military  . The Brits don't seem to know the difference and seem keen to make anti military  anti  soldier self loathing war movies with Paul Greengrass's RESURRECTED a good example . Having suffered the tragedy of Vietnam the Americans finally made anti war movies that were a million miles removed from the old John Wayne and Errol Flynn star vehicles where a man wipes out 30 enemy soldiers single handed without suffering a scratch . But when it comes to making anti  war movies that shows the horrors of war and the courage of men in battle the Germans are top of the league  heads and shoulders above everyone else . This is because present day Germans realize that the enemy isn't the other side  it's war itself that's the enemy and DAS BOOT is a great example of this thinking The story starts slowly by introducing us to the crew via the war correspondent who are celebrating a last night ashore before they sail on their mission to sink British convoys sailing from America to Britain carrying vital supplies for the war effort against Nazi Germany . This is where DAS BOOT is superb  I really felt empathy for these crew man . Okay I didn't want them sinking British ships but I didn't want them to die either an opinion that shouldn't be taken lightly since my paternal grandfather was a merchant seaman during the war while my maternal grandfather was a crewman on a destroyer . The fact the crew of U96 are presented as being utterly human and for this Brit hoping they make it home in one piece is a great achievement DAS BOOT was nominated for several Oscars and it's not difficult to see why. Watch it on widescreen television with stereo surround and you'll be amazed with the very clear sound effects and sound editing . Perhaps the best technical aspect is the cinematography where during moments of crisis the camera shoots along the length of the U boat as it follows crewmen rushing about . When a foreign language movie is nominated for several Oscars you just know it's good!!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!This is a superb movie but it's not perfect . Being a German movie Nazis feature at one point but none of them are crew members  the only Nazis featured are the crew of a supply ship who have who have never seen a days fighting in their lives . It's understandable for German film makers to play down the courage of Nazi party members of the Second World War but it should also be remembered that the Waffan SS were exclusively composed of party members and they were the most feared fighting force of the conflict . CROSS OF IRON  My favourite movie featuring WW 2  does make the valid point that because someone isn't a fan of the Nazis it doesn't necessarily make them a good person either . The screenplay also drags due to the fact that there's two subplots of U96 being damaged and stuck on the Atlantic seabed when one subplot of sinking and then resurrecting the vessel would have sufficedBut the pros far outweigh the cons and I recommend this movie to people who have never seen a foreign language film in their life . It's placing in the IMDb top 250 is well earned . You may be shocked to know that director Wolgang Petersen later went onto to make Hollywood crap like OUTBREAK and A PERFECT STORM".

This opening pitch and the antsiness of Jrgen's young hooligan crew seems to presage a roaring Hitlercoaster of war war war Amerikan style  but directorcowriter Wolfgang Petersen and writers Lothar G. Buchheim and Dean Riesner swerve to port with a counter intuitive yet singularly entertaining and tensionfilled characterdriven nonaction action movie. These young punks discover that being at war is much like the waiting room in any doctor's office.DAS BOOT is filled with periods of waiting in fear waiting in boredom waiting in terror waiting in anxiety  and sudden action that rips throats and bends steel with its bare hands.DAS BOOT does something which most commercial war films are too gutless to do  humanizes Germans they carry photos of their girls they write home there are heroes and cowards there are hard men and those that crack under the strain they catch crabs and rib each other about it at one point a sailor stops a celebration with the announcement of bad news on the radio  into the silence he declares that back home their team has lost! These men doubt much of the war propaganda they are fed. Even though German tacticians convey Churchill as a paralyzed guzzler the officers on U96 respect the British fleet Those aren't amateurs up there. Yet they do not fear the British simply because that is the default position of Germans in Westernized film but because the British had better equipment. These Germans are not onedimensional haters not committed blindly to the Fhrer not simple villain props as in countless Brit and U.S. movies. They are the heroes. And our hearts are with theirs in their throats every watery step of the way.Even in its shortest version DAS BOOT is 2 hours 29 minutes. The Director's Cut is 209 minutes the uncut version is 293 minutes 4 hrs 53 mins. It's the most fun you'll have growing a five o'clock shadow.DAS BOOT attains such a high level of drama we forgive Wolfgang Petersen for the subpar exteriors with those model subs and little dolls on the tower being foamed in slow motion to emulate a sizable uboat.When most movies are ending  at the 133 mark  this movie sees its first action. Yet even the action is not what one expects after U96 fires torpedoes at a British convoy they submerge and wait in silence listening for the muffled faroff explosions and counting the British ships sinking by the groans of steel they hear through the depths. And they know they're in for repercussions  depth charges. The waiting begins anew  the interminable unbearable waiting for death to claim you or not  as they run silent all lights out submerging further engines at minimum. The sound of sonar pings their only warning that something is closing on them from above. The Captain says into the silence Here it comes. The revenge. And all they can do is hang on through the bucking explosions and bolts bursting on pressurized pipes.After the terror subsides Prochnow simply declares That's the end of that. Not heroes. Not cowards. Just doing their job.When U96 surfaces to survey their kills they are outraged to find that one of the flaming ships they torpedoed still has men onboard jumping off screaming aflame. And the focus of the Captain's outrage will surprise you Why weren't they rescued after all these hours? One of his officers begins to weep for the dying. It's a wondrous portrayal of war empathy of humanity. It makes us question war yet again and question the supposed intelligence of the species that can create the marvel of submarines and battleships only to use them in such unproductive moronic fashion against each other.Imagine the frustration of knowing that on a submarine humans are the least important cargo  literally stacks of torpedoes spare parts tools for repairs it's like being in space  there is nowhere you can turn if you need a certain part food fuel ballast the mechanics of the sub itself and at the very bottom of the list  as evidenced by the way sleeping bunks are haphazardly squeezed into crawlspaces  people.Director Petersen instructed the whole crew not to go out into the sun during filming so they would retain that bloodless pallor. He effectively suffocates us in the ghastly claustrophobic passageways and living spaces of a submarine he sends his cameras barreling through crawlspaces full tilt pursuing running men who trip and glide through hatches we almost feel the cracking of our skulls on jutting iron overhangs sea water thunders in every time the top hatch is opened drenching the plasticcoated charts and everyone nearby everything is wet and damp dark and cold...DAS BOOT is a gritty study in patience tactics anxiety tolerance futility and brings a whole new meaning to wetting the bed.".

Jurgen Prochnow played the part of the captain better than any other actor has ever played the role of a leader of men. He brought to life the drama of leading a group of young men into a possible suicide mission with utter realism and depth. I don't normally get emotional at movies anymore. I did watching this one! All the other actors deserve as much credit for the very different men they portrayed. Not one of them was bad. Wolfgang Petersen is an amazing storyteller and this movie proved it.

The Superbit director's cut on DVD with one additional hour is a supreme masterpiece of a war or antiwar film. It is impressive how a 3h 29 min film is never boring keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat until the very ending. The claustrophobic and tense story increases the drama and the character development in this version becoming one of the best movies in the cinema history. The German captain officers and crew are not shown as onedimension character or sad killing machine like in many war films but as human beings with families and friends very efficient in their works but with fear and other feelings. My vote is ten.Title Brazil O Barco Inferno no Mar The Boat Hell in the Sea".

My grandfather commanded a sub in the Pacific during WW2 and my dad went on to do nearly 30 years as crew and finally skipper in a nuke hunterkiller. So I kinda know the history of subs 1st hand. This movie pulls no punches and is stunningly accurate. It is a work of genius from one of the greatest directors of our time.I must qualify that by saying PLEASE don't watch the dubbed English version. This film has to be seen in German with subtitles and you absolutely have to see the director's cut. Three and a half hours of laughter terror claustrophobia tenderness and finally a sense of the futility of war. It's just brilliant.Jrgen Prochnow has made some good films in his career but he will never better this performance. He is the epitome of a sub captain. Steely yet sensitive to his crew. Determined and sometimes rash but always in control and the love of his crew for him is clear throughout. Even I would follow him until the end!!I kinda feel bad about praising Jrgen Prochnow so highly because seriously this is one of the few movies I've seen where EVERY member of the cast is just perfect. All credit to the casting people. You would not change anyone. Bernd Tauber as the Chief is just awesome. Erwin Leder as Johann is just so right and Herbert Grnemeyer as the raw reporter who grows up is amazing.This film should be up there with the greatest war movies of all time. Unfortunately I think because it's told from the German side it will never get the recognition it truly deserves. Very sad as it never glorifies Nazism. It's simply a tale of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances  which kinda sums up all wars.Incredible film from an incredible director.".

They are not heroes they are men who are afraid and are in the line of duty out of selfpreservation and patriotism not because they are psychotic Nazis. they're not. It is a story far more complex that good and evil it is about human decisions and mistakes and the complex struggle between one's loyalties and one's nature. Watching Das Boot you forget that the crew is German which in Western society we are taught is the 'bad team' of WWII and see them for what they really were ordinary men. I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a film that's really about something without the warmfuzzies and Hollywood conventions steeped into most movies.

Everyone needs to realize that I have a fascination with submarine films. I loved The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide. Both of them rank as my top action films. I don't know why I love this genre so much. I think it has to do somewhat with my passion for scifi. The ocean is almost like fighting in another world. So many times we have seen wars play out on land and while there is only so much you can show with a land fight the war field on the open sea allows for so much more creativity. Director Wolfgang Peterson gives us some great characters. While not much dialogue happens in this film you can see everyone's expressions on their faces and those expressions tell better stories than words. You can see their fear their excitement their sadness and their power by just the way that Peterson directs them. With his direction I felt that I was on this UBoat with the crew. Peterson perfectly portrays a feeling of crampness and claustrophobia wrapped together as one. I think that during one of the bombing scenes I broke a sweat because of what was happening on screen. Finally I am also a fan of films that tell a different angle on the story. So many years I have watched war movie after war movie that show the victorious American's beating the classic evildoers. Now don't get me wrong these are fun sometimes but I love to see a different angle. In history class we didn't learn about the casualties of the Germans in WWII. We learn about them as a statistic and never put these heroes on a human level. This film humanizes the German's conditions during the war. The Germans are human being also who fought for their country just as valiantly as our soldiers did during WWII. They had families they had pasts they had homes that they left to become a part of history. To fight for your beliefs. That is what America teaches us fight for what we believe in....doesn't it? I could talk about this for hours but instead I am going to sit back relax and tell you how wonderful Das Boot was to watch. I have not been this entertained for a long time. Bravo to everyone involved in this film. I think it IS the best war film ever released that I have seen. I want everyone to get out of their seats this weekend and go rent this movie. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. Grade  out of ".

	schema:headline " Excellent war drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Paul Verhoeven's Soldaat van Oranje aka Soldier Of Orange the religious excesses of his Flesh  Blood 1985 not withstanding is probably the closest the director has come to an epic. At the equivalent of 2.5 million it was the most expensive Dutch feature film made at that time. It was also the film which brought him to the attention of Hollywood exemplified by Spielberg's phone call to him after seeing the film What are you doing in Holland? Come to the USA things are better there!   During his childhood in The Hague Verhoeven had been witness to the activities of the occupying Nazis which made a great impression on him. He remembers vividly his father hiding in a cellar and seeing dead bodies in the street for example. As one biographer has noted Soldier Of Orange was a theme he could taste feel and breathe a film shot with of honesty and verisimilitude if less of the director's characteristic excess though still with his distinctive vision and style. There are some familiar faces in the large cast Jeroen Krabb as Guus Le Jeune who took the lead in De Vierde Man aka The Fourth Man is a key protagonist and the svelte and goodlooking Rutger Hauer as the central character Erik Lanshof. The blond Hauer who had until now been utilised by Verhoeven as a working class hero in such films as Turks Fruit aka Turkish Delight 1973 and afterwards in Spetters 1980 is here transformed into a prosperous war hero modelled on Erik Roelfzema the author of the original dramatic memoir. Much of the fraught virility usually associated with Hauer is suppressed here although it briefly reappears during his dalliance with Susan Susan Penhaligon.   That ErikHauer is the focus of the film is suggested by his first appearance although the episodic nature of much that follows in the narrative sometimes sidelines his significance. He is inserted Zeliglike into opening newsreel footage the 'single aide' at the post war return of Queen Wilhemina. Like so many of his Dutch contemporaries Erik is comfortably well off a man to whom if only at first the conflict seems just another grand adventure. Previously the middle class had been presented in Verhoeven's work as exploiters as in Keetje Keeple 1975 or as sexually ludicrous in Wat Zen Ik? aka Business Is Business 1971. Such boisterous social irony is in the present film conspicuous by its absence as if the contemplation of war forced a different responsibility upon the filmmakers. Erik and his class of 193940 may sometimes be made effete but never risible.    Made at a time when Netherlanders were starting to face the realities of their wartime existence unpleasant facts about home collaboration and acquiescence to occupation Verhoeven's film confronts these issues with a tale of student friends torn apart by war having to face moral dilemmas and choices. Soldier Of Orange complete with its stirring title music is a title with a singular subject implying a monolithic view of an individual at war. But the film actually focuses on a plurality of men an ensemble of half a dozen privileged students each of them responding to the conflict in a different way. Although Erik is the nominal hero his actions are often ineffectual and have dubious results. His counterweight is Alex Derek de Lint. Having served in the Dutch army he sees his mother interned and decides to join the Waffen SS. The two meet only twice after at a parade where the Dutch civilians give flowers to the Germans and at a dance where the two tango face to face with obvious connotations of identity and mutual resemblance. Of the other friends Robby Eddie Habbema betrays his colleagues to save his girlfriend while another stays out of it entirely  one of only two surviving out of the initial group picture.

	onyx:emotionText "Paul Verhoeven's Soldaat van Oranje aka Soldier Of Orange the religious excesses of his Flesh  Blood 1985 not withstanding is probably the closest the director has come to an epic. At the equivalent of 2.5 million it was the most expensive Dutch feature film made at that time. It was also the film which brought him to the attention of Hollywood exemplified by Spielberg's phone call to him after seeing the film What are you doing in Holland? Come to the USA things are better there!   During his childhood in The Hague Verhoeven had been witness to the activities of the occupying Nazis which made a great impression on him. He remembers vividly his father hiding in a cellar and seeing dead bodies in the street for example. As one biographer has noted Soldier Of Orange was a theme he could taste feel and breathe a film shot with of honesty and verisimilitude if less of the director's characteristic excess though still with his distinctive vision and style. There are some familiar faces in the large cast Jeroen Krabb as Guus Le Jeune who took the lead in De Vierde Man aka The Fourth Man is a key protagonist and the svelte and goodlooking Rutger Hauer as the central character Erik Lanshof. The blond Hauer who had until now been utilised by Verhoeven as a working class hero in such films as Turks Fruit aka Turkish Delight 1973 and afterwards in Spetters 1980 is here transformed into a prosperous war hero modelled on Erik Roelfzema the author of the original dramatic memoir. Much of the fraught virility usually associated with Hauer is suppressed here although it briefly reappears during his dalliance with Susan Susan Penhaligon.   That ErikHauer is the focus of the film is suggested by his first appearance although the episodic nature of much that follows in the narrative sometimes sidelines his significance. He is inserted Zeliglike into opening newsreel footage the 'single aide' at the post war return of Queen Wilhemina. Like so many of his Dutch contemporaries Erik is comfortably well off a man to whom if only at first the conflict seems just another grand adventure. Previously the middle class had been presented in Verhoeven's work as exploiters as in Keetje Keeple 1975 or as sexually ludicrous in Wat Zen Ik? aka Business Is Business 1971. Such boisterous social irony is in the present film conspicuous by its absence as if the contemplation of war forced a different responsibility upon the filmmakers. Erik and his class of 193940 may sometimes be made effete but never risible.    Made at a time when Netherlanders were starting to face the realities of their wartime existence unpleasant facts about home collaboration and acquiescence to occupation Verhoeven's film confronts these issues with a tale of student friends torn apart by war having to face moral dilemmas and choices. Soldier Of Orange complete with its stirring title music is a title with a singular subject implying a monolithic view of an individual at war. But the film actually focuses on a plurality of men an ensemble of half a dozen privileged students each of them responding to the conflict in a different way. Although Erik is the nominal hero his actions are often ineffectual and have dubious results. His counterweight is Alex Derek de Lint. Having served in the Dutch army he sees his mother interned and decides to join the Waffen SS. The two meet only twice after at a parade where the Dutch civilians give flowers to the Germans and at a dance where the two tango face to face with obvious connotations of identity and mutual resemblance. Of the other friends Robby Eddie Habbema betrays his colleagues to save his girlfriend while another stays out of it entirely  one of only two surviving out of the initial group picture.   Soldier Of Orange begins aptly enough with an initiation ceremony. Cowed humiliated then celebratory Erik and the others have to undergo rituals to be accepted into the student body. Of course the mocking cruelties they undergo echo the Nazi repression of later on the fear the anal torture and the firing squads.

It's nice to know that in this era of Hollywood churning out films that look more like video games or music videos Verhoeven continues to make films that push envelopes and give the audience something to think about.Soldaat van Oranje like its American counterpart twenty years later is a film about war that takes its subject by the horns and doesn't let go at any moment. As we are introduced to the group of Dutch students whose eyes we see World War II through we see a reflection of one rarely acknowledged truth that numerous ordinary everyday people ignorant of what was really going on in Nazi Germany couldn't have cared less about what was going on. It was only when the reality of the war was brought to them as the Germans invaded Holland that these students sat up and took notice of what the war was doing to ordinary people. Indeed early on in the film Hauer's character even says that a spot of war would be exciting.Another reality that this film prefers to hit the viewer square in the face with is that while the war changed a lot of aspects of everyday life for everyone there were some things that stayed the same regardless. In the scene where Hauer's character is attempting to board a boat bound for England the German army's refusal to let the sailors on board prompts a quick back to the pub response from the workingclass sailors. Business as usual in that respect.Considering that this is a Paul Verhoeven film it is actually quite surprising how little violence there is to be found here. Granted it is not a family film and some of the torture scenes will make your blood boil as well as make some sick people like myself chuckle but unlike the film that Verhoeven made with numerous references to this one twenty years later there is surprisingly little blood and gore. Indeed unlike the sarcastic satire of Starship Troopers Soldaat Van Oranje tells its story in a restrained almost documentarylike manner that is surprising as well as creative.All in all I'd give Soldaat Van Oranje a qualified ten out of ten. It is not going to appeal to everyone and some just won't get it at all but it delivers a powerful story about the loss of innocence and freedom that should be required viewing in all schools not just Dutch ones. Oh and I cannot remember who said it but they are right about one thing the footage of the Queen returning to Dutch soil made me want to shout Oranje boven! and I am not even Dutch.".

The most touching part is set in May 1945 at the moment of the Liberation.  The part where Queen Wilhelmina steps onto Dutch soil after a fiveyear absence is an extremely emotional one.

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently when Spielberg saw 'Soldier Of Orange' he phoned Paul Verhoeven congratulating him and urging him to come to Hollywood. That took about ten years but in retrospect in might have been a big mistake. Despite an excellent Hollywood debut the savage science fiction satire 'RoboCop' still one of Verhoeven's best the directors movies have been mostly disappointing ever since. Just compare his most recent movie the lame 'Hollow Man' to this one. There's no denying that there has been a major drop in quality. 'Soldier Of Orange' is worth mentioning in the same breath as such classic war movies as Kubrick's 'Paths Of Glory' Fuller's 'The Big Red One' and Peckinpah's 'Cross Of Iron'. It's that good. Considering it was made by a director with a reputation for provocation and general outrageousness it plays it surprisingly straight and in my opinion is all the better for it. There is some violence but it is appropriate for the subject matter and there is very little sex. This is quite an epic story dealing with the fates of six University friends in Holland after the outbreak of WW2. The ensemble cast is excellent but Verhoeven favourites Rutger Hauer and Jeroen Krabbe are particularly outstanding. Hauer still has a strong cult following despite appearing in a string of bgrade movies for many years. Krabbe is best remembered by most movie fans as a Bond villain if he's remembered at all. It's such a shame neither actor achieved the international success they both deserved. Check out their performances in 'Soldier Of Orange' Krabbe's in 'The Fourth Man' and Hauer's in 'Flesh  Blood'. Verhoeven certainly got the best out of them both. The supporting cast also includes dependable Brit Edward Fox 'The Day Of The Jackal' and Susan Penhaligon of cult Aussie thriller 'Patrick'. 'Soldier Of Orange' will be quite an eye opener for anyone unfamiliar with Verhoeven's preHollywood output. It's a first rate war movie that has just about something for everyone. Highly recommended as is the equally good but very different 'Spetters' and 'The Fourth Man'.".

	schema:headline " Simply the best Dutch movie ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Successful war movies almost always depend on tone. We've seen so many battle films so many soldiers and so many tanks so many landings and invasions and spies dropped behind the lines that the actual subject matter itself is no longer enough for us. Movies like A BRIDGE TOO FAR may cost untold millions and be years in the making but for the most part we're just not moved. Good war movies don't necessarily need a message but they need a feeling We want to sense what the war experience was like for a specific group of people at a particular time. Thi movie creates that feeling as effectively probably as it can be created. It traces the stories of six Dutch soldiers through the years before and during World War II and at the movie's end we feel we know these people and have learned from their experiences. Although the film contains a great deal of suspense and a fair amount of violence it's not a garish adventure movie it's a human chronicle. And it involves us. That's all the more remarkable because this isn't a profoundly serious little film with a somber message but a big colorful expensive war moviethe most costly production in Dutch film history. Expensive war movies tend to linger forever on their great special effects they have a tendency to pose their heroes in front of collapsing buildings and expect us to be moved. SOLDIER OF ORANGE is big but it's lowkey. It's about how characters of ordinary human dimension might behave against the bewildering scale of a war. The movie's based on the memoirs of Erik Hazelhoff a Dutch war hero who escaped from Nazioccupied Europe landed in England was attached to the then hopelessly disorganized and ineffectual Dutch government in exile and spent the war on a series of espionage missions before finally joining up with the Royal Air Force and flying many missions. What's interesting is that the Hazelhoff character is shown doing all of these things and yet he doesn't emerge as a superhero he's just a capable brave man doing the next right thing. The film mostly follows Hazelhoff but it begins in the prewar years with six friendscollege students playing tennis hanging out together doubting war will really comeand it follows all six through the war. Four of them die one in a particularly horrible way in a concentration camp. By following all six lives over a period of years the film suggests the historical sweep of the war for many millions of lives SOLDIER OF ORANGE isn't just episodes strung together although it is episodic but a suggestion of how long the war must have seemed and how easily it must have seemed endless. The narrative structure is interesting. Instead of giving us a tightly knit plot with characters assigned to particular roles and functions it gives us a great many specific details. There are the scenes involving Queen Wilhelmina for example. In exile in England the dowager queen walks stiffly in her garden gravely absorbs the advice of her ministers receives delegations and conveys a dignity upon the situation through her very bearing for of course she had no real authority then at all. A subplot involving an underground Dutch radio operator is clothed in similar detail we know enough of his character to know why he turns informer and his decision is not simply cowardly but is almost understandable. Unforgivable but understandable. The movie is filled with perceptions like that.".

	onyx:emotionText "Successful war movies almost always depend on tone. We've seen so many battle films so many soldiers and so many tanks so many landings and invasions and spies dropped behind the lines that the actual subject matter itself is no longer enough for us. Movies like A BRIDGE TOO FAR may cost untold millions and be years in the making but for the most part we're just not moved. Good war movies don't necessarily need a message but they need a feeling We want to sense what the war experience was like for a specific group of people at a particular time. Thi movie creates that feeling as effectively probably as it can be created. It traces the stories of six Dutch soldiers through the years before and during World War II and at the movie's end we feel we know these people and have learned from their experiences. Although the film contains a great deal of suspense and a fair amount of violence it's not a garish adventure movie it's a human chronicle. And it involves us. That's all the more remarkable because this isn't a profoundly serious little film with a somber message but a big colorful expensive war moviethe most costly production in Dutch film history. Expensive war movies tend to linger forever on their great special effects they have a tendency to pose their heroes in front of collapsing buildings and expect us to be moved. SOLDIER OF ORANGE is big but it's lowkey. It's about how characters of ordinary human dimension might behave against the bewildering scale of a war. The movie's based on the memoirs of Erik Hazelhoff a Dutch war hero who escaped from Nazioccupied Europe landed in England was attached to the then hopelessly disorganized and ineffectual Dutch government in exile and spent the war on a series of espionage missions before finally joining up with the Royal Air Force and flying many missions. What's interesting is that the Hazelhoff character is shown doing all of these things and yet he doesn't emerge as a superhero he's just a capable brave man doing the next right thing. The film mostly follows Hazelhoff but it begins in the prewar years with six friendscollege students playing tennis hanging out together doubting war will really comeand it follows all six through the war. Four of them die one in a particularly horrible way in a concentration camp. By following all six lives over a period of years the film suggests the historical sweep of the war for many millions of lives SOLDIER OF ORANGE isn't just episodes strung together although it is episodic but a suggestion of how long the war must have seemed and how easily it must have seemed endless. The narrative structure is interesting. Instead of giving us a tightly knit plot with characters assigned to particular roles and functions it gives us a great many specific details. There are the scenes involving Queen Wilhelmina for example. In exile in England the dowager queen walks stiffly in her garden gravely absorbs the advice of her ministers receives delegations and conveys a dignity upon the situation through her very bearing for of course she had no real authority then at all. A subplot involving an underground Dutch radio operator is clothed in similar detail we know enough of his character to know why he turns informer and his decision is not simply cowardly but is almost understandable. Unforgivable but understandable. The movie is filled with perceptions like that.";

We see that it takes serious quick wit and nerves of steel to be a secret agent and that one can rarely count on the plan the phone that no longer took dimes was an exceptional and realistic surprise!  It is also one of the only films I have seen to take a look at the war from the Dutch perspective.  The people of the Netherlands were conquered by the Nazis and thus could strike back only by forming a resistance movement.  It is a great film and although miracles rarely happen I PRAY FOR THIS MOVIE'S RELEASE ON DVD!!!  Grade A.".

We follow him and some of his close friends as they take different paths during the early occupation of Nederland by the Nazis.  One of them becomes a nazi collaborator another is Jewish and does his best to defy the occupational troops the others join the resistance in varying degrees.  The story gets complex in its telling and you get an in depth look at how some civilians did their best to stay alive and help the war effort. The story focuses mostly on a Hauer's character.  I thought it was great that he was not a 'John WayneRambo' type of character.  Instead we find a chap who is a bit reluctant to do his part and is more concerned with surviving the war years.  This movie works on several levels.  I love espionage and this has plenty of it.  You also can look at it as a human drama to see how the war affects the comradery of the lads.  And for you gals out there there are some love scenes.  There are some great scenes that capture the spirit of the time. This movie can be added to the likes of Schindler's List Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan as great WWII movies.".

It follows them through the beginning of the war the Nazi occupation whose lives forever changed by the WWII invasion of Holland by the Nazis . It begins in Univerity Leiden the Netherlands  1938  with various young Dutch Students just before the outbreak of World War 2 and finishes with the liberation . As soon as the war starts many students join the resistance . Later on  Erik Lanshof Rutger Hauer is assigned by an exiled Queen Wilhelmina Andrea Domburg who used cotton paddings in her cheeks to better resemble Queen and his helper colonel Rafelli Edward Fox to carry out a dangerous mission during Nazi downfall.This thrilling  cerebral WWII picture is plenty of suspense emotion  action and is pretty entertaining . At the beginning there is an amusing introduction on students life in Leiden University and fraternity  in which we find the protagonists of this exciting story . The screenplay is full of plot twist and tension  the developing is kept everything moving fast and frantic to a climax guaranteed to make hearts pound. Based on actual events about Queen Wilhelmina and her real aidedecamp Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema the author of the book on which the film is screenwritten  even appearing in the opening scene a genuine newsreel footage . Based on real happenings  though some names of historic persons are modified  one of the reasons for the change in names may be that for clarity and simplicity the number of characters from the original story were reduced and as a consequence some historic actions are ascribed to other people in the movie so as to acknowledge this deviation from reality  some names may have been altered. It was shot entirely on real locations with the exception of the short sequence in the RAF bomber . Good acting by Rutger Hauer who made him an international star  he plays as a valiant official named Erik  though Director Paul Verhoeven originally wanted Derek De Lint to play Erik Lanshof the title character . He had previously directed Rutger Hauer in the Dutch television series Floris 1969 and the film Turks fruits 1973 and did not think Hauer was right for the lead in this picture . He then decided to give Hauer a try and Hauer surprised Verhoeven by giving a very strong reading with the result that Verhoeven cast him as Erik and De Lint as Alex . Rijk De Gooyer who plays Gestapo collaborator Breitner was part of the resistance in the Netherlands during World War II  as a result he harbored quite some antiGerman sentiments towards his fellow actor Reinhard Kolldehoff who plays Wehrmacht General Geisman . Carefully made and lavishly produced  as cost the equivalent of 2.5 million to produce making it the mostexpensive Dutch film made at the time. Nice special effects  as the explosions were provided not by technicians but by the Dutch Marines  as director Paul Verhoeven stated that the explosive charges were held in place with metal  when one of the charges was set off it blew the metal to bits  even one of the flying fragments nearly killed star Rutger Hauer . When the production ran out of budget a British film company and a Dutch television company provided additional financial support under the condition that the material was also adapted into a four part miniseries which was retitled For Queen and Fatherland.".

Because of his activities in the second world war Erik was awarded by the Queen to become her personal adjudant a soldier of orange orange being the house colour of the dutch royal family.The fact that this movie is so good is that it clearly shows how people and in this movie students make choices in the war and how these choices made affect relationships between these people. There are a few keyfigures in this movie Erik being the main character and the rest of his student friends e.g. Alex Guus. During his study of law in Leiden the Germans invade the Netherlands. After a five days of fighting the Germans occupy the Netherlands completely. After a few months some students including Erik start a resistance against the Germans. After a few amateuristic attempts most of them get arrested by the Germans and the rest of the band keeps quiet. Not all of the band have joined the resistance some favour the Germans like Alex. Alex starts to fight for Germany and therefore turns away from Erik and the rest. In the movie this can be seen as Erik sees him again in the Hague during a fare well parade of the dutch SS volunteers which are going to fight in Russia. The parade turns to the right of the screen and Erik goes the other way Erik joined the resistance. The band of students which was so close at the start of the war falls apart during the war.Another thing that makes the movie that good is the fact that it shows that the collaboration in the Netherlands was massive during the Second World War and most of the resistance was amateurism. When all London activities are cancelled to start a network of resistance in the Netherlands Erik joins the RAF. Not because he is convinced that Germany is wrong but because he has the opportunity to do so he likes the adventure in the movie he says little bit of war always fun  een beetje oorlog altijd leuk. For the same reason Erik could have joined the luftwaffe if the opportunity to do so was there.Summary the movie gives a nice picture of the dutch people during the Second World War some people joined the resistance much people collaborated and alas the most of the dutch people kept quiet and hoped to live to see the end of the war in the most possitive case they performed passive resistance against the Germans. In the movie there was a nice scene at the end. Erik finds a band brother who tells him he is so proude that he gratuated during the war he took clandestine exams.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Verhoeven's signature ironic detachment from the graphic violence in his work has reasonably been attributed to his experiences as a young Dutch child during the Nazi Occupation. What I've always admired about him has been his use of sardonic indifference with films like RoboCop Starship Troopers and Spetters but with Soldier of Orange there doesn't seem to be anything discerning his vision from that of other war film directors who've had less or no eyewitness or everyday experience with war. Though thankfully it is not without unabashed Dutchnessthe Queen is anything but strict with her loyal underlings' sense of manners sex and exhibitionist affection is in no way taboo in any presented dynamic and Rutger Hauer's response to his sometime lover spitting beer in his face is I love youits framework is in a sense American. It is a spy thriller that begins and ends like a comingofage film about a circle of aloof airy friends some of whom make it to the end and some of whom don't.In some way upon reflection I can see how this early effort by Verhoeven and his two regular preU.S. stars Hauer and Jeroen Krabbe benefits from its incongruous lack of involvement. It is the story of people who don't understand the import of what is truly happening until it literally hits home and find that loyalty grows to be more and more of an illusion. Thus it seems to aesthetically make a degree of sense for the story to unfold at arm's length as if we can never quite know who will live die or turn on us. But still wouldn't this film be so much better if it did not keep its distance? Isn't it the point for us to feel betrayed and angered by the unraveling of events? In any case I could still be wrong as the clich love triangles token romantic interests and ignored moral dichotomies of seemingly incidental things certain characters do abound.Perhaps Verhoeven was not yet ready to make the Dutch Resistance film he knew he should make. His filmography can often look like the work of someone who is cynically desensitized to violence and other sorts of cruelty but it can also often look like the work of someone's defense mechanism against how it has affected him. It wasn't until 2006 when Black Book was released when we saw his true and personal vision of a story set during this time. We have authentic emotional reactions to everything that happens in that tremendous film which as it turns out is surely Verhoeven's best work as if his previous films had all been his way of wrestling with the feelings with which he had to come to terms in order to make it just as the Dutch in this film seem to remain aloof perhaps in quiet ambiguous defense of what could happen to them at any moment.".

It is up to man itself to believe what he wants to believe just to survive or live life in a proud way and die for a good cause? Nowhere in the universe it is written how it should be and this movie shows this in a very good and neutral way. Sometimes I can agree with the somewhat cold Rutger Hauer character to just survive and I can understand the student in the end that did nothing in the war but survived! Also the people that went along with the Germans you see it happen and somehow only in this movie they could be just like you and me and making the bad choice as we know it now. As a character of Sartre once said in The roads to freedom one day is enough to find out whether you are a hero or a coward. Personally I never got over that picture where all those young men were once alive but no more. Especially Guus one of the very best characters ever on the screen brilliantly depicted by Jeroen Krabbe  I still hate Paul Verhoeven and the War for not allowing him to make it to peace!

This is not really a war story but a story about evolving personalities. People become heroes or traitors almost by circumstance. The Second World War is merely a catalyst for this evolution.Please go see it on DVD out in sort notice and prove me right or wrong.

	schema:reviewBody "Human Desire is NOT one of Fritz Lang's masterpieces. Though it has its moments it ultimately comes off as a secondrate work. A remake of Jean Renoir's 1938 La bete Humaine starring Jean Gabin Human Desire is less successful than Renoir's adaptation of the Zola novel but when all things considered it is not bad and is filled with some interesting geometric images  visuals. The film turns out to be gloomy often bleak melodrama that has a striking affinity with Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity in its plot dealing with a married woman Gloria Grahame trying to get rid of her bland husband Broderick Crawford through the help of a train engineer Glenn Ford. If you stop concentrating on the melodramatic plot and focus on Lang's lovely architectural compositions Human Desire becomes quite engrossing picture on par with The Big Heat Lang's previous film noir with Grahame  Ford. From the first image to the last the scenes of railroad tracks are masterfully handled we see a series of precise lines and converging tracks moving forward. Moreover Grahame and Crawford's rooms in their working class house are characterized by a series of squares boxes rectangles to conjure up a nightmarish vision of fate and destiny. Also it is worth noting that in the same house we see the appearance of television for the first time in Lang's films. Lang will later explore the dangers of media manipulation in his last two American films While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Human Desire is directed by Fritz Lang and adapted for the screen by Alfred Hayes from the story The Human Beast written by mile Zola. It stars Glenn Ford Gloria Grahame and Broderick Crawford. Music is by Daniele Amfitheatrof and Burnett Guffey is the cinematographer. The story had been filmed twice before as Die Bestie im Menschen in 1920 and La Bte humaine in 1938.The plot revolves around a love triangle axis involving Jeff Warren Ford Vicki Buckley Grahame and Carl Buckley Crawford. Crawford's Railroad Marshall gets fired and asks his wife Viki to sweet talk one of the yards main investors John Owens Grandon Rhodes into pressuring his yard boss into giving him his job back. But there is a history there and Carl is beset with jealousy when Viki is away for far too long. It's his jealousy that will start the downward spiral of events that will change their lives forever with Jeff firmly in the middle of the storm.The Production Code of the time ensured that Fritz Lang's take on the Zola novel would be considerably toned down. Thus some of the sex and violence aspects in the narrative give way to suggestion or aftermath. However for although it may not be in the top tier of Lang's works it's still an involving and intriguing picture seeping with film noir attributes. It features a couple of wretched characters living a bleak existence what hope there is is in short supply and pleasures are futile stymied by jealousy and murder. Thrust in to the middle of such hopelessness is the bastion of good and pure honesty Jeff Warren fresh from serving his country in the Korean War. Lusted after by the sweet daughter of his friend and landlord Kathleen Case and Edgar Buchanan respectively Jeff back in employment at the rail yard has it all going for him. But as the title suggests human beings are at times at the mercy of their desires and it's here where Lang enjoys pitting his three main characters against their respective fates. All set to the backdrop of a cold rail yard and the trains that work out of that steely working class place Guffey's photography in sync with desolation of location and the characters collision course of fate.Featuring two of the principal cast from The Big Heat 1953 it's a very well casted picture. Grahame is a revelation as the amoral wife stung by unfulfillment sleazy yet sexy Grahame makes Vicki both alluring and sympathetic. Lang had wanted Rita Hayworth for the role but a child custody case prevented her from leaving the country much of the film was shot in Canada so in came Grahame and film noir got another classic femme fatale. Ford could play an everyman in his sleep so this was an easy role for him to fill but that's taking nothing away from the quality of his performance because he's the cooling glue holding the film together. Crawford offers up another in his line of hulking brutes with this one pitiful as he has anger issues take a hold his original crime being only that he wants to desperately please his uncaring wife. Strong support comes from Buchanan Case and Diane DeLaire.Adultery jealousy murder and passion dwells within Human Desire a highly accomplished piece of film noir from the gifted Fritz Lang. 7.510".

Whereas in Renoir's movie the train and its engineer seem to be wild beasts which have to be kept under control by tight regulations Lang's engineer is a regular guy who has returned from the Korean war and just yearns to be back on the tracks again. He clearly wants order regularity and predictability in his life the very things which seem to destroy the Broderick Crawford character who appears to be the real beast in Human Desire. His counterpart in the Renoir movie is an authority figure in the railroad system who more than anything else wants to keep up a front of respectability.Gloria Grahame's character is less a femme fatale like cocky Simone Simon in La bte humaine than a true victim who has suffered on the hands of different men. She really looks exhausted and seems to have given up on life. In the vain hope that war experience has awakened the beast in the train engineer she succeeds in rousing some passion in him but it is not enough for his murdering her husband who really is a bad character for whom it is hard to feel any pity. The final scene very much looks like her executing a carefully planned suicidescheme which also definitely brings down her evil husband.Both movies show that the layer of civilization is pretty thin. Lang's Human Desire distinguishes itself for being a careful probe into the social conditions of the USA in the first part of the 1950ies which is also evident in the careful set design. On several occasions the engineer talks about his war experiences which led him to have new esteem for the merits of order and civilization. It is an important item in Human Desire. Up to you to decide if this makes it a pro or an anti war movie.".

The plot has some inescapable holes in it but the drama and tension build fairly well first because of his tortuous marriage with Grahme which seems to go with the film's title as the marriage is a sham that represents another unattainable desire for him.

The plot has some inescapable holes in it but the drama and tension build fairly well first because of his tortuous marriage with Grahme which seems to go with the film's title as the marriage is a sham that represents another unattainable desire for him. He carries the part off all the way to end.";

Human desire aspires to be a hardhitting gutsy crime picture that shows not only a story of romance bound to fail from the start but also makes a series of aggressive comments on the topic of alcoholism and pathology in families.When Jeff Warren Glenn Ford returns home after serving his time in Korea his only dream is to return back to his steady job as a train engineer. Unfortunately on his way he meets a vulgar abusive Carl Buckley Broderick Crawford. The man is in desperate need of an intervention in order to keep his job and begs his beautiful wife Vicki Gloria Grahame to stand by him during the meeting with his boss. However due to his alcohol addiction and distorted mind Carl thinks that she met with Owens so as to flirt with him. On the train back Carl kills the man and Jeff  who was very close to the whole action  bumps into Vicky and quickly develops feelings for her. She on the other hand wants to take advantage of his generosity. Being abused by her raging husband she finds solace in the arms of a stranger. However in a small city every rumor spreads faster than the wind. Carl starts drinking more and more and blackmails Vicky with a letter into staying with him for as long as they'll live. Vicky soon comes up with a devilish plan to get rid of her disgraceful hubby... The film owes much to the mightily effective and spellbinding photography. It portrays not only America's working class but also many intrain sequences which give the film a muchdeserved claustrophobic feel. The intensity of the atmosphere goes through the roof as the characters argue and fight inside the small compartments making their disputes even more dramatic and realistic than they are. Human Desire may not be Fritz Lang's masterpiece but it surely deserves a view for it is a violently sombre tale about regular people who bring about their own demise through a series of tragic misunderstandings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Human Desire 1954 is technically a remake of Jean Renoir's La Bete Humaine 1938 which featured Spencer Tracy lookalike Jean Gabin and Simone Simon which itself was an adaptation of French Naturalist writer Emile Zola's novel. But director Fritz Lang takes his version in an entirely different direction turning the story from psychological thriller to film noir masterpiece by focusing on the twotiming woman Vicki Buckley  played by Gloria Grahame.Renoir's La Bete Humaine had instead focused on the exploring the mind of Gabin's protagonist Lantier specifically his genetic curse of brutality and rage. His occupation of train engineer and the images of train tracks are used to reinforce the inevitability of his fate.In Lang's version this character Jeff Warren  played by Glenn Ford has no dimensionality the train tracks reinforce his straight and narrow nature he is not bent and his train engine must be placed in a roundhouse to be given a different direction.There are intersecting tracks in the train yard and Jeff's moral compass is only challenged in that location. The film's two most suspenseful sequences occur in the train yard and Lang amplifies the discordance with disorienting changes of camera angles and at one point an expressionistic jumpcut as Jeff and Vicki suddenly bridge the distance between each other.But this is Grahame's film her alltime best performance and Lang's best work as an acting for the camera director. She gently teases this role when others would fill it with overwrought melodrama. Her Vicki Buckley is the most authentic and complex heroinefatale of the Film Noir genre perhaps of all cinema. The character is a canvas filled with shades of gray at once manipulative vulnerable selfdestructive and haunting. Much of Grahame's effectiveness is nonverbal and much of it derives from her physical qualities and inherent fragility. All very fitting as Zola was the pioneer of literary naturalism.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

And no wonder  remember this is Glenn Ford. One of the railroad bosses Carl Buckley Crawford loses his job in a fit of temper and asks his wife Vicki Grahame to appeal to a wealthy and powerful family friend to help him get his job back.

Blind with anger Buckley makes her write a letter saying she will meet the man in his train compartment. Buckley kills him there and keeps the letter to hold over Vicki.As she was seen near the murder compartment Vicki flirts with Ford to keep her out of the investigation and eventually they become involved. That's when Vicki starts hinting around that she needs the letter found and her husband dead  not necessarily in that order.Not being familiar with the source material I can't comment on this film as well as some others here. The postwar era was not Lang's strongest he seems to have fallen out of favor and not getting the budgets or the scripts he once did. That being said this is a very absorbing noir with Gloria Grahame being completely hateful and Ford being Mr. Nice Guy who is in this woman's clutches. Crawford's character is an odd one he's presented as a good guy and then suddenly he goes off and becomes a total madman.What makes this film is the sexual tension between Ford and Grahame. Ford was a wonderful movie star but with a limited range. What he had going for him beside good looks was major sex appeal and while Grahame burns he smolders. They make a hot team.Perhaps the story and characters could have been fleshed out more as it is it's entertaining with good directing acting and some interesting shots. Great for noir fans.".

	schema:headline " Fritz Lang derailed";
	schema:reviewBody "After a series of fantastic directorial achievements Fritz Lang settled in Hollywood. And he learned too well how to let his creative mind be overwhelmed by social conventions. How distressing. Yes Fritz Lang became a conventional filmmaker dealing with social issues but with the conventional stiff characters the American audience was suppose to root for the sanctified common man.

As we learned in the beginning that Glenn Ford nice American boy just comes back from Korea I was hoping to see him show a dark side. No way he's a star designed to smile in studio stills. What's left is a cold rail of anecdotal plot points droning to a ohsomoral conclusion. Yep it totally misses the mark.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie for the second time the other day. First time round as a young man I watched this and enjoyed it relieved that the hero doesn't get dragged down by the heartless femme fatale. now quarter of a century I see it somewhat differently and am disappointed in the lack of clarity concerning Gloria Grahame's character. For the first half of the film she elicits much sympathy we can see that she has had a rough life and was probably raped as a 16 year old by the man whom her husband made her go and beg for a job. Knowing her as he did he was suspicious of what favours Owens the dirty old manprospective employer and once she gets him his job back by undergoing further abuse he beats her up then takes her with him to watch him kill the guy! He then proceeds to blackmail her. Earlier comments describing Grahame's character as pure evil and heartless were surely not paying enough attention. Unfortunately as the film develops and Glenn Ford's Jeff gets involved as her lover it seems that Lang loses the thread also. As he now becomes the primary focus there is a requirement for a moral imperative within the ending. Hard war vet Jeff rejects Gloria's pleas and brings a statement of peace to her refusing to kill her husband he condemns her to death by leaving her to him. The irony of all this is that the 30 something Jeff is now going to look forward to having his way with the teenage daughter of his best friend. Anyway this is a pretty good film despite this with many good performances especially Gloria Grahame and a sublime piece of acting from Broderick Crawford as the abusive killer husband who just can't keep up with life. Good filming of trains and what looks like documentary footage also. At times the sets and filming felt oppressive nothing new there though with the often wonderful Fritz. Not his best but make a point of watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is Fritz Lang so one would expect lots of dark emotion double crossing and sexual tension. Well you won't be disappointed. This one has it all. The story is hardly original. In fact Emile Zola was given story credit. It is a love triangle with Broderick Crawford and Gloria Grahame as an unhappy couple with Glenn Ford at his somnambulistic best showing all the emotion of a turnip. Watching him try to generate the emotion required to be the catalyst in a love triangle was almost painful. In fact he almost sinks this movie into cinematic obscurity. Thankfully it is resurrected by the performances of his costars. I am always amazed at the on screen sexuality of Gloria Grahame. She is hardly your typical Hollywood beauty. Her features are somehow askew but she absolutely exudes sex. The other redeeming performance is given by Broderick Crawford. He plays her jealous out of control husband. He has a natural explosive persona but in this movie I kept waiting for him to fly off the rails.Speaking of rails. This is a train noir if there is such a thing. It all takes place around aboard and about trains. Glenn Ford is an engineer and Crawford the yard boss. Train buffs will love it. There are numerous scenes of the engineer and passenger compartments the rail yards the roundhouse and plenty of rambling track shots. It is all diesel in the '50's which I think most people would agree was the zenith of train travel in the US.Despite it's predictability and some of it's shortcomings I still found this movie extremely enjoyable. My only real complaint came at the end which seemed to leave the viewer at loose ends and feeling somewhat bewildered. Still if you like trains and dark drama take a look. It hasn't been around much and the title is fairly generic so it isn't easy to find but it is certainly worth the effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film noir is a mood a state of mind in a film world. It doesn't just have to be guys with guns nor is it just infidelity and murder. But it usually rests on dark streets and in rooms with the lights off with sultry women average Joes and Big Heavys who are the bane of any person's existence and sometimes it's just based on the narration the setting the way a character stares at one another or holds on a kiss. Human Desire Fritz Lang's update of Emile Zola's book La bete Humaine and also made into the wonderful film of the same name by Jean Renoir a kind of prenoir example in the 30's is drenched in noir and it's a wonderful example of what could be done with the right actors  or seemingly the right ones all the way through  and the right setting. It's set among workers on trains as an engineer Jeff played by Glenn Ford comes back from Korea and is back a work a nice but quiet type usually and also works with Broderick Crawford's Carl. Carl is a big louse of a man jealous as hell of his wife but contradictory in that he asks him to do a 'favor' in order to get his job back from his wife. She goes to see this bossman but Crawford ain't havin' it he goes ahead and kills the guy on a train and Glenn Ford's character suspects something having seen Vicki come out of the same car. But he also kinda sorta falls for her if only by a sudden kiss moment and she tries to egg him on to 'get rid' of Carl who has become a total drunk and waste after killing a man. Some guys just can't take it but can Jeff go that far? And for a dame?Sounds like a book title matter of fact it was at some point but it's how Lang presents these characters in shadows and among the grime of the trains and tracks and those dark rooms that make things interesting. It's also good that there's a side character here Ellen played by Kathleen Case as a way of giving some pause from the main plot she's a younger woman who takes a fancy to Jeff as he comes back from the East and has a kimono for her. Lang makes us wonder is this dame Vicki Jeff's only choice? Hopefully not but the dilemma makes for some great chemistry for the two actors and the tension is ratcheted up as Jeff has to ponder taking the next step for Vicki or to not as Carl isn't a stranger to him and this isn't fighting in a war. Ford is fine in the role he's in and Crawford gets to ham it up with his drunken ahole of a husband who occasionally shows signs of regret he's not all blackandwhite morally but as in noir has shades of grays. But with Grahame I wasn't totally sure about her performance at least at first. She's playing something different than her previous Lang role in The Big Heat where she was just a fullon moll. Here she's a housewife but one with a checkered past we don't know of entirely till near the final reel. She acts a little duplicitous but I wasn't always believing her acting even if she looked the part of a femme fatale. It's a strange thing since she isn't bad in the role just inconsistent and it was mostly due to some good chemistry with Ford who he himself is a little stiff in a nonbadassvillain role but stuff dependable that I could believe her in the part.Lang also gets some moments for pure cinema that is without much dialog and just the physical locations and scenes like how Jeff just motions for a cigarette and drives away as the engineer on the train or how he tracks Carl one night coming back from a bar drunk. And sometimes the body language and way shots are framed tells a lot about the disconnect of these people in the aftermath of the murder one night we see Carl and Vicki at home having dinner very torn apart and how they're placed in the house separated by kitchen and living room or on other side tells a lot about where they're at even when they don't say much. Things like that or how Jeff and Vicki are lit outside by the tracks at night contemplating their lovelust for one another is done with such emotion that is just fine.Other times there is some melodrama and again Crawford does ham it up in some scenes to where it comes close to unintentional hilarity the crowd I saw the movie with laughed at a few key moments that would've probably been deadsilent back in the day but this may be more for the change in times than anything else. If it's not quite as great as Renoir's film it's that it's not aiming as high artistically I think. Renoir's film is a tragic romance while this is more of a Bthriller with some aspirations for high artistry. It's not to say it's a pale imitation of that film but it's just different. Lang's world is a bit colder more cynical more untrusting of what humanity is capable of except the occasional good and usually evil tasks. No one character in Human Desire gets off the hook except maybe Ellen but the varying degrees makes for a strong comment on postwar morality a defining characteristic between Lang and Renoir's adaptations.In other words Human Desire is cool and brutal and more than a bit sexy and if it's not all great there's enough here for buffs to chew on.".

	schema:headline " The Destructive Power Of Unbridled Passions";
	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang's Human Desire is based on Emile Zola's novel La Bete Humaine which had previously been made into a movie directed by Jean Renoir in 1938. For Lang's version the time frame was changed to the 1950s the action was relocated to the United States and some modifications were made to satisfy the requirements of studio bosses and the production code. What remains however is still a very powerful and grim tale about a couple who are driven by their most base instincts into acts of deceit blackmail adultery and murder. These people are not only unencumbered by any type of moral code but also by their actions have a corrupting effect on a more passive character who is also a mutual acquaintance.Railroad official Carl Buckley Broderick Crawford is fired from his job for insubordination and begs his wife Vicki Gloria Grahame to approach her mother's former employer the influential John Owens Grandon Rhodes to get him to persuade Carl's exemployer to change his mind and reemploy him. After Vicki completes her mission quickly and successfully Carl becomes suspicious about the method she'd used to induce Owens to cooperate so readily and in a fit of jealousy and rage beats her and forces her to write a letter to Owens. The letter is an invitation for Owens to meet Vicki on a train at an arranged time on the following day.Owens and Vicki meet as arranged but Carl who'd accompanied Vicki uses his knife to kill Owens and removes Vicki's letter from his victim's pocket and steals his money to make it appear that the murder was connected with a robbery. Railroad engineer Jeff Warren Glenn Ford is standing in the train corridor when the couple want to leave Owens' compartment and so Carl tells Vicki to encourage Jeff away from the area which she duly does. Jeff and Vicki go into another compartment and talk but when he kisses her she runs away.At the inquest into Owens' death Jeff doesn't admit that he'd seen Vicki near the crime scene and when he sees her next she tells him a fabricated version of what happened on the train and also about her husband's abusive behaviour towards her. She shows Jeff some of her bruises and shortly after they embark on an affair.Some time later Vicki tells Jeff the truth about the murder the incriminating content of her letter to Owens and the fact that Carl had kept the letter to ensure her future cooperation. However when Carl gets fired from his job for the second time Vicki says that she's terrified about his reaction if he discovers the truth about her affair and tries to persuade Jeff to murder her husband. What Jeff ultimately does has a critical effect on both their futures.Carl's volatile nature had been the original cause of him losing his job and his subsequent irrational outbursts of violence and jealousy then led him into wife beating blackmail and murder and his drunkenness and apparent lack of remorse made his relationship with Vicki even more toxic. Broderick Crawford is impressively powerful and menacing as the brutish Carl whose actions are determined by the destructive force of his unbridled passions.Vicki is a victim of Carl's behaviour but is also manipulative mendacious and totally unscrupulous. Gloria Grahame captures perfectly her character's devious nature and changing moods as well as her unashamed willingness to be involved in a plan to murder her husband.Jeff had returned from military service in Korea and in the movie's earliest scenes shows the natural type of contentment he enjoys as a passive man whose aspirations are modest. Glenn Ford then shows as the action continues how Jeff's demeanour alters as he becomes morally compromised enough to withhold information from the murder inquest before getting involved in an affair with the untrustworthy Vicki and then taking part in a plot to kill her husband.Human Desire is ultimately an engaging and sordid story about people who act without reason logic or compassion and in the process corrupt or inflict misery on those with whom they come into contact.".

The letter is an invitation for Owens to meet Vicki on a train at an arranged time on the following day.Owens and Vicki meet as arranged but Carl who'd accompanied Vicki uses his knife to kill Owens and removes Vicki's letter from his victim's pocket and steals his money to make it appear that the murder was connected with a robbery. Railroad engineer Jeff Warren Glenn Ford is standing in the train corridor when the couple want to leave Owens' compartment and so Carl tells Vicki to encourage Jeff away from the area which she duly does. Jeff and Vicki go into another compartment and talk but when he kisses her she runs away.At the inquest into Owens' death Jeff doesn't admit that he'd seen Vicki near the crime scene and when he sees her next she tells him a fabricated version of what happened on the train and also about her husband's abusive behaviour towards her. She shows Jeff some of her bruises and shortly after they embark on an affair.Some time later Vicki tells Jeff the truth about the murder the incriminating content of her letter to Owens and the fact that Carl had kept the letter to ensure her future cooperation. However when Carl gets fired from his job for the second time Vicki says that she's terrified about his reaction if he discovers the truth about her affair and tries to persuade Jeff to murder her husband. What Jeff ultimately does has a critical effect on both their futures.Carl's volatile nature had been the original cause of him losing his job and his subsequent irrational outbursts of violence and jealousy then led him into wife beating blackmail and murder and his drunkenness and apparent lack of remorse made his relationship with Vicki even more toxic. Broderick Crawford is impressively powerful and menacing as the brutish Carl whose actions are determined by the destructive force of his unbridled passions.Vicki is a victim of Carl's behaviour but is also manipulative mendacious and totally unscrupulous. Gloria Grahame captures perfectly her character's devious nature and changing moods as well as her unashamed willingness to be involved in a plan to murder her husband.Jeff had returned from military service in Korea and in the movie's earliest scenes shows the natural type of contentment he enjoys as a passive man whose aspirations are modest. Glenn Ford then shows as the action continues how Jeff's demeanour alters as he becomes morally compromised enough to withhold information from the murder inquest before getting involved in an affair with the untrustworthy Vicki and then taking part in a plot to kill her husband.Human Desire is ultimately an engaging and sordid story about people who act without reason logic or compassion and in the process corrupt or inflict misery on those with whom they come into contact.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fine Fritz Lang thriller loosely based it seems to me on Emile Zola's superb The Beast in Man novel. I'll try not to insert too many railway clichs herein and keep my comments firmly on track! It's difficult to view this late Lang filmnoir without referencing the other thrillermaestro Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train which predates it by a few years but here by contrast almost all the action takes place on or around trains or stations. The story is involving if slightly unbelievable in terms of some of the coincidences we're asked to swallow but under Lang's sure direction the leads deliver wholly convincing performances. Glenn Ford is fine in his role as the returning Korean vet. ensnared by the wiles of Gloria Grahame as the sensual but unhappy young wife of his yard's older assistant manager Broderick Crawford. Oblivious to the charms of the attractive and obviously smitten young daughter of his coengineerlandlord he is lured sirenlike by Grahame's more overt sexual charms almost to the extent of committing murder on her behalf. Grahame is great oscillating between initially almost pathetic submissiveness to her boorish drunken but still jealous older husband to the reignition of her womanly passions as Ford moves into her orbit and lastly as the conniving schemer who eggs Ford onto to kill the unwanted husband. The love scenes between Ford and Grahame certainly stoke the flames of the film's provocative title. Best of all again in a filmstealing role is Broderick Crawford as the cuckolded husband the sweat beading off his forehead and the seedy stubble covering his face as he descends to dissipation. Some of the scenes are excellently lit particularly a couple of interior shots in Grahame's hotel room while there's an excellent highdolly shot displaying the director's invention and vision as Ford trails the drunken Crawford through the railway yard in the dusk. The scene where Ford's young love interest gets all emotional is overplayed however with tears cascading down her face like she'd peeled a whole bag of onions! There are also probably too many stock shots of railway tracks inserted into the narrative but that would be nitpicking. But on the whole this is another superior feature by Fritz Lang and one of the best filmnoirs you could hope to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike most of the reviews here I see this films as a treatise on broken and betrayed love.First there is the innocent love of the family daughter who looks up to Jeff as the hero returned from the war. This love is betrayed by Jeff not being the man of her dreams but rather somewhat proficient womanizer who acquires interest in Vicky the wife of his work colleague Carl.Second there is the love of Vicki to her husband Carl which is betrayed by Carl's stupid and insensitive character. Carl having been fired from his job because of his rowdy nature pushes Vicki against her will to 'negotiate' the job back through Vicki's former 'contacts' to a top level railroad employee Owens. Vicki refuses multiple times  a history of abuse is hinted between her and Owens. However insensitive Carl fails to catch the reasons of Vicki's refusal and pushes her against her will until she yields to her husband. Only when now disillusioned Vicki returns from a hours long 'negotiations' with her former boss and heads to the shower Carl begins to suspect something is wrong.Third there is the brutal dependent and jealous love of Carl to his wife Vicki. Carl smitten by jealousy develops a plan. He forces Vicki to play along by writing a letter summoning Owens to a secret rendezvous in a train sleeper carriage. There Carl murders him and takes Vicki's letter from the body to be used as a guarantee against her.Through Carl's actions love between them is broken. Consequently Vicki begins an affair with Jeff who saw her in the train at the night of the murder. The relationship develops into love with the pair meeting behind Carl's back at railroad yard shacks and Vicki's relative's apartment. However in a small town such an affair cannot be concealed. The illfated and illchosen desire causes suffering and alienation. A plan develops to rid Vicki of Carl  now a once again sacked drunk who drowns his sorrows at the local watering hole. But Jeff can't bring himself to kill such a defenseless man. He grabs the letter unknown by Carl and returns it to Vicki at the same time dumping her. Vicki who is now free pleads and cries for Jeff to take her but he refuses coldly and walks away from the mess while suspecting that Vicki has for the whole time only been using him.The definitive moment of the movie for me comes at the train car in which Vicki now free but manifestly alone plans to ride away. Carl stumbles in the car and just in the same way as Vicki moments ago he in a humiliated manner laments his love and need for her and pleads for her to stay even offering to give her the incriminating letter which she already has. But as Vicki had learned nothing. Just like Jeff walked away she too rejects Carl's desperate plea similar to her own. When the train with Jeff in its cabin  dance tickets given to him by the employee's daughter in his hand  speeds in the distance Carl strangles Vicki in the compartment.Love is actually not the Hollywood solution to everything and the force that makes one overcome every obstacle. Rather it can be very ugly confusing and depressing human desire.I'm giving this movie a rare 1010. Aside from excellent directing and especially wonderful lighting e.g. Jeff and Vicki in the rail yard shack when you try to hide you are actually right at the spotlight I very much enjoyed Lang's interpretation of the source material. Unlike Zola's original which seems nihilistic to me Lang's interpretation is realistic and does not fall into unnecessary celebration of inhumanity. That is it's strength. Though the murky waters of depraved love abound there is yet hope and a glimpse of true love in the form of the dance tickets in Jeff's hands.".

Finally in the denouement of the story Grahame decides to take revenge on her drunken and emotionally shattered husband by taunting him about her past sexual exploits. Not exactly something a sensible person would be likely to do with an insanely jealous and murderous husband.On the plus side the dark mazelike train yard and the ominous threatening power of the heavy locomotives make for some interesting noir imagery. And Gloria Grahame with her odd voice and pursed lips exudes an intense and slightly perverse sexuality that makes her fairly convincing in the femme fatal role she adopts toward Glenn Ford.In all not a worthless film but perhaps one for film noir completists only.".

In my book no amount of train track symbolism can compensate for such generally lackluster results given the story potential. Ten years earlier Lang proved his way with wanton women and driven men in the sublime Scarlet Street 1945. Here however with similar ingredients the mix never gels into anything more memorable than a programmer leaving us instead with bits and pieces of what might have been.Now Glenn Ford proved he could do interestingly ambivalent characters as in The Big Heat 1953. Nonetheless his working stiff Jeff Warren is just thattoo stiff to be convincing as the wayward fall guy for Vicki's dark scheme. As an actor Ford always understated but here the lowkey is carried to a fault creating a basically dull and uninteresting character. It also doesn't help that his character is rather poorly written as other reviewers have pointed out. Then there's Crawford who had generally one single screen personaa loudmouth boor. As a killer he's fine as a guy that even the needy Vicki might settle for he's an unlikely stretch. That leaves the poutylipped vamping of Grahame's Vicki to carry the drama which she does in a part I expect she could do in her sleep.At the same time compare the visual styling here with that of the earlier Scarlet Street. The latter shows genuine expressionist artistry with light and shadow. This noir by contrast comes across as one of the dullest grays on record. You know a noir is in trouble when the most interesting visuals are Canadian train tracks. Then too I expect the cultural climate of the McCarthy year 1953 worked against both the script and Lang. As a result we get the good girl Ellen subplot that dangles like a loose appendage. Its purpose I suppose is to provide a wholesome contrast to bad girl Vicki. The effect however is that of a weakening distraction. At the same time the narrative could have used at least two revealing sex scenes. Some such would have brought out the vulnerable side of both Jeff and Carl making their characters more interesting and their actions more believable. But the period's paralyzing Production Code makes sure that we get nothing more than pallid hints of the real human desire that drives these characters to their doom.I haven't seen the Renoir original. But even within the Lang catalogue the film's a disappointment. Given his career trajectory in America it's hardly surprising that he chose to end filmmaking back in his native Germany.".

	schema:headline " Sincere generally wellcrafted story about the farreaching effects of childhood trauma lovingly directed by Streisand and grounded by Nick Nolte's profoundly moving performance.";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the 80s and 90s Barbra Streisand has grown in stature albeit sporadically as a formidable producer and director of social drama for both films and TV.  The apex of her behindthecamera career came with The Prince of Tides a poignant study of a man coping with the longterm effects of childhood trauma.  Streisand nurtures this pet project from start to finish coadapted by Pat Conroy from his epic novel finding a precise heartbeat for the profoundly sentient piece.  Despite a rather protracted love story and one too many climaxes Streisand who also costars never loses sight of the novel's primary intent.Streisand graciously hands the spotlight over to actor Nick Nolte who gives the most sensitive emotionally complex performance of his varied career. Tom Wingo is a walking shell of a man who quells his pain with a drink an easy smile a cleverly foul remark and a bitter uncontrollable outpouring of anger.  A onetime Southernbred football coachturnedteacher he has grown increasingly irresponsible and disconnected over the years.  With a troubled marriage hovering over him he conveniently heads off to New York City at the urging of sister Savannah's psychiatrist Susan Lowenstein following his twin's most recent wristslashing attempt.  His purpose is to fill in the missing details of her tormented past she has blotted out all childhood memories in order to help steer the psychiatrist in her recovery process.  Eventually Tom who lacks faith in psychiatry finds himself facing his own demons as these initial discussions about Savannah take a suddenly dramatic and romantic turn.In addition to Nolte's Oscarnominated showcase much of the film's strength lies in the highly concentrated flashback sequences as Tom recalls his turbulent family life.  Kate Nelligan also Oscarnominated is simply extraordinary as Lila Tom's brittle often callous mother who quite understandably vows to remarry into money after surviving a horrific first marriage to Tom's violent alcoholic dirtpoor father played by an absolutely terrifying Brad Sullivan.  Nelligan grabs this role literally by the throat and allows her character no apologies for her flawed selfserving logic despite the effects it would have on her children as her wealthy second husband starts exhibiting the same abusive traits as the first.  Kudos must also go to the three strong young actors who play the Wingo siblings as children for reenacting the more horrific elements of this story. Some of the other presentday roles however are hitandmiss in their effectiveness.  Blythe Danner has some strained though affecting moments as Tom's neglected wife.  Sadly the vital role of Savannah is nearly excised from the film.  What with the talented Melinda Dillon egregiously reduced to such an insignificant extra one can only rue the dramatic potential untapped here.  As Savannah's neighbor and trusted friend George Carlin seems to be around merely to show off New York gay chic  providing mild amusement a bit of pathos and little else.  On a brighter note Jason Gould Barbra's reallife son acquits himself surprisingly well in the difficult role of Lowenstein's antagonistic son who slowly bonds with Tom's absentee father figure  showing for once that nepotism isn't necessarily blind or reckless.  Dutch actor Jeroen Krabb gets brief but noticeable exposure as Herbert Woodruff Lowenstein's charming smugelegant husband a renown concert violinist who demonstrates more affection for his Stradivarius than either his wife or child.  There is one telling dinner scene at his opulent Manhattan highrise in which the outclassed Wingo gets to put Woodruff in his place.     As for Streisand herself many will invariably take her to task for casting herself in the fundamental role of Susan Lowenstein.  A star of such magnitude always faces the daunting task of presenting a fully realized character and Streisand is only marginally successful here.  Although there is undeniable sexual chemistry between her and Nolte it's hard to overlook her somewhat glossy approach to the role and the unethical intentions of her character.  One can only imagine the ramifications of such a harmful act had her suicidal patient ever uncovered the illicit affair between her brother and psychiatrist.Director Streisand however must be applauded for her explicit attention to exterior details.  A visually resplendent picture great care was taken to get the right look and feel.  Notice particularly the lovely allegorical scenes with the children at the beginning and end.  And with Streisand's exceptional musicianship it is hardly surprising that James Newton Howard's lush score is one of the most beautifully designed ever in fact I borrowed it for my own commitment ceremony in 1996.  It floods the film with an unexpressible tenderness.  Nick Nolte's bookend narration is perfect as well  warm wise poetic and reflective.And so despite the flaws The Prince of Tides may have Streisand certainly shows that her heart was in the right place.".

I learn more about him every time I view this movie. He is a versatile actor and is truly underrated. He DEFINITELY deserved the Oscar for best actor for this difficult role. Barbra Streisand was fantastic as the psychiatrist who had her own secrets and her son Jason was terrific as the rebellious son who wanted to please his father but who needed to find himself by taking on the challenge of playing football.

	schema:headline " Wonderful Performance by Nick Nolte  Part I";
	schema:reviewBody "Part I of My Critique  I've read some of the comments here but unfortunately have never read the book. Firstly it's easy to detect the Streisand haters among these critics....your hatred is truly sophomoric and doesn't serve in your recounting an objective critique of the film.As for this film itself I think that Nick Nolte was absolutely the best element in it as well as Kate Nelligan. I had never been a Nick Nolte fan and was very surprised by his layered characterization. He did more with just a certain look no words than most actors can hope to accomplish reciting nonstop for two hours straight. In the simple shot of his looking at his daughter blow out her birthday candles and smiling when she's done right after we are treated with a flashback of his horrid past was enough to make me break. You could see him hiding some longheld buried pain behind his genuine smile and love for his daughter. It was for me a very subtle yet powerfully moving moment.I think Streisand did a fine job directing this film and was definitely robbed of a best director nomination. Several of the academy members who presented Oscars that evening including Billy Crystal Liza Minnelli Shirley MacLaine and Jessica Tandy who REALLY made a point in a beautifully sarcastic delivery to mention how ridiculous it was that the film was nominated but not the director. This almost NEVER happens and it certainly happened that evening because there are so many academy members who despise Streisand. Minnelli and MacLaine made a point of saying before they read nominations for the particular award they were giving that they would love to be directed by Streisand some day....more digs at the Academy. ANYWAY beyond the snub I thought the film overall was very poignant.Where it falls short however are in the following areas. First Streisand andor the screenwriter LaGraveness shouldn't have focused really any time developing a love story between Streisand and Nolte. This was completely unnecessary. For this reason alone I might not have even voted the film as one of the best of the year....I don't remember what else came out that year. My contention is that if you're going to honor a film with the Oscar you should also honor the director since this film had Streisand's vision all over it. In fact LaGraveness I believe was also a bit disgruntled with the many rewrites that Streisand made of his screenplay. More time should have been devoted to the horrific background story of Nolte's family and of his sister. I understand that her character was actually schizophrenic for many years probably triggered by her rape at 13 but that was not portrayed at all in the movie. Also I thought Jason Gould did a fine job in his little part. However I think it was disingenuous to even include that whole storyline in the movie. He was introduced in a slice of voiceover offered by Streisand's character when she talks to Nolte during a transitional scene when she invites Nick Nolte inside her apartment after he walks her home from Eddie's George Carlin party. She asks why don't you come inside. I'd like you to meet my son. I know the plausibility we're supposed to accept is that her son is a bit difficult and he's in football and Nolte's character is a football coach who might be able to coach him privately....but I just didn't buy this whole plot line. It was an opportunity for Streisand to give her son a part in her film...that's it. He did all right in the part....I just didn't think this element was necessary. More showcasing for Streisand.What else....the love story. I know that Tom Wingo Nolte is not her patient so romance between a doctor and hisher patient isn't an issue. And it is plausible that she is pained as well since her husband is having an affair we later learn with another woman. However it would have been far more realistic and plausible if no romance came up and no opening up on Streisand's part occurred at all. Or perhaps we might have been offered only a glimpse of her also troubled life even though it's shielded behind the veneer of her being a successful psychiatrist. But to have her character let loose in a fullblown romance with Nolte's character was a plot line that took so much time away from what I really wanted to see which was more of the background of the Wingo family and particularly more of the sister herself....the raison d'etre of the film itself.Part I Ends. See Part II for the rest of my critique.".

	onyx:emotionText "Part I of My Critique  I've read some of the comments here but unfortunately have never read the book. Firstly it's easy to detect the Streisand haters among these critics....your hatred is truly sophomoric and doesn't serve in your recounting an objective critique of the film.As for this film itself I think that Nick Nolte was absolutely the best element in it as well as Kate Nelligan. I had never been a Nick Nolte fan and was very surprised by his layered characterization. He did more with just a certain look no words than most actors can hope to accomplish reciting nonstop for two hours straight. In the simple shot of his looking at his daughter blow out her birthday candles and smiling when she's done right after we are treated with a flashback of his horrid past was enough to make me break. You could see him hiding some longheld buried pain behind his genuine smile and love for his daughter. It was for me a very subtle yet powerfully moving moment.I think Streisand did a fine job directing this film and was definitely robbed of a best director nomination. Several of the academy members who presented Oscars that evening including Billy Crystal Liza Minnelli Shirley MacLaine and Jessica Tandy who REALLY made a point in a beautifully sarcastic delivery to mention how ridiculous it was that the film was nominated but not the director. This almost NEVER happens and it certainly happened that evening because there are so many academy members who despise Streisand. Minnelli and MacLaine made a point of saying before they read nominations for the particular award they were giving that they would love to be directed by Streisand some day....more digs at the Academy. ANYWAY beyond the snub I thought the film overall was very poignant.Where it falls short however are in the following areas. First Streisand andor the screenwriter LaGraveness shouldn't have focused really any time developing a love story between Streisand and Nolte. This was completely unnecessary. For this reason alone I might not have even voted the film as one of the best of the year....I don't remember what else came out that year. My contention is that if you're going to honor a film with the Oscar you should also honor the director since this film had Streisand's vision all over it. In fact LaGraveness I believe was also a bit disgruntled with the many rewrites that Streisand made of his screenplay. More time should have been devoted to the horrific background story of Nolte's family and of his sister. I understand that her character was actually schizophrenic for many years probably triggered by her rape at 13 but that was not portrayed at all in the movie. Also I thought Jason Gould did a fine job in his little part. However I think it was disingenuous to even include that whole storyline in the movie.

The novel is about growing up in South Carolina and about the love of three siblings for each other.  The novel takes its name from what the sister calls one of the brothers The Prince Of Tides.  But Luke Wingo the title character is seldom seen in this mediocre adaptation. Ms. Streisand decided to make it a love story about her character and Lukes brother Tom.  She missed the entire point and screwed up a good story that would have better been left as a miniseries because of its length and depth. She needs to watch LONESOME DOVE or ROOTS or CENNTENIAL to see that you can make masterpeices on tv especially if you have a huge text to work from.However Nolte is perfectly cast and plays the part of a downtrodden southern everyman very well.  The few childhood flashback scenes that they do film are done very well.  Too bad Babs didn't realize this was the meat of the novel.  Oh well at least she didn't sing.".

The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is lovely and really fulfills and underlines the whole movie. Technically the finest work is done by the cinematography which is warm and wrapping.  The entire cast is good especially Nick Nolte who is very believable and delivers a great performance.  Barbra Streisand is great behind the camera but only good in front of it.  Playing the role of a rich sophisticated and independent woman she is kind of playing herself. Indeed she is at her best when she doesn't have to deliver any line. Unarguably because her charming presence by itself is enough to fill up the entire screen.  She was probably too busy worrying about the way she looked than anything else.  This probably wouldn't have happened if someone else were directing her.  But then again in that case we probably wouldn't have enjoyed her sweet and profound point of view.".

She completely misses the point of the book and may as well glide around without her feet touching the ground.

Barbara's version takes away most of the message avoids the subject and meaning of the novel and merely sets up pretty stage Sometimes a Great Notion by Ken Kesey. Superb book that far exceeds his One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest. That one misses the point by having the main character focus on the female lead a kind of claim the woman ending. Nolte's ending utterance Lowenstein Lowenstein has the same impact. Neither the book nor the movie are about possessing a woman or about a meaningful affair with someone. If men are going to be defined by their relationship with women it will be as tragic as the woman as property attitude men express.After seeing the movie and reading the novel repeatedly I chose Hunting Island SC for a Fall vacation. As you drive across SC there is a fall point a descent from the uplands of the western half down to sea level. You smell the salt marshes before you see them. When you begin driving through them you recognize how accurately they were captured in the story. I remember my heart racing as we entered salt marsh county and the movie's setting came alive all around us. If you leave your car and walk the boardwalks through the marsh you come to realize that this is the heart of life on earth. The fecundity of the marshes washed by the ocean during high tide helps you understand the primordial ooze that nurtured our ancient ascent from minuscule sea creature to hominid. See the movie visit the marshes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Douglas Kennedy's perplexing novel THE WOMAN IN THE FIFTH has been further contorted by writerdirector Pawel Pawlikowski for the film of the same name aka La femme du Vme. If the viewer has read the novel then the confusion of the story will not be as surprising as it is to the novice viewer. In many ways this is a brilliant cinematic exploration of the fragility of the human mind how events of the past can influence the manner in which we attempt to reconstruct a viable present. But in other ways this is a film that refuses to tell a story that is logical and will leave many viewers with some serious head scratching by movie's end.Academic professor of literature and writer Tom Hicks Ethan Hawke seems to be fleeing America in the wake of a scandal simply because he wants to see his sixyearold daughter Chlo Julie Papillon Tom's estranged wife Nathalie Delphine Chuillot refuses to let Tom see his daughter has a restraining order in place and seems fearful of Tom's character it is suggested that Tom may have been in prison for the past six years. The police are called and Tom escapes onto a bus falls asleep and s awakened at the end of the line having been robbed of this luggage and money. He is in the sleazy part of Paris inhabited by North Africans and Moroccans and finds a degree of solace in a tiny caf the beautiful Polish waitress Ania Joanna Kulig offers him coffee and introduces him to the owner Sezer Samir Guesmi who allows him to room in the filthy place an offer that is accompanied by a 'job' where he will be a night watchman in a warehouse visited by shadowy figures who must give a code for Tom to allow entry. Tom uses his night jobsite to write lengthy letters to Chlo and spends his days spying on her at her school. At a bookstore he meets a fellow American who invites him to an evening reception for writers and there he encounters the very strange Margit Kristin Scott Thomas a bewitching but enigmatic widow of a Hungarian writer who is obviously attracted to Tom and sets meeting times and places for them to engage in a tryst in the Fifth Arrondissement. Tom and Margit begin a tempestuous physical affair but at the same time Tom and Ania have an equally passionate affair and there is always in the background Tom's obsession to reunite with his daughter. But the story implodes with a murder a disappearance and a very strange change in the veracity of Margit's existence. It is at this point that the film becomes purposefully deranged and bizarre and the audience is left with merely some ideas and clues as to what has really happened. How are these incongruous events to make sense? Can they make sense? Is Tom succumbing to the same fever that kept him sheltered for many days upon his arrival in beautiful Paris? Has time somehow passed him by or is he living in an even grander deceit than he first thought?The film is basically in French with English subtitles. Ethan Hawke struggle with the French but that is credible for a 'just arrived' American. Kristin Scott Thomas offers her usual excellent skills as the strange Margit and the remainder of the cast do well with what little dialogue they are given. The dank atmospheric cinematography is by Ryszard Lenczewski and the correctly strange musical score from an aria form a Handel opera sung by a countertenor to piano music excerpts form the Romantic era is the work of Max de Wardener. Pawel Pawlikowski's moody menacing downbeat film takes something from the director's Polish compatriots Polanski and Kieslowski. It is offbeat but for those who appreciate experimental cinema this is well worth your time. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "To say that Tom is down on his luck is an understatement. He has lost his job as a university lecturer on literature and flown to Paris in search of his young daughter Chloe and his wife who has had a restraining order issued against him. His bag is stolen on the bus he has no money and is forced to rent a grotty room in a downandout Parisian caf owned by a domineering criminal character called Sezer.Tom has also written a novel. He has no faith in it but it clearly shows potential. His passion for literature seems to have been extinguished by the time we meet him yet he hopes that writing a second novel will bring him some income. In the meantime Sezer sets him up with a scary night shift in an underground bunker where he must watch a screen for six hours each night and only allow people to enter if they know the correct 'password'.It is at a literary gathering that Tom meets Margit. From the first moment she appears we get goosebumps. The effect she has on Tom is electric  it might not be love at first sight but there is something cool mysterious and effortlessly sensual about Margit that immediately captivates him. From a simple glance through a doorway he is compelled to follow her onto the balcony. The conversation they have there is tinged with sadness and sinister undertones she recognises something in Tom and hands him her card telling him to call 'any time after four' before slipping away. Who is this woman? Why does she unsettle us so much? Ethan Hawke plays Tom. Critics have complained about his dodgy French accent but try and put this into perspective. He is playing an outsider a foreigner who is able to get by in conversation. Surely the American accent adds to the authenticity of the role and emphasises his isolation. Give him a break  it's a fine performance.Even more impressive though is Kristin Scott Thomas as the ethereal Margit. It is not the details of her life or the tragedy in her past that fascinates us  these are eventually revealed but they won't be what you remember most. It is the constant performance  the cold removed beauty of this character that startles us. Intelligent demure and sinister there is a potent dread and sorrow that pervades the scenes she is in and permeates throughout the rest of the film in ripples that seem to emanate from her presence.Consider the first time Tom visits her apartment. He is awkward and tries to make small talk. He asks about her husband a Hungarian writer. She indulges him for a short time but they have no delusions. Both know very well why he is there. The shot that follows is perhaps the finest in the entire film finally we have found someone who understands how to film sex. It is sad to think that so many directors believe that the more you show the more erotic the scene is. The tension in that apartment is almost unbearable and sex does not diffuse it. Watch closely as Tom tries to kiss Margit at what point she stops him and undoes his trousers. No detail is shown and even the sounds of rustling material are muted. The camera focuses on their faces in one steady unmoving shot Tom recoils in shock closes his eyes murmurs almost disintegrating from the overwhelming emotion and physical pleasure of this act. Margit only watches silently smiling knowingly as if she were gazing at a small child trying to learn the alphabet. She is in complete control and knows it.I am not sure how to describe 'The Woman In The Fifth' the word 'strange' doesn't even scratch the surface. It is a classy movie  the aesthetics and cinematography are top notch notice the deep reds and blacks that cling to Margit for example and the influence of Polish cinema is patent. Paris is an alien world  behind a romantic faade lie the gray skies the lonely train tracks the tragic aura of mystery and always the looming sense of danger and death. This is a movie that defies rational judgement as the plot swings from one bizarre event to the next. The twist about two thirds of the way through had many cynics in the audience scoffing  I have to admit I wasn't completely convinced. But we are in the hands of a director who has complete confidence in his medium and by the end I had a deep respect for his efforts. This movie isn't perfect but it is nevertheless beguiling and utterly compelling. It takes some skill to blend the genres seen here so effortlessly  from domestic drama to romance to crime thriller and finally entering the realms of the supernatural this shouldn't really work. Yet the threads between these genres and the themes on display are as tangible as those woven by spiders and serving to capture insects in the brief interludes within the film often showing snapshots of nature in its deformed frightening beauty focusing in particular on a faraway woodland. Where is it? What do these images mean? It only really struck me as I left the cinema just how desperately sad this movie is. Whatever else 'The Woman In The Fifth' explores it is primarily about suffering and loss and our need for love and human companionship. It may not be a masterpiece  I would argue its flaws are quite substantial  but it is never pretentious. Pawel Pawlikowski is a director who has a story to tell and does so with flair and imagination without ever alienating his audience. Surprisingly deep concisely expressed and including within its short running time glimpses of cinematic genius 'The Woman In The Fifth' is an unassuming little gem. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Woman in the Fifth adapted from the novel by Douglas Kennedy tells the story of an author whose crumbling personal life is second only to the decaying state of his mind. Although it has a definite sequence of events I hesitate to say that it has a plot. The intention so far as I could tell was to toy with the audience's perception of reality to intentionally raise questions without answering them. Writerdirector Pawel Pawlikowski seems to operate under the assumption that a certain degree of madness goes hand in hand with the writing process. To an extent he's probably right it takes a special kind of person to not only conceive of fictitious people places and plots but to also obsess over them until the story has naturally resolved itself. The real downside is that this usually comes at the expense of a personal life.Tom Ricks Ethan Hawke an American literature professor with one published novel to his name travels to Paris desperate to reunite with his sixyearold daughter Chloe Julie Papillion. His estranged wife Nathalie Delphine Chuillot clearly does not want him in Chloe's life the details are not made explicitly clear although we do know that she has already filed a restraining order against him and it's strongly suggested that he has spent time in prison. Fleeing from Nathalie's apartment after she calls the police he boards a bus falls asleep and awakens to find that his bag has been stolen. He's now lost in a city he's completely unfamiliar with. The best he has going for him is that he can speak French. He takes refuge in a seedy hostel on the outskirts of town.Because he doesn't have the money to pay for a room he's forced to work as a night guard in a warehouse owned by Sezer Samir Guesmin who can never say anything without sounding sinister. The job is simple enough all Tom has to do is buzz people in. Granted they must speak in code if they're to be granted access and it certainly is odd that they look rather shady and pop by at all hours of the night. Then there's the fact that neither Tom nor the audience has any idea what if anything they do behind the closed door of the neighboring cell. We are made aware that every time a group of men enter the room the light bulbs in the lamp on Tom's desk flicker. And then there's the moment Tom puts his ear against the wall in an attempt to eavesdrop someone immediately bangs on the wall and warns Tom that if he continues to listen in he will be killed.As he feverishly handwrites letters to Chloe all of which detail a magical forest located somewhere in Virginia two women enter Tom's life. One is Ania Joanna Kulig a Polish waitress in Sezer's caf who has a healthy interest in poetry. Her attraction to him is not adequately explained although given the love and affection he so desperately craves it's easy to understand his attraction to her.

	onyx:emotionText "The Woman in the Fifth adapted from the novel by Douglas Kennedy tells the story of an author whose crumbling personal life is second only to the decaying state of his mind. Although it has a definite sequence of events I hesitate to say that it has a plot. The intention so far as I could tell was to toy with the audience's perception of reality to intentionally raise questions without answering them. Writerdirector Pawel Pawlikowski seems to operate under the assumption that a certain degree of madness goes hand in hand with the writing process. To an extent he's probably right it takes a special kind of person to not only conceive of fictitious people places and plots but to also obsess over them until the story has naturally resolved itself. The real downside is that this usually comes at the expense of a personal life.Tom Ricks Ethan Hawke an American literature professor with one published novel to his name travels to Paris desperate to reunite with his sixyearold daughter Chloe Julie Papillion. His estranged wife Nathalie Delphine Chuillot clearly does not want him in Chloe's life the details are not made explicitly clear although we do know that she has already filed a restraining order against him and it's strongly suggested that he has spent time in prison. Fleeing from Nathalie's apartment after she calls the police he boards a bus falls asleep and awakens to find that his bag has been stolen. He's now lost in a city he's completely unfamiliar with. The best he has going for him is that he can speak French. He takes refuge in a seedy hostel on the outskirts of town.Because he doesn't have the money to pay for a room he's forced to work as a night guard in a warehouse owned by Sezer Samir Guesmin who can never say anything without sounding sinister. The job is simple enough all Tom has to do is buzz people in. Granted they must speak in code if they're to be granted access and it certainly is odd that they look rather shady and pop by at all hours of the night. Then there's the fact that neither Tom nor the audience has any idea what if anything they do behind the closed door of the neighboring cell. We are made aware that every time a group of men enter the room the light bulbs in the lamp on Tom's desk flicker. And then there's the moment Tom puts his ear against the wall in an attempt to eavesdrop someone immediately bangs on the wall and warns Tom that if he continues to listen in he will be killed.As he feverishly handwrites letters to Chloe all of which detail a magical forest located somewhere in Virginia two women enter Tom's life. One is Ania Joanna Kulig a Polish waitress in Sezer's caf who has a healthy interest in poetry. Her attraction to him is not adequately explained although given the love and affection he so desperately craves it's easy to understand his attraction to her. The other woman is the mysterious Margit Kristin Scott Thomas the well travelled translator of her late husband's Hungarian novels. She and Tom met at an upscale literary gathering hosted by an Englishspeaking bookshop owner. Obviously aware of his attraction to her she gives Tom a card with her name and address on it. She makes it clear that if they are to meet it can only be on her terms.And so it comes to pass that he finds himself at Paris' Fifth Arrondissment entering her apartment and immediately dropping his defenses against her bold borderline oedipal sexual advances.

He probably believes these words as he says them out loud however the audience quickly learns Tom is not welcomed by his exwife and six year old Chloe thought daddy was in prison. We never learn exactly where Tom came from but it is most likely somewhere unpleasant. Through a combination of errors Tom manages to have his luggage stolen the police are after him for violating a restraining order and he winds up at a seedy cafhotel conveniently located at the last stop on the bus line never a good neighborhood. Tom Ricks has hit bottom.The title The Woman in the Fifth refers to Margit Kadara Kristin Scott Thomas. While failing spectacularly at small talk at and upscale function for writers and their elite admirers Tom has one of those moments where Margit is the only person in the room he sees even though there are 50 some people in the room. They strike up a conversation where she learns he is a novelist has had one book published which was moderately successful but is now obviously baffled on if there will be a second book. Tom learns Margit has lived everywhere speaks six or seven languages fluently was a muse and translator for her late Hungarian husband and now seems poised to volunteer to become Tom's muse.Tom falls into a job which could only be invented by a novelist. The Woman in the Fifth is adapted from the eponymous 2007 novel by Douglas Kennedy which puts Tom in a job where he is confined to a bare room for six hours every night to watch a video screen. When men appear at the door they will say a prepared phrase and if they say the correct phrase Tom is to press the buzzer to open a door down the hall. He does not know who these men are why they are coming to the door or who they are meeting behind that door. What Tom discovers is that behind that door comes some yelling occasional screaming and the power fluctuates sometimes during that screaming. This is the perfect job for a novelist who can write uninterrupted for six hours a night and the perfect mysterious predicament for a novelist to place his protagonist in.Two other characters straight out of a novel populate Tom's hotel. There is the bar maid Joanna Kulig who takes an interest in Tom and there is his next door neighbor Omar who never flushes their shared toilet and takes an extra special dislike to Tom when he finds out he is American. As Tom sleepily shuffles around Paris to visit Margit keep tabs on his exwife and daughter and spend his six hours a night behind a locked door with a buzzer it is refreshing to see him fall back to the hotel and develop a sweet rapport with the bar maid.The movie is mysterious languid and seems to be setting the audience up for something. What that 'something' is I will not say and you will hopefully not learn before you see the film. Paris seems empty and lonely and after awhile I just wanted Tom to take a nap because as time progresses he looks dead tired and unaware of his surroundings. Pawel Pawlikowski My Summer of Love Last Resort the director and screenplay adaptor allows time to flow by and rarely defines it. The audience loses track of how many days Tom has been in Paris or if it becomes tomorrow or the day after.Ethan Hawke does a very good job of keeping the audience on edge about Tom. He is frequently quiet and contemplative as he melts into a caf booth but every now and then there are loud outbursts when a bit of news or a situation displeases him. I have seen variations of Kristin Scott Thomas as Margit before. She is confident knows how to relax her company and easily handles Tom when he is falling apart she knows exactly how to put him back together. Joanna Kulig as the bar maid is a wonderful new presence on screen. She is obviously native Polish like the director but must converse in two other languages English and French along with the rest of the cast. The script shows a narrative strength as I did not realize very often as it seamlessly slipped from French to English and back again.After the screening I overheard a lot of people asking their friends to explain what happened and either agreeing with them in 'aha' moments or shaking their heads in disbelief. The Woman in the Fifth will most likely polarize the audience between those who are familiar with films such as these and those that are unfamiliar with being blindsided and bewildered. I recommend The Woman in the Fifth for both types of audience members. For the indoctrinated you will appreciate a shadowy script with a fascinating unreliable narrator. For the untested viewer go and enjoy an intriguing international cast and get your questions ready at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Woman in the Fifth 2011Well the reason this movie gets some pretty awful reviews is the utter confusion of the plot. And yet it's a deliberate confusionwhich is no excuse. It just means this isn't quite bad filmmaking but a bad decision or two taken too far.You see the main character played with ease and almost familiarity by Ethan Hawke is mentally unstable. He seems to have two distinct realities and these are easily confused by the viewer. And in one of these realities he does terrible things though it isn't clear because we see those terrible things as innocently as he does which is to say not at all it seems. The character Tom Ricks is an American in Paris a writer ostensibly in town to find and visit his daughter. But the mother's reaction to his showing up at their house is the first clue that something is wrong. This seemingly smart and very nice fellow scares her to call to the police. We see Ricks run to save himself from arrest but we don't quite know if he's to blame or if the mother is just overreacting.The fact is the confusions in the movie are overwhelming. Maybe there was a better logic somewhere that an editor under pressure from a producer or distributor made much out of. Or maybe it was an artful decision to leave us bewildered to spend time and emotional energy gathering the pieces and clues. The director Pawel Pawlikowski has something of a success or two behind him and so might have pretensions that got the better of things here. In a way the movie is better than it's overall impression by the end. There are numerous scenes that show a modern Paris very far removedand much more revealingthan the glorified city seen in both mainstream French movies and American love letters like Woody Allen's recent timetravel. And the acting is overall restrained and convincing. In its bones this is a substantial movie. Most of all the cinematography is superb some of the best creative stuff I've seen recently dependent not on creative editing but on smart visual seeingframing kinetics focus and so on. I think you could watch it on many levels with great pleasure if you knew ahead of time the overall meaning and plot were going to be a mess.Without forewarning I'm guessing it leaves mostly frustration and bitterness.".

This movie is a pure expression of a certain state of mind a simple story of a deceived man. Its a fight between life and death. Death in its enigmatic image is represented by KristinST and life at its utmost innocence and purity by the polish girl Ania. Tom was tempted by the beauty of both. sexuality of death reflects its image. Life is good so making love to the polish girl was genuine and real. At the end death wins Toms' life but love is valued majestically Tom destroys the text he wrote to Chloe keeping only the part Love dad because in the end even for a writer love is what matters. His wife represented those who refuse to love to forgive to give another chance their responsibility towards the needy person that was once a husband. Sezer and Omar represents life harsh difficult cold and disgusting like the toilet. A great movie about the director own dilemma. beautiful...".

Death in its enigmatic image is represented by KristinST and life at its utmost innocence and purity by the polish girl Ania. Tom was tempted by the beauty of both. sexuality of death reflects its image. Life is good so making love to the polish girl was genuine and real. At the end death wins Toms' life but love is valued majestically Tom destroys the text he wrote to Chloe keeping only the part Love dad because in the end even for a writer love is what matters. His wife represented those who refuse to love to forgive to give another chance their responsibility towards the needy person that was once a husband. Sezer and Omar represents life harsh difficult cold and disgusting like the toilet. A great movie about the director own dilemma. beautiful...";

Waiting for this surprise actually helped me concentrate wonderfully and it did not when it came seem out of place.What did keep me waiting was when Kristin Scott Thomas who was presumably the woman of the title was going to appear and I had forgotten about the invitation that Ethan Hawke as Tom had been given to a literary evening Which it must be said seemed as dire as one might imagine with even the effrontery of being asked for a contribution of twenty euros on arrival. If I didn't know that KST would be much better company than all of these old bores I still wouldn't have blamed Ethan for having caught sight of her wanting to follow her up to the roof with the base of Le Tour Eiffel seemingly in touching distance and leave them behind.As to the way that everything was told although quite in the right way nothing did get told what arose from an initial feeling that things were uneasy was one of mysteriousness especially in relation to KST playing Margit Kadar halfFrench halfRoumanian. The seductiveness that she had shown so tellingly well in her role in Leaving 2009 was not to the fore as such although she did greet Tom in a very intimate way when he came to her flat for the first time but was simmeringly almost glitteringly present.And it was fine that she could see an attractive quality in Tom because his glasses I am probably not one to speak didn't suit him and his face was much better without them when in the same scene she removed them we possibly hadn't seen him properly like that before because talking to his daughter through some railings we just catch him when he swaps glasses with her.Tom had an inward quality to him that made it seem as if he had not even noticed that another woman Frenchspeaking Ania from Poland played by Joanna Kulig was taking an interest in him until she arrives at his door very obviously dressed up and likewise takes him up to the roof. One almost thought in the same way that his curiosity would not get the better of him when on duty in his mysterious nightjob although his employer must surely have thought that sooner or later he would have that impulse and that he would never go to the 5th arrondissement the Fifth of the title or in the French La Femme du Vme.I wanted to see this film again but I may not have the chance  not at my usual cinema as it turned out that I had made it to the last screening  and I have ordered the book by Douglas Kennedy on which Pawel Pawlikowski based the screenplay that he has directed.All in all this was a film that credited me as a filmgoer to follow connections to be confused to work it out and to construct a reality.

Two of Kennedy's other novels have been filmed previously the last being THE BIG PICTURE 2010 also shot in French. As for Pawlikowski this is his fourth feature film the previous one being MY SUMMER OF LOVE 2004. Before that he was a highly praised director of documentaries for British television. This film is very much in the tradition of Andr Breton's surrealistic novel NADJA which has inspired so much of subsequent French fiction and cinema. We have the mysterious woman who may be mad whom the novelist hero cannot resist we have the strange regions of Paris we have the atmosphere of dream and illusion. Hawke having been rejected by his exwife and forbidden to approach or speak to his daughter gets onto a Paris bus and falls asleep. He is woken at the end of line to discover that his luggage and all his money has been stolen from him while he slept. He goes into a small Arab caf near the bus stop to order a coffee and try to think what to do. The Arab owner offers him a room to stay in in return for confiscating his passport. The owner is married to a pathetic depressed young Polish girl who dreams of better things but is trapped in her circumstances. Hawke unable to sort out any other possibility for himself accepts a mysterious night job operating access to a gangster hideout associated with the owner of the caf. One day he wanders into a bookshop and is recognised by a man working there as the author of a wellknown novel. The man enthusiastically invites him to a gathering of poets and writers which he attends some days later. There he meets the infinitely mysterious 'woman of the Fifth' 'the Fifth' here is a section of the Left Bank of Paris not a measure of whiskey named Margit played with arch menace and erotic intensity by Kristin Scott Thomas. He appeals to her and he ends up becoming involved with her at her insistence. But then bizarre things begin to happen. People start getting killed and he is arrested for a murder he did not commit. He takes refuge in the arms of Joanna Kulig the young Polish actress who plays the caf owner's wife. This too has consequences. Things become increasingly complex and inexplicable and events seem to become more and more imaginary as Hawke struggles to understand what is happening. The film's atmosphere is thick enough to cut with a knife and the film is very artfully made. If you want to be puzzled and fascinated by mysteries which appear insoluble this is for you.".

	schema:headline " A trip into the mind of a serial killer?";
	schema:reviewBody "I will say from the off that my conclusion comes from reading other reviews after seeing the film. Which left me confused and lost as to what I had seen. Ethen Hawk arrives in Paris from who knows where gets robbed on the bus and reaches the end of the line. He ends up in a seedy caf where he manages to get a room with no money in his pocket and seemingly on the back of being an American. Later the barcaf owner offers him a job as a doorman letting people into a nondescriptive place of 'entertainmentbad things'. He meets his estranged wife and daughter as well as meeting a strange but alluring French widow who needs his body and mind. He later discovers his obnoxious neighbour dead in the shared toilet and he has a brief fling with a polish bar maid who just happens to be the same bar owner's girl. OK so far? If you see the film like that you will end up as confused as most of us watching the screening as I did. However if you start to think about the allegorical message of a serial killer incarcerated in the system then it starts to make more sense. What this film does for me is to take me on a journey as our 'Hero' arrives at the entrance of the institution is stripped of all his possessions apart from his passport or his identity and locked up in a series of small rooms as he relates to the audience just what he did do to end up where he was. He fleeting contact with the police and his frequent evasion of them is the Hickockian hallmark of a man on the run. The rooms he lives and works in is his cell Paris is but a backdrop in which to establish his story perhaps his wife was French as she is portray in the film? But the cast of whom he reacts with his victims including his wife and daughter. Reflecting on the film I think on hindsight that it's not to bad and I fact made me think about the boundaries that people set up for the self's and what happens when those boundaries are breached. All in all a good effort and one that perhaps might do well with a second viewing?".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Woman in the Fifth";
	schema:reviewBody "There are films that pretend to be high art and The Woman in the Fifth is clearly one of them. It insults your intelligence with its twists because if a film were to suggest everything had happened in the protagonist's mind then surely why bother with this story when you can imagine everything yourself just by looking at the poster and watching the trailer. And surprisingly this is based on a novel written by Douglas Kennedy so there should be a story at least unless something went wrong with director Pawel Pawlikowski's adaptation of the screenplay.A FrenchBritishPolish production the film boasts the likes of Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas the latter being the titular woman a widow of a notsowell read Polish writer. But she appears only about halfway through the film and we're left to follow Hawke's Tom Ricks an American English literature professor and writer of only one book who had journeyed to Paris indefinitely so that he can stalk his estranged wife and kid. That's because he has a restraining order and has to keep a distance. He loses all his possessions and ends up in a motelbar where the goodwill of the owner Sezer Samir Guesmi meant he could live on credit for the time being.One hour is spent together with Tom in getting into a routine. He mopes around trying to write gets frustrated with his neighbour who has bad shared toilet manners Sezer gets him a job which is a night guard equivalent of sitting in a windowless room screening people entering some premises that is never revealed to be what it is and in between he gets to physically romance Scott Thomas' Margit Kardar who sets certain rules and conditions when and where they can get jiggy with it and interchanges his muse to Sezer's squeeze Ania Joanna Kulig because she's obviously more nubile and more impressed with his writing credentials than Margit.But it is this routine that does the film in because it doesn't bother to lead the story anywhere. If Pawlikowski's objective is to bore or put something existential onto film then he succeeded complete with dreary lines where Margit tells Tom the latter has to experience tragedy in order to write that next big novel. Right so a translator for her dead husband's literary works suddenly becomes life's guru to a writer and dispenses plenty of knowledge nuggets to her lover when he visits her periodically for one sole objective.It's one thing being open ended so as to make the audience work for the pay load but another if things are kept open ended as a cheat because of the emptiness of the film leaving it to the audience to guess in any fashion without clear parameters drawn up because the filmmakers are clueless as to where they want the film to go. No amount of beautiful cinematography can cover up the lack of clarity and to sugar coat the flimsiness and silliness of the film is but a futile effort. While Kristin Scott Thomas and Ethan Hawke put in good performances ultimately they are done in by their lines and probably had an exercise on how to brood effectively for the screen.The twist could have been done in creepy fashion since it blows open the possibilities just when things were turning rote and stale past the hour mark but nothing was done to exploit this sudden window of hope. When it happened it provided a temporary lift but ultimately did itself in again by going for things that are inexplicable both logically and emotionally and as mentioned if everything can be imagined then why the need to watch this in the very first place? Save your money for something else more worthwhile as this stinker sinks to the bottom of the pile not worth another mention unless to list down the worst of the year.".

What is hinted at is good enough. Of course it would have been more satisfying to have explanatory sequences or flashbacks to show how the murder took place or how the fantasy of Kristin Scott Thomas's character evolved. Or how his daughter was taken and released.The acting is fine. Ethan Hawke is quite good in this complex role. He's a bit gaunt and disheveled but that's the role. Kristin is stylishly alluring. Liked the twist that the minorities who seem menacing are actually not the real terror.The unresolved issues might put many off and hurt its box office. So might the rather ugly portrayal of Paris. But overall I think it is worth a watch if you bear in mind the unique point of view and the incompleteness is deliberate.".

	schema:headline " Experimental fimmakers successfully rearing their artistic head";
	schema:reviewBody "The slowly unravelling character and background of a CCTV operator form the plot of this gripping and unsettling lowbudget yet very professionally made film. Jackie's job is to watch the feed from closed circuit cameras sited in the less desirable areas of Glasgow including a street called Red Road and liaising with the police where possible to help track or prevent crime. She's a dour Scots lass who gives little away and we build up a picture of her life very efficiently in the first few varied and colourful short scenes  her working life her social life her sex life and at the edge of it her family life.She starts to follow an excon who she recognises on the cameras eventually ingratiating herself into his life. We are kept in the dark for a very long time as to her motives and simply feel an insidious creeping tension as she takes risks. That we become so glued to what she is up to is a great credit to the skillful characterisation and acting. It's one of those films where if you want to feel the full impact of the surprises the less you know about the story the better. The title maybe also suggests a path of sexual tension and danger that the protagonist feels she has to follow. The final denouement brings a surprise emotional enlightenment. If you dislike independent filmmaking or are averse to explicit sex avoid Red Road otherwise make a beeline to see one of the most original and capable films to come out of Scotland.Delving into the world of CCTV also opens up other questions. Britain has a very high deployment of CCTV  according to one estimate the average Briton is recorded by CCTV cameras 300 times a day director Andrea Arnold says in an interview that twenty per cent of all the CCTV cameras in the world are in Britain  and there are also concerns about privacy and abuse. The film doesn't argue for or against  it seems realistic  but in portraying 'a face that watches the footage' it allows us to picture what it is maybe like on the other side of the camera when we form our ideas about the social dilemmas.Although Red Road has been roundly praised it is not immediately clear why it is so successful. There is very little substantive action for a long time and little of the obvious attention grabbers such as violence or heavy romance. Although it seems to be directed on a very tight leash part of the credit no doubt should also go to Lone Scherfig characterisation is done in part by Scherfig as collaborator and with whose background there is a discernible connection.Danish Director Scherfig rose to fame with Italian for Beginners one of the successful films to be made under the strict discipline of the austere Dogme95 rules. While Red Road uses little of the formal laws of the backtobasics Dogme system the lessons learnt are evident a lack of intrusive background music no superficial action or definable genre and so on. The reliance is on the characters themselves and in working in the development of the Red Road characters Scherfig's genius is shining through. We feel just as we did in her Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself that the people have just walked off the streets of Glasgow or are still walking about on them. This style of realism is also discernible in the first British Dogme film Gypo released about the same time as Red Road and together they form almost a new thread in British cinema. Whatever the reasons or antecedents Red Road is a film of remarkable ingenuity aimed at an intelligent adult audience.The background to the creation of Red Road is that it forms part of a project called Advance Party. Scherfig and her collaborator in accordance with the experiment presented the fully fledged characters to director Andrea Arnold who then wrote the plot around them. They have a life of their own instead of being altered to fit a storyline. The creative genius behind the idea as with Dogme is Lars von Trier. In the hands of Oscarwinning director Arnold we again see art and new creative processes forcing their head through the muchabused medium of cinema.".

Nevertheles the spectator does not know the relationship between the protagonist and the man she has discovered through the CCTV. The mystery gets solved as the film goes on and the tension is well kept throughout the film. This is not only a thriller it is a drama full of realism with all its crudeness and no false extremes with regards to good ones and evil ones. The interpretations by the actors are truly brilliant. I don't see that that sex scene is so crude I think it is very naturalistic. There are scenes in the film that seem very crude to me but won't tell in order not to spoil anything.

	schema:reviewBody "Produced in collaboration with Lars von Trier's production house Zentropa and based on characters created by Lone Scherfig and Anders Thomas Jensen this debut feature by Oscarwinning Andrea Arnold is the first British feature filmed under the rigid Dogmaprinciples. I guess I'll never become a big fan of Dogmastyle filmmaking but I must admit this was a wellstructured and ultimately intriguing piece of filmmaking if you can make it to the final half hour when part of the story is resolved and some sorely needed background information is given. We meet a woman Kate Dickie who works as a CCTV operator obsessively observing the residents in a rundown housing estate in Glasgow. She seems obsessed by her work compensating for her nonexistent social life. Most of the story revolves around a dire housing estate a huge 25floor tower on Red Road from which the film got its title. On day when she zooms in on a man having some backalley sex with a young woman she recognizes him and starts tracking his every move on camera but in real life as well even insinuating herself into his life going to his apartment and even attending a party he's giving. Obviously she has some shared experience from the past with this man. At first it seems an exhusbandboyfriend but soon it becomes obvious he doesn't know her apart from a vague recollection haven't I seen you somewhere before? Who is he and foremost what on earth could this woman possibly want from him? The film keeps you guessing till the very end. Perhaps a bit too long. For almost 90 minutes you keep wondering why the hell she goes through all this trouble meeting this mysterious fellow. Till then we're fishing in the dark.The film is greatly bolstered by two extremely convincing performances. Kate Dickie commits herself to this role with such vigour her every move comes off completely believable despite her motivations are hard to understand while Tony Curran's performance ranges from very frightening to even touching at times. It's interesting enough to keep watching but only just till the end when the elements fall in place. The prominence of CCTV surveillance in the film and how far it has penetrated Britons everyday lives and increasingly in other parts of the world as well is quite revealing and disturbing as well. Since a large part of the film consists of CCTVimages and is strained by Dogmarules in the first place the images are not always pleasing for the eye. But some beautifully shot night scenes around Red Roadestate and the two powerhouse performances by the leads largely make up for some shortcomings in the film's narrative.Camera Obscura  710".

	schema:reviewBody "A female cctv operative discovers in the course of her work that a criminal has been released from jail early for good behaviour. She takes a very personal interest in him..That rare thing. A superb British movie. Set in an unremittingly bleak Glasgow focused on a multistorey housing estate in the East End of that city this is NOT the usual kitchensink or sliceoflife tellystyle drama that nearly always make a disheartening prospect for cinemagoing. This is a complex characterdriven piece beautifully shot and edited. Scenes are allowed space and time to breathe in their own life. It never tells the audience what to think how to feel or even what's going on. Yet ultimately the movie tells of a struggle against loss and grief and there is a redemptive quality which is hardwon by the director. The surveillance aspect is brilliantly handled by mixing in lowres grainy footage of surveyed scenes scanning and zooming in on actual streets and some of the locals and allowing the audience to figure out what is going on along with the operative. It suggested a kneejerk parallel with Haneke's Cache Hidden but this a completely different take more closely paralleling Coppola's 'The Conversation' and suggesting that the effects of surveillance may be more acutely felt by the observer than the observed. The acting by the entire cast is pitchperfect. The highly explicit sex scene is for once completely warranted and the sexual tension in the relationship is reminiscent of Roeg's 'Bad Timing'. But this is a film which gains a lot of power by being deeplyrooted in its time and place and doesn't need to look back. Utterly assured and contemporary like 'Morvern Callar' it is very much what is happening NOW. And whenever the journalistic blah about a boom in Scottish film inevitably subsides the country will be left with something more potent than bloody 'Gregory's Girl' as a benchmark for what can be achieved with a smallscale budget and ScottishScotlandbased directors.".

	onyx:emotionText "A female cctv operative discovers in the course of her work that a criminal has been released from jail early for good behaviour. She takes a very personal interest in him..That rare thing. A superb British movie. Set in an unremittingly bleak Glasgow focused on a multistorey housing estate in the East End of that city this is NOT the usual kitchensink or sliceoflife tellystyle drama that nearly always make a disheartening prospect for cinemagoing. This is a complex characterdriven piece beautifully shot and edited. Scenes are allowed space and time to breathe in their own life. It never tells the audience what to think how to feel or even what's going on. Yet ultimately the movie tells of a struggle against loss and grief and there is a redemptive quality which is hardwon by the director. The surveillance aspect is brilliantly handled by mixing in lowres grainy footage of surveyed scenes scanning and zooming in on actual streets and some of the locals and allowing the audience to figure out what is going on along with the operative.

	schema:reviewBody " No specific spoilers but I discuss the narrative shape and hint at some plot elements. This film comes on as a psychological suspenseful moodpiece but delivers all too much dark mood and not enough psychological insight. I was rooting for Red Road for a whileI liked the dread and creepy voyeurism in a rough part of Glasgow. But I felt the film despite its earnest attempt to deal with a woman's grief was fairly banal. And more importantly it does not integrate the two biggest plot elements thematically.The film doles out small bits of information about why Jackie is disturbed and begins to track Clyde a recentlyreleased criminal and to misuse some of her powers as a tracker. This works well for a while but then gets a bit tedious. Disappointingly the use of surveillance is not united with any larger thematic concern. For a film which begins steeped in the technology of watching and recordingeven quotidian doings come to seem ominousthe surveillance aspect is part of entirely personal plot with very little wider cultural implications. This may be because the UK has more surveillance than the U.S. so the filmmaker was simply using it as a given whereas in the US it would generate more societal questions though the use of cameras is surely growing in the US.The other big thematic problem is why Jackie chooses her particular form of revenge. It's an extremely provocative choice but it's not tied to what happened in the past. Again her personal reasons her loneliness her revulsionattraction to a dangerous but compelling guy are interesting but her technique is a culturally relevant issue which the film has nothing to say about.As Clyde Tony Curran has haunting moments. His physicality even the way he walks is a memorable portrait of a man caught between studly swagger haunted emptiness and attempted recovery. As Jackie Kate Dickie has a tougher task playing the repressed pain but hinting at someone capable of inflicting revenge. But she's good too.In the end though it was not enough for me to like this film. The movie feels rather small and a nottoooriginal spin on other films which have dealt with similar matters.".

	schema:reviewBody "I at first reserved comment on this film sat with it as it settled in and began to resonate. Red Road is a challenging film on several levels. It requires us to pay attention it doesn't hit us on the head with flashbacks or expository on the nose dialog. Instead the script is frugal casually exacting and the discovery is in the subtext rather than what's on screen. When we first meet Jackie all we see is a head and shoulders hands manipulating the CCTV cameras so she can get a better look at the nefarious goings on  she is trained to know what's worth looking at and what she can let go.Jackie remains rather disembodied throughout much of the film  even during sex it seems she's not really connected to anything below her neck including her heart. She's passive running away from even the slightest emotional exchange.Except for Clyde. Clyde changes everything. She loses perspective and we follow along with her despising Clyde because she does. Everything he does looks vaguely criminal because we see him through Jackie's tainted eyes.But again we are challenged to see Clyde and other characters as layered individuals. The wastenothing script gives us insight into their motivations  sure it could have had some sort of perversion or twisty ending but the point really is that sometimes what looks strange and frightening on the surface is actually benign and familiar on a deeper more personal level.A lot has been said here about the sex scene which is pretty explicit although only one scene. But it is the pivotal scene in the film. In order to insinuate herself into Clyde's world she has to engage with him in a way she's been avoiding with anyone. But she ends up letting go completely more than she has to. And in doing so she not only accesses her pain and anger but remembers her body and its need for nurturing remembers her heart and her compassion and begins to see Clyde in three dimensions for the first time. As do we.I did have a problem with the police aspect of it because here in the states what Jackie put into motion would not have been stopped just because she decided not to press the issue.The success of a quiet story like Red Road sans neon Americanstyle exposition exists largely in the way the characters are brought to us by the actors. Kate Dickie and Tony Curran are excellent and it's nice to see the underrated Mr. Curran in a lead role and not invisible quickly dead or uh undead.".

And yet the lead woman Jackie almost always alone and played with unusual sensitivity and calm by Kate Dickie does just the opposite of getting out. She enters forbidden spaces sees danger and then calmly keeps penetrating.You sense why early on but don't quite know. It's never explained in words but it becomes clear by the unfolding of the eventsthe best kind of moviemaking. Much of the time is spent watching Jackie brood and emote and move through these roughedged city scenes. It is all made very reasonable which only makes it scarier. And yet as much as it's real and realistic it has an artful not artsy pace to it that imbues the whole feeling with something larger something universal. It makes it all matter even to us far from the screen.English director Andrea Arnold is little known even though she won an Oscar for a short a few years earlier but she has a few other films that I suddenly need to see. There are aspects here of brilliance like the many surveillance camera scenes and yet even these are not flashy and with no hype they like the movie dig into your brain. More important there is a grip on the whole the balance and flow of the narrative the feeling in the editing and small details included that add up. It's a commanding experience. It won't be for everyone on the surface it might seem slow and indulgently sadbut if it will definitely be a very special movie for others. Even the shocking climax near the end which at first seems like directorial excess makes sense after all both for the character who has lost some sense of boundary and for the viewer who is meant to lose their boundaries as well.

Most people do not 'get over' the death of a loved one they learn to accommodate it while knowing that on the inside they are changed forever.Some of us unfortunately also have to cope with causing hurt and destruction in the lives of others as a result of our own selfinflicted substance abuse. The subsequent guilt and selfloathing is never punishment enough.What Red Road asks of the audience is to believe that two people whose lives become intertwined as a result of such actions would resolve their relationship in the fashion this story relates. Red Road is welldirected in terms of framing and dripfeeding the backstory to the audience superbly acted has admirable cinematography and creditable art direction. However I did not believe this story. The script just did not have the power to achieve such towering heights of catharsis. Witness Clyde's final attempt at explanation for his horrible act This kind of thing happens every day. Sht happens. This is a line that conjures up no emotion at all a clich from a character who did not deserve clichd treatment. There are more glaring gaps in credibility  would the police not recognise the past connection between these two characters when she makes the rape charge? How can the CCTV footage of her escaping Red Road still be in the cupboard when it is evidence in an ongoing rape investigation? Can you really drop rape charges with just one phone call? And in a tale so grounded in realism isn't it a heck of a coincidence that Clyde's daughter shows up when she does?This is a promising but not wholly convincing debut from Arnold. I would not call her a wise filmmaker but she is certainly brave. Arnold is not Scottish but by setting a film like this in Glasgow she invites comparisons with Lynne Ramsay  not because they are two of that rarest of creatures the female director but because stylistically and thematically they are so close. Let Ramsay do her thing which she does very well and hope that Arnold finds her own voice and style. I will certainly look out for her next film.".

Instead the audience is never really clued in to exactly what her motivations are just that she has a reason. The twist and reveal are handled with deft emotion. The character of Clyde is an interesting one because you never really get a handle on him till the final moments of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Jackie may not have much of a life of her own but she has found a way to live vicariously through the lives of others. As an employee of the city of Gloscow Scotland her job is to monitor the security cameras that have been strategically placed throughout the city and to report any suspicious activity or possible crimes she sees to the local authorities. For the most part she keeps a respectful distance from those she's observing contenting herself with following the course of their lives as a generally dispassionate observer. That all changes however when one night much to her horror she spots the man who was recently convicted in the deaths of her husband and daughter walking freely through the streets of the city his sentence overturned on a technicality. Jackie decides that she must now take matters into her own hands to procure for herself and for her loved ones the justice the legal system has clearly denied them.Red Road is a taut tantalizing thriller that turns into a touching human drama in its closing stages. For most of the movie Jackie is obsessed with exacting revenge on the man who destroyed her life. She follows him around first through the various monitors that record his every public move then in person as she literally stalks him through the streets of the city. It is at this point that Jackie crosses over the line from passive observer to active manipulator of events. At times her obsession seems to take on an almost erotic tone particularly after she makes personal contact with him several times making this yet another forbidden line Jackie threatens to cross. Yet the movie is much more than a mere tale of erotic obsession it is a complex study of the stages a grieving soul must go through before it can finally let go of the past confer forgiveness when forgiveness is least possible and achieve the peace it so achingly longs for.Kate Dickie is both intense and poignant as the woman trying to come to terms with her overwhelming tragedy. In an intriguing example of the media becoming the message director Andrea Arnold keeps her camera tightly focused on the character at all times almost as if we too were watching Jackie's life as through a monitor. Tony Curran is also very effective as the man who may not be quite as evil as Jackie has convinced herself that he is.By holding her cards close to the vest Arnold never reveals more of the mystery than we need to know at any given time. We don't always understand exactly what is going on or why Jackie acts in the way she does but this ambiguity only heightens our desire to see the story through to the end. And that ending when it comes is a beautiful and richly rewarding one as the movie takes us to a place we hadn't expected it to at any point prior to its arrival.Two caveats may be in order however one fairly minor the other quite major. The minor one is that the heavy Scottish accents make much of the dialogue virtually incomprehensible to those of us with more Westernoriented ears. Luckily the filmmakers have headed off the problem by kindly providing subtitles for us. The more serious warning involves a graphic sex scene later on in the film in which the action is anything but simulated. Those easily offended by such activity had best be forewarned.".

In fact one of the key characters in this movie is Glasgow in particular the Red Road Estate and tower blocks. The Maldives it is not. And yet amidst this bleak and desperately unforgiving landscape there are stolen moments of kindness happiness and hope.The film is filmed in a Dogmeesque style ie true to life with little or no special effects bar the closing music I suppose which is haunting but it feels rich and layered.The direction is outstanding and the cinematography gripping. The human characters are universally excellent Kate Dickie Tony Curran and a remarkably savage performance from Martin Compston  Whoah I wouldn't like to sit next to him on a train to London. It is a superb exploration of the human psyche of remorse bitterness and in a strange sort of way redemption via a very clever and slowly unravelling plot and extremely believable dialogue.Yes it's bleak.

She appears quite lonely  and very ordinary but she has a tragic past as is revealed later. She recognises someone on camera  someone from her tragic past and seeks to engineer a meeting with him for reasons unknown but which become all too clear.This is a low budget homespun movie but as someone who collects Scottish output I'm glad to have it. It's a novel idea. The film would have been an 18 cert. I would hope. I have never seen such graphic sex scenes in a mainstream movie. They are not always pleasant and there is a pervasive air of tawdry cheap but urgent copulation threaded through the plot. Not for shrinking violets or the prim amongst us but I did catch myself wincing once or twice....that's wincing.However if you rise above the sleaze and sympathise with our heroine who is really a fine upstanding lass with a lust for healthy revenge this film is worth taking a walk on the cheap side.Incidentally although the scale of surveillance is perhaps a trifle overstated it's a grim indication of just how scrutinised we in Great Britain are becoming as a society.".

One day she sees a man she recognizes and sets out to track him down finally stalking him right up to his front door and beyond. It isn't until the end of the film that her motives are finally revealed.Arnold's film works on several levels not least as a gripping psychological thriller. What is her interest in this man? What in their pasts connects them? Was she raped and is she now out for revenge? As the film progresses we get to know the protagonists. Is this man really some kind of psychopathic monster? Is this woman really so damaged and if so in what way? Arnold finally resolves these issues in a moving understated and realistic fashion where a more obvious 'thriller' would have taken a more melodramatic route.In reaching this resolution Arnold is of course greatly helped by her own honest. beautifully written script and terrific performances not only from Dickie but also from Tony Curran as the man she has set her sights on and from Martin Compston totally fulfilling at last the promise he showed in Ken Loach's Sweet Sixteen as a younger hangeron.

While it's predictable and kind of like a backwards Hitch it's a simply cute romantic comedy with some twists and turns.

I watched it again with the director's commentary on later that night and then watched it with my husband on Saturday afternoon. It held up to the repeated viewings so that's one thing in its favor.The movie is a romantic comedy starring David Boreanaz. The premise is that while dreaming of racing his Camaro in the town's annual street car race he runs a business where freshly dumped guys hire him to be the rebound guy for their exes. Mr. FixIt's goal is to make the exboyfriends look not so bad after all by taking to extremes whatever qualities the girls think made the ex worth dumping. Of course the plot thickens when he actually starts to fall for one of his marks ...The low budget nature of the movie and sometimes campy acting actually enhanced my enjoyment as I found its goofy lame quality to be endearing. On the downside there are some plots and themes that seem underdeveloped. His friendship with his male buddies seems particularly tacked on and they only show up when the plot demands. More enjoyable was the mentoring relationship he had with the older mechanics who fix up his Camaro.I loved the kicky soundtrack mostly tunes by The Rosenbergs. I especially like Birds of a Feather which plays near the opening and over the credits.David Boreanaz really demonstrates good range here creating a character totally different from the dark brooding Angel or even the bythebook FBI agent he plays in Bones. He made Lance Valenteen very appealing and kept you rooting for him throughout. Watching his performance in this movie made me a bonafide fan of his! It's interesting to note that while the movie does have some sexual themes and gross out humor there is no cursing and no nudity except for some shirtless David Boreanaz!.Go into this movie expecting light entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously ... and you'll get a few laughs and a positive message to boot.".

The premise seemed enjoyable Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen proprietor of a business called Mr. Fix It where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back.Among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting. Although I've found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles with the exception of that Crow movie he did this was disappointing. At times his character was interesting and others flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. I realize it wasn't a bigbudget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right.My advice watch at your own risk.".

The movie puts him in many hilarious situations making strong execution of the funny bad boyfriend concept that is the basis for the movie. The performances are impressive especially La Garza who plays her role with a touch of innocence that makes you really root for her. The biggest surprise was the movies depth and the way it addresses aging loneliness and regret. It made the film more than just a typical date movie and helped keep my interest. All in all a fun flick and recommended for those who like the romantic comedy genre.".

Lance as Mr. Fix It seduces the guys exgirlfriend and becomes such a bad boyfriend that the girl runs back into her exboyfriend's arms. I've always thought Boreanaz was too brooding and tortured on Angel and in Bones he slurs his words and lulls me to sleep. But somehow in this movie he's transformed into a high energy funny vulnerable romantic lead. Maybe it's the blonde or gold? hair dye that changed him but whatever it is it works and it works well.The movie starts off after some pretty funny scenes of Mr. Fix It at work with Lance getting hired by Bill Smith Pat Healy to help him get back his exgirlfriend an Italianaccented hottie named Sophia Fiori Alana De La Garza. Sophia dumped Bill because he was a chronic liar so Lance concocts a plan to seduce Sophia get her to fall in love with him and then reveal that all the reasons she fell in love with him were lies. With her heart broken Bill's lies will pale in comparison.The execution of the plan is pretty much the movie They date they start to fall for each other blah blah blahit's a romantic comedy so you pretty much know the story and how it ends. But that's the thing with this movie  you don't know! It takes the accepted conventions of romantic comedies and not only satirizes them but uses them to lull the audience into a false sense of comfort so that each new shock is so unexpected that it's embraced by the viewer. The charm of the movie and there's a lot of it comes from its ability to work within the confines of the genre while carefully breaking some of it's rules making for an entertaining unpredictable story.I've never seen the female lead before Alana De La Garza but she made the film. This movie is almost a romantic comedy for guys which makes you root for Lance. But Garza plays the role of Sophia note perfect with a dashing combination of innocence and beauty that you start cringing knowing what lies ahead and hope somehow someway she won't get hurt. Halfway through the movie I wasn't sure who I was rooting for since you genuinely like both characters. Mr. Fix It has a message but unlike most films you believe the message because you've learned it as the characters have through situations and conflict. It's not underdeveloped and forced as in other romantic comedies.".

Had this film been cast with AList stars it surely would have been the top Romantic Comedy for 2006. One especially nice scene features Paul Sorvino and his pals serenading their senior sweethearts in the middle of the night.

To seduce them he gets priviliged information from his clients then assaults the young lady in question with lots of charm and devasting good looks. Inevitably they all fall hard for this whirlwind Romeo with chiseled pecs.Just when he's sure they've fallen for him he springs on them a shower of their worst fears and displeasure coming from your boyfriend and trusted person status. Upon such devastation of their yearn for love and sex each girl automatically calls on thieir exboyfriends for solace and friendship. Et voila another fee earned for Lance.Lance however is having doubts about his career just when he must tackle not only his biggest race event as a driver but as Mr. Fix It too. Sophia Alana De La Garza is the haughty exgirlfriend of Lance's desperate new client. Va va voom can best describe her. With talent a beautiful flawless face and a depth to her eye not to mention someone ALSO thought of giving the girl a script to work for she makes Lance fall for her! That wasn't a spoiler what else did you expect from this flic? This is a busy film. The sequence of events actually make sense this is not usual in a romcom and you feel engaged. Surprisingly this movie also attempts to say something about life and relationships and leaves the floor open for you to think what you wish.I'm a Alana De La Garza fan now.And here is the spoilerWatch out for the last 5 minutes of the film though. This is the war of the sexes....with women usually winning these days. The lead actor's masculinity is castrated in the last five minutes.Apart from that excess it was a fun smart flic.Cheers from Montral.".

I had low expectations going in but I see that shot and I point at the TV screen and say HOLD UP now this guy is a freakin' genius. I haven't seen this director's other films and judging by their IMDb synopses I don't want to but Mr. Fix It is cleverly written wellpaced has some great visual gags and Paul Sorvino for no apparent reason. It's by no means theatrical quality you can see the end coming from ten miles away but for straighttoDVD it's in the top tier.The actors all start to look alike after a while they're all fairly generic LAtypes except for Sorvino and the radiant subtle Alana De La Garza and Boreanaz has limited range but knows how to play to his strengths unlike say that other half of his former TVromance. He's the smug fratboy who's just a little bit more aware of what's going on around him closer to his character on Bones than the dark brooding... well you already know his resume.The meat of the story was fun to watch the setup is clever and this guy does some really evil things to the women he's trying to chase back to their former boyfriends. Does he get his comeuppance? I don't think it's too big a spoiler to say that he does. What happens after that though takes only about 5 minutes of screen time and kinda ruined the movie for me. It's difficult to talk about with spoiling it but essentially there's a new character introduced at the very end of the story and we never get to know her so we don't care. Where a clever plottwister like Wild Things spends 10 minutes of the closing credits revealing the behindthescenes Mr. Fix It spend 30 seconds and expects it to be satisfying.But whatever. The getting there was fun and I wasn't expecting art. And I always enjoy a good gokart race. 710.".

	schema:headline " I felt ten years old again";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember loving Our Gang when I was a kid. Sitting in front of that wood grain TV watching Spanky  Alfalfa wishing I could be a part of their adventures. Then I remember seeing the Little Rascals 1994 remake and hating it Despising it. Worst piece of crap ever. Utter. trash. People who obviously had no respect for the original and just...screwed it up.Well I also remember loving The Three Stooges as a kid. Just classic material. Then I remember seeing the trailer for this new remake and hating it. I moved on putting it out of my mind. It got the 2012 treatment and looked like how you would expect it to look when they rape our memories for a quick buck. Then I was invited to a top secret viewing of the flick. Free. I don't pass up free stuff. So I went. Figured I would have fun ranting about this movie later.So  let me get this out of the way first. This movie surpassed my extremely low expectations for it. And that is where I sat with it for a while after I saw it trying to figure out if I liked it because I had low expectations or because I truly find it to be actually funny. I have confidently decided on the latter.Yes The Three Stooges 2012 is a gasp funny movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the humor. Yes its essentially a fart joke movie but.it is a well made fart joke movie which isn't easy to make. This isn't Norbit. Like the originals there are well placed jokesnice set ups and the story mostly moves along at a nice clip. The characters are interesting and plenty of the gags are laugh out loud funny. The film doesn't take itself seriously at all and is better for it. I felt like the Farrelly brothers have a lot of love for the Stooges and it really shows up on film. You will fall in love the 10 year old versions of Larry Moe and Curly. I would kill to see an entire movie based on them at the orphanage. IMO 10 year old Curly is channeling Vern from Stand by Me. Like eerily a pitch perfect Vern.So the film is broken down into 3 episodes in classic Stooges format but its all one story. You will know where the story is going right away but it doesn't stop it from being entertaining. There are plenty of twists that make for some laugh out loud jokes that I would hate to ruin for you here. The adult versions of Larry Moe and Curly are REALLY good. I have absolutely no complaints other than Moe's jaw looked too big. That is about it. The mannerisms are flawless sound effects are on point even the 'special effects' are done in a way that looks like the originals. The way a bell falls on someone or the way the boys jump on horses. It is all done in a way that looks fake but on purpose. The attention to detail in that department made me smile.There is some depth to Moe that we get to see that could have failed miserably as groan inducing but really works here. I was impressed to see some nuanced range. It was just the right touch. What really makes this movie genuinely funny though are all the peripheral characters. Everyone buys in to who they are in this universe and plenty of characters will surprise you. Every single character the Stooges interacted with in even the smallest ways brought something worthwhile to the movie...just like in the originals.SPOILERS So the cast of Jersey Shore is in the movie for a short time. The only real issue I had was I thought they played the Jersey Shore gag too much. Using topical humor too much traps a movie in that time period when The Stooges should always be timeless. With that said they used the cast well I hate the show and even had a hilarious out of left field Kardashian sisters joke. So the topical stuff was funny but I feel definitely wasn't needed. END SPOILERSThe greatest respect I can give this movie is it honestly made me feel 10 years old again. I was laughing like a kid. I let go of all the criticisms I thought I would want to give it and just sat back and ENJOYED IT. Cant remember the last time I did that with this kind of movie.

	onyx:emotionText "I remember loving Our Gang when I was a kid. Sitting in front of that wood grain TV watching Spanky  Alfalfa wishing I could be a part of their adventures. Then I remember seeing the Little Rascals 1994 remake and hating it Despising it. Worst piece of crap ever. Utter. trash. People who obviously had no respect for the original and just...screwed it up.Well I also remember loving The Three Stooges as a kid. Just classic material. Then I remember seeing the trailer for this new remake and hating it. I moved on putting it out of my mind. It got the 2012 treatment and looked like how you would expect it to look when they rape our memories for a quick buck. Then I was invited to a top secret viewing of the flick. Free. I don't pass up free stuff. So I went. Figured I would have fun ranting about this movie later.So  let me get this out of the way first. This movie surpassed my extremely low expectations for it. And that is where I sat with it for a while after I saw it trying to figure out if I liked it because I had low expectations or because I truly find it to be actually funny. I have confidently decided on the latter.Yes The Three Stooges 2012 is a gasp funny movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the humor. Yes its essentially a fart joke movie but.it is a well made fart joke movie which isn't easy to make. This isn't Norbit. Like the originals there are well placed jokesnice set ups and the story mostly moves along at a nice clip. The characters are interesting and plenty of the gags are laugh out loud funny. The film doesn't take itself seriously at all and is better for it. I felt like the Farrelly brothers have a lot of love for the Stooges and it really shows up on film. You will fall in love the 10 year old versions of Larry Moe and Curly. I would kill to see an entire movie based on them at the orphanage. IMO 10 year old Curly is channeling Vern from Stand by Me. Like eerily a pitch perfect Vern.So the film is broken down into 3 episodes in classic Stooges format but its all one story. You will know where the story is going right away but it doesn't stop it from being entertaining. There are plenty of twists that make for some laugh out loud jokes that I would hate to ruin for you here. The adult versions of Larry Moe and Curly are REALLY good. I have absolutely no complaints other than Moe's jaw looked too big. That is about it. The mannerisms are flawless sound effects are on point even the 'special effects' are done in a way that looks like the originals. The way a bell falls on someone or the way the boys jump on horses. It is all done in a way that looks fake but on purpose. The attention to detail in that department made me smile.There is some depth to Moe that we get to see that could have failed miserably as groan inducing but really works here. I was impressed to see some nuanced range. It was just the right touch. What really makes this movie genuinely funny though are all the peripheral characters. Everyone buys in to who they are in this universe and plenty of characters will surprise you. Every single character the Stooges interacted with in even the smallest ways brought something worthwhile to the movie...just like in the originals.SPOILERS So the cast of Jersey Shore is in the movie for a short time. The only real issue I had was I thought they played the Jersey Shore gag too much. Using topical humor too much traps a movie in that time period when The Stooges should always be timeless. With that said they used the cast well I hate the show and even had a hilarious out of left field Kardashian sisters joke. So the topical stuff was funny but I feel definitely wasn't needed. END SPOILERSThe greatest respect I can give this movie is it honestly made me feel 10 years old again. I was laughing like a kid. I let go of all the criticisms I thought I would want to give it and just sat back and ENJOYED IT. Cant remember the last time I did that with this kind of movie. The audience loved it too and clapped at the end. I know right? We must all be idiots right? Nah. Take your son nephew or goofy buddy and sit back and enjoy some new Stooge material in 2012. Its not often they get it RIGHT so you owe it to yourself to see it on the big screen.";

All three actors who portray the stooges do a flawless job and make you actually forget that they are not the originals halfway through the movie. It's as if Larry Curly and Moe have been pulled out of time and placed into today's society getting into the same type of trouble and running the same type of gags they always would. There really isn't a better way the Three Stooges could have been portrayed in this day and age. The Farrelly brothers do an incredible job doing the character of the Stooges justice weaving a fantastic Stoogeesque plot and transporting these lovable nitwits into the present day. Heck the Farrelly brothers even made sure to include the classic title slides seen before every Stooges short.

The three stars have their parts down perfectly each of them doing bangon impersonations but not overdoing the mannerisms and voices. The Farrelly Brothers keep the comedy innocent and even manage to bring originality to having babies pee on people. The slapstick is fast and well choreographed with a few puns thrown in for good luck.

I always wondered if it was nostalgia that I loved the stooges so much but I still as an adult get together with my dad and will bring over a stooge DVD and watch it with him his wife and my fianc and still laugh like if we were seeing it for the first time. There was something so special about these guys who went through anything just to make people smile and you could tell that they loved doing so. They've inspired so many comedians today and a lot of people still consider them to be the top dogs of comedy they really did create slap stick. So when I heard there was a movie coming out where the stooges were going to be in today's world I just cringed even more so when I learned it was the Farrelly brothers behind it they're a hit or miss team. But in the surprise of 2012 we got a great comedy that I'm sure if the stooges were alive today would really enjoy and that's because of the lead actors who held this film together and had a lot of love and respect for these three knuckleheads.Ever since Moe Larry and Curly were dumped on the doorstep of the Sisters of Mercy Orphanage they have wreaked havoc on the place and have left the nuns there scared. 25 years later the trio is still living there and attempting to help out and taking care of the kids as well. When they get wind the orphanage will be shutting down unless they can come up with 830000 in 30 days the trio volunteers to go out and try to raise the money somehow. A woman named Lydia is trying to kill her husband and offers to pay the trio the money they need to take care of the job. However they botch the job and leave the supposed husband in traction in the hospital. When they try to visit to finish the job they are chased throughout the hospital and escape by jumping off the roof using a fire hose. They end up running into a now grown up Teddy a boy they lost an adoptive family too from the orphanage who invites them to his anniversary party. Turns out that he's the actual husband they need to kill.What could've been a total flop turned into a very funny comedy and I think the reason it worked was because the obvious love that Sean Hayes Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos had for the stooges. The jokes were perfect and even directly taken from some shorts. The mannerisms were also on key and you almost believe it's the real Moe Larry and Curly on screen. Even the side characters were really funny like Sofa Vergara Jane Lynch and Stephen Collins. I liked how we could see the stooges in an updated world where it's completely different from the 1930's. The film has a couple flaws like how they have this heart to heart with Moe which honestly was never apart of the stooge shorts. I can understand they have to have conflict in the movie but it didn't work with the characters. Also there's an end credit scene where they explain the gags. I completely understand where they are coming from on this one but really? After the film?! Why not before the film have a little disclaimer? It was lame and I'm sorry it ruins the movie because it's like having James Cameron doing a scene after Titanic saying how the ship was CGI and none of the actors were actually hurt it takes away from the film. Honestly if you're too ignorant to explain to your children the difference between fantasy and film you shouldn't be a parent. My dad explained all the gags to me when I was a kid and on top of that what kid can pick up a 20 pound hammer and hit someone in the head with it? OK I end my rant on that. However I think this film was a pleasant surprise and a pleasure to watch and I can't wait to add it to my stooge collection when it comes on blu ray.810".

It was lame and I'm sorry it ruins the movie because it's like having James Cameron doing a scene after Titanic saying how the ship was CGI and none of the actors were actually hurt it takes away from the film. Honestly if you're too ignorant to explain to your children the difference between fantasy and film you shouldn't be a parent. My dad explained all the gags to me when I was a kid and on top of that what kid can pick up a 20 pound hammer and hit someone in the head with it? OK I end my rant on that. However I think this film was a pleasant surprise and a pleasure to watch and I can't wait to add it to my stooge collection when it comes on blu ray.810";

All three actors are faithful and accurate in their imitation of the beloved characters. I emphasize IMITATION because noone can ever truly replace or replicate the originals. The actors do a great job bringing the antics of the stooges into the modern day and civilization while still sticking to the classic roots that made the stooges The Stooges. The director and everyone involved in the production of this film are obviously huge fans for working so hard to maintain the integrity of the franchise while modernizing it as well.

	schema:reviewBody "As a big fan of The Three Stooges since childhood I wasn't sure how to feel about this movie. Was Hollywood selling out a beloved franchise or was it actually attempting a faithful big screen tribute to one of the greatest comedy acts of all time?This film was everything I had hoped it'd be and more. When we get to see the Moe Larry and Curly that we all know and love it feels like running into a couple of old friends that we haven't seen in awhile. While the appearances aren't dead on with the original Stooges Sasso Hayes and Diamantopolous manage to capture the very essence and mannerisms behind the original Stooges.There's some very interesting character development for the character of Moe something I didn't expect to find in this film. There's also an emotional depth and a lighthearted silliness that are present throughout the film something which made the originals so great. There's a few questionable scenes here or there that don't quite feel like they fit in the film but somehow we get the impression that if the Stooges could have gotten away with it back then they would have done the exact same thing.The eye pokes slaps and head bonks are all the same as you remember. They look authentic and when they are mixed with the original sound effects you'll find yourself laughing like you were a 10 year old kid again. The Farrelly's obviously put a lot of work and research into the film and if their goal was to make a film that the original Stooges would be proud of and that would inspire a new generation of Stooge lovers then they have succeeded.Don't go into this film expecting it to top the originals. No one will ever come close to them and the makers of this film understand that. Moe Howard was a man who always believed that the show must go on. When Curly was replaced by Shemp naturally the shorts wouldn't be as good as the Curly ones but they were still great on their own levels. The same thing could be said when Shemp was replaced by Joe Besser and eventually Joe DeRita. Moe knew that the golden age of the Stooges was the Moe Larry and Curly era. That didn't stop him though he always continued the act because he knew people needed the Stooges. Don't think of this film as an attempt to top the originals that's just never gonna happen. Look at it was a faithful love letter to the boys and sit back relax and get ready to laugh like a kid again.".

And while there's somewhat of a sentimental plot involving some orphan kids it never goes in treacly territory as there's always some wonderfully staged slapstick scenes that undercuts that.

If you watch either of the shows compared be embarrassed. You deserve it!You can't ask for much more when it comes to acting by the Three Stooges honestly it was brilliantly executed. Although Will Sasso has to be shaking his head wondering Why do my hands curl up in every scene?The cinematography could have used some love just a little extra to add to the quality of the film. We could have used some aging some finer scenery and maybe some variety in set.The PG rated comedy brought humor for all ages. From making the old ladies next to me snort to making the kids behind me kicking my seat laugh it had a little bit of everything. But the broad audience appeal also stretches its ability to deliver a memorable performance. Watch you will all forget about it until BlueRay or DVD no offense release and then easily pass it up on the shelves.But was this humor for all ages comedy worth the admission?

It was done in a very conceited and disrespectful manner.These actors gave me the clear impression that they thought what they were doing was actually improving on the original Stooges.

And it was hilarious. All the bad puns the childish humour the slapping the hitting science being thrown to the wind it was all there.The story is as follows Moe Larry and Curly Joe have to come up with a substantial amount of money 830000 to be exact to save the orphanage that raised them up as kids. To do so they must go into the world and raise this money by any means necessary.On a side note the plot of this movie closely resembles the 3 stooges Nintendo game from 1989  in the game the stooges must raise money save an orphanage. so possibly the writer took the idea from there.With stars like Will sasso who is quite famous for his MadTV skits as Kenny Rogers Sofia Vergara who is the modern day queen of cleavage Jennifer Hudson with a singing voice that can melt stone and the Crew from Jersey Shore this really is a family flick that the whole family will enjoy.Folks go see this movie you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose the main question about this update is will the ridiculously violent but often hilarious slapstick comedy of Moses and Jerome Horiwitz and Louis Feinberg translate onto the modern screens of 2012.Of course I am writing about Moe and Curly Howard and their third wheel Larry Fine who became the Three Stooges after breaking away from comedian Ted Healy and began making a series of short 20 minute tworeelers features in 1933.While Moe was the selfappointed leader and used that power to slap poke gouge crack punch and bop the others at will it was his younger brother Curly who has achieved pop culture status and is revered to this day for his wild manchild antics. He was the darling of the troupe even in his era from '33 to 1946 when years of bad living and alcoholism led to a debilitating stroke.Moe and Larry carried on first with Moe's older brother Samuel Shemp Joe Besser and finally Curly Joe DeRita. After over 200 short films Columbia decided to cease production thus ending the long career of the trio. In 1959 however reruns of the old features became popular on television and introduced a whole new generation to the Stooges' goofiness.Revitalized they finally began making the full feature films denied to them for so long by their studio with DeRita in the Curly role. For years thereafter children including this author would come home from school and watch a full hour three shorts of this team which fits somewhere between the Marx Brothers and Abbott and Costello on my personal funny meter.A criticallyacclaimed TV movie was made in 2000 and now the Farrelly brothers Peter and Bobby have put their love of this troupe into wide theatrical release with Chris Diamantopoulos various TV series including The Sopranos and a voice on American Dad as Moe ironically he was born on May 9 1975 five days after the real Moe passed away Will Sasso Best Of Show Mad TV as Curly and Sean Hayes Will  Grace as Larry.The plot is simple the trio is abandoned as infants at an orphanage run by various nuns some in drag. The sisters including Glee's Jane Lynch and Oscarwinner Jennifer Hudson soon grow tired of the bad behavior which include all of the slapstick the original troupe performed. The three grow up and are forced to earn 830000 to save the home from foreclosure.Like in many of the old black and white shorts the bumbling but goodhearted gang seems to be hopelessly over their heads and in danger of complete failure. However luck seems to be on their side and they often triumph over the odds despite themselves.Here they run into an old friend from the orphanage uncover a sinister murder plot and split up over some petty disagreement. This break allows Moe to make an appearance on the Jersey Shore program and these are easily the most hilarious sequences of this movie. To see Moe slapping and punching idiots like Snooki Mike The Situation Jennifer and Vinnie around almost makes up for the picture's shortcomings.Almost.True Stoogeaholics will most likely long to be watching one of the original shorts instead of spending time on this one which is divided into three titled segments. The jokes are clearly stuck in the 1930s while the boys are supposed to exist in the present day. Also the painful physical humor and aggression that long ago audiences enjoyed may not translate well to modern politicallycorrect sensibilities.I fit somewhere in the middle here. While Diamantopoulos has an amazing resemblance to Moe and Sasso does a pretty good Curly these are not the real Three Stooges I grew up loving and laughing at. Still it was not a bad homage to them either. The Farrelly's clearly know and seem to love their subjects and certainly no disrespect is shown here and the supporting cast seems to be having a lot of fun as well.A silly disclaimer prologue however has the Farrelly's actually instructing the audience not to imitate the scenes in the movie. This hammer is made of rubber see? says Peter. You should never hit someone in the head with a real hammer.Really ...?".

The performances by Sasso Hayes and Diamantopoulos are superb. They hit the nail on the head mimicking the original stooges.The story is about the Stooges raising money to save an Orphanage and the trouble they get into trying to reach their goal..There are great shtick scenes that made me laugh especially the Orphanage Bell scene where Larry David dressed as a nun gets clobbered. You have to see the build up to get the full effect of the gag. The film had some other sequences which were very stooge such as pratfalls pokes slaps and running away from the bad guys. But for some reason the story fell apart with scenes that just didn't fit. I mean do the Stooges need a cameo by the Jersey Shore cast to be funny?Other scenes missed the mark. When I saw the Stooges in tuxes at an upscale party with food around I figured here's a recipe for a classic food fight with a pun just before the person gets whacked in the face with a pie cake or some other party food. The build up of the party scene shows promise with Larry getting a pant full of lobster. But it falls flat after that when they throw the lobster shoot a balloon and a little girl falls into a cake.I liked some of this film but it wasn't worth paying to go see at the theater. I should have waited for the DVD.".

Gibsons film was not only educational and just as funny as their shorts with Columbia Pictures but also very heartfelt and depressing when showing the end of the original Curly Joes comedy career and his passing followed by Shemps passing but along with their reunion performance at the end of the film and summary of the Longest Comedy Act in history coming to an end. Moe Larry and Curly along with Shemp even though he wasn't in the movie WERE NOT special needs nor idiotic freaks that were a menace to society yet a group of people with the gift of laughter to bring people joy by their amazing ability and gift to make people laugh and this movie that has just been filmed and released to theaters deserves to be taken from all theaters around the world collected together and either locked away for eternity or destroyed leaving no evidence of its existence and all digital copies deleteddestroyedterminated so that years and years from now in the future the world may begin to forget about this horrible film.".

She has become so dangerous and emotionally paralyzed by the condition that her husband imprisons her by day in their home. It is Shane's chance encounter with this woman that triggers an event so cataclysmic and shocking it might just lead him to rediscover the tranquility he seeks to restore for himself and his new bride.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had a chance to view Trouble Every Day at the Cinemuerte film festival here in Vancouver and I felt the need to talk about it as it's an extraordinary film yet one which I'll never see again. The film much like Abel Ferrera's 'The Addiction' features a twist on a well treaded horror device in this case Cannibalism and treats it as a horrendous disease which afflicts someone and the horrors that person and as well the people around them suffer. Vincent Gallo who is terrific here plays a newlywed who takes his new wife to France for a honeymoon. It is soon learned that he is also searching for a college friend who with Gallo participated in experiments during their college days which have left them scarred and ravenous. Gallo seems to be fine keeping his cannibalistic urges to a minimum but his college mate played with unabandon by Beatrice Dalle is not. As a matter of fact this is probably the most hateful character I have ever witnessed in a movie. She frequently lures men for sex and when the sex drive kicks in that's when the cannibalistic urges start. Much of the cinema in the past has treated Cannibalism either in a sci fi vein much like George Romero's dead movies or for use as shock value. Cannibal Holocaust Very rarely has cannibalism gone down to a believable state the only film that I can think of right now is 'Alive' but the victims were already dead and frozen. Much of the films were of the fantastic vein this won't happen here sort of thing. While the film does take place in France the director Claire Denis has made the fate of the characters so realistic and haunting that it's hard to shake off. This brings me to the most ghastly frightening and sad scene I probably have seen ever. A young man is seduced by Dalle's character and they proceed to have sex. During which her impulses start to take over and proceeds to bite into his neck. What follows are the most primal maddening shocking screaming coming from the male   It's hard to describe. He's crying screaming shaking. While this is happening like some wild animal Dalle starts playing with the terminally injured man nipping playing with pieces of flesh and kissing him. Sickening scary hateful disgusting haunting. The scene is all of these but it's amazingly well done and probably will stick with me for a long time. All in all I probably won't see Trouble Every Day for a long time if at all. Don't get me wrong I think the film is an amazing accomplishment one of those hooror movies that truly get under your skin and stays there. It's just a movie that is truly hard to like.".

Light on story and big on aesthetics the film moves silently like a sensual and terrible dream. You've got to hand it to Claire Denis  it could have all gone horribly wrong were it not for her ability to set just the right poetic tone and mood.This film is lovely to look at and the camera work is captivating. There is such suspense when the camera follows the back of the chambermaid's neck. The lack of dialog is so hypnotic that when characters began speaking it was an unwelcome jolt. This was especially true of Vincent Gallo Shane whose whiny voice is strangely at odds with his intense and unique looks. Beatrice Dalle is perfect as Core who is more animal than human. Her one speaking line says everything you need to know about her character. There was not a moment that I didn't fully believe Core's plight and pity and fear her.When the movie begins Core has already completely succumbed to the unexplained sickness that Shane spends most of the film trying to suppress. Core is locked indoors all day in an attempt to prevent her from killing but she finds her way out and eventually the prey comes to her.The two much talked about cannibalism scenes occur pretty late in the film and are worthy of the fuss they are stunning.There isn't enough plot development to figure out exactly what is happening to these people or why. There could have been a bit more explanation but the ambiguity makes everything a bit creepier.Then I went to bed and you can only imagine my dreams.".

Surely it is the admittedly confronting content that has people dismissing this nearbrilliant meditation on carnal desire blood lust and homicidal tendencies and not the filmmaking. There is something gratuitous about the scenes of explicit violence in Trouble Every Day but I see no reason why this is grounds to reject the film outright. I think everything else works pretty well from the elliptical narrative that never lets on more than it needs the stripped and reserved performances the suggestive camera work and the beautiful atmospheric photography. The sense of menace created by the guttural aural track and the bloody violence suggest an unusual link between artfilm and horror that is reminiscent of Cronenberg and Ferrara. One of the more compelling films I've seen in recent times.".

It certainly has moments that fit those adjectives but then there are scenes of great power that really impress.  It's difficult and sometimes frustrating viewing sure but very beautiful and brutal and ultimately an extremely fascinating film. 'Trouble Every Day's arthouse approach to horror themes reminded me a little bit of both Abel Ferrara's 'The Addiction' and Jean Rollin's 'Night Of The Hunted' but that's just to give you an idea of the strange territory the movie enters. I can also understand where the David Cronenberg comparisons are coming from but Claire Denis is a lot less clinical and detached. It's a very emotional movie and a lot of that has to do with Vincent Gallo's subtle performance. Gallo 'Buffalo '66' 'The Funeral' is a controversial figure as a person but as an actor there's no disputing his talent. His wife played by 'Ghost Dog's Tricia Vessey is also excellent and Beatrice Dalle 'Betty Blue''s performance is way out there but it's Gallo's movie as far as I'm concerned. This movie is not to everyone's taste no pun intended! but if you are looking for something different and are willing to put some effort in I highly recommend this film. There's nothing quite like it.".

If Denis was aiming in that direction she failed spectacularly this flick from beginning to end just takes itself far too seriously. There isn't a trace of a desperately needed wink or a nudge in sight.'Trouble' died somewhere between the idea and the first draft. It doesn't have much of a plot to begin with but Denis isn't much 'driven' by plots 'Friday Night' is a good example. She's one of them there you know artistes. This indifference to plot is okay by me but don't give us incredulous nonsense in its place while you obey other conventional narrative rules.There are so many silly things happening here that I don't know how to list them  I mean 200lb. men getting eaten alive by a waifish girl screaming bloody murder in terrible pain but apparently not resisting. You know they can't do anything about it they're helpless. I repeat Wow. The biggest whopper of them all begins and ends with the Vincent Gallo character marrying the Tricia Vessey character. Luckily for us all the marriage is unconsummated if not there wouldn't be much point in a script  or a film.This whole feeble conceit strains what little credulity this movie has  a seemingly sweet intelligent sensitive and sensible woman falls in love and marries an extremely creepy guy Gallo who just happens to be a conflicted cannibal. It's just something she kind of overlooked while romancing this decidedly UNromanceable weirdo. Perhaps she neglected to notice his gory fingernails his stale bloody breath. I mean there are plot holes and then there are PLOT HOLES.This most peculiar of marriages REMAINS unconsummated jeez another Wow until they go to Paris on a honeymoon and romp with gargoyles on top of Notre Dame de Paris that's Victor Hugo you hear groaning in the background. The bloodthirsty Gallo realizes he cannot have coital joy with the beautiful Vessey because well you know then he'd have to eat her as he does earlier with a rather luckless chambermaid in a disgusting scene bathed in gore. So in deference to Vessey he savagely masturbates instead. This is a very considerate cannibal.Once again if Denis had just given us a glimmer of a satirical edge this film might have worked. But she plays it straight from beginning to end with no room anywhere for irony.The theme of this movie if you strip it bare started with Nosfaratu 85 years ago and it's been repeated cinematically about 40000 times give or take since then. It's the vampirewerewolf thing gussied up with sex and some stunning cinematography. Denis is treading very familiar metaphorical ground here.We symbolically 'consume' each other we viciously hurt and maim each other we unconsciously yearn to 'enter' and merge with the ones we love to be 'parts' of them all in our quest for a puzzling metaphysical grace a 'sustenance' if you will. Five centuries ago the great English poet John Donne used to write about such things without the explicit flesheating stuff. There's a pretty pathetic and entirely unsatisfying ending to this film as well. BIG SPOILER COMING.The hopelessly oblivious and spectacularly clueless Vessey can such people REALLY exist? notices blood dripping from a shower curtain and in the final frames we know the overheated Gallo is primed and finally ready to do the nasty with her. The camera catches Vessey's eyes in closeup and she's slowly awakening. 'Jeez' those eyes are saying 'I think maybe I made a mistake. My creepy wildeyed hubby is about eight seconds away from ripping my vagina apart with his jaws entering my body and disemboweling me. Gonna eat my intestines and stuff. There's gonna be a lot of blood and I'm gonna be dead. Oh my. Can you in the audience see how expressive my eyes are?' And so the movie ends. I say again Wow. There's no disbelief here to suspend.".

Five centuries ago the great English poet John Donne used to write about such things without the explicit flesheating stuff. There's a pretty pathetic and entirely unsatisfying ending to this film as well. BIG SPOILER COMING.The hopelessly oblivious and spectacularly clueless Vessey can such people REALLY exist? notices blood dripping from a shower curtain and in the final frames we know the overheated Gallo is primed and finally ready to do the nasty with her. The camera catches Vessey's eyes in closeup and she's slowly awakening. 'Jeez' those eyes are saying 'I think maybe I made a mistake. My creepy wildeyed hubby is about eight seconds away from ripping my vagina apart with his jaws entering my body and disemboweling me. Gonna eat my intestines and stuff. There's gonna be a lot of blood and I'm gonna be dead. Oh my. Can you in the audience see how expressive my eyes are?' And so the movie ends. I say again Wow. There's no disbelief here to suspend.";

So here goes...Trouble Every Day was... well... It's hard to express dislike for some films without being accused of shallowness or of not being able to take onscreen gore. The thing is that this is not a very interesting film. It's well shot and all but the acting seems forced not in the overacting sense but in the 'underacting' one. It's as if everyone is trying their best to deliver lines as empty of emotion as possible. I get that it's a choice the director made but along with the lack of dialog it becomes too prominent. Some people spoke of passion or lust or something but I got none of that.The gore was not offensive or over the top either. I'd say it was just enough to get the point across even if one is not accustomed to such things. To be frank I welcomed it when it started because it provided something to look at. Talking about plot obviously the creators didn't care for one but some things are just silly. Breaking into a house and having sex with some girl you found trapped in a room for one...All in all this is a film about sexually transmitted cannibalism shot in an art house film fashion which in my opinion would be much better if it run only 30 minutes long.".

Most of the films I watch I've either known about for years or discovered through a paper trail as it were. It's films like Trouble Every Day that sap all the energy out of me when writing a reviewI'm teetering very slowly on the edge of exclusively reviewing older films rather than traipsing through a land of the absolute garbage that's been released in the past decade. It's a good thing this came out 9 years ago otherwise the statement I made about French cinema in a recent review would be rendered useless.The synopsis of the film is about a recently married American couple who are honeymooning in Paris. The husband is stricken with a strange sexual desire to inflict damage during intimacy. The affects on a more grand scale mirror those of cannibalistic tendencies. He seeks treatment from an expert in the field that may be of use to him the doctor's wife also suffers from this strange desire but on a more severe level.Horror films within the last decade have tried so desperately to create their own niche in the market and more often than not end up creating a subgenre of trytoohards. Speaking on a more personal level I am an artist. I am appreciative of various mediums and I can respect a film's artistic vision if it actually has one. There has to be some level of structure involved on all fronts otherwise the talent pool becomes cluttered with a mass of idiots who like to pretend they're something they aren't. I don't know Claire Denis as a human being face to face but it's apparent that the message of her film is obscure and artistic just for the sake of being that way there are few things on this planet that annoy me greater than that. The people that praised this film for its direction are probably the same people that live in a delusional fairyland where untalented directors can release vomit for wholesale and be praised for it simultaneously. This one is for the birds. If you'd like to watch a film that doesn't pretend to be sophisticated watch 1984's The Company of Wolves  a film that utilizes terrific use of symbolism as a result of REAL talent  not slapdash ridiculousness produced by a team of wannabe's.".

It is not a film one enjoys except in a manner appreciative of it as art and offers a narrative with little closure and sparse plot. It is also moody brilliantly photographed by Agnes Godard excellentlyacted and genuinely unsettling and not just for the muchtalked about gore which takes up around five or so minutes of the film over two scenes.The film's thin plot is based around dark scientific secrets and is more than a little reminiscent of one of David Cronenberg's sexuallycharged horror films but Denis' approach is completely different. The film lacks dialogue for most of its scenes but the visuals tell the story far better than dialogue could anyway. We don't find out very much about these experiments but we don't need to the film is about the characters especially Shane played brilliantly by Vincent Gallo and the film is ultimately more about Shane's struggle with his condition and his love for his wife girlfriend? Not that it really matters... than about the general plot or the gore.Trouble Every Day Zappa reference! is certainly graphic but only when it needs to be. There are two scenes of gore both far from the worst anybody wellacquainted with horror films has seen in terms of the actual onscreen violence but it is testament to Denis' great skill as director and the actors' great conviction that they feel so hard to watch in particular the latter scene. There have been films with more or less similar subject matter made before but most of them are harmed by a cynical harsh approach to their subjects. Denis' approach to this film is far more human even towards what some might not hesitate to call monsters. The film is quiet ponderous and sensitive so is the brilliant score by Tindersticks. The brilliant photography and Denis' wonderful miseenscne capture this warm feel very well especially during the sex scene between Shane and his wife .The critics who almost unanimously lambasted the film in 2001 raise some good points. Perhaps Trouble Every Day is underwritten although I enjoyed the fact that the film let me piece things together rather than tell me precisely what was going on. Perhaps the film has less depth than it thinks it does. But the real question is whether or not that keeps Trouble Every Day from being a triumph of atmosphere and style and a haunting examination of gender roles and human sexuality?

I don't like French films but then stuff like Amlie or Le pacte des loups came along  one a perfect movie one a very entertaining one. And they were French. Could this be? Would the French finally make good movies? So I went to see Trouble Every Day because Beatrice Dalle is in it because it sort of deals with Vampires  and because some women fainted in the Cannes audience. Always a good sign. But alas Trouble Every Day is the worst movie I've seen this year so far. And I see a lot of films. It's perhaps the only movie which makes sex and violence look boring. Imagine that!First of all it's boring. Nothing happens. A man lights a cigarette. A man buys a dog. Stuff like this fills about 80 minutes of the movie. Most of it is utterly pointless. The graphic scenes are graphic indeed. I'll discuss one in length Spoilers The camera crawls around the chest of a young man. We see every hair every pimple. It's nice for some time to see a camera analyze human skin but it goes on forever. Then comes the sex scene. Raunchy. Slightly erotic the people in this movie are ugly. Not much eroticism there. Yes even Dull sorry Dalle looks bad  and then lots of blood. And screams. I had to laugh. Those screams were amazing. First piercing but then only laughable. And again it goes on forever.Well I could go on forever too but I should come to a point Trouble Every Day belongs to those movies that THINK they are so amazingly clever and artsy  but actually are only tedious shallow and stupid. Trouble Every Day thinks it's better than your average horror movie it thinks it lifts the erotic vampire theme to another level. Yes to the level of utter boredom.Avoid this movie at all cost. It's a sleeping pill. Watch a porn movie for the sex and a good horror movie for the blood. You'll get more out of it. Just don't let yourself be lured to the idea that this movie has something to say that it's deep. If you have to watch a Denismovie stick to Beau travail which is very good.

	schema:reviewBody "From what I've read of him I do not like Vincent Gallo as a person and he often physically repulses me. In Trouble Every Day he does physically repulse me more than ever yet I do not dislike him in his role. What I must say impresses me about Gallo is his ability as an actor including performances under his own writing and direction to play roles devoid of any of the ego that he defensively projects what I've read of his offscreen life and that are crippled by hopeless insecurity and apprehension which he showcases without a hint of inhibition or unintended uneasiness. That is why I believe he continues to find work in movies in spite of the unbelievable amount of projects from which he was fired or walked away the amount of people he claims to hate and the mindblowingly infuriated critical and audience reaction to his sophomore effort at the helm The Brown Bunny. Allembracing filmmakers see him as one of the very few actors who has no problem baring himself for a performance as a truly pathetic character. In this film he is honeymooning with his wife in Paris superficially in an effort to nurture their new life together however the core reason is so that he can visit a medical clinic where studies of the human libido are undertaken. He hopes to rid himself of the bloodthirsty urges that have always plagued him.The real shock found in this film is my surprise introduction to Beatrice Dalle who I have never before seen in a movie and near whom I hope to be wearing football gear inside the Batmobile if I ever see her in person. As a doctor's wife who is psychologically in ruins due to a mysterious overextention of her libido and is too dangerous for her husband to let her free from the bedroom during the day she reaches as deeply into the most basic appetitive animal instincts as she is capable and plainly ensues as a nightmarish monster of berserk chaos. It was clever of writerdirector Claire Denis to cast two notoriously wild atypical people of extremity in their roles.Denis's scenes of gore which due to her focus on the morose feelings of the characters mainly Gallo his wife and Dalle are intermittent and often difficult to anticipate are extremely disturbing. During a scene where Dalle attacks a person's flesh as they lay in shock barely able to scream the sounds made by both Dalle and her victim are heard just barely over the glum cheerlessly jazzy score. In the other scenes of violence Denis's wise discerning between the appropriate placement or absence of music asserts a very moving outcome.Though I was expecting a grittier cinematographic delivery the film is stirring well made and metaphorically interpretable.".

	onyx:emotionText "From what I've read of him I do not like Vincent Gallo as a person and he often physically repulses me. In Trouble Every Day he does physically repulse me more than ever yet I do not dislike him in his role. What I must say impresses me about Gallo is his ability as an actor including performances under his own writing and direction to play roles devoid of any of the ego that he defensively projects what I've read of his offscreen life and that are crippled by hopeless insecurity and apprehension which he showcases without a hint of inhibition or unintended uneasiness. That is why I believe he continues to find work in movies in spite of the unbelievable amount of projects from which he was fired or walked away the amount of people he claims to hate and the mindblowingly infuriated critical and audience reaction to his sophomore effort at the helm The Brown Bunny. Allembracing filmmakers see him as one of the very few actors who has no problem baring himself for a performance as a truly pathetic character.

	schema:reviewBody "A man afflicted with a disease that makes him want to kill and eat people I'm a brass tacks reviewer so there it is during intercourse Gallo and his wife are headed to Paris on their honeymoon. Meanwhile somewhere in Paris another man covers up some ghastly murders his wife Dalle commits due to having the same disease. Gallo's condition is deteriorating. Some other things happen slowly that neither the director nor the audience care about in order to set up the eventual meeting of Gallo and Dalle. Things get ugly right around there.The first scene is haunting and reminds me of the best kind of horror like Let The Right One In Swedish version creepy with what is left unsaid the damage done by unstoppable carnal need and the lengths a husband will go through to cover up for his wife. I began loving this film.Sadly though I didn't feel that way by the film's end. Much of it had to do with Gallo's flat performance which may be due to the direction or to his lack of actorly ability. Either way it fails in every way when the guy speaks. Particularly bad were the attempts at a back story which should have just been left out of the film altogether. If you're going to make an arty character study in the horror genre just do it. Don't throw in awful scenes just to make the film partially coherent don't CYA don't bore me with Vincent Gallo attempting to read dialogue. It's just bad unnecessary and takes away from any good the film does eventually deliver. That said there were excellent moments in this film. The scenes with the chambermaid I found to be brilliantly done. We're proved again and again the pliability and vulnerability of human flesh. From the way the camera stares down at the back of her neck as she pushes her cart around to the way she washes her feet after her long shift. This does really establish a sense of empathy for the victim that is essential at least for me to actually being horrified. Denis knows how to create an atmosphere and capture a feeling stylistically I'll give her that.Dalle is breathtaking as a woman who is closeted away by her fearful but devoted husband. She shows remorse but also seems resentful of his attempts to protect her in one scene ripping up the entire household in an attempt to break out and kill again. He buries the bodies of her victims and then lovingly sponges away the blood from her body. Such an interesting relationship should have spent more time on screen than anything with Gallo having his headaches.I think this film would have been quite good had the back story just been absent. Does knowing why the afflicted have the disease really add to the meaning and metaphor attempting to be conveyed here? Not at all for me. Everything about the plot seems to be created and by created I mean thrown in thoughtlessly in order to have the meeting between Gallo's character and the one played by Dalle. Which ends given the synopsis I read before seeing the movie in a somewhat disappointing and farfromclimactic way. Finally we have the couple of scenes that everyone mentions and let's face it these scenes are why this movie exists at all. Everything else seems to serve as a vehicle for the long and drawn out disgustathon of eating someone alive whilst having sex. Now I'm not sitting here aghast at the tastelessness of Denis for including this in her film. I'm a fan of Noe's Irreversible for it's incredibly stark and real depiction of rape in the sickest sense because it is sick. But there's something about these scenes that is a little too shallow. The director is obviously messing with our heads but can't quite pull it off. The scene with Dalle is perverse but hauntingly so and the scene with Gallo starts off surprisingly actually somewhat erotically. However I just can't be convinced these weren't done at least in part in the spirit just to satisfy the weird competitiveness people have for seeing the depths of depravity andor having the courage to face it in their films. Something about these scenes from at least a directorial point of view is just lessthangenuine. Sorry Ms. Denis but I'm not convinced.".

For a movie that was supposed to be very dramatic the actors did not have any chemistry between them as an ensemble. I have no idea why Vincent Gallo was cast. He has got to be one of the most unattractive male leads in the industry. Anyhow. This movie was really bad all around. I would recommend that it be avoided at all costs. This is not one of the films you should see before you die. This is not a film for gore hounds either as it has minimal gore. The gross out alone is not reason enough for a viewing of this movie. I'm sure if you want to know what is so gross about this movie just ask someone who has seen it and save the rental fee. Stay away from Trouble Every Day.".

If you read the plot you could have guessed you are about to see an Italian like gorehorror film such as of Argento's or Bava's films. Forget about them Claire Denis tries an irrelevant job to 'extract' the problematic of human relations particularly between men and women. However the story is so dry that it could not have been a masterpiece even in Antonioni's hands for instance let Denis aside. Denis simply fails in montage. Almost half of cuts are simply irrelevant denoting an unsuccessful effort of artsy impacts. The lights the acting the dialogues are below average. What makes this film worth seeing is the sour taste left with you no I don't mean the film quality you know sometimes it happens when you are affected by something you don't know.

	schema:reviewBody "The first half of the film was great. It was creepy it was suspenseful and it was almost scary speaking as someone who considers most scary films to be dull and silly. The film did a good job of summarizing the first and the 3D was generally welldone. So where did this film fail? Well first the character relationships were extremely superficial to the point where it felt like they were tackedon or unrealistic. Some of the character motivations were also underdeveloped and made the characters come off as stupid or just hard to relate to especially towards the end. The characters take a while to actually enter Silent Hill and when they do the film quickly devolves from creepy moments to explaining the story which is not particularly compelling. Obviously the film makers had to work within the context of the original while trying to tie it into the third game but so much of the film was devoted to characters explaining the plot that it made the film feel somewhat dull. Think of the old adage show don't tell. The film was overly short and it seemed as though this was the central problem. 20 more minutes to SHOW the plot interspersed with a few more creepy scenes and this film could have easily surpassed the original. Alas the director chose to keep the film succinct and the result is that it feels rushed and the last ten or fifteen minutes feel more like a cheesy action movie than a horror film. As I said with twenty more minutes of footage the film could have easily been one of the scariest movies of the last 10 years and could have had believable characters and a more expertly revealed plot. Instead we're left with a decent movie with a few good scares.".

Remember this from the game? So do we! Take a good long look at it! Worst of all the little nods that it gives to the game series are such big parts of the plot that you cannot ignore the fact that they are being used completely out of context and it gets avid gamers like me really mad.All in all newcomers to the series who like horror films will have a tough time understanding it people who enjoyed the first film will probably lose interest fast and anyone who has played the games will spend the entire film sitting in frustration. It is an unpleasant experience and I would recommend that nobody watches this not even to see how bad it is because I don't think the Silent Hill community will be very pleased with another sequel.".

I'm sure this was no easy task but the amount of story they crammed into this film was too much considering the runtime of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely love the first Silent Hill film. The flashbacks reminiscent of how one learns the backstory in a video game were chilling and unveiled a haunting past for little RoseAlessa. So I went into the sequel with anticipation and an open mind but honestly...the best part of this movie was the opening credits which did look pretty awesome in 3D. Everything after that was just boring as heck. The storyline just seemed to move at a snail's pace. Plus the movie relied more on startle tactics instead of horror and gross out factor like the first. The new monsters did a lot of screaming and little else. The older ones we've previously seen were treated like domesticated livestock. And all I got of my favorite character Rose was a 10 second exchange with another character and dialog straight out of a 1.99 Harlequin Romance novel. Ugh! I actually had to wake myself up in the middle of this film. The only other time I've fallen asleep was back in the 90's with Blue Chips. It'd be a toss up as to which I'd be willing to sit through again. Oh and the gal was NOT as good or creepy as the original AlessaSharon kid. Could they not afford to hire that one back again or something?And I really think it was the wrong move to go with a film so dedicated to the video game. Tossing out things like magical totems and demon gods...it just didn't translate to film well. The first one made sense without having to have played the game. The plot for this one seemed too Bmovie especially if you weren't a player.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into Silent Hill Revelation hoping to be proved wrong. Sure I knew the move was going to be a bit gimmicky being shot in 3D and all and the trailers hadn't looked too promising but as a fan of the Silent Hill series I thought that maybe I'd still enjoy the film. Unfortunately this movie is riddled with so many flaws and defects that it completely falls flat.The movie is based on the third silent hill game following Heather Mason as she tries to learn more about her past but more importantly just survive as a series of nightmarish events draw to Silent Hill. The movie tries to follow the plot of the game but deviates frequently in ways that make little sense. The game's plot was already somewhat muddled and disjointed and its translation into a screenplay has only made the plot more nonsensical and difficult to follow. Events seem to occur at random characters are left underdeveloped and there is no logical progression to the story. The film flounders around for a bit before leaving viewers with an unsatisfactory climax which tapers off with an awkward closing scene.The acting is pretty poor and the screenplay isn't much better. Dialogue is stilted and awkward. CarrieAnne Moss and Kit Harington in particularly do a very poor job of delivering their lines and are completely unconvincing. To be fair Sean Bean and Adelaide Clemens do a halfway decent job considering the lines they are given. But overall the acting and writing are both beneath what you would expect from your runofthemill horror flick.The special effects are pretty well done and the 3D does make for some interesting moments. Silent Hill's iconic falling ash and dense fog in particular benefit from this treatment. Most of the time though the 3D is just used to amplify the movies considerable gore. While the special effects are pretty solid they just don't make up for the poor plot and dialogue which really are subpar even by horror movie standards.I really wanted to like this movie but even as a fan of the material I found myself unable to appreciate it. My advice is to save your money and rent it when it comes out on DVD.".

And we as an audience already knew how her father is doing only Heather didn't know again there's nothing to look forward too. We just merely watching Heather going from point A to B and nothing else. It is that dull and plain. And the horror? the movie is trying too hard to be creepy.

	schema:headline " Satisfying for fans of the original but missing that SH touch";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into Silent Hill Revelation with high expectations. I liked the original film for its having successfully captured the feel of the original games even if it wasn't terribly accurate to the actual plot of the game. I wasn't too happy that they skipped adapting Silent Hill 2 but I'll take what I can get for SH adaptations. Although I felt I got my money's worth I wasn't as mesmerized by the film as I thought I would.Revelation's story is a mixed bag. The film is a bizarre hybrid of both the first movie's and the game's canon but it does a good job of tying the various threads together into a coherent plot. If you liked the original film's straightforward take on the cult of Silent Hill and Alessa you'll like this one. It may be missing a lot of the subtlety but the core story is still enjoyable. However a large amount of the dialogue is really awkward and sometimes even winceinducing. Tidying up the dialogue and making it feel more natural would have made a noticeable difference in the final film. Overall the story and dialogue were better in the original movie.If you're looking for a straight adaptation of Silent Hill 3 look elsewhere. Characters have their personality and role shifted plot twists are removed and added and there are a whole lot of Wait that never happened in the game! moments. I would describe this film as being inspired by the original game as it really only covers the most important details of the original plot. However there are a lot of clever references to the original game and to entries throughout the series that will doubtlessly please the Silent Hill addict.Silent Hill Revelations carries over a flaw from the original in that it is absolutely obsessed with the black magic and demonic side of Silent Hill and downplays the psychological and surreal elements of the original games. The dreamlike feeling that the original games inspired in players is mostly gone even moreso than the first. However this does in some ways create a more exciting film and lends itself well to some visceral chase sequences and graphic fights with the monsters of everyone's favorite hellhole.However many of these changes are understandable. The original game thrived on atmosphere and bombarded the player with cryptic notes and bizarre occurrences as they solved puzzles and fought monsters. Film is a very different medium from videogames so logically a lot of things had to be changed to create a story that would fit the pacing of a film. As a result I don't have too many hard feelings about the changes made to the story.The acting side of things is fairly positive. Adelaide Clemens does a fantastic job as Heather. She looks exactly like Heather did in the game and delivers a performance that makes Heather into a much more likable character. Sean Bean gives a decent but underutilized performance as Harry. Kit Harington is by far the weakest link in the cast in his awkward portrayal of a highschool aged Vincent. The rest of the cast give decent if not extraordinary performances.Visually the film is better than you'd expect. They slashed the budget to less than half of the original's but the film still looks pretty good. Monster costuming is phenomenal just like the first. The cinematography is fairly good and does a good job of drawing you into the film even if the first film was better in this regard. The more largescale visual effects and a few of the monsters are obviously CGI but it's not too distracting.The 3D in the film is alright but not necessary by any means. There's some decent depth a few cool popout moments and overall it improves the look of the film but it's hardly revolutionary. Although it is a cashin I respect the fact that they went to the trouble to film it in 3D instead of using a postproduction job. If you decide to see this film I'd recommend shelling out the extra few bucks to see it in 3D as I feel it earns the upcharge.If you liked the first film I'd definitely recommend this film. If you're in the market for an entertaining horror film this Halloween there are worse ways to spend your money. Silent Hill fans will have fun as long as they aren't too picky over the particulars of the original plot. If you were displeased by the original or perhaps haven't even seen it I'd advise passing on this one but for everyone else I'd give this film a thumbs up.".

All this man ever seems to do is walk around! and never anything big or important! i mean his daughter did more in the film then he did! in fact it appears she did everything and again we get another lame story that i don't care about and we have a bunch of strange things happening that i don't care aboutabout the only interesting thing about this movie is the end when the two villains fight each other i thought we had an okay fight between pyramid head and the Evil creature women but even that could have been done betteri thought the fight was poorly edited but it kept me watching at least as lame as it was. I thought the ending of the film was a little clich and it looked like a sequel bait ending which it probably was meant to be because i'm guessing they are going to make a third film which they don't need. All in all i thought this film was quite boring and it didn't have much action in it and it didn't scare me that much either i maybe got one scare max but thats not saying much considering this is supposed to be a horror film.I just found this film pretty lame and in my opinion the first film was better and it made a little more sense too. this film is not terrible but its really not good either and i just didn't care for it and in my opinion we would have been better off without this film they should have just stuck to the original and since they did make this film they should have at least given Sean bean more to do instead of just him sitting around in his house all day. Sean bean may have gotten kidnapped halfway through the story and brought to silent hill but even then he doesn't have much to do and we barely see him for most of the film instead all we see is the lead girl running around looking for him and having weird visions and i just got tired of it after a while but i guess the actors did the best they could and the ending is okay so i gave this film 410 for the effort because it least they tried but all in all i thought this film was nothing special and quite forgettable.".

Sean bean may have gotten kidnapped halfway through the story and brought to silent hill but even then he doesn't have much to do and we barely see him for most of the film instead all we see is the lead girl running around looking for him and having weird visions and i just got tired of it after a while but i guess the actors did the best they could and the ending is okay so i gave this film 410 for the effort because it least they tried but all in all i thought this film was nothing special and quite forgettable.";

	schema:reviewBody "It has been 6 years since the release of the first Silent Hill movie and fans have been eagerly waiting for a sequel. Now we finally have one and boy is it a let down. First off this movie isn't so terrible as I'm making it seem. Heather Mason's cosplay was pretty accurate and they got close with Claudia Wolfe. It did have some good acting in it. It also started off good. However the spoiling of what would have been a good twist to those who have not played Silent Hill 3 could have been easily done without especially since it was made in the first 15 minutes. The character Vincent was introduced well but he said a lot of really bold things to Heather Mason for someone that just met her such as I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Once the characters made their way into Silent Hill the story just started to get really messy. Heather started coming out of character there were pop out scare tactics so cheesy even William Castle would have thought were corny and when Heather enters a room of mannequins we all start to think Oh looks like we're actually gonna see Pyramid Head rape some mannequins! Instead we get more cheesy scare tactics and a character written in only to be killed off almost instantaneously. Also our big climax was a poorly edited fight scene between Pyramid Head and the antagonist and our protagonist just watching. Yeah. The dorky hugging that only last a few minutes was not good enough to be the climax of the story? And to top it off they presented an ending that was bland to those not fans of the game and hysterical to those who are. If you wanna see be my guest. I think fans of the games would appreciate it. If you haven't played the games you might want to sit this one out. It's one of those films you watch on Netflix with your friends just to make terrible puns all through the night.".

The creatures were scary and the less we knew about them the scarier they were. In the last film the acting was great and there was plenty of suspense and a decent director and art team running the project.This one had some great visuals the environments were great to look at. The CGI effects however were not. Neither was the poor use of the actors talent and the over use of extra human characters and monsters. These combined with a terrible attempt to almost follow the 3rd game TOO closely whilst remaining loyal to the first film makes for a bad experience. It's nice to see that the director here tried to make a nice little tie in with both the games and the film but the last film wandered into it's own little story which luckily turned out well. he should have stuck to following the games or the last film instead of both.

It felt that the script was so rushed and it was trying to cover up many story lines from the game and the first film that could leave many nonsilent hill video game fans very confused but the fan will know exactly what's going on. It was tied up nicely to the first film but left many loose ends but it's not something a third movie couldn't fix.For video game fans It's just as faithful to the game as the first movie was faithful to the first game think about it. The movie ran in the same order as it did in the video game and contains so many references for the third game installment. As for the atmosphere it was a bit tame compared to the games but still chilling. The acting was pretty decent and the special effects were amazing. It's thrills it's what mostly stands out from the film it has its scary moments and a horrifying atmosphere. It's bloodier than the first one. Though I was kinda left out with a feeling wanting for more I wasn't satisfied enough which is why I'm desperately calling out for another installment I mean this franchise can be just as successful as Resident Evil.If you liked the first one you'll like this one too especially if your a fan of the game.

I found the effects a joy and i was often marveling at them especially the world peeling away effect which was downright crazy. The acting was great to me I seriously am baffled as to why people are saying it has such bad acting. While some changes made from the game to the movie were a little questionable i still found the movie enjoyable and wonderful. It balanced jumpscares and creepyscares wonderfully.

A lot of scenes are taken from the game that's a nice gift for its fans. The plot is really interesting and twisty and it's understandable for everyone not only video game fans who know the background of the story like it happened with the first movie. The script is wellthought out the dialogues sound realistic the connection to the first movie is clearly explained. Silent Hill 2 has not come down to just an expensive video clip full of visual effects like what happened to the latest Resident Evil movies where the whole script can be written on just one sheet of paper with the most informative dialogues being I need to recharge ammo Cover me and Run. I'll try and stall them to give you time to get clear. The monsters are disgusting and creepy every motion they execute curdles the blood. The unceasing gritting sounds and even piano music create an atmosphere of true horror. I just think Silent Hill 2 could be a little bit longer the time in the movie theatre passed too fast but that's not a big bit of complaint. Well I think it is a mustwatch movie containing a lot of outstanding features of the video game which can satisfy the most devoted fan of the game but being a good independent movie for every horror lover to enjoy.".

I just think Silent Hill 2 could be a little bit longer the time in the movie theatre passed too fast but that's not a big bit of complaint. Well I think it is a mustwatch movie containing a lot of outstanding features of the video game which can satisfy the most devoted fan of the game but being a good independent movie for every horror lover to enjoy.";

HeatherSharon Adelaide Clemens and her father Harry Sean Bean are on the run from a cult group that wants his adopted child back to the Silent Hill though Heather does not fully understand the reason behind any of this. But when her father is taken by the group she is determined to come to Silent Hill to save him and learn the truth about herself the group the town and the nightmare that has been haunting her for so long...Review As a fan of the Silent Hill game series I found that the attempt of the director to stay true to the game plot admirable. Sure it is a headache to balance between the game fan expectation and the commercial element of the movie. So the story of the movie goes slightly off from the game. However I understand the difficulty to cramp a 10hour game into a 1.5hour movie changes need to be made to the movie's storyline. But rest assured the director has made many references to Silent Hill game in the movie game fan will notice this starting from the beginning of the movie itself! and I as a game fan appreciate that. I am pretty sure the director is also a fan of the game series himself!Gamefan view aside the movie itself is generally good. The graphic of the movie especially during transition from the reality to the nightmare world is stunning. Not too mention the ashes effect in the foggy world. Although I did not watched the movie in 3D i am pretty sure it would look good in 3D. In fact the movie itself was done in 3D than later converted to 2D. It also has many scary moments disturbing image gruesome killing and horrible monster.. Should be interesting to watch them in 3D!Storywise this movie is actually quite complicated and heavy. This is to be expected from a gametomovie genre. If you never played the game you will be very confused with the storyline. Even myself who played all the game series aside from the latest one still do not understand the game fully. However the director try to solve this by having Heather read a book her father wrote about Silent Hill. A good attempt to simplify the back story but otherwise failed to clear the confusion.Adelaide Clemens has done a fantastic job in bringing the main character Heather. She was the central character of the movie. The director did a good job in casting her as she looks surprisingly similar with the game character! However there is not much development with the other characters. Alessa who is a very important character in the game version has surprisingly limited role. It is fair to say that Heather aside the other characters has no development at all. Silent Hill game fan will be disappointed by this.In conclusion the movie itself is good but like many gametomovie genre it suffers the same problem it still fails to balance between stayingtruetothe gameplot and changetheplotsoitfitsintoa movie. Silent Hill hardcore gamers will most probably find the movie adequately satisfying but personally I think the movie did a fine job to follow the game storyline. For the nongamer viewers this movie is good but can be quite heavy and complex.Final Verdict 6.510 for the nongamer viewers as it is hard for me to imagine them not having questionsconfusions or even halfasleep when they come out of the cinema. To Silent Hill game fans 7.510 for you. Check this movie out see if you like it. I do.".

	schema:reviewBody "'SILENT HILL REVELATION 3D' Four Stars Out of Five3D sequel to the 2006 horror film based on the popular survival horror video game of the same name. It was written and directed by Michael J. Bassett and is based on the 'Silent Hill 3' video game. The film centers on the heroine's daughter from the first film Sharon who's now a young teen and lives with her father while constantly on the run from a ruthless cult. The cult wants Sharon back in the nightmarish alternate dimension world of 'Silent Hill' where her mother is still trapped. Radha Mitchell who starred in the first film only has a cameo in this chapter. Sean Bean and Deborah Kara Unger also reprise their roles from the first movie. They're joined by Adelaide Clemens Kit Harington CarrieAnn Moss Martin Donovan and Malcolm McDowell. Horror fans are sure to be pleased with this installment as well as fans of the video games I've heard. I haven't played the games but being just a fan of artistic imaginative horror I thought it was quite an achievement.Heather Clemens is now turning 18 and after being on the run with her father Harry Bean for many years he goes missing. She's never fully understood who she is and why her father and her have been running from town to town. She doesn't remember 'Silent Hill' but has been tortured by nightmares of it for years. She soon discovers that the people of the alternate dimension town want her back. Her mom Mitchell has been captive there for years and now her father is as well. A young man named Vincent Harington who grew up in 'Silent Hill' has been sent to our world to help bring Heather back. Vincent is not a bad guy of course though and sees Heather's true beauty so the two join forces in surviving 'Silent Hill' and unraveling it's mysteries.The film is like a true nightmare and is played out in beautifully grotesque elaborate detail the set design effects and 3D are all spectacular. It looks horrendous and really has that nightmarish feel to it. I'd put it up there with the classic slasher films of the 80s like the 'A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET' and 'HELLRAISER' franchises. It's every bit as creative and grotesque. The acting is all decent and the directing is fitting. The story is a little too rushed and fast paced but I've read it's really faithful to the video games and gives the fans just what they want to see. I know nothing about the games but I did like the original 'SILENT HILL' movie and would put this second installment right up there with it. It's a classic B slasher film done right.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vsD9BHpPUnE8".

What drives her to Silent Hill is finding out WHY her father was killed and who she is. Vincent  you don't even really meet him until a third through the game though I get why they introduced him like they did for the film. Then you have Douglas who wasn't supposed to die that soon and actually helps Heather. He didn't help her in the slightest so his character was just kinda there. And Claudia was the one that was supposed to actually off him after telling him what Heather was going to be used for. I was looking SO FORWARD to that!! Some pros were that the movie starts out similarly to the game with her dreaming that she's at the Lakeside Amusement Park. What got confusing though was that Nightmare!Silent Hill was so prevalent and there wasn't a lot of the typical Silent Hill more on this later.I will say that this time Pyramid Head made sense. He didn't make sense at all in the first one considering he's in the second game unrelated to the first and third games and is the manifestation of James' inner turmoil. They switched his meaning around to have him in this film but it worked and you can tell that it was really something for the fans  to have Pyramid Head portrayed as he was. As a fan I DIDN'T MIND AND I LOVED THE TAKE. There was a lot of action which while it's nice it took away from the character development and the real dark feel of Silent Hill. The whole love of Silent Hill is being completely alone trying to solve puzzles and figure out everything on your own occasionally running into another person but eventually just going your own way. That's what draws the fans to the series and why the first film was pretty damn good. Look I've been a Silent Hill fan since the first game was released in the 90s and I even own the Silent Hill Play Novel  I taught myself to read Japanese all so I could play that game. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but then again. Like I said there was a lot to put into one film from one of the best games in the series. It was an interesting take! And while I may not go to see it in theatres again I will definitely be getting it when it comes out on DVD. Oh! They also had about five different rearrangements of Never Forget Me Never Forgive Me each sounding wickedly awesome and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn was singing the ending theme. That just made it for me. I love that they use Akira Yamaoka's music in it. The music really does give the feel of Silent Hill.".

Set in the gaslight era of the 1880s it's the same plot involving an actress instead of an heiress.The actress is Betty Grable who has just scored a big triumph on the London stage and is the toast of two continents. She's also about to marry a title in the person of Reginald Gardiner but she's gotten wind that that notorious scandal sheet the Police Gazette has uncovered her past as a burlesque queen. The reporter with the nose for news is Robert Young and his editor is Adolphe Menjou.If you've seen Love Is News and That Wonderful Urge than you know exactly how this will all end up. But along the way with several musical numbers you'll see Betty Grable probably at the height of her career when she and Rita Hayworth vied to be the GI's number one pinup girl of the barracks. Harry Warren and Mack Gordon wrote a beautiful ballad My Heart Tells Me which Betty and Phil Regan sing during the film. Sadly Darryl Zanuck banned her from a commercial recording so others made hit records and money off the song she introduced. Robert Young got to sing the title song and he was not going to be a threat to Bing Crosby or that new singer from Hoboken that was coming up at the time.The film was significant in another way for Betty Grable. During the production it was shut down for a bit when Betty ran off and married Harry James. Apparently that was cause for great happiness even Darryl Zanuck didn't mind the production delay.If you're a Betty Grable fan Sweet Rosie O'Grady is an absolute must.".

From there they each try to outdo the other in revenge mode and from here the plot goes far afield.It is all harmless fun and as bright and glossy as Fox could make it. The surprise as noted above is Young who I didn't consider as either particularly funny or as a singer but who proves he can be both here. Good support from Adolph Menjou and Reginald Gardner helps the cause. Leonard Maltin raved about Menjou in his review and he gave a workmanlike but unspectacular performance.

Then the present offering which at only 75 min. appears to have been meant as a B picture with A stars. Although not as popular as Coney Island it certainly is an entertaining film both the music and dialogue. Robert Young is Betty's male counterpart as they carryout a version of the battle of the sexes with Young as a reporter for the scandal sheet The Police Gazette. He exposes Betty's origins as a burlesque queen to her embarrassment as she is currently the darling of the legitimate theater. Thus Madge Marlow of the legitimate theater is the same person as Rosie O'Grady previously of Flugleman's burlesque house. The screenplay is essentially taken from Love is News only the female lead is characterized as a rich showgirl rather than a rich heiress. It would be done yet again in 1948's That Wonderful UrgeThe first 2 songs Where oh Where is the Groom and Waiting at the Church were sung by Betty as part of the London musical comedy Belle of Bond Street. Duke Charles TrippinghamReginald Gardiner whom Betty has been flirting with is in the audience. She asks him if he will marry her as she would like to be a duchess. He says yes  but only when he arrives in the US about a month later. Meanwhile Betty is going to the US to do a tour. While in transit she comes upon a copy of The Police Gazette with Young's article about her past. When she arrives Young using a pseudonym greets her warning her about the overeager reporters. She soon discovers his real identity and tells reporters that she has dumped the Duke for him embarrassing him. This initiates a continuing war between them for the rest of the picture. Eventually it's evident that they have really fallen for each other although she sometimes still teases him. The Duke shows up unexpectedly early and is sent on his way. Eventually the Duke is paired with Betty's maidVirginia GreyThis seems a strange turn of events. Apparently Betty found Young more interesting than the stuffy Duke and decided to forgo the royalty title. The musical numbers are rather evenly divided between traditional songs and new songs composed by the prolific team of Harry Warren and Mack Gordon. There are two songs we might consider theme songs the traditional title song which Young is said to have composedThis being 1880. Then there is the WarrenGordon song My Heart Tells Me. Both are sung on at least 2 occasions.The finale show is Sweet Rosie O'Grady in which Betty sings and dances to the title song. The other main song of the show is Going to the County Fair also good. Previously while riding in a coach and slightly inebriated Betty and Young sing Two Little Girls in Blue and Little Anne Rooney.A must see for Betty and Young fans. See it in glorious Technicolor at YouTube. I give it a 9 one point taken off for Betty's excessive lipstick and over the topliterally sophisticated hairdo which I find distracting.In 1950 Fox released The Daughter of Rosie O'Grady which can be thought of as sort of a sequel to this film. June Haver rather than Betty took the title role.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Music Hall star Madeleine Marlowe Betty Grable returns from London to America where she has wowed society and is romantically linked with a Duke Charles Reginald Gardiner. On her return a reporter Sam Robert Young exposes her as a former Burlesque Queen Rosie O'Grady. The film then follows the tricks that Rosie and Sam play against one another in order to get the upper hand. At the end love is in the air.Unfortunately the songs and dances in this film aren't any good and this lets the film down as the story doesn't have the strength to carry the film alone. The scenes with Betty Grable are good but when she is not on screen there are some pretty dull moments.

On her return a reporter Sam Robert Young exposes her as a former Burlesque Queen Rosie O'Grady. The film then follows the tricks that Rosie and Sam play against one another in order to get the upper hand. At the end love is in the air.Unfortunately the songs and dances in this film aren't any good and this lets the film down as the story doesn't have the strength to carry the film alone. The scenes with Betty Grable are good but when she is not on screen there are some pretty dull moments.

	schema:reviewBody "Below is a transcript of a hand written letter from Harper Goff in 1974 of which I have a copy which I think might be of interest.  This is an unusual comment entry but I hope you will find this letter a fasinating rare glimpse into the process of creation and will give a better appreciation of the artistry of the design of the Disney 'Nautilus'.  Harper Goff was responsible for the 'look' of the submarine in the Disney Production along with much of the film's set designs.  Enjoy!Harper Goff writes....I was assigned the task of getting together a 'truelife' adventure film using some exceptional underwater footage shot in a laboratory aquarium by Dr. McGinnity of CalTech's Marine Biology lab in Carona Del Mar.  Walt Disney thought inasmuch as 20000 L.U.T.S. was in public domain we might do worse than use the title for a current TrueLife adventure short subject. Walt went to England and I stayed in Burbank and made a storyboard of a live action version of the classic using McGinnity's footage as a sort of ballet episode where Nemo shows Aronax the wonders of the deep.  Walt liked the storyboard well enough to have me give an 'A.R.I.' Audience Reaction Inquiry to a group of exhibitors who were in town.  They were enthusiastic and the rest is history.In motion pictures the text of a classic like this subject is sacrosanct like the Bible!  The 'word' of Jules Verne is not to be made light of so the duty of the production designer like myself is to take the sometimes arbitary discriptions of the Nautilus as recorded by 'J.V.' and make it work.a. Jules Verne while foreseeing brilliantly the atomic submarine of today did not at that time invent the periscope the torpedo tube or sonar.  He did not prophesy closed curcut television.  According to Verne if Nemo wanted to see what was going on the surface he simply poked the glass ports of the conning tower out of the depths and took a direct look.  He risked his vessel himself and his crew by ramming the enemy at frightening speed. If he wanted to study the marvels of life under the surface he reclined in his elegent bay window lounge and passed the hours studying the marine life outside the amazing pressure proof window of his luxurious salon.  These items dictated much of the direction of my production designs.b. Nemo is quoted by Verne as telling Aronax that I need no coal for my bunkers.  I have instead harnessed the very building blocks of the material universe to heat my boilers and drive this craft.  No one can doubt Verne meant Atomic Power.c. It is not sound economics to study and design obviously unnesscessary parts of the Nautilus if it will not appear on screen.  The crews quarters were thus unaccounted for.  In Verne's original text Nemo from time to time leaves the chart room and steps directly into other diversified areas of the submarine.  Directors do not like to slow down the action and clutter up a dramatic moment by showing actors leave a room lift a hatch enter another room.d. At the time Captain Nemo constructed Nautilus on Mysterious Island the iron riveted ship was the last word in marine construction.  I have always thought rivet patterns were beautiful.  I wanted no slick shelled moonship to transport Nemo thru the emerald deep and so fought and somehow got my way.  On Mysterious Island Nemo had the white hot heat of a volcano to help him build his dreamship but I am sure that flat iron plates profusely riveted would have been his way.  His stock pile of material was always the countless sunken ships uniquely available to him alone.  Even the Greek amphora and the works of art that graced his great salon was salvaged from wrecks.e.  The free diving suits  selfcontained were developed by myself with the assistance of Fred Zender and exceptionally able underwater man.  The helmets were soupedup Japanese pearl diving helmets.  We masked the scuba gear let water into the the helmet put a breathing tube in our mouth the clamps on our nose and one night in 1952 Freddie and I walked slowly from the shallow end to the deep end of the Santa Monica pool.

We spent 9 hrs. a day 7 days a week for 8 weeks at Lyford Key in the Bahamas underwater! Never lost a man Fred was in charge of safety.f. 20000 Leagues was the second cinemascope picture to go into production. Fox had the worldrights to the anamorphic lenses developed by a French inventor named Cretien.  This lense squeezes the horizontal dimensions of a scene into half the normal area on a cinema frame.  If projected thru an anamorphic projection lense it unsqueezes this image and the resulting image is widescreen.  Fox had only one lense to lease and this meant that Disney could not shoot miniture set ups while the main action sequences were before the cameras.  I hit upon the idea of having the prop miniature shop build a squeezed Nautilus miniature.  The model was built half as wide and half as long but just as high.  Even the rivets were squeezed.  This one miniature was shot with a normal lense.  If care was taken to insure the Nautilus remained on an even keel the resulting footage was more than adequate.  When unsqueezed by anamorphic projection the image of the Nautilus was stretched to normal proportions.  Of course the bubbles looked strange but no one seemed to mind.  The success of this experiment made it possible for the special effects department to make its necessary footage of many of the underwater miniatures simultaniously with principal photography of the actors.g.

You can describe him as a despotic man who's got a grudge against the earth that made him suffer. Moreover he regards himself as a sort of governor of the ocean. In this way Jules Verne's novel introduces a reflection about man and the extension of his power thanks to the machine the Nautilus.Of course the movie is supported by a dazzling performance.

But Kirk Douglas just wants to escape because for all of Douglas's carefree philistinism he sees Nemo as a murderer and a menace. The conflict between both is what drives the story.20000 Leagues Under the Sea won Oscars for both Special Effects and Art direction. It is probably Walt Disney's most successful live action film ever done even beating out Mary Poppins dare I say. Even in this day of computer generated effects 20000 Leagues Under the Sea still holds its own with more modern films.Kirk Douglas enjoyed the part of Ned Land the harpooner and it's a favorite of his today. He might have made a few more films for Walt Disney but for an incident that took place after the film. Disney was also at the same time creating his first theme park Disneyland in Anahem California. When it was opening he invited Kirk and his family to spend the day there on him and he even agreed to furnish a camera crew to follow the Douglas family around as they enjoyed the park attractions. So Kirk took his wife and his sons and they had a grand old time and got some free home movies as a souvenir. But Walt Disney kept the negative and the films showed up on his Walt Disney Presents television show. Of course Kirk never got paid for this appearance and neither did any of the rest of his family including young Michael Douglas. Even though this left a sour taste in Kirk Douglas's mouth as he related in his memoirs The Ragman's Son he liked his work in this film very much and the part certainly has the same kind of exuberance we expect from a Kirk Douglas movie. Kirk even gets to sing in the film a nice little sea chantey called A Whale of a Tale. He even made a record of it and I'm sure if you can find it the item might be worth a few dollars as a collectible.Right around the time 20000 Leagues Under the Sea was released the United States Navy launched it's first atomic submarine.

	schema:headline " A parable an exemplary sci fi story a classic tragedy";
	schema:reviewBody "This is by far the most literate the most moving and the most cinematically sophisticated film Disney has ever made. Those of the reviewers at this IMDb site who dismiss it as a kiddie movie or who sneer at the special effects time has not been kind to this film one of them says according to another the thrill is gone seem simply prejudiced rather like those who automatically deride any film that features Charlton Heston or deals with a biblical theme. It is indeed quite amazing that any special effects filmed in 1954 would continue to stack up so well. I suppose Lucas or Spielberg could improve on the giant squid today but so what?The acting is almost uniformily superb although I seem to be in the minority in my opinion that Kirk Douglas' yohoho clich sailor is rather wooden. v. following paragraph James Mason portrays Captain Nemo as a tragic hero in the classic sense neither byronic nor a mad scientist a man so far ahead of his time that the world can only see his invention as a monster to be hunted with harpoonsand yet he is so tragically wounded by the whose malice and envy of lesser men that he has indeed become in some ways a monster. Paul Lucas is equally heartrending as Professor Arronax the goodhearted bourgeois academician who truly believes that anyone can be made to see reason and become in effect a nice guy. Between these huge opposites are the robust common man of action Ned Land Nemo's cracked I want to escape! the Professor's worrywart servant Conseil Peter Lorre and Nemo's equally devoted spookily laconic First Mate Robert J. Wilkes.I may as well say at the outset that to my mind the characterization of Ned Land along with Kirk Douglas' stiff and utterly unnuanced portrayal remains the major fault of the film. I would have liked to have seen an attempt at capturing Verne's taciturn Ned halfmad from the tension between his enforced submarine claustrophobia and his romantic longing to once again swab a deck reef a sail or entrust himself to winds and currents indeed according to the novel's Aronnax Ned's recitals of his adventures are worthy of a Homer of the North. Most unfortunately the wisecracking womanizing Ned of the film seems to reflect Douglas' momentary screen persona more than Verne's character since it bears so little resemblance to the latter. Also the fact that Douglas outbills Mason in credits and advertisements is as weird as the ubiquitous poster art in which Douglas' head is two sizes larger than Mason's.

	onyx:emotionText "This is by far the most literate the most moving and the most cinematically sophisticated film Disney has ever made. Those of the reviewers at this IMDb site who dismiss it as a kiddie movie or who sneer at the special effects time has not been kind to this film one of them says according to another the thrill is gone seem simply prejudiced rather like those who automatically deride any film that features Charlton Heston or deals with a biblical theme. It is indeed quite amazing that any special effects filmed in 1954 would continue to stack up so well. I suppose Lucas or Spielberg could improve on the giant squid today but so what?The acting is almost uniformily superb although I seem to be in the minority in my opinion that Kirk Douglas' yohoho clich sailor is rather wooden. v. following paragraph James Mason portrays Captain Nemo as a tragic hero in the classic sense neither byronic nor a mad scientist a man so far ahead of his time that the world can only see his invention as a monster to be hunted with harpoonsand yet he is so tragically wounded by the whose malice and envy of lesser men that he has indeed become in some ways a monster. Paul Lucas is equally heartrending as Professor Arronax the goodhearted bourgeois academician who truly believes that anyone can be made to see reason and become in effect a nice guy. Between these huge opposites are the robust common man of action Ned Land Nemo's cracked I want to escape! the Professor's worrywart servant Conseil Peter Lorre and Nemo's equally devoted spookily laconic First Mate Robert J. Wilkes.I may as well say at the outset that to my mind the characterization of Ned Land along with Kirk Douglas' stiff and utterly unnuanced portrayal remains the major fault of the film. I would have liked to have seen an attempt at capturing Verne's taciturn Ned halfmad from the tension between his enforced submarine claustrophobia and his romantic longing to once again swab a deck reef a sail or entrust himself to winds and currents indeed according to the novel's Aronnax Ned's recitals of his adventures are worthy of a Homer of the North. Most unfortunately the wisecracking womanizing Ned of the film seems to reflect Douglas' momentary screen persona more than Verne's character since it bears so little resemblance to the latter. Also the fact that Douglas outbills Mason in credits and advertisements is as weird as the ubiquitous poster art in which Douglas' head is two sizes larger than Mason's. Leaving aside my pet peeve i.e. Douglas there are many Shakespearean qualities here in addition to the tragedy of Nemo. For one thing much of the action takes place inside the characters' heads First Arronax Conseil and Land analyze Nemo assaying a most dangerous attempt to ferret out his motivations.

	schema:reviewBody "The Walt Disney film of 1954 20000 Leagues Under The Sea is nothing short of a masterpiece within its genre. While comparing it to Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane might be done by others in calling Leagues a 'masterpiece' it would be comparing apples to oranges for this epic while not overlong as are most masterpieces it is completely contained to tell a gripping story with wonder acting production values and the special effects of the day.It is had to know where to begin to list the wonderful achievements here especially in adapting a book of almost a thousand pages much of it filled with endless lists of the fish and fauna of the sea of which Jules Verne was especially fond. Such was unfilmable of course and the script writer Earl Felton was wise in paring down the verbosity of the novel which of course was the usual for the prolix Victorian style of Verne's day. From that wonderful opening of the titles shown against lush drapery illuminated by rippling water reflections of the undersea cast upon it to the beginning of the inspired majestic score by Paul J. Smith one is transported to a fantastic time and place and the artistry to come is well intoned. Customarily the Director is given the lion's share of the credit for a film's success but here it is an almost perfect melding of the story the acting and the visuals as well as the music that combine with seeming effortlessness to entertain.James Mason as Capt. Nemo is superb with his wonderful bearing and diction lending the aura of both contained madness and yet sympathetic grace to a character who could have been so easily overplayed. Disney wisely selected Kirk Douglas and Peter Lorre as the physical foils of Nemo and to provide the comic and action relief. Had this not been done the intellectual bearings of Nemo and Paul Lukas' Professor Arronax would have overloaded and stilted the film rather the way they do in the novel. Some take exception to the device of Esmeralda the seal but that too is a needed counterpoint to the otherwise dark theme of the implied mission of the Nautilus the destruction of warships that spread man's inhumanity to man. Such is the skill of the spare dialogue in the film that one never is hit over the head with the sermon of the hopelessness and wickedness of war and the nations that sponsor it. This film carries the message of the novel but it never looses sight of its first purpose which is to entertain. Even the implied nuclear destruction is not trumpeted but only alluded to since such energy source was unknown to Jules Verne in the 19th Century of course but was highly topical in the 1950s. One of the glories of the movie is the marked artistry in all the careful details in the film. It was just then that the USA was planning its first nuclear submarines the first of which was even named the Nautilus in memory of this immensely popular film. But the art director John Meehan the production designer Harper Goff and the set decorator Emile Kuri were never carried away by allusions to then modern technology but kept faith with the setting of the day by making the ship a wonderful creaturelike form the interiors a skillful blend of needed science for function coupled with a lush decor that bespoke not only the Victorian times but also the sensitivity of man of its genius of design. Look at the touches the electric iris covering the massive bubble window the fountain in the captain's drawing room complete with an artistic pipe organ properly intoning Bach's Toccata and Fugue in Dminor as most appropriate. Even the uniforms and upholstery are embroidered with the 'N' of Nemo's monogram as are the galloons on the edges of the draperies. The inventiveness of the electric charge upon the hull is also one of the clever devices to invoke the future yet help make the existence of the undersea ship believable.Everyone who sees this epic will always remember the night scene of a handtotentacle fight with a giant squid as truly unforgettable and most appropriate again for it was only a few years before that the first complete corpse of such a squid was found in complete form and thereby documented what others had only written of. This film exceeded its class in that day and age yet even if equal actors could have been found for the earlier versions they would have been too early to truly depict the vision of Jules Verne's technology of the future.Some have criticized that the entire novel was not on film but were the entire book to be filmed it would exceed five hours and Disney knows that even with the finest production a film must be limited to approximately two hours in order to get both an audience willing to sit through it as well as exhibitors willing to show it. In making a movie the constraints are much more severe than in writing a novel a movie is a collaboration of many people and many conflicting desires and egos must be assuaged. The flow of an entertaining story is paramount since this was never to be a documentary. Each actor's agent works to try to get the maximum time on screen for his client which gets maximum credit and fee for the actor. The limitations of filming such an imaginative novel also created large costs which the producers would try to show on screen to justify it all to the accountants since a film is created with the aim of making a profit for the studio and its investors. We must agree that they succeeded in making one of the most interesting and visually spectacular films ever made whereas the book contained a great deal of unfilmable ichthyology that was more of an excursus into the expertise of Jules Verne than any dramatic device. All in all I think that were Jules Verne alive in 1954 he would have been well pleased with this celluloid version of his epic story.".

	schema:reviewBody "If one wants to read the best edition in English of Jules Verne's TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA the edition to turn to is edited by Mr. Walter Miller and published by Washington Square Press. Miller did a wonderful job at showing how the editions of the novel have been bowdlerized over the last 137 years it was published in 1870 by translators who were determined to dampen the antiimperialistantiBritish theme of the novel. Miller who also did the definitive modern edition of FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON did the first edition about 1985 and the second edition in the 1990s.Someone at the start of the novel has been attacking various ships on the seven seas ramming them from underwater. In several cases the ships almost been sunk in the movie one is blown up. Yet the culprit from the descriptions of survivors seems to be a monstrous fish or sea serpent. An expedition is sent out by the U.S. government under a Captain Farragut Ted De Corsia here in the brig U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. On board is harpooner Ned Land Kirk Douglas Professor Pierre Arronax of France an expert on oceanography  played by Paul Lukas and Arronax loyal servant Conseil Peter Lorre. Despite the doubts of Captain Farragut Arronax is certain it must be a serpent. Eventually the Lincoln is attacked by the strange creature and Land Arronax and Conseil are thrown off the brig and land on the creature. It turns out to be a submarine boat and it's owner and navigator is Captain Nemo James Mason. Although at first willing to sink his boat below the ocean's surface to allow the three men to drown he changes his mind  but insists that they are now his prisoners. And the three are taken on a cruise of the world's seas by Nemo for the rest of the novel.Now it was a novel written in 1870. At that time submarines were experimented with but with indifferent success. Cornelius Drebbel had built a successful one that was tried in the Thames in the 17th Century. David Bushnell's Turtle had tried to sink a British frigate in New York Harbor in 1776. Robert Fulton had designed a successful submarine in 1802 and tried to interest first England and then France in his weapon. In 1859 a French submarine was tried out. Then in 1864 although it is doubtful if Verne knew about it the Confederate handcranked submarine C.S.S. Hunley successfully sank the U.S.S. Housatonic in the first successful submarine attack in war. The problem was that submarines looked flimsy as opposed to the strong looking frigates and naval surface craft at the time including early ironclads. Also to be truthful there seemed something sneaky about warfare under water.But Verne took it one step farther  the submarine Nautilus is designed for comfort not only for warfare more hereafter. It has luxurious accommodations like a parlor with organ a museum of various nautical curiosities a library staterooms for Nemo his guests and his crew. So far in the 108 years since John P. Holland's submarine was bought by the U.S. the idea of a luxury yacht submarine has not caught on yet  particularly the parlor has a thick glass window to allow you to see the creatures of the sea like in a vast fish bowl.Verne did mention electricity as the key to the motion power of the ship  the film suggests Nemo has discovered a new power to move the engines i.e. atomic. Verne never dealt with atomic power  one of the few examples of a lack of imagination that Verne ever showed. He was a firm believer in modes of propulsion that one could see and feel  hence his attack on H.G.Wells' use of cavourite in the FIRST MEN IN THE MOON which was a chemical based on hydrogen. Verne's moon cannon the Columbiad worked with guncotton.The key to the novel was the political attack on imperialism  in particular British. In the attacks of the Nautilus on the ships it does the worst damage to British based ships. The reason is that Nemo is an exIndian Prince named Dakar from the Sepoy Revolt. Unless you read the complete novel you do not realize that the Prince lost his wife and children in the reprisal killings of the Sepoy Revolt and he and his men are cruising the seas doing damage to the British Empire financing antiBritish activity throughout the empire when they can. The explorations of the seas is secondary to the political reasons for Nemo's actions.Some of the adventures of the Nautilus and it's crew and passengers are exciting but now are dismissed as false. The submarine cruised under the ice to reach the South Pole  actually it would not get far due to the Antarctic continent. But in the 20th Century the U.S.S. Nautilus the first nuclear powered submarine cruised under the ice to reach the North Pole in the 1950s.Mason gives a good performance as the tormented Nemo who is basically a good man but is consumed by hatred although it is never made clear why. Douglas is good as a happy go lucky but realistic sailor who is determined to escape. Also this film is one of the few where Douglas sings A Whale of a Tale. Peter Lorre does well as Lucas' servant who gradually realizes that his employer has become besotted by the learning experience of staying with Nemo forever  Lucas forgets the danger he and his associates are in. The special effects for 1954 are first rate  and the film remains quite effective. It is possibly the best film ever made out of a Jules Verne novel.".

Douglas is good as a happy go lucky but realistic sailor who is determined to escape. Also this film is one of the few where Douglas sings A Whale of a Tale. Peter Lorre does well as Lucas' servant who gradually realizes that his employer has become besotted by the learning experience of staying with Nemo forever  Lucas forgets the danger he and his associates are in. The special effects for 1954 are first rate  and the film remains quite effective. It is possibly the best film ever made out of a Jules Verne novel.";

Captain Nemo is a wonderfully written antihero whos what would be described nowadays as an environmentalist  but dont dare confuse him with being some sort of yogurt knitting tree hugger because this is a man waging a violent crusade against warmongers and anyone else he sees fit to exterminate . Its a really intriguing character study and Nemo is played superbly by James Mason . Compare Masons performance as Nemo to that of Steven Seagals role as ecowarrior Forrest Taft in ON DEADLY GROUND . Done so ? A laughable contrast isnt it . Kirk Douglas may disappoint as Ned Land but his real function is to act as a physical square jawed hero alongside the academic and somewhat ambigious Professor Arronnax.I also appreciated the fact that Disney resisted the temptation to invent a child character in order to make the film appeal to children more by way of audience identification  nor is there any sort of mawkish sentiment or frivolity thats spoiled many a Disney film . In fact this is such an exciting thoughtful adventure if it wasnt for the presence of a seal I wouldnt have believed it was a Disney film .Did I mention theres a great battle with a giant squid ?".

Professor Pierre M. Arrnoax Paul Lakas and his assistant Conseil Peter Lorre were invited by the US government to find. They were attacked by the 'so called' monster and found themselves shipwreck with Ned Land Kirk Douglas a sailor. Captured by the monster they found out it's not a monster at all but a submarine the Naultius captain by the mysterious Nemo. James Mason explorer of the ocean bottom '20000 Leagues Under the Sea'. What Pierre and the survivors doesn't know at first is that Captain Nemo is borderlining between genius and madness. A man who is at war at the surface world while being tired of war. Arrnoax knows of this but due to his lust of knowledge he continue to take the side of the captain while Ned Land tries to escape. 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is based on the science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne with the same name. There are some big differences between the film and the novel. The film tends to cut outs or combinded such in case the treasure scene and the shark. Much praise for keeping much of Captain Nemo's reasons to attack the surface world and keeping the violence and death in for a PG movie. Without it it wouldn't be much of a adventure. The film can be a bit outdated thus some action scenes with the limited special effects might be a bit cheesy but at the time well made. It's far superior to the majority of genre efforts from the period or any period for that matter with production design and technical effects that have dated hardly at all. The soundtrack is spellbinding mysterious and glam. The haunting classic organ music plays well into the film. 'A Whale of a Tale' by Al Hoffman and Norman Gimbel as sung by Kirk Douglas sound as real as a sailor's hymn. Kirk Douglas is the perfect fit for Ned Land. Land is everything that Nemo hates about the surface selfcentered greedy and ego driven. While all of the actors did great in their respectable roles it was James Mason that got singled out for his performance of Captain Nemo. Even the point that Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo is a strong message. There is hope for the future. And when the world is ready for a new and better life all this will someday come to pass in God's good time. It's a great adventure so give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was 13 I visited Disney World as a present for my graduation from elementary school. I was already too old and I was rather annoyed at most of it. Particularly annoying was the 20000 Leagues Under the Sea. It had the longest line and when I finally got on the ride it was utterly boring. It also takes longer than all of the other rides as well. Well the movie on which the ride is based is fortunately much more fun and you could probably watch it thrice in a row from the time you step into the ride's line up to the moment you get back off the thing!. It's actually one of the best films Disney ever put its name on counting both live action and animation. In fact the only one I can think of off hand that I definitely prefer is Mary Poppins. A good deal of 20000's success can probably be found in Jules Verne's novel. I have a feeling that a lot of the dialogue and plot were left intact I know some of it was changed. The script and dialogue are enormously literate. Disney films rarely if ever express this much intelligence and depth. It would only equal half the movie though if the lead actors weren't aboard. Kirk Douglas Paul Lukas Peter Lorre and James Mason are at their bests here. Douglas and Mason in particular give stellar performances Lukas' character is more of an observer and Lorre is well Lorre but both have great scenes. Douglas plays Ned Land a harpooner and the sole survivor of a ship's crew which was attacked by the Nautilaus. He's energetic and funny and he also effectively communicates his dilemma as someone who has no real purpose on the ship and is thus disposable. Heck Kirk even sings a great song believe it or not! Mason plays Captain Nemo a character that became so archetypical afterwards that he might seem somewhat cliche to some. But Mason has some of the most amazing line readings. Richard Fleischer's direction is quite good. The film also benefits from an obviously enormous budget as the production values are aweinspiring. Take for example a scene in which the Nautilaus begins to sink. We see various bolts burst and pipes bend. We see the details when they repair the ship. And the giant squid attack is actually quite well done. The special effect technology is a bit crude at the time a goofy rubber shark thankfully only appears in one shot but the squid's enormous tentacles look and move realistically or at least as realistically as one can demand for a film from this period. I'm telling you don't ignore this movie just because Disney produced it and you can only get it in one of those giant plastic retard cases. It's a great great film. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "20000 Leagues Under the Sea is probably the greatest novel by the father of the entire science fiction genre.I happen to own an annotated edition of the novel.  Its editor explains that French and other European readers take Verne more seriously as an author than do most Anglophones who consider him a writer for boys.  The latter verdict is unfortunate and can be blamed on incompetent translators and disrespectful publishers.  For one thing they mangled technical passages which they did not understand causing critics to disparage unjustly the science in Verne's science fiction.  Secondly they completely omitted many passages of shrewd social commentary from Verne's original French.It is true that Disney was not altogether faithful to details in the novel.  But in other ways I found him confronting his viewers young though they were with questions of uncommon sophistication and probity just as did the real Jules Verne.  Disney pulled no punches with respect to the moral ambiguity of all three of his major characters.  They are not herowhite and villainblack. To say they are shades of gray does not do justice to their vividness. Let us say that they are zebras.  McCarthyites must have squirmed to see a film which made kids think so hard about what one should or shouldn't do in the name of science or of fighting slavery or of escaping incarceration.Another striking aspect of this screenplay is how it is reminiscent of Sartre a major philosopher in the 1950s.  His play Huis Clos No Exit was published only ten years earlier. In connexion with this play Sartre stated his view that a portrayal of several mutually incompatible characters condemned to live together forever would make for gripping drama if I am not mistaken he said that this should be the perfect drama. This is exactly the situation which Nemo Arronax and Land face in the Nautilus and it is remarkable how tightly the dialogue concentrates on the ramifications of this predicament.  Hardly a word escapes their lips which does not allude to it.Children's films have seldom gone deeper than this in any sense.".

This adaptation is a corking scifi adventure that benefits from great work from all involved.The cast are just smashing James Mason is the stand out as the barmy but intelligent protagonist Capt. Nemo gruff and menacing with a dandy slice of camp into the proceedings. Then we have Kirk Douglas who out Popeye's Popeye tough and rugged with a song and dance to help moral along and even taking time out to befriend a seal to help jolly the film in heart. Peter Lorre is solid as ever and Paul Lukas almost steals the show as the conflicted Professor Pierre Aronnax. The sets are wonderful the direction seamless and the special effects make it hard to believe this was made back in the early 1950s but ultimately its a story for adults and an adventure for the kids. Containing a giant squid sequence that sees Mason  Douglas fighting it to the death serves as proof positive that 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is an unadulterated joy. 910".

Like all Disney film this is not a great adaptation of the novelthe novel is so boring though but it is probably the best known adaptation of the book. To start off the cast is marvelous more specifically that of James Mason as the antihero Capt. Nemo. The movie also stars Paul Lukas Peter Lorre and Kirk Douglas. Most of the film takes place in the Nautilusdesigned by the genius Harper Goff and it gives the audience a feel of claustrophobia. The underwater shots of the Nautilus are beautiful. However those scenes would not be as good if they were not accompanied by Paul Smith''s beautiful score. Another Disney legend on this movie is matte artist Peter Ellenshaw. He painted a bunch of boats that looked very much real and he painted Vulcania. The highlight of the movie is the giant squid a scene that took up so much money that it could have been the end of Disney as we know it. Overall 20000 Leagues is in fact a mighty motion picture with great acting music and special effects that contribute to the overall quality of the film.".

Cruel Intentions 3 is another amoral mean and erotic tale using the same concept of Cruel Intentions and Cruel Intentions 2 but without Kathryn Merteuil performed by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Amy Adams respectively. Cassidy has the same lack of character of the original Kathryn and is a good substitute for the original character.

But their intentions go cruel when they compete for taken ladies and who can do it first. Then they go for Cassidy in the ultimate bet of all and see who is the ultimate smooth operator.Cruel Intentions 3 at least to me was also very predictable for me the ending wasn't that big of a shock.

Glad it was on TV and I didn't lose anything except sleep. Smith is an eyeful in this with his brooding good looks and fantastic build. Nice to look at. Only thing that made me keep watching. But that lead girl Kristina Anapau was awful. With looks of a weasel squinting eyes thin lips overly glossed and ridiculous hair she prances around in a bikini mistake there as she's a skinny 's broad thinking she can seduce anyone in pants. Wrong. There were far more attractive young ladies walking around her as extras that could have done better. I won't even ask how this girl got cast. I felt sorry for director Scott Ziehl and writer Rhett Reese as they didn't get much from a poor cast except Kerr Smith's performance. Kerr deserves better offers than this.".

I rented this third installment hoping for a slight taste of the first hell even the very weak second movie. I was ultimately disappointed! If you are searching for the eloquent dialogue the powerful acting talents visually appealing set strong narrative and bitter sweet love story found in the original movie you will be extremely dissatisfied.The plot outlines the lives of three vindictive shallow students in their scheme to seduce conquer and destroy each other and other coeds. The movie jumps from wager to wager but there is no depth or satisfaction in any of their conquests. The sex scenes are tacky REALLY tacky the characterization is beyond week and the dialogue is short of drivel. Without the familiar face and onscreen ease of Kerr Smith or the sexy savvy Kristina Anapau I would have rated this film 110.Save yourself the horror just rent the original again even if you have seen it 100 times over!".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this is another one of those laughers where a 30something Smith tries to play a 20 year old college boy lothario. That is a time tested Hollywood tradition and not unexpected in a movie of this caliber. What really tests any semblance of credibility is the 'college' itself. Trust me there isn't a real college anywhere this side of an internet diploma mill that looks like this one. What you really have depicted here is one of those 2500.00 three day weekend seminars where art history majors and trust fund freelance photographers go to get a couple hours instruction in Photoshop tweaks on how to produce fine art prints with inkjets or something along that line. Lots of time at the pool plenty of time for sex games among the precocious Botox and Power Peel set and one or two hangover busting workshops looking at digital slides.The only sex scene really worth anything is when the Evil Nerd does a quick and nasty 'back seat' style hump on a cute blonde one night on the grass in the resort courtyard. A little bare tit shows up and the blonde's orgasmic cries are slightly above porno grade. The real standout though is the cinematography. Through careful photographic site selection grimy and tawdry modern LA is distorted into a rather appealing collection of exotic faux Mediterranean and colonial California Mission locales where the vistas are always bathed in warm late afternoon sunglow or hidden among cool seductive night shadows. This city hasn't looked this good since Jack and Faye explored it in 'Chinatown.' Or at least since the soap opera 'Santa Barbara.'Rent this only if you want to see LA presented the way the California Department of Tourism might want you to see it.".

Better yet you shouldn't even be reading the reviews for this movie in the first place.I mean really it's Cruel Intentions 3. We know what this is all about  the petty betting matches between sexcrazed wealthy teensyoung adults with obviously too much time on their hands. It's a soppy clichfilled teen drama. What do you expect? The original Cruel Intentions wasn't great because of its airtight script or ingenious plot either let me tell you. It was great because it had an exceptionally great cast for this genre. Do you honestly believe it would have been the hit it was without Sarah Michelle Gellar Ryan Phillippe Reese Witherspoon Selma Blair Christine Baranski Louise Fletcher etc? So that's where we are with Cruel Intentions 3. Same old plot just without the stellar cast. So what do you get? A fun playful knotty and even down right meanspirited movie all in one. And I hate to say it but it's not nearly as bad as it could have been.The beautiful and relatively unknown Kristina Anapau does well as Cassidy Merteuil cousin to Gellar's character in the original Cruel Intentions. The other actors are not worth mentioning but do about as best a job as can be expected for this genre.As I said before if you want Oscar material pass this by but if you're just bored and want a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously or you're a fan of the franchise it's worth a look. I would have given it 5 stars but because this film didn't add anything fresh over the original it loses a point for lack of originality.".

Not surprisingly I found it to be very entertaining.Kerr Smith plays Jason an annoyingly handsome and rather devious prep school student who along with his amoral pal Patrick Nathan Wetherington has made an art out of seducing hot women. After playing a mean trick on rich bitch Cassidy played by brunette hottie Kristina Anapau with whom Jason has a lovehate relationship the two guys realise that they need a tougher challenge so they set out to bed two of the least available girls on campus.However when Patrick uses particularly nasty tactics to achieve his desired results Jason teams up with Cassidy to teach the scoundrel a lesson.Whilst Cruel Intentions 3 may not be in the least bit believable with its ridiculously gorgeous yet impossibly wicked characters and extremely unlikely plot developments it is a whole heap of tacky fun. There's loads of eye candy for both guys and girls some gratuitous TA and lots of wanton debauchery meaning that those who enjoy titillating and tawdry trash will not be disappointed.".

Cruel Intentions 3 has a few good plot twists some pretty decent acting a super hot lead girl and a really good ending. The only thing that kept me from rating this movie a 7 or an 8 was that some of the plot never really felt finished. At 80 minutes or so this movie could have benefited from ten more minutes to answer these questions.This movie is what you'd expect it's nowhere near great but it's at least competent and in my opinion worth watching once if you're a cruel intentions fan. If you liked the Wild Things sequels Cruel Intentions 3 is along those lines.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I am not the biggest fan of the Cruel Intentions movies in fact the only reason why I watched all 3 of them is because I really like the Dangerous Liaisons storyline and I want to see how they could possibly carry it on. The original Cruel Intentions film was basically a retelling of a story about sexual deviency originally set with adults of the French Aristocracy set in High School and the way they try to make this work...Its pretty clear why this isn't everyone's cup of tea. Not because its shocking but because it doesn't work. The second one I will give credit actually entertained me but because that movie assaults its audience with so much stupidity that its hard not to laugh at it. Its damn near one of the funniest movie ever made.Now when it comes to this film its the worst of the series.The plot of this movie is split up into thirds. As in one plot will take up one third of this movie its that confused as to what the Cruel Intentions should be. The first plot is a bet that Merteuil has with Jason that she can sleep with a nerd named Patrick and then some bland guy who is in touch with royalty but that goes belly side up because during the date with the English guy I'm sorry I don't know his name Patrick comes over with flowers and proves to him that she had sex with him. Patrick then reveals to her that this was his doing the entire time and he and Patrick were in cahoots with each other the entire time which leads to the one biggest question what the hell did either of the two guys get out of it?So the guys then decide to compete with each other for sexual points as such. One of them has sex with a girl who is engaged and a girl who is happily with a boyfriend. This plot starts 20 minutes in and ends by the hour mark. The THIRD story is that because they both succeeded in their quest on the exact same night they decide to make a bet that they can bed Merteuil. It turns out that Patrick is being played the entire time and he ends up going to prison for raping Merteuil.I will give the acting of this movie credit it does try to pull something off but considering they needed to split up the character of Valmont into two people to show the two faces to his personality instead of just having the one actor that should tell you what the writing is like. Oversimplified even for a Cruel Intentions movie. There isn't any character at all in this that has any depth Merteuil is evil Jason is a player as is Patrick. There the main characters and the height of their depth all described as a list.I will give it credit in one area that this was pulled off. Instead of High School its set in College and that is one area where I have to give it credit for. It tries to update it to an older age while keeping the look of a Cruel Intentions cast. Does it work? Even here no.Overall there is a slightly variant degree as to why this one is worse than the first one but its like measuring the pain of being stabbed in the chest or being shot in the chest either way its gonna hurt. If your a fan and you are a completionist go check it out but I'm not sure that you'll enjoy it but if the filmmakers of this didn't put any effort into making the movie why should I in my review of said movie?".

	schema:reviewBody "I sometimes wonder if the people who make good movies ever feel a pang of anger or disgust when they see somebody else doing a crappy directtoDVD sequel of their work. It's not like the original creators are responsible for the talentless mimics who superficially ape their creations. They most times probably don't have a choice and for poor efforts like Cruel Intentions 3 that only copy the idea and form but nothing specific from the first movie I'm not even sure they get paid for it. But it takes time and energy to make any film and when those efforts produce something worthy it can't be fun to see someone else do a halfassed job trying to piggy back off your labor and success.Cruel Intentions itself a modern version of Dangerous Liasons was the story of amoral and decadent young people playing games of sex and betrayal where Sarah Michelle Geller and Selma Blair made out with each other. By the time they bothered to crap out this thing that plot was as worn out as a heavily used piece of carbon paper how's that for a dated reference? This movie is actually closer to a Star Trek mirror universe version of Beverly Hills 90210 where Dylan has been coated in sleaze Steve is a psychotic rapist and Brendawell she's just an even bigger bitch.Set at an expensive private college that's more like a summer resort than any kind of school the movie's main characters are Jason and Cassidy Kerr Smith and Kristina Anapau. She's a jaded rich girl and he's the guy from more humble origins who wants to have sex with her. Jason and Cassidy sit around and talk about what horrible people they are even though they never do anything bad enough to get themselves on the Jerry Springer show. They're eventually joined by Patrick Nathan J. Wetheringon who's supposed to be so evil and twisted he made Jason and Cassidy just look naughty. Since they're neither all terrible or shocking Patrick comes off like some aggravated fraternity reject.Those three surrounded by a cluster of poorly written script fodder engage in a string of contests where the goal is for somebody to have sex with somebody else. That's pretty much what most college students spend all their time doing anyway so there's never much of a point to it. The plot plods along with the occasional scene that isn't outright horrible and then concludes with a double cross that only confuses who is actually the evil character in this bunch.Here's the bottom line on Cruel Intentions 3. A couple of bit part actresses take their tops off for a combined total of less than 45 seconds. They look nice but there is no other nudity here. The only violence is an implied rape that happens 99 off camera. The language never gets saltier than an infrequent Fbomb. The young cast all seems reasonably capable but their roles are less than paper thin and there's never any reason to care if anyone lives or gets run over by a golf cart. And the film ends with a moral that being a screwed up bastard is fun and the only thing that matters is being an even more screwed up bastard than the next guy.If this had been trashier with more naked flesh profanity and all around debauchery it might have made a marginally decent flick. However the substance of Cruel Intentions 3 is simply too tame to overcome the disinterested storytelling and submediocre filmmaking on display here. There are no facepalm moments where it runs completely off the rails. There are also no moments where it gets anywhere close to being interesting. You shouldn't watch this but if you've got a friend who wants to see it for some silly reason you don't need to run screaming out of the house to get away.".

'99 was a decent year for TV and one of the gems was a show called Popular.  Popular turned out to be....well popular and Manchester Prep was canceled before it ever aired it's pilot.  The first few episodes were already shot so it was repackaged with a few reshoots and rewrites and some gratuitous nudity into the form of Cruel Intentions 2.The tonal changes throughout the film and different stylistic changes that plague the film are due to the segments of the TV episodes having been shot by different directors and then roughly tied together with reshoots by another director for the movie version. The film takes on a pulp feel as it plays on the inside jokes from the original film which was designed to set up a connection between the show and the film as time progressed and panders to the innuendos of the film in the lowest exploitative ways possible.If you look hard enough you will find its connection to the first film however viewing Cruel Intentions 2 before the original will likely dissuade you from viewing the original as this one lacks the sophistication and charisma of the original.".

This movie also has something else that the original didn't have nudity. Although THe deleted scenes of the first one had a few seconds this one has two sisters taking a shower with Sebastian.

And we also have a few other scenes that were mimicked straight from the original.  We're introduced to some new characters which were supposed to purposely bear similarities to ones in the original like the nerdy blonde chick who was a mimic of Selma Blair's character.This movie was originally going to become a TV show Manchester Prep.  But with all the controversy it never made it to air.  I think it might've worked out quite well as a TV program and I probably would've watched itbut if you're going to coarsen it up a bit and transform it into a directtovideo prequel to Cruel Intentions...once again I say Why bother?The actors in general were a notch below the ones in the original.  The one who played Sebastian in this installment doesn't have the charm or looks of Ryan Phillippe.  In fact he looks pretty geeky.  You can't imagine this guy seducing an old lady much less his beautiful love interest in the movie.  The actress who takes over the role of Catherine has that bch quality that almost measures up Sarah Michelle's so I can't really complain about her performance.  If anything this movie has more of a sense of humor.  There are some sitcomlike gagsagain showing us this was more suited for TVthat I got a chuckle out of.  The plot goes through the formulaic motions and concludes with a preposterous plot twist thatI guessserved as an eyeopener for an otherwise mediocre tale.  Speaking of eyeopeners there's a shower scene that the guys will fully appreciate.  wink wink  If you have the DVD it's much more convenient.  You can just go straight to that scene.  God bless the makers of DVD!!!OK that was a shallow comment but I'm not criticizing Casablanca over here.  This is a directtovideo prequel and you pretty much get what you expect.  I loved the original Cruel Intentions but I can't say I'm going to keep high expectations for anything that heads straight to the video racks.  But I have to say my expectations were slightly heightened when I found out Roger Kumble the writerdirector of the original wrote and directed this movie too.  My score  5 out of 10".

Then the dialogue is also crap.Sebastian About to have threesome If you cant beat them... Virgin Girl Who says you can't beat 'em?Lame.The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad aside from the fact that she's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar was that she was the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him. She was a tease who liked playing with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. Then in this P.O.S. it implies that he CAN have her along with a girl on the side. What? And we don't even see the sex either. It's implied making it not only stupid pointless and contradictory but worthless too.And in the first one Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love making him a loser. Even though he won the bet that crumbled his chances. Then in this excrement he looses AND falls in love. So she doesn't screw losers only complete losers? Another thing it's stated that Sebastian has never been in love so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl?Then at the end virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover dun dun dun and like I said they go into a lame offscreen threesome. Stupid. There's several other plot contradictions. Did the writer even see the first film? A 5 year old can point his stuff out.After the threesome Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sit in the front listen and smile evilly into the camera. The end... Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film. I guess all it took to make little Sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls.

Kathryn whose passion is to cause trouble whenever possible attempts to scupper Sebastian's new relationship whilst also doing her best to corrupt pretty and naive virgin Cherie Keri Lynn Pratt.Whereas the original Cruel Intentions was with its cast of trendy Hollywood stars a calculated attempt to be cool savvy and ohsoclever Manchester Prep is a trashy immature and totally unsophisticated movie that by being far less pretentious manages to be just as entertaining as if not more than the first.Adams is easily a match for Sarah Michelle Gellar Kathryn in Cruel Intentions being both convincingly cruel and very sexy Thompson is great as the pretty poor girl of the school who captures Sebastian's heart and Keri Lynn Pratt is charming as the Manchester Prep virgin who learns why riding horses is so popular with young women. Hats off also to Annie Sorell and Alicia Lorn who are unforgettable as Sebastian's horny brunette shower buddies female nudity in a teen drama has rarely been so gratuitous!.Manchester Prep might not be innovative groundbreaking cinema but it sure is fun. Not quite an 810 but a pretty high 7.".

Kathryn whose passion is to cause trouble whenever possible attempts to scupper Sebastian's new relationship whilst also doing her best to corrupt pretty and naive virgin Cherie Keri Lynn Pratt.Whereas the original Cruel Intentions was with its cast of trendy Hollywood stars a calculated attempt to be cool savvy and ohsoclever Manchester Prep is a trashy immature and totally unsophisticated movie that by being far less pretentious manages to be just as entertaining as if not more than the first.Adams is easily a match for Sarah Michelle Gellar Kathryn in Cruel Intentions being both convincingly cruel and very sexy Thompson is great as the pretty poor girl of the school who captures Sebastian's heart and Keri Lynn Pratt is charming as the Manchester Prep virgin who learns why riding horses is so popular with young women. Hats off also to Annie Sorell and Alicia Lorn who are unforgettable as Sebastian's horny brunette shower buddies female nudity in a teen drama has rarely been so gratuitous!.Manchester Prep might not be innovative groundbreaking cinema but it sure is fun. Not quite an 810 but a pretty high 7.";

Well I wouldnt like to drag so Ill go straight to the point Its plainly the best teenage girl fantasy ever. Yup guys this ones got babesaplenty but ones with wittiness and a brain. The step sister really makes for a GREAT villain. Shes not just the typical snobbish rich girl often seen in this kind of movies shes much colder smarter...I could believe a girl like this exists!As for the rest of the female cast man theyre heavenly! Beautiful clever and the guy who designed those uniforms really knew what he was up to! Dont miss the stepsisters merciless seduction of her teacher. Thats good cinema! On a minor note what about when another teacher rejects her but immediately shows his liking for a male student? Its a great gag!Thanks to the good writing in this movie the bad brotherhood of rich spoiled teens actually ends up becoming sympathetic. Dont miss the muchcelebrated shower scene! You cant hate those girls!!The main character Sebastian makes for a great counterpart for the villain. Intelligent selfassured but sensitive nevertheless and unwilling to let his stepsister have her way.And the movie really does have a message. It is Romanticism and faithfulness are ok but...other ways may be good also. Much better in fact. Are the characters in this movie bad actually? Yeah theyre rich and spoiled but they only mess with their equals and what for? To tell them Hey were rich Were beautiful. Put traditional morals aside and enjoy sex and life! Which by other side you can also do not being rich at all. You just dont have to live by everybodys standards. Is it having a single steady lover the only better way? The story presents this questions with great intelligence.And as said before the flick is full of really beautiful ladies. The Danielle character in particular is one to really look at. I sure hope to see more of this actress!So ignore the reviews do yourself a favor and watch this one without prejudices! Its lots better than 75 of the stuff thats making it to the silver screen. Great story great humor gorgeous babes...It sure deserves a chance!".

Words can not explain how bad it is but I'll give it a go anyway.The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first film. Sebastian Robin Dunne is kicked out of a private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to make a fresh start and just a life a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately he has to deal with his stepsister Kathryn Amy Adams wants to drag him down. Sebastain starts to fall in love Danielle Sarah Thompson the innocent daughter of the Headmaster of the school. Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep around with the whole school which had been describe as a 'whorehouse'. Kathryn also wants to get revenge with Cherie Keri Lynn Pratt who humiliated her during the school assembly. Kathryn wanted to make the freshman into the biggest slut in the school a similar subplot to the first film.Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a cancelled TVshow which was turned into a prequel. There are so many problems with the film. It is poorly written unfunny and badly acted. Luckily for Amy Adams that the show never took off because now she is a fairly big actress. Whilst Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can been seen to be set in the real world Cruel Intentions 2 is set in sitcom land and as described on amazon.co.uk 'a randy version of Saved by the Bell'. There were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film but in Cruel Intentions 2 tried to make it funny and some of the ideas in the film shouldn't be such as Kathryn having an affair with a teacher. Other ideas also don't work such as the secret society where all the popular kids meet to discuss the downfall of other students. The film also had a major problem of sexualised 1516yearsold. I know that teenagers do have sex sometimes a lot but when done on film or television is treated very seriously. One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie who is around 1415 in the film to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm. The idea of turning a girl around 1415 into a slut is just very wrong with me and shouldn't be made into a subject of comedy. The jokes in the film fall flat whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.There is a lot wrong with this film which I don't have time to go into but I say it should be avoid. Just watch Cruel Intentions whilst not a classic still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.This film is just a pervert's wet dream having schoolkids having lots of sex with each other.".

Sebastian is somewho magically raised from the dead who this time around is a poor prankster that is sent to live with his rich father new stepmother and stepsister Kathryn . Here he meets Kathryn for the first time who turns out to be downright mean. At his first day of school he meet the sweet and innocent school masters daughter and falls in love with her. If you think it sounds familiar you are very correct in fact most of the dialogue from the first is recycled and used all over again. Sarah Michelle Gellar was delightfully evil as the wicked Kathryn the first time around who seen herself ruined at the end of the first movie. This time she is so cruel her character is just plain annonying and seems to be put on a side note due to the high amount of unneeded characters she even heads an undergroud cult of popular people. Ryan Phillipi is dearly missed as the new Sebastian lacks any of his swave debonairlike charm. Where as the first film was somewhat erotic and passionate this one is just plain dirty. IN fact the film gained a reasonable amount of controversy due to a scene in which a girl has an orgasm on a horse. The acting is horrible there is no emotion to be found anywhere and probably the only people this film will appeal to are people who have not seen the first. Where the first Cruel Intertions was a guilty pleasure this one is just guilty fans of the original should steer way clear of this sequal that is more of a remake due to the fact that it offers nothing new to the fold except a lot of homosexuality and an even stupider ending.".

The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy snooty richkid attitude that the original actors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim  not so much between Christian and Kathryn but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot  if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie?

The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy snooty richkid attitude that the original actors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim  not so much between Christian and Kathryn but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot  if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with Reese Witherspoon's character.Also the tiein with the photographyYou could be a model comment at the end was totally lame and didn't add anything at all.

Those who put it down however you might find are out of the age bracket this movie was directed at. Robin Dunne is one of my favourite actors basically when he is in something you know your in for a great performance. I found he with Sarah Thompson and Keri Lynn Pratt gave an edgy and sexy very sexy in the shower and park scenes performance which I enjoyed and have enjoyed many times over. So no prizes to people who put this down just cause it's a sequel prequel or whatever it is just see it as a good movie thats a companion to something great and buy the dvd like i did. 5 out of 5.".

Deciding to sit down and watch it without knowing anything the original movie the story of which they're both based off of or anything else this is a so bad it's good movie but not one of the best.Okay the story is that a delinquent named Sebastian Valmont is being taken care of by his father and rich stepmother and stepsister. He goes to school and falls in love and would you believe it this seems even more spontaneous than a Disney movie and he tries to go out with her. Meanwhile his stepsister Kathryn tries to lower his guard so he can instead be a prick while she tries to remain on top of the popularity ladder and stay the best at everything.Now to be fair I am NOT criticizing the acting. The reason is that the directing and writing are both horrible. A line of dialogue literally goes Yesterday was my first kiss and today you're at second base at this rate your d!ck will be in my mouth before lunch... I don't think Marlon Brando could save writing that asks for dialogue THIS FCKING STUPID. In terms of directing there is a scene where in an attempt to make Sebastian what he is Kathryn sends 2 lesbians into his shower to make out naked in front of him. And before you ask  no this is not something out of a porn. Another scene involves a Student body going into a BIG DARK ROOM where they look at slides of new students and allocate them What High School student let alone a group of High Shcool Students do this?.BUT through horrible lines and horrible directing this is enjoyable... Before you go crazy I'm just going to tell you why This stuff is so awkward so... To simply put it what the fck that it just has to get a laugh out of me. I know the actors can do better hell I've seen them in better! but honestly as I said not even an actor of the very highest caliber can save something this awful.Now I have no idea if the first movie is any good or not but if you see some sobadit'sgood opportunity from this and if you don't I can see why then it's really worth checking out. I mean if you see in the original movie some good characters and story although as I said have no idea of it this is just guess work then you might think this is one of the worst sequels ever made.

So today I felt bored and wanted to watch a movie with the full knowledge I'd hate it its sequel.Now I didn't like this film because it had good acting great writing and an interesting story. No. In fact all of these things are horrendous but that just adds on to the magnificent whirpool of idiocy that is Cruel Intentions 2. This is really one of those movies that is so bad that it actually is entertaining.The plot of this one is kind of a rehash of the first where Sebastian goes after a virgin and tries to seduce her but falls in love with her in the process while her sister Kathryn tries to make a freshman the class slut.I know what you are thinking what about that plot could possibly be funny? Kathryn is played by Amy Adams who plays her part with an entirety of her trying to look and sound sinister. Yes Amy Adams tries to be sinister. But it gets better literally every minute this movie is on it assaults you with something stupid that you just have to laugh at it. My absolute favourite scene is where Kathryn as the student body president has her own minions that hide in back rooms of the school looking at a slide show of all the new kids and how she will devise a scheme to get them to fit in to what they want down to the exact detail. Yes in a high school this movie wants you to believe that the popular kids spend their time looking at slide shows of unpopular kids and scheme plans to destroy their reputation.Thats not enough? The first day in school a girl chokes on chewing gum after getting the hiccups. The headmaster's daughter saves her life and some random kid that you'll never see again picks her up and takes her out of the hall Knight in Shining armour style while Amy Adams gives them a death stare. I could go on and on with how many awkwardly funny moments there are in this movie because as I said earlier this movie assaults you with that amount of stupid.This is a short review because I literally have nothing else to say about it except that this may be my vote for the funniest movie ever made. I swear you will be tired of laughing at the end of this film. It was made as a pilot to a TV show aimed at teenagers that was never picked up but I think this was written for kindergardeners. If you want a laugh go check this out. If you're a fan of the original and want to see a worthy prequel you're better off avoiding this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remarkably this was Polish director Andrzej Zulawski's debut feature. Coming from a family full of actors directors poets writers and general great thinkers Zulawski strides into this film with confidence focus and a craft that takes the majority of directors years to perfect. I was interested in this film after reading about the rather strange plot line and having a keen interest in Polish cinema notably the work of Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda. And I'm pleased my I followed my curiosity as the film is a hypnotic and nightmarish piece of cinema that encourages discussion interpretation and repeat viewings something that I find with only a few films especially straight after the first viewing.The film begins in a remote countryside house in Nazioccupied Poland where Michal Leszek Teleszynski stays with his wife and children until the Nazis come along a murder everyone while Michal lies hidden in the woods. He journeys back to Lwow where he joins the resistance almost instantly being tracked down and almost murdered. He manages to escape when the pursuers mistake an innocent bystander wearing similar clothes to be him and shoot him dead. Michal comforts the dead man's wife while noticing that the mysterious woman bears an uncanny resemblance to his own dead wife. Being a typhus sufferer Michal decides to put his misfortune to use and earns money becoming a lice feeder strapping small boxes full of the bloodsuckers down his legs to let them feed which are later used to develop a vaccine.What stems from the relatively normal opening scene can only be described as a chaotic descent into instability as the story moves along slowly and confusingly. The decision to use the same actress Malgorzata Braunek to play multiple roles is never clearly explained or made clear. The obvious and initial reason would apparently be the inability of Michal to let go of his wife's death seeing her everywhere but as the film goes on you wonder about the mental stability of our hero or even ponder if this or indeed the whole film is just a product of his typhoidaddled brain. Scenes randomly blend into the next and you have no idea where the film is going or will end up. It is truly a mentally tiring experience and all the better for it.Zulawski seems to be fascinated with lice and the feeding process that the film depicts. He films in close detail with some effectively loose hand held work how the lice are packed together in a tiny box with a mesh screen in place to allow the creatures to feed through. Later during the vaccination process we are treated to a microscope POV of the lice being carefully placed on a petri dish one by one only to be torn open by a pair of tweezers to extract their infected blood. Do the lice represent our protagonist or the nature of the human race? Or perhaps it's a commentary on the war and the destruction of the Nazi party? No answers are clear with the film and is best enjoyed as an interpretive piece of art cinema. I use the word 'enjoy' loosely as when the climax approaches it almost becomes a piece of psychological horror one that genuinely disturbs in a way that only a true artist can achieve.It will not appeal to everybody but no matter what your view or opinion it will no doubt have a profound effect on the emotions and the brain and will linger for a long time.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

He doesn't care to develop a clear story he has a way of surprising us continually through the exploitation of the characters which cover all the range of emotions. He can take any human and expose them to supernatural occurrences until they goes mad they live in a constant nightmare. His actors occasionally go in a real trance and purge themselves of all emotions crying and laughing simultaneously. It seems as if he is dissecting humans and beneath all that flesh and terror there lies a spirit alone and in darkness.Near the end someone cites the Apocalypse and goes something like this and then they will search for death and they won't find it. And that seems as the center point to the movies I've seen. In a way you can say he believes in an eternal return of the soul but what he longs for is tranquility in death and so life to him is just a terrible passing and so it is occasionally for many.About the movie well it can be mistaken for some supernatural horror flick some will be repelled by the style others will embrace it. But to me his movies are more of the overall experience and the way they linger in our subconscious as an infernal palace which we try to discredit and judge unreal but which we inhabit.".

In each of his movies I have only seen two others he manages to create an amazing cinematic velocity you are not sure about the meaning and of the plot twists but you are defenseless against the intensity of the camerawork editing performances and staging. He uses film in the way I usually find most interesting to convey dream states and give fragmented views into other worlds in that sense he is like Bergman when he was at his best. I can't help comparing the two since Bergmans recent passing and my seeing this film happened almost simultaneously...Watching this film is like experiencing someones nightmare based in a gritty reality but at the same time far removed from it and also managing to convey political issues in a nonrealistic way. Which is the way I prefer not ramming it down the audiences throats but keeping it in the subtext for you to explore if you want.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Third part of the night is set in Poland during the second world war which as you will probably know was infested by the plague of Nazism and latterly equipollent Communism. The film starts with a quotation from Revelations Chapter VIII which delineates the havoc that will be wreaked upon the earth when the Big Guy decides it's time to wrap everything up. There are seven trumpets being blown the first four we are told about and they wreak chaotic damage to earth generally in thirds a third of the rivers are turned to wormwood one third of ships destroyed... Anyway the fourth trumpet makes it so that for a third part of the night the moon and stars will not shine so that's basically what the German occupation of Poland is the Third Part of the Night.Most of the film is set in the city of Lwow which was then part of Poland but now has been made part of Ukraine and is called Lviv. That was Joe Stalin's doing part of his Polish Holocaust.The film starts though in the countryside with a violent act that is a quotation of the violence at the start of Menilmontant if I have seen things correctly. Michal the main character a ghostfaced unibrowed typhus sufferer loses his family and returns to Lwow where he attempts to become part of the resistance. It turns out that the resistance centers around a research institute. The folks there exist to feed lice. The way it works is that you put a strap around your bare leg and slot in these matchbox size containers full of lice that feed from your blood through a wire mesh. These lice are used to breed typhus and the vaccine is then prepared from their guts. One guy gets home from work strips naked and starts scratching himself and whimpering. Not the most pleasant scene. Involving yourself in this process gave you great papers though because the Germans took one look at your papers and were then scared of catching typhus from you and so left you well alone.After losing his wife Michal comes across a woman who looks exactly like her a plot device Zulawski also uses in La Femme Publique. It's not clear why this device is used but it could be a misogynist motif ie. he's incapable of seeing the woman for who she is he may also be having a traumatic hallucination which would mean that there is a woman but she doesn't look like his wife. This hallucination of a movie is mainly anchored around this plot providing some sort of bearing for the viewer.You won't see a normal moment in the entire movie everything is topsy turvy every scene is either in a shattered building or of a normal building full of shattered people. It's a nightmarish movie like a dance of death. Dance is an appropriate word because the film uses handheld camera a lot though Zulawski in an interview has stated that the cameraman he found had a very steady hand and he was obviously proud to find him and the shot dances around with some circular shots zooms you never see coming really it's very alive.What really is the Zulawski strength though is directing actors he managed to coax scenes of incredible intensity out of Malgorzata Braunek as Michal's wife and Jerzy Golinski Michal's father. I've seen almost nothing like it though another Polish film springs to mind Jerzy Kawalerowicz's Mother Joan of the Angels. The actors handed themselves over to Zulawski giving them his complete trust Braunek in particular in one scene at the institute connected with some deep innermost primal emotions.The cellar shots at the institute are the bleakest shots you're likely to see in cinema and remind me only of paintings and bizarrely of the shots of test chambers in Alien 4.The only big stumbling block for most people I believe would be the music which is very outofplace jazz three quarters of the way between mellifluence and dissonance and has taken me a while to get used to.".

It's not because of what he has to say or because themes might be important here Polish life under Nazi horrors. Similarly I don't reject him because stories are muddled or the acting is hysteric. I welcome him because he can use the eye of the camera to rope forces that move us.On the surface this is a glimpse of anguished life during WWII but not the mock historical type that seeks to enshrine bygone events in pious ceremony. This is one that speaks very much about anxiety that haunts the soul now in this very life rending the air with dread and confusion. Horror that is very much present and didn't go away with the war but still lingers. He would rail  more or less covertly  against a repressive Soviet regime in later films as well.So he's angry with god that won't manifest he shouts dejection at a broken state of things everything he would become known for is already present here fully formed as template. But no answer can be found in the mind that despairs and clamors and none would suffice to explain anything. No his power is that he can show these things truthfully for what they are confusion as confusion ignorance as ignorance. So of course the narrative becomes oblique muddled sense takes flight and we're left with fragments.He's still striving to burst forth here not yet channeling madness through the eye to alter how we see. That would come to him in due time. But everything you need to know about him you'll see in the very beginning of this first film.A man's wife and child are taken from their house one day and murdered in the yard evil that swoops over this world and wrecks lives. He joins the resistance and immediately people are chasing after him and shooting to kill him agents of that evil. So he hides in an apartment building and by a chance turn of fate police arrest someone else in his place someone with the same color of coat who was going up the stairs to a pregnant wife. In a stunning turn he helps the wife give birth becoming the husband who was taken away.Jancso and Tarkovsky were previous masters of the floating eye who could maintain equanimity in the face of horror and misfortune he is ruptured by it splintered in selves. But it's still the same deep roar from the engines of consciousness that propels him.".

The dialogue is extreme and sometimes absurd but that only adds to the atmosphere of a character being eaten by lice and perhaps in a fever. The lice thing is based on fact  Polish resistance fighters were happy to put themselves forward for scientific experimentation with lice in an effort to eradicate typhoid as no German soldiers would go near them if their cards said that they were involved in the programme. The lice in any case are a symbol of war  people sucking the blood out of each other etc. A chaotic and incoherent film but amazing firsttime direction from Zuwavski. It is all filmed in handheld camera usual stuff now but extremely unusual back in the early 70's so there is a lot of movement. The film was made in Krakow and the city looks nothing like is now  an empty desolate filthy city of dilapidated grey building. Very Kafkaesque indeed with stark bleak colours. I liked the film for atmosphere and cinematics but many will not if they concentrate on the story and often somewhat obscure dialogue.The film was a big thing when it came out in Poland with huge queues to see it by the public  it has lost its relevance today and looks VERY dated ie. as does all Polish 1970s cinema but is still an interesting view.".

If he fails to accomplish this task Kathryn gets his Jaguar Roadster if he succeeds he gets an evening of pleasure with Kathryn. I just finished watching Cruel Intentions and what a pleasant surprise this film turned out to be. I guess the best way to describe it is as a sexy and seductive thriller. The film is very clever and bold but above all extremely engaging and entertaining. Dealing with this kind of subject...making this kind of film...it's definitely not easy. Usually these kind of films come off somewhat fake and lame corny whatever you want to call it. Thankfully Cruel Intentions went the other way probably thanks to the witty and sharp dialogue and a very good direction. Ryan Phillippe delivered a terrific performance and so did Reese Witherspoon. I was actually a bit disappointed with Sarah Michelle Gellar her acting was not very convincing at times to say the least but honestly the story is so engaging that I was able to overlook that flaw. Another aspect that really took me by surprise was the musical score. Cruel Intentions has one of the best soundtracks I have ever seen in films. There's some great well known songs like Skunk Anansie's secretly and Placebo's every me and every you but there's also some fast paced instrumental tracks throughout the film that really compliment the scenes. Overall a great watch and so much more then a teen film.7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Cruel Intentions was my favorite movie when I was 14 to me it was everything I just wanted to be as a teen despite how cruel and manipulative Katheryn was I thought she was the coolest and strongest female character I'd ever seen on film. Now a couple years afterwards I read the book and saw the original Dangerous Liasons with John Malkovich and Glenn Close I still very much enjoy Cruel Intentions. Like I said this was just a terrific updated version of the ultimate story of love and betrayal it was a little Dawson's Creek at times but from what angle they went at it was understandable. It had the biggest stars Sarah Michelle Gellar Ryan Phillipe Reese Withersppon Tara Reid Joshua Jackson and Selma Blair. May I say they gave extremely impressive performances but the best without a doubt goes to Sarah Michelle Gellar she was just ultimately brilliant as Kathryn Muertiel the cruelist girl in school who's goal isn't to be the most popular but to dominate everyone's innocence.Kathryn and Sebastion are step brother and sister they have a partnership together to work the school into a total wave of turning the most innocent into the most corrupted. They also have a love for each other but Kathryn is the only girl Sebastian can't have it kills him and she teases him constantly over it. Kathryn asks Sebastian if he could help her corrupt the girl that took her boyfriend Cecil a naive young girl who is under Kathryn's wing but isn't aware of her intentions. But the plot thickens when Kathryn finds out that Cecil is in love with her black music teacher which her mother wouldn't like very much. Then Sebastian finds a girl Annette who believes that people shouldn't experience the act of love until they are in love. He and Kathryn make a bet while he seduces Cecil that if he can corrupt Annette he gets to bed Kathryn. But there's one problem he might be in over his head when he starts to fall in love with Annette.Cruel Intentions is a great movie with good strong performances. For what might have been a typical teen movie this was just a good idea on where the director made decisions on how to make the story real. It's very romantic heart breaking and even has it's dark comedic moments for a little breath of air. I will always recommend this film to anyone it's a great story. I would also highly recommend to watch Dangerous Liasons along with Cruel Intentions so you have a little bit of a different variety. You'll find yourself a bit seduced with these movies.910".

He said he loved the start of the movie where the evil Sebastian says to the Psychologist You have beautiful legs I would love to photograph them'. This then sets the tone for one of the best teen films that the world has seen. Based on the movie Dangerous Liaisons Cruel Intentions goes down as one of my top five favourite films of alltime.A sexobsessed rich boy Sebastian sets out to win his greatest conquest  a girl who has proclaimed in a Teen magazine that she will wait until marriage to lose her virginity. The teen is egged on by his sister Catherine an evil scheming girl in her own right. The two have a wager on whether Sebastian can achieve his conquest. If he wins he gets a night of bliss with his stepsister if she wins she keeps his most prided possession his Jaguar convertible!Well this is a brilliant backstabbing bitchy love and hate war movie. I cannot remember a movie like it in my time. The theme of the movie was priceless. Having two rich hobnob kids toying with various people's emotions in their neighborhood was just great. In fact it is not at all silly to think that this does not happen in real life because if you don't believe that then you are very nave. There are many people who need to be praised for this classic movie. Director Roger Kumble did a great job in bringing this movie to our screens. He added so many little steamy' pieces to this movie that it was never going to fail. Then you have the producer Neal H. Moritz who also allowed this film to shine. He gave this film all the right production touches which I can only praise.Then you have the wonderful cast that was assembled for Cruel Intentions. The main star for this film would have to be the gorgeous Sarah Michelle Gellar. She was outstanding as the horrible Catherine. Her character while at times was extremely hard to like she was almost too hard to not want to like. I mean she was every guy's fantasy. Sexually liberated and not afraid to admit it then all she wanted to do is screw up all her enemies at the same time. Then you have the patronising and stud man' Sebastian played by Hollywood hunk Ryan Philippe. His performance in this film was also first class. I thought his character was a lot more likable then Catherine's but you could sometimes want to strangle him for the way he screws with people just like his stepsister does and then still seemingly gets more women dying to be with him. Other cast members just help to make this film an extraordinary viewing experience. Reese Witherspoon is fantastic as the pure and innocent Annette. She helps to balance the sour bitchy side of the cast with her friendly almost sickening goody goody side. I am looking forward to seeing Witherspoon in the comedy Legally Blonde directed by new Australian director Robert Luketic. Selma Blair was also very good in her role as the dumb and very nave Cecil. The kissing scene that she has with Gellar was one of the highlights of the film with the kiss being voted the best onscreen kiss a few years ago.Then this film has another great side to it that of the soundtrack. It has so many great songs on it. Placebos tune Every me Every you' helps start this movie off then you get songs such as Colorblind by Counting Crows and the classy Bitter Sweet Symphony by the Verve. This would have to be one of the world's most popular soundtracks from where I view it.In conclusion Cruel Intentions is a film I can say I love and that I can learn from. People in real life do use people and do hurt them. I know this because I was involved in such a scenario not so long ago. Nothing was ever happy until it was a fight and scrag. I will go as far to admit that I was confronted with a real life Catherine a person who was such a goody goody on the outside but the real person on the inside is a person that loves to cause trouble and will go out of her way to do it. Anyone who is like that is a real lowlife in my view. Get swept up in the nasty love triangle Cruel Intentions'!Rating 5 Stars or 1010".

It communicates a new idea of sexuality amongst presentday teenagers rather than the bang her and leave her mentality that is most commonly portrayed. I think the cast was very well chosen and the dynamics of the cast were amazing. There weren't too many no names or B list actors but on the other hand there weren't too many A listers which would have thrown the focus off the plot. The music used in the movie was perfect because it accentuated the tone of the movie. I give Cruel intentions a 10 because it is a saucy love story without all the corniness of normal movies.".

Sound weird? It is. It's basically about 2 rich snobs who mess with the lives of those around them just because their lives get boring.This film also stars Joshua Jackson 'The Skulls' 'Urban Legend' TV's 'Dawson's Creek as Sebastian's gay best friend who also gets involved in the use or be used storyline. Fellow teenmovie star Tara Reid 'Urban Legend' 'American Pie' also has a small role as Sebastian's psychiatrists's daughter.This film is pretty intense and deals with sex drugs seduction and alienation in a brave way that makes it appealing to all teenagers. Not for the light hearted more daring than anything like 'She's All That' and 'Never Been Kissed' but it's still good fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "The main reason I wanted to see this one is because I am a big SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR fan. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is one of my alltime favorite shoes. I also rather like REESE WITHERSPOON and a few of the other actors in this movie. The plot also seemed original and interesting and of course there was no hiding the sexy scenes that seemed like it would add to the plot. It turns out this movie is just a collection of these scenes with a seemingly original but actually predictable plot to hold them together.Kathryn Merteuil Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sebastian Valmont Ryan Phillippe are two victims of bad parenting. They are two rich stepchildren who enjoy making other students miserable. Kathryn with a reputation as the perfect student often uses others to ruin people's lives. Sebastian who has a very nasty reputation that he is proud of prefers to do the work himself. He finds an attractive girl charms her over sleeps with her and finally ruining her reputation. Kathryn has set her sights on the ditsy Cecile Caldwell Selma Blair while Sebastian goes for the great challenge of seducing and ruining the allAmerican virgin goodygoody Annette Hargrove Reese Witherspoon. Sebastian has a bet with Kathryn that he can win Annette over. If she wins she gets his Jaguar. If he wins she gets to sleep with her.The plot in writing sounds fairly original. This is really just a shield. In truth this movie is a mixture of two things. One is a predictable love story. The other is a bunch of scenes intended to turn on the teenagers who watch it and get them to watch it over and over. I am a teenager and I had no real desire to watch this movie again afterwards.The acting is about even. Sarah Michelle Gellar does an excellent job as the scheming evil richbh. Reese Witherspoon did a pretty good job but her character was not especially interesting. Joshua Jackson and Selma Blair are extremely annoying in this movie which is good because it is what they are meant to be. Blair did better than Jackson for the record. Ryan Phillippe did OK but I really didn't buy his evil richguy character. The characters in this movie aren't anything great. This is probably because the two main characters are rich mean people which most viewers can't relate to or enjoy much. The target audience is obviously teens but these people although cute probably remind them too much of students they hate. Witherspoon's character is a little 2D mostly because she was underplayed and the two main characters were overplayed. Blair's character is pretty fun.The movie is very predictable. I had the entire movie figured out by the previews and my theory which was correct didn't change at all watching this movie. There is only one part I didn't see coming which happens near the end. The ending of this movie is the best part even though I saw it coming since the beginning.If you feel like getting drunk and watching a movie with college buds so you can drool and howl at the TV this movie is a good choice. Most teenagers would probably enjoy it too especially fans of the actors but I can't say I recommend this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm writing on this movie because there is probably no bigger afficionado on this subject than myself. I've seen this movie thousands of times and must say that it is exquisite. The portrayal of Valmont by Ryan Phillippe is magnificent and its intriguing to know that the object of his affection Annette Reese Witherspoon is his real life wife. Sarah Michelle Gellar does easily the best acting of her career not that that says too much. The story is one that has been done many times over Dangerous Liaisons Valmont however this was an excellent adaptation to this age group and these current times. The fact that the 20 somethings are portraying 17 year old kids is unnoticeable because of the great acting and the portrayal of the story. Phillippe is easily the highlight of the film with his slick portrayal of Valmont. His disregard for others feelings and emotions is ruthless. The piece is without comparison of the trend of terrible teen movies made in the late 90'searly 0001. This is the only one that takes a serious storyline and portrays it with enough maturity to appeal not only to teens but older audiences as well. The one problem I do have with the movie is the way that Sebastian turns from so evil and wicked to this love sick kid at the end of the film. When you see the deleted scenes on the DVD you see the original cut of the climatic scene between Valmont and Merteuil. In this scene rather than walk out in near tears Valmont slaps Kathryn and demands her end of the bet before he is finally denied and then leaves. This would be a much better scene than the one used. It goes along with the entire idea of the character and when he turns to a sap you feel like Sebastian is turning to a sappy wimp. The film is still an excellent piece and should be regarded as an admirable adaptation of the novel Les Liasons Dangereuse.".

When Dr. Greenbaum Swoosie Kurtz pounded on her office window and yelled at Sebastian Ryan Phillippe after Marci Tara Reid called her in tears I really felt good. To me the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the costumes were perfectly designed and the set was nice. Also the scenes with Kathryn Sarah Michelle Gellar were excellent too. Now in conclusion I highly recommend this excellent teen flick which will have you feeling good from start to finish to any Sarah Michelle Gellar Ryan Phillippe or Reese Witherspoon fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cruel Intentions1999 is a tame and lousy movie that never retains the sense of tragedy found in the Stephen Frears version of Dangerous Liaisons. It was a stupid idea to set it among high school teensrich teens because the characters in the film are angels compared to the French Aristocrats of the late 18th Century who were the most ruthless extremely decandent and evil human beings around.  What I find amazing is that there are many people who are unaware that the first version of Dangerous Liaisons was done in 1960 by Roger Vadim with Jeanne Moreau with the setting similar to this film except with married adults involved.  The characters in the movie behaved like bad little children instead of the evil jerks that aristocrats were. This film is the worst version of the novel that its based on.I would have enjoyed the movie more if it took a more hardcore approach to the material instead of the softness injected into it.  Its easy for Hollywood to do a version of Dangerous Liaisons then it would be to do a version of 120 Days of Sodom as a novel like this might hit close to home in its subject matter.  I think that the movie would've been better off in the hands of a director like for instance Francois Truffalt Abel Ferrara Bernardo Bertulucci Rainer Werner Fassbinder Catherine Breillatdid the brillant Movie Romance1999 and someone like Pier Paolo Pasolini who would have made the film more powerful and interesting.  The humillation scene would have been better if it showed the spirit of Valmont coming out of nowhere ala Harry Lime to give a big smile at his step sister during this scene.  I suggest this motion picture to people who are unable to see films that deal with adult themes and sexual content shown in an emotional and everyday way of life style.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sick and tired of these crappy teen updates of classic films that aren't half as good as the source material and somehow rake in millions more.One must wonder how in the world this ever got made in the first place. And how in the world did it ever become a box office smash? The majority of the filmgoers must have been teenagers because I doubt any educated cinemagoer could actually enjoy this much less recommend it to someone else. I could be wrong but I somehow doubt it. Roger Ebert liked it. Why? How?Forgive my condenscending tone but this film is a disaster. Essentially a lackluster teen update of Dangerous Liaisons Cruel Intentions concerns the bet between stepsiblings Sebastian Ryan Phillippe and Kathryn Sarah Michelle Gellar with black hair. If Sebastian can lay Annette Reese Witherspoon a virgin then he gets to keep Kathryn for himself. But if he fails then Kathryn gets his Jaguar. Simple enough yes?Not so. Annette is very reserved about her feelings and her body which provides a bit of a problem for Sebastian. But let's face it we all know what's going to happen between them. Without spoiling the movie our first thoughts are that Sebastian will lay Annette then realize that he really loves her over Kathyrn then become unevil. I'm not going to confirm or deny this as truth but I will say that a lot of the thoughts you're probably having about what happens in this movie are correct.This could have been an intriguing film to be blatantly honest. Some teen updates such as Romeo  Juliet have a unique style that provides the audience with something new. Not here. Sure Cruel Intentions is stylish but it brings nothing new to the party and you're going to be left with a sour taste in your mouth after it's over. You're also going to be continually checking your watch to see how much longer the film is and slapping your own head every time the stupid characters onscreen mutter their scripted words.Still even with its stylish nonstyle aside Cruel Intentions had potential as a sort of stupid entertaining film. But Phillippe is one of the worst actors of the decade and Sarah Michelle Gellar is no hot catch either. Every production they touch usually ends up either disappointing or awful sometimes both including ScoobyDoo and I Know What You Did Last Summer.And Witherspoon the best young actress in the film is entirely subdued here. She seems like an utter dipsydoodle idiot cast between a dangerous game between two nonrelated siblings. Which is the point. But she doesn't seem very intriguing at all and her performance in 2001's Legally Blonde is by far a much better one. She basically played the same part with the same corny dialogue but that movie was a comedy that intended its audience to laugh at the character. Here she is actually meant to be taken seriously which is almost as laughable as the entire film's overall effect.Based on Choderlos de Laclos' Les Liaisons Dangereuses and its original 1988 film remake with John Malkovich Cruel Intentions is nothing but a modern day pale imitation of a greater picture. Its dialogue is ridiculous and its characters are all stereotypical. We know where the film is going long before it seems to know that we know that which means we get a lot of stupid and cliched moments in between.This is a bad movie and a bad remake. Perhaps with someone cleverer behind the helm and with better actors and actresses this could have been worthwhile. But then it would have just been Dangerous Liaisons would it not? 12 out of .".

Reese Witherspoon does great at being a goodnatured person with a brain actually fixed to her beautiful body. Perhaps the carried weight of the whole film rests on Ryan Phillippe's performance and how love transforms him.

Attempts at tenderness and intimacy come across as heavy handed and the attempts at eroticism are laughable. Sarah Michelle Gellar has a huge following who find her irresistible. I am not one of those.

	schema:headline " A sassy sexy and downright seductive shocker!. Cruel Intentions is one of my all time favorite films.";
	schema:reviewBody "Cruel Intentions is seriously a movie that gives me the chills every time I watch it. Its bold its daring and downright chilling. The main thing I dug about Cruel Intentions was the relationships and the manipulation for there own benefits. Sebastian is used to getting his own way he uses woman to sleep with them and manipulates people for the hell of it along with his sister Kathryn. What we don't know at the start of the movie is how Sebastian has been affected by Kathryn. Then comes along Annette who Sebastian figures will be his little toy his own personal trophy so to speak. As much as I loved the relationship between Kathryn and Sebastian I adored the one between Annette and Sebastian even more. We see this arrogant young charmer who loves to mess people up and as the movie progresses we see the real him start to come out thanks to Annette. Sebastian isn't used to fun he's not used to genuine laughter other than the laughter he got for his own amusement and Annette gave that all to him.It just seemed so genuine. I'm a rare guy who enjoys romance and this put a whole new deal on romance for me They pushed the envelope many times and I loved every minute of it. One thing I was disappointed about though is they didn't give us enough info on how Kathryn and Sebastian became so evil together. The prequelIf that's what you wanna call it gave us snippets of information but it was basically a rehash so I would really love to see a real movie focused on the relationship of Kathryn and Sebastian. Cruel Intentions is a movie I can't stop thinking about each time I watch it. Each time I have new questions I need answering and every time I noticed something new something that stimulates my mind even more. It's just a fascinating film and one of my favorite daring love stories.Performances. Ryan Phillippe in his best role in my opinion delivers a suave emotional and downright convincing show. At the start of the movie we are aware of his charm but we hate what he's pulling yet somehow he's able to make us relate to him. It's a terrific performance that often gets overlooked how can people honestly say he's wooden?. Sarah Michelle Gellar gives one hell of a devious yet deliciously sexy performance. She's clearly a backstabbing woman who cares about no one about herself and at the time Sebastian seemingly is the only one who understands her it's only what's revealed in the diary that we come to see how he felt. Reese Witherspoon is fabulous as Annette. Perfectly innocent yet wonderfully charming and goodhearted. Her simple gorgeous smile or her easygoing charm can put a smile on your face in a minute. Her chemistry with Ryan was outstanding. Selma Blair plays the ditsy Cecile to perfection. She's clearly a ditz yet a likable one. Joshua Jackson has a small bit as a gay man. Sean Patrick Thomas plays the token black part down to a T and a has a key role in the end. Tara Reid has a small part in the beginning.Bottom line. Cruel Intentions is a movie I'm very fond of and I can proudly say it's one of my all time favorites. This isn't just a movie for teens it's a powerful love story for us adults too. I think everybody needs to experience this movie at least once. An absolute must see! Now I gotta check out Dangerous Liasons because that's what this movie is based on.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the chance to see the movie at the Berlin Film Festival actually I saw it twice and I must say I really loved it. Even during the second screening I still thought it was interesting and funny.Granted I like both Sidney Lumet and Vin Diesel so I may be a bit biased but the audience in the cinema seemed to like the movie too because after both screenings they applauded.The movie is a courtroom drama based on real events. The film depicts the longest Mafia trial in NYC history and most of the dialog is taken from the original records of the trial. In 198788 some 20 members of the Lucchese crime family each with his own lawyer were indicted on some 76 charges ranging from criminal conspiracy to narcotics trafficking. The trial went on for 21 months.The film focuses on Jack DiNorscio one of the accused mobsters played by Vin Diesel who decides to defend himself. Even though he spent half his life in jail he doesn't know much about legal proceedings and mostly speaks what comes into his mind thus sometimes making fun of the whole trial.Actually I was quite skeptical if Diesel could pull it off. C'mon we all know him from some more or less mediocre action movies so when I heard he was cast in a Sidney Lumet movie I was quite surprised and therefore even more eager to see him in this film. And yes he is good. He gained some weight for this role and has hair a wig so he looks quite different from what you're used to.During the Berlinale press conference Sidney Lumet said about Vin Diesel People make the great mistake with action heroes. They think that because generally the plots are simpler and their behavior is onenote that they can't act. But most of the time they can. And Diesel shows that he can act. With his charismatic persona he manages to carry the movie pretty easily. He has to talk a lot during the film which comes across very believable and authentic and he shows a wide range of emotions from happiness to anger to mourning to being embarrassed to whatever.The overall acting is really good Linus Roache shines in his role as prosecutor Kierney. Contrary to his Necromonger role in The Chronicles of Riddick he gets a chance here to really show his talent. The other supporting cast is also really fantastic. I'd like to point out Peter Dinklage as lead defense attorney Ben Klandis and Annabella Sciorra The Sopranos who is really great in her single scene as DiNorscio's exwife. In this scene she goes through all the emotions from anger to frustration to jealousy. The other supporting cast consists of New York theater talent as well as faces familiar to anyone who watches crime shows on the tube.The film itself takes place almost entirely in the court room and sometimes it drags a bit although it is not boring. It depends solely on talking there is no action whatsoever in the movie. As DiNorscio joked around quite a bit during the trial the film too is pretty funny in parts and the audience in the cinema laughed quite a bit.All in all I recommend this movie. But I have to warn the action fans you might not like this film as it is a total change in comparison to the movies Vin Diesel has done until now.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of Sidney Lumet's unorthodox casting lead for this film I was intrigued because Van Diesel's selection was indeed a daring move. There was little doubt Lumet would err and he has truly come up with a sensational film and presented us with an outstanding turn by Diesel. The film would have worked and been at least a decent movie because of Lumet's expertise. Getting Diesel to take command of the screen channel the spirit of the infamous defendant to ultimately convince the audience in both the movie and the theater audience that we were witnessing a rather unique individual.The success of the film hangs on every single line that Diesel delivers. There is conviction and sincerity in his delivery. Here is a character that has a tarnished background ultimately finds an outlet for a new perspective in life and runs with it. Eventually we get to discover he is a more powerful force than we expected.Lumet once again shapes the film with his assured hand allowing the actors to shine in their respective roles not interfering with dialog that is practically taken from original transcripts by adding overdramatic touches or unnecessary inspirational music. There are long silences when we are allowed to reflect on what is taking place in front of us. We see a situation change witness how the players moves are changed because of unexpected twists in the story and never is the intensity of true emotions and the power of relationships diluted by a false note. There is a superb scene between Diesel and his ex wife in a great performance by Sciorra that is both incredibly moving and sexy. These are real people with overpowering feelings and passionate exchanges and it all comes through because of these two performers' chemistry and electrifying delivery.This is a film that will probably divide its audiences depending on what you think of the defendant and his connections but most people will probably agree that a star has been born and with the support of a masterful director we can see that he deserves to have a long and fruitful career in front of him. Many people heaped praise on Hoffman not too long ago. I felt Diesel outdid Hoffman because this time the gimmick and the make up felt apart by the soulful approach of a real actor.".

Eventually we get to discover he is a more powerful force than we expected.Lumet once again shapes the film with his assured hand allowing the actors to shine in their respective roles not interfering with dialog that is practically taken from original transcripts by adding overdramatic touches or unnecessary inspirational music. There are long silences when we are allowed to reflect on what is taking place in front of us. We see a situation change witness how the players moves are changed because of unexpected twists in the story and never is the intensity of true emotions and the power of relationships diluted by a false note. There is a superb scene between Diesel and his ex wife in a great performance by Sciorra that is both incredibly moving and sexy. These are real people with overpowering feelings and passionate exchanges and it all comes through because of these two performers' chemistry and electrifying delivery.This is a film that will probably divide its audiences depending on what you think of the defendant and his connections but most people will probably agree that a star has been born and with the support of a masterful director we can see that he deserves to have a long and fruitful career in front of him. Many people heaped praise on Hoffman not too long ago. I felt Diesel outdid Hoffman because this time the gimmick and the make up felt apart by the soulful approach of a real actor.";

	schema:reviewBody "Great performance by Vin Diesel in here. I always just thought of him as an actor who did not have the ability to take on a nonaction leading role. Wow did he prove me wrong here. Find Me Guilty was really a revelation in itself and for Diesel.The acting like I just said was great from Vin Diesel. Diesel has shown in the past some great supporting performances. With this movie he clearly showed that he can give a real acting performance. The way he displayed his character as a loud mouth slick talking mafia man was just so genuine and real. He made me laugh every five minutes and still was able to draw me into the movie as a serious character. The supporting performances were nice here to from Peter Dinklage and Alex Rocco.The directing was very good if not great as well. When it comes to any film involving court Sidney Lumet is the man who should direct it. This is the man who directed 12 Angry Men and The Verdict which are probably the two of the top five court movies ever. This time though he is able to perfectly balance the comedy and drama of this movie to make this film very engaging and exciting to watch. Sidney Lumet once again proves to me at least why he is one of the most creative and best movie directors ever.The writing was perfect for this movie. In a way the movie was making fun of itself which is always nice to see in these type of comedies. Together with Diesel the writing made for some many laughoutloud scenes. Sidney Lumet with his directing and writing really is able to show that a reallife courtroom drama can realistically funny too.My advice is to definitely watch this movie if you have not. It is not a superficial meaningless movie and believe it or not is a little inspiring. Creativity in movies at its best.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing to see certain actors working with a director like the veteran Sidney Lumet if it's appropriate to use for him who knows though this is his latest film at 81 over a near 50 year career and see really intriguing special things happening on screen. Actors like Pacino Lee J. Cobb Rod Steiger and Peter Finch among many others undoubtedly have other noteworthy performances in other films but in the work they've done with Lumet there's something that connects just right to get that full touch reaching into the character and pulling out the humanity or lack thereof. Vin Diesel in this case has possibly his most convincing and onspot performance to date and with the exception of his supporting role in Boiler Room goes beyond the typically machoroles of his career in the past several years. He is a tough guy in this true and Jackie DiNorscio has the life of a criminal to him. But in the story presented in the film of this man defending himself in the longest trial in American history it's essential that the actor playing him gets it right with the emotional connections of the character of being truthful. Diesel gets that right in a performance that has that gangster quality err 'gagster' as DiNorsci refers himself as but is also has a certain fascinating complexity that the character of for example the prosecuting attorney could never have.Still Lumet captures this ensemble with enough nuance and wellspun real dialog for two movies. It's not at all strange to see him doing a courtroom drama as it reaches back to his first film 12 Angry Men. This time however there is a difference in the focus on a story lasting three years and the evidence in the sprawling elephantine case against the crime families is not as crucial for getting involved in the film as the people who make up the case and courtroom. There are at least a few character actors providing some terrific work like Ron Silver as the judge or Peter Dinklage as one of the defense attorneys. And while amid a scene or shot here and there that could've been lost or put on the cutting room floor it's hard to pinpoint which after a first viewing without notes there are at least a few that do provide some extra interest that most other filmmakers would've lost. The detail of the one mobster who becomes ill and has to come in every day to court on a stretcher is one thing. Or the detail of the importance of a chair in Jackie's prison cell.And in this mix there are a few scenes that rank up with being some of the more dramatically perfect scenes Lumet has done chiefly by letting the actors who have inhabited the roles to the point of doubtless believability just do their work. Two that come to mind are when the judge informs Jackie about the death of his mother and how what Diesel doesn't show to the audience is even more important than what is I'm reminded of the scene towards the end of Serpico where he gets the badge. Another is when Jackie is questioning his cousin on the stand. The filming of this scene isn't all that complex but the dynamic between the two characters is and the right notes are just there between the two actors. By the end of Find Me Guilty I didn't think I saw an outright masterpiece like some of the director's other films. Neverhtheless I also knew that I had seen an extremely confident and very good piece of work that brings out what's dependable in Lumet and what's unexpected in an actor like Diesel. Not to mention that here and there the film is quite funny. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to a preview screening of this film so the version I saw may not make it onto the screen. I was pretty hesitant when I heard that Mr. Diesel was in it. I have to report that he did justice to the role. OK he was no young Al Pacino but he was certainly better than the old Al Pacino would be in the role. And Pacino has to be the patron saint of the film. His performance could have been loud it could have been slick instead he adds surprising depth to an essentially obnoxious character.The story isn't surprising but it does carry a bit of a cultural wallop and Deisel using dialog drawn from actual courtroom testimony is able to convey a real sense of outrage over being societal discrimination. It is a testimony to Lumet's direction that the film never veers into the didactic or preachy.The real surprise to me was Annabella Sciorra. The print I saw had no credits so I wasn't expecting her and it took me a bit to place her face. She was electrifying. She truly lit up the screen in her 5 minutes. In an extended dialog with Diesel as her husband she goes from dispassion to jealousy to outrage to sexual hunger in the most nuanced and natural performance I have seen in a long while. Sciorra is a major talent and needs to get some larger roles maybe even a few where she isn't the WifeFiance of a N.J. mobster.".

	onyx:emotionText "I went to a preview screening of this film so the version I saw may not make it onto the screen. I was pretty hesitant when I heard that Mr. Diesel was in it. I have to report that he did justice to the role. OK he was no young Al Pacino but he was certainly better than the old Al Pacino would be in the role. And Pacino has to be the patron saint of the film. His performance could have been loud it could have been slick instead he adds surprising depth to an essentially obnoxious character.The story isn't surprising but it does carry a bit of a cultural wallop and Deisel using dialog drawn from actual courtroom testimony is able to convey a real sense of outrage over being societal discrimination. It is a testimony to Lumet's direction that the film never veers into the didactic or preachy.The real surprise to me was Annabella Sciorra. The print I saw had no credits so I wasn't expecting her and it took me a bit to place her face. She was electrifying. She truly lit up the screen in her 5 minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "Movies hopefully should be about more than their stars or lack thereof. Whether or not you were charmed by the unique choice of Diesel for the starring role you cannot ignore the blaring faults of this movie. It is a courtroom dramaa genre which should promise us conflicts of principle and belief choices people have to make. See A Few Good Men for example. The conflict in this movie? Is Diesel's gangster good or bad ? Why? Can he defend himself? Those are possible answers but the only time we are made to believe he is otherwise are from the rants of the prosecutor. Why not show us examples of the mobsters life? Another possible themeIs the U.S. Government being racist in its prosecution of Italian Americans ? Again this is mentioned but only one side of the argument is briefly explored. Perhaps the theme that was adhered to the most was that of the main character's loyalty to his family. Yet the strongest attempt to illustrate this poses Diesel as the simpleton gangster speaking from his heart to his comobsterdefendants waxing eloquent that he would never rat on the people he grew up with. A tapslike trumpet fanfare accompanies his speech at the end. Very dramatic except that he is in a meeting concerning whether or not the group should unanimously decide to take a plea bargaina situation which has nothing what so ever to do with ratting on one another. So when each member stands up and says I vote no! who cares? Overall this film took a potentially charmingstrong character poised to stand for his beliefs but only ends in playing at several hackneyed and borrowed dramatic ideas. There are some decent performances that unfortunately cannot save the meandering lack of direction in this movie. And it was BADLY edited.".

	schema:reviewBody "We're all familiar with Vin Diesel being the new action hero with his buffed muscular body bald pate gruff voice and his high octane movies like Fast and the Furious and xXx. He took a different path into comedy with The Pacifier and now into drama with Find Me Guilty. How did he fair?Pretty good in spite of the focus being on his new look hairdo and belly ok so it's prosthetics and makeup assisted. Playing a real life mobster Jack DiNorscio and the true story of his defense of himself in court without a lawyer in an extremely long trial spanning 21 months where it's the US Government versus the Lucchese crime family.The movie started off promisingly with a tense scene classic of any mafia movies that of a hit job though it's laced with some unexpected humour. Alas just as you thought the movie will go uphill from then on it actually stalled and cruised along before tapering from the halfway mark until the end.Diesel as DiNorscio deftly balanced dramatics with flair for comedy labelling himself as a gagster rather than a gangster inevitably forming a bond with the jurors of the case getting into the skin of the prosecutors and having a hard time convincing his fellow chums that his loyalties still lie with the family that he'll never rat them out or knowingly jeopardize their chances in court. However amongst his buddies he fared the worst having to defend himself in court and go home to his jail cell where he's still serving time. It's a bit like doing your all for your family but yet experiencing a nonreciprocal feeling from them.You probably won't care much for the other characters consisting of many minor role hoodlums and their numerous legal representatives. Perhaps the only other role having prominence is Ron Silver's Judge Finestein who has to precede over this gruelling cast and at the same time reining in DiNorscio's antics.Although this movie boasts the using of actual court transcripts for its dialogue there are not enough compelling arguments objections challenges and square offs. Rather the movie zooms by quite quickly to the basic significant courtroom sessions  it's obvious you can't cover 21 months worth of material in 2 hours.So for those eager to watch topnotch courtroom drama you might go away a little disappointed but if you buy into Vin Diesel's charm and of course for Vin Diesel fans you might go away enjoying every moment of his screen presence.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie bugged me. What was that anyway? And what were its problems? Sure it got many ! The movie looked provocative in dealing with the monsters it had. True it demands to look into its characters like usual human beings inside their own world. But the main problem is that it happens at the moment of taking revenge on them by us the moment where they go to their righteous end as the natural fairness from our very point of view. You sense anger and fear when those mean old criminals go free at the end that easily ! So it's hard to see any human type Mr. Lumet wants us to see in Jackie DiNorscio Vin Diesel and learn about. And harder to feel sympathy out of this courtroom movie.Moreover how the logicality of the whole trialmovie has gone with the wind? It's impossible for us as viewers to BELIEVE for a second how the jury decided that the accused killers and dealers are all NOT GUILTY !! Even if it's a very known case from the 1980s dramatically the movie pushed me to not buy that and to assume that those mafia bosses bribed all the jury?Or maybe it's Sidney Lumet's special satire... When we see all the mobsters walk joyfully in one street with the members of the jury to mingle with each other you'd conclude what vision is shown for the American society or its big family  echoes from Lumet's Family Business  1989  like it's that nation's naked truth. Which even breaking it is a breakage for a LIFE STYLE like their lawyer's first pleading. So similar to Lumet's Q  A  1990 also it's the case of perversely established ground and forever. It's like Roman Polanski's films where evil is finally dominating. Or the world of Coppola's The Godfather however the mafia is axiomatic fact  ordinary part yet with no purgation.Therefore the federal prosecutor's shouting They're criminals wasn't to assure sense of morality at it only. But to manifest how hopeless his character is in a world like this. Though the movie doesn't try to give us the reason HOW he has been beaten at the end ?! Since the answer of WHY is  naturally ! It could be another violent commentary on the American explicitly incomplete justice. So the prosecutor looked nasty while his efforts to achieve the lost justice as the evil man of this world who had to lose to our world's real evil men !?? I told you earlier this movie can bug cleverly. It makes you think Maybe the mob produced it ?!!In fact the moral dilemma was for the viewer to decide is Jackie DiNorscio a hero of his world or not ? The finale just answered a big YES for that and exaggerated it passionately after living his redemption till his noble statement of willingly selfsacrifice at the end. However you'd feel  How he sacrifices for people will kill you and your kids by bullets or drugs ! How even his attempt to sacrifice was fake since he's going to jail anyhow ! and How he didn't learn about himself as long as he says Send me to jail. I'm not guilty but I'm used to it!!? Baby you're so guilty to the backbone. And I feel I must say the same about Sidney Lumet here too.It was difficult to catch on the movie's message or its type of a hero. Simply Jackie is the only one who discovered through the whole trail that he lost everything and everyone by himself the only one who owns love and asks for nonconditional love. But the treatment didn't pinpoint that seriously. I sunk under so many defects. One of them is making it as a courtroom movie which tried to be so loyally realistic also since the normal viewer would live continual heavy defense for the mafia's sake with a happy end for them too ! This distracted the attention to heed anything but the appearance of a heart of gold inside the personality of DiNorscio. Not to mention the ethical complication of understanding his redemption with another possible satire about the ones whom he sacrifices for. You can't ignore that precise look into world of Italians whom not the progeny of Italian artists but Italian bottom to ask what's the original basis of America exactly? and how its crime is a victor force and organic limb. The try of 2 movies in one is the same problem of Lumet's The Anderson Tapes  1971 refer to my comment about it on the IMDb  A Political Crime Movie ? NAAAY !!. However like that last one Lumet uses criminals to expose something wrong in the American system but here it seemed disharmonious and annoying. It's not the movie where the evil guy goes to jail at last it's the movie where the evil guys go to society free while the good guy is beaten and the less evil imprisoned but none of these stories was done fairly.This is one of Lumet's less powerful movies. Marketing it as a Comedy tells you how they were desperate to market it anyway. They did it before with his better one Family Business. Maybe he's making movies about subjects too hard to face or stand. Here as a director cowriter he went to the sink to seek heroes read  less impure yet he did it in a movie that needed to be more emotional concentrated and effective.P.S  despite Diesel's good efforts the makeup and the gray wig were heavy mask that made him a freak and devitalized his acting.".

	schema:headline " A Sidney Lumet film need anything more be said?";
	schema:reviewBody "As we enter the spring of 2006 we can look back at a surprisingly recent albeit small number of well written dramas on film that have not been blockbustertent pole films but have been critically successful and profitable. Unlike their bloated kidvid computer imageenhanced poorly written cousins that we have learned to despise these smaller lower budget films remind us of a better earlierday Hollywood. It was time when the human condition and experience was celebrated and movies thus met their true raison d'etre by fulfilling us on many levels. Find Me Guilty is one of these. The product of none other than the legendary director Sidney Lumet who at this writing is 82 years old like all his other works the film is about humanity. It presents in sketchy continuity the longest trial in the history of the government versus organized crime. The surprise here is Vin Diesel who comes to this film from the field of bloated empty CGI pictures mentioned above. We're surprised both by the quality of his resoundingly good character performance and also by its subtlety. What Lumet does in his trade is recreate life. He does not embellish amplify or whitewash life so the language here is streetvulgarstrong ostensibly as it exists at the levels of the parasitical Mafia that it depicts. It's also not a simpleheaded drama in that it bears several surprises for those like me not terribly familiar with the jurisprudence history of organized crime or its denizens. This film is like The Godfather written by a yellowsheet Tabloid reporter and not a fiction writer. Yet it goes on to prove that life can sometimes be stranger than fiction exactly as said the Bard 500 years ago.At the bottom line we are shown that there is no black and white reality out there but one of varied subtle hues and tones on both the destructive and the constructive sides of the forces that are metaphysically opposed to each other recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "As we enter the spring of 2006 we can look back at a surprisingly recent albeit small number of well written dramas on film that have not been blockbustertent pole films but have been critically successful and profitable. Unlike their bloated kidvid computer imageenhanced poorly written cousins that we have learned to despise these smaller lower budget films remind us of a better earlierday Hollywood. It was time when the human condition and experience was celebrated and movies thus met their true raison d'etre by fulfilling us on many levels. Find Me Guilty is one of these. The product of none other than the legendary director Sidney Lumet who at this writing is 82 years old like all his other works the film is about humanity. It presents in sketchy continuity the longest trial in the history of the government versus organized crime. The surprise here is Vin Diesel who comes to this film from the field of bloated empty CGI pictures mentioned above. We're surprised both by the quality of his resoundingly good character performance and also by its subtlety. What Lumet does in his trade is recreate life. He does not embellish amplify or whitewash life so the language here is streetvulgarstrong ostensibly as it exists at the levels of the parasitical Mafia that it depicts. It's also not a simpleheaded drama in that it bears several surprises for those like me not terribly familiar with the jurisprudence history of organized crime or its denizens. This film is like The Godfather written by a yellowsheet Tabloid reporter and not a fiction writer. Yet it goes on to prove that life can sometimes be stranger than fiction exactly as said the Bard 500 years ago.At the bottom line we are shown that there is no black and white reality out there but one of varied subtle hues and tones on both the destructive and the constructive sides of the forces that are metaphysically opposed to each other recommended.";

Despite being overly long maybe as an attempt to recreate the overly length of the trial itself the film profits from a surprising turn from Vin Diesel whom I never thought could be believable as a serious actor and a very convincing cast for the other gangsters.It is no surprise that Sidney Lumet who previously did great courtrooms like '12 Angry Men' and 'The Verdict' directed this. He was a very good director and the direction was never a weakness of his films.However just like in those two Lumet once again takes a chance to attack the legal system.Lumet once again vilifies the legal system as 'a system that offends common sense' like a famous critic said. However whereas the other mentioned films find a way to work well to validate such criticism Lumet seems to have finally thrown discretion away in 'Find me Guilty' where he makes real criminals seem like innocent guys unjustly victimized by the system something he also did before in other films like 'Dog Day Afternoon'.Yes they truly did end up with a 'not guilty' verdict and the courtroom dialogue is true but Lumet goes out of his way to show the gangsters as nice guys and manipulates the viewer into sympathizing with them the noncourtroom dialogue for example which is created for the film. How can one twist things in such a way using REAL CRIMINALS as if they were innocents as a way to condemn the LAW SYSTEM for going against them?The real good gangster films like 'The Godfather' trilogy or Scorsese's never try to show them as 'nice guys' like Lumet does here!Moreover the district attorney is shown as an evil almost sadistic person who is impossible to like. The ludicrous attack by the defense implying or outright saying that the trial is nothing but a waste of the taxpayer's money a point Lumet seems to reinforce and the focus on how weak the evidence was only further show how terribly biased Lumet is.This is easily the last nail in the coffin of Lumet's morality. His obsession with making criminals seem like good guys and law enforcers seem bad always made me suspect him of having a questionable sense of morality to say the least. 'Find me Guilty' truly proves his guilt.It is a good film from a technical standpoint with very good acting and directing. As any gangster film it is never truly bad to watch. However its terrible message keeps me from enjoying it fully or giving it a good rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "In an ambitious bid for credibility as a serious actor Vin Diesel tries hard here but despite his imposing physical stature he just doesn't have either the finesse or the gravitas to carry off the role of Jackie DiNorscio a pivotal member of the truelife New Jersey Lucchese crime family who have been brought to court on 76 charges of various crimes. This resulted in the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. No stranger to the courtroom 12 Angry Men The Verdict veteran filmmaker Sidney Lumet helmed this 2006 dramedy and while some of his prowess is evident on the edges the film is a relatively lifeless slog through the exhausting duration of the trial. Lumet who cowrote the script with T.J. Mancini and Robert J. McCrea seems to think the story is compelling enough itself without having to invest much in terms of story structure to the production. It turns out to be a key error in judgment.The problems start with the toupeechallenged Diesel who seems to be left out to dry by Lumet as his lunkheaded clownish presence makes DiNorscio's dilemma less than palpable. After refusing a plea bargain from hyperobsessed federal prosecutor Sean Kierney DiNorscio chooses to represent himself in court and it would have taken a more outsized personality than Diesel's to emphasize the dramatic impact of this ploy. Fortunately Lumet still shows an idiosyncratic sense in casting many of the other roles and three actors stand out. First Peter Dinklage The Station Agent lends a becalming authority to the role of one of the defense attorneys and as it turns out the one ally DiNorscio can trust. That he is a dwarf comes up only when a platform is wheeled into the courtroom for him to provide arguments. Second Annabella Sciorra has a powerful cameo as DiNorscio's embittered exwife whose visit with her cheating exhusband becomes a chainsmoking rite of passage for her.Finally in his film debut Broadway sensation Ral Esparza Company plays the key role of DiNorscio's greasy drugaddicted cousin Tony Compagna with surprising relish. His character's desperate act opens the film but it's the brief climactic crossexamination scene that finally brings the trial to life with Tony visibly breaking down under the weight of his betrayal to DiNorscio. I just wish the rest of the movie was as involving. The usually lowkey British actor Linus Roache is a surprising choice to play Kierney and he provides the necessary bombast but with a wavering accent. The rest of the casting is more typical with Alex Rocco playing head gangster Nick Calabrese and Ron Silver as the often exasperated presiding judge. Lumet unwisely uses musical cues to punctuate the action though the music often overwhelms the dialogue to the point of distraction. The DVD comes with just one extra Conversations with Sidney Lumet which has been inexplicably broken up into multiple parts despite the cursory nature of Lumet's comments in each section.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many Mafia movies the courtroom is merely a backdrop in which we see the main character cut his teeth in the criminal world. A quick shot of the defendant at the defendant desk and the judge rapping the gavel and the picture moves on. In Sidney Lumet's Find Me Guilty the courtroom is where the action takes place not the streets. Lumet captures the longest running Mafia trial in Unites States history with precision while also moving the story along to hold the audiences' attention. It is through the charismatic and charming performance by Vin Diesel as gagster Jackie DiNorscio however that film is brought to life. With this performance Diesel proves he is indeed an actor who can rise beyond his usual action tough guy role. Accompanied by a talented supporting cast and a smart script the film is guilty of being entertaining.In 1987 the city of New York tries 20 members of the Lucchese crime family. Among the defendants is Giacomo Jackie D DiNorscio Vin Diesel who is already serving a 30year sentence for a narcotics charge. Fed up with the ineptitude of his attorney DiNorscio decides to defend himself in the trial. Utilizing his wisecracking attitude and street smarts DiNorscio aggravates lead prosecutor Sean Kierney Linus Roache surprises head defense attorney Ben Klandis Peter Dinklage and captivates the jury. With his undying loyalty to his family and his refusal to testify against them DiNorscio attempts to free not only himself but his fellow mobsters.Sidney Lumet is meticulous about pacing the film. He is wise not linger too often on a dramatic moment so as not to bore the audience but he also does not allow jokes to play themselves out. Instead of focusing on the usual circus a trial of this nature becomes Lumet focuses on the characters involved and how they are affected throughout the ordeal. Through his direction we witness and feel the strain of the prosecutors to win and the nervous tension among the defendants. Lumet takes the audience for a ride simply by showing what the characters are enduring. In lieu of fancy camera angles and dramatic music Lumet allows his actors to tell the story.Vin Diesel does a 180 turn of the heroic tough guy in his performance as Jackie D. He is witty and charismatic that one feels he is not only attempting to win over the jury but the audience as well. Diesel's portrayal of selfprofessed gagster is so charming that audience has to remind themselves that Jackie D is still a criminal underneath the nice guy exterior. But Diesel is not merely fun and games. In his closing argument where he pleads to the jury to let the burden fall on him the audience really feels the love and loyalty Jackie has for his family. With this role Diesel proves he does not have to blow up cars in order to make a successful picture. Accompanying Diesel is Linus Roache as Prosecutor Sean Kierney. Roache plays Kierney as a winatallcosts attorney hellbent on sending the Lucchese family to prison. Roache portrays the anxiety and dedication Kierney has to this case that audience can almost see the ulcers building inside him. But despite being the good guy audiences will still want to see lovable Jackie D beat the rap from the uptight prosecutor. Another scene stealer is Peter Dinklage as criminal attorney Ben Klandis. Dinklage is articulate and intelligent as Klandis. He presents his clients' case without needing to resort to shouting or being over dramatic. He simply shows the errors made by the agents and witnesses. Klandis also shows caring and respect for Jackie and is smooth in that character transition. He does not think it wise that DiNorscio defend himself but like the audience grows think he'll be able to handle it. Other supporting characters to look out for are Ron Silver as Judge Finestein and Raul Esparza as Tony Campagna Jackie D's cousin. Like Klandis Silver also receives Jackie from inept hood to clever human being. As Judge Finestein Silver is like a parent. He warns and punishes Jackie when he goes too far but shows he is can be fair if DiNorscio plays by the rules. Esparza is just great as DiNorscio's drugaddicted cousin. Esparza captures the nervous ticks and mannerisms to a perfect form that one would almost believe he was a drug pusher for years.Through the expert directing and even more talented cast Find Me Guilty is an absolutely enjoyable film. The only minor weakness comes from the screenplay. Although solid for the most part the story should have gone into a bit more explanation on the legal jargon of the case. But that weakness is quickly forgotten by talent of the cast and crew. Lumet's directing keep s the audience involved in the trial while ably trimming down the fat. The actors make the film worth watching with their strong performances and characters. Audiences may be found guilty or rooting for the bad guy but if you knew Jackie D you would be too.GRADE B".

I find Find Me Guilty guilty of being one of the best courtroom melodramas in the last 50 years with 12 Angry Men and The Verdict among them. Of course these three films are Sidney Lumet's a brainy director whose book Making Movies is a definitive analysis of the art and production process seen through a director's eyes. It doesn't hurt either that his Dog Day Afternoon is a gritty urban bank heist story headed by a young actor of promise Al Pacino.So how can Vin Diesel playing the real Jackie DiNorscio compete with Pacino? He's within range underplaying a playful gangster who prefers the jury think of him as a gagster. Think of a bit slimmer Tony Soprano with less smarts but a better sense of humor which Jackie uses to disorient the longest mobster trial in American history involving 20 hoods at the same time as he represents himself against racketeering charges. And I hope the Academy doesn't forget Peter Dinklage's unforgettable lead attorney either next year at this time.Both sides in any trial have known this by clich probably from the time of Hammurabi They say a laughing jury is not a hanging jury. Because the trial actually happened and all twenty went free in no small part because of Jackie's connection with the jury Find Me Guilty transcends even the usual Lumet brilliance with low life and common life and is a caution about the power of personality and the danger of prosecuting on circumstantial evidence. Nietzsche observed Objectivity and justice have nothing to do with one another. Although Jackie has only a sixthgrade education his understanding of life's ironies is sharp and his affection for friends and relatives boundless. A crushing irony is that his goombahs ordered his murder which attempt is depicted in the opening scene and yet he continues to say I love you even while a cousin is sending four bullets his way. Nor will he rat on them to ease his jail time much less tell the police that his cousin tried to whack him. The scene between Jackie and his exwife Annabella Sciorra shows the dual world of antagonism and love in which the latter wins out just as Jackie always knew.Lumet's world is old fashioned I doubt there's an FX in the whole film but powerful because he discovered a long time ago that strong characters and strong actors make strong drama.

But I keep watching it every couple of years and it has become one of my favorite films.Yes it's a fanciful story romanticizing the boring grubby dangerous lives of the very few mercenary soldiers in the world.  But its daring smallunit tactics are actually pretty good and they do illustrate the chaos and devastation a well trained special ops force can cause in an enemy's rear area.  It also illustrates the ease with which such a small unit can be wiped out if the enemy can locate it and bring real forces to bear against it.And interestingly it shows very clearly the effectiveness of even a single small armed airplane against an infantry unit unequipped with antiaircraft capability.  So whoever wrote and advised on this film had some genuine experience.  There are many examples of true combat reality in various parts of the film.However there are also some of the usual warmoviemaking gaffes and there were some really silly amateurish attempts at special effects in the theatrical release most of which have been edited out in the cable movie versions.  So it's still a mixed bag but overall very effective.The other aspects of this film are universally wonderful.  It has a plausible enough story line once you've decided to accept the premise and from there it progresses nicely indeed.  Several of the subplots are intense and very moving some are a little comical and some are downright funny. Burton's last line to Emile Let's talk about your father. is as fine a line as can be written.The depth of the cast is remarkable dozens of very good actors some speaking only one or two lines but so well delivered!  There are also some awkward lines that just don't work at all.  As I said this film is a mixed bag.  Even in the small rolls Jock Tosh Esposito the village priest Jesse and others the quality just shines.The movie doesn't shy away from the unglamorous gutwrenching realities of the consequences of mercenary operations either.  There are some very troubling scenes about the responsibilities of leadership in such a unit.There is not another movie like The Wild Geese.I couldn't end without saying this one last thing.  The theme song The Wild Geese sung by Joan Armatrading is simply marvelous.  It is worth the price of admission and is played in its entirety during the closing credits.

	schema:headline " An historical war film with plenty of testosterone!";
	schema:reviewBody "Having just watched wild geese on DVD for the first time in almost 20 years I'm actually amazed how well it stands up today in the sense that it really portrays well the image of of the mercenary and the mercenary mentality in general back in the 60's and 70's! Watching wild geese today is very nostalgic particularly if you remember seeing the movie at the time but boy so much in the world has changed since then it's nearly 30 years old. Back in 1978 southern Africa was one of the worlds hot spots now it is the forgotten continent and the biggest threat to Africa is not communism mercenaries black majority rule wars but aids.As for the movie itself the character development at the beginning of the four major actors was well done! Faulkner himself puts it as well as any body when he says when I'm not killing complete strangers I'm an out of work drunk who does what he does purely for the money and doesn't care who signs the checks. Janders on the other hand has a conscience who wants to retire gracefully and just watch his son grow up. Fynn is a petty crook who has the right cold blooded streak required for being a mercenary because he has no problem killing people he does not like. Also Coetzee a down on his luck Afrikaner who finds the confines of London not to his taste he just wants to go back to South Africa and buy a farm. He realistically portrays the contempt that Whites had for blacks back then. The blacks were not ready for prime time and the whites were the ones that carried the blacks and made South Africa what it was. He did not like them but did not hate them probably mistrusted them and feared them.The Secondary cast  Tosh Witty and Sandy etc who obviously find retirement or life in civvy street dull and jump at the opportunity to to get the adrenalin flowing for one last time again come across as believable as a sorry looking bunch of middle aged misfits. As another reviewer points out mercenaries were often bored and out of work malcontents who found civilian life difficult to deal with. The prospect of a large pay check and some excitement was certainly a no brainier when stacked up against regular visits to the labor exchange or some poorly paid factory job! This part of the movie is interesting. If wild geese or something similar was to be made today you would have bunch of macho looking men muscle boundsquared jaws probably in their late 20's and early 30's with state of the art equipment. Hollywood in particular has done a wonderful job in brainwashing modern audiences that special forces fit the above description but this is nonsense. Unfortunately this is what viewers expect or want to see and Hollywood whose primary motive is profit wants to portray this image to draw in the audiences. However the reality is nothing could be further from the truth. If you were to meet any special forces you would never believe they are special forces many of them look so inconspicuous. Secondly you should not get confused that all mercenaries were former special forces many came from regular regiments did not have proper training nor good equipment to boot and more often than not resembled the type of oddballs that Wildgeese stereotyped so well.After they had been double crossed they only manage to escape from the Zimbas by fighting themselves to an air strip and stealing an aging Dakota whereby crash landing it in Rhodesia with only 13 members of the original outfit surviving. I can't tell you the amount of films over the years where the bad guys can't shoot straight no not in wild geese 37 perish.Yes you could say that the fighting was not really realistic and their uniforms were perhaps too clean at the end remember it's a film however in my opinion no movie can be realistic about war or close quarters combat I don't care what people say about Black Hawk down or Saving Private Ryan.It's good entertainment good charactersRichard Burton was very believable as Faulkner plenty of politically incorrect dialog action and a none fairytale ending with the loss of Jaunders who was probably the most likable of all the characters. In addition Limbani who in 1978 was playing a sort of Nelson Mandela type character who was prepared to reach out to the whites Coetzee understands that he may have a point white and blacks need each other for the continent to survive. Funnily enough 10 years on Mandela was released from prison and the rest is history how right Wildgeese was back then. I expect Wildgeese to be broadcast on the History channel some time in the future as it is part of history now! Lastly as for the DVD it's been digitally restored and remastered and simply looks great. Some may complain that it's not real widescreen with the top and bottom being sliced off to give that impression but I would have to say that it did not in any way spoil the movie.The extras are great too about the London premier making of wild geese as well as a commentary from Euan Lloyd and Roger Moore. Note some have questioned why it was a 30th anniversary DVD when the movie was released in1978. My guess is that most of the cast have died and the surviving cast and crew are getting up there    do it now when you can!!".

Also Coetzee a down on his luck Afrikaner who finds the confines of London not to his taste he just wants to go back to South Africa and buy a farm. He realistically portrays the contempt that Whites had for blacks back then. The blacks were not ready for prime time and the whites were the ones that carried the blacks and made South Africa what it was. He did not like them but did not hate them probably mistrusted them and feared them.The Secondary cast  Tosh Witty and Sandy etc who obviously find retirement or life in civvy street dull and jump at the opportunity to to get the adrenalin flowing for one last time again come across as believable as a sorry looking bunch of middle aged misfits. As another reviewer points out mercenaries were often bored and out of work malcontents who found civilian life difficult to deal with. The prospect of a large pay check and some excitement was certainly a no brainier when stacked up against regular visits to the labor exchange or some poorly paid factory job! This part of the movie is interesting. If wild geese or something similar was to be made today you would have bunch of macho looking men muscle boundsquared jaws probably in their late 20's and early 30's with state of the art equipment. Hollywood in particular has done a wonderful job in brainwashing modern audiences that special forces fit the above description but this is nonsense. Unfortunately this is what viewers expect or want to see and Hollywood whose primary motive is profit wants to portray this image to draw in the audiences. However the reality is nothing could be further from the truth. If you were to meet any special forces you would never believe they are special forces many of them look so inconspicuous. Secondly you should not get confused that all mercenaries were former special forces many came from regular regiments did not have proper training nor good equipment to boot and more often than not resembled the type of oddballs that Wildgeese stereotyped so well.After they had been double crossed they only manage to escape from the Zimbas by fighting themselves to an air strip and stealing an aging Dakota whereby crash landing it in Rhodesia with only 13 members of the original outfit surviving. I can't tell you the amount of films over the years where the bad guys can't shoot straight no not in wild geese 37 perish.Yes you could say that the fighting was not really realistic and their uniforms were perhaps too clean at the end remember it's a film however in my opinion no movie can be realistic about war or close quarters combat I don't care what people say about Black Hawk down or Saving Private Ryan.It's good entertainment good charactersRichard Burton was very believable as Faulkner plenty of politically incorrect dialog action and a none fairytale ending with the loss of Jaunders who was probably the most likable of all the characters. In addition Limbani who in 1978 was playing a sort of Nelson Mandela type character who was prepared to reach out to the whites Coetzee understands that he may have a point white and blacks need each other for the continent to survive. Funnily enough 10 years on Mandela was released from prison and the rest is history how right Wildgeese was back then. I expect Wildgeese to be broadcast on the History channel some time in the future as it is part of history now! Lastly as for the DVD it's been digitally restored and remastered and simply looks great. Some may complain that it's not real widescreen with the top and bottom being sliced off to give that impression but I would have to say that it did not in any way spoil the movie.The extras are great too about the London premier making of wild geese as well as a commentary from Euan Lloyd and Roger Moore. Note some have questioned why it was a 30th anniversary DVD when the movie was released in1978. My guess is that most of the cast have died and the surviving cast and crew are getting up there    do it now when you can!!";

With the unlikely combination of Richard Burton Richard Harris  Roger Moore plus a wellwritten script coupled with spectacular action sequences this is a riproaring action  adventure and a topnotch film.The three main leads are the main attraction of this film. It's hard to believe that actors of the caliber of Burton Harris and Moore would either have chemistry or even be in the same film together. But put the three of them together as mercenaries and you get a truly explosive combination of three terrific actors. None of them fail in their roles and they actually share quite a bit of chemistry between them especially in the final scene between Burton and Harris.The rest of the cast is not a let down either. Harvey Kruger does well in his role as the mercenary Pieter Coetze as do Kenneth Griffith John Kani and Jack Watson among the other members of the Wild Geese. Frank Finlay Winston Ntshona and Stewart Granger all make welcomed appearances in the film in their supporting roles.The film's script is a wellwritten action film with political overtones. While the politics of the film are dated now the message for the times is still evident in the film. Outside of the political overtones the dialouge of the film is wellwritten and in some scenes is even touching especially in the final scene.The action in the film is another highlight. The air drop into Africa various raids by the Wild Geese and the final battle at the airstrip complement the story and never overwhelm the story and plot. Thanks to some good editing by editor John Glen who had edited three Bond films and would go on to direct five more Bond filmsthe action is never dull and keeps the pace constant.With a topnotch leading cast a good supporting cast a good script and spectacular action sequences The Wild Geese is one of the better action films you can see. Despite being somewhat dated the film still packs quite a punch and could easily go up against any recent action film. A must see for action film fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "This flick which has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it over twenty years ago.It was released on DVD in the past year or so here in the U.S.so I bought it to see if it held up.Boy howdy did it everaside from some of the goofy clothes the people were wearing at the mafia punk's partythis movie still looks fantastic. First of all you can't wrong with a flick starring two of the three greatest actors of all timeRichard Burton and Richard Harris it's a shame there was no part for Peter O'Tooleoh well.Not to forget Roger Moore who shows all the naysayers he was a great choice to play 007it's not his fault he was saddled with mediocre scripts and wasn't allowed to be the 007 he could've been for proof watch the scene where he dispenses some very Bondlike justice on the mafia punk who tricked him into smuggling heroin. Richard Burton plays the nononsensehard drinking merc commander who has his sense of what's right and wrong in the world reawakened by his best friend and master tactician merc played by Richard Harris the conscience of the group.Also in the group is great German actor Hardy Kruger as a Dutch South African who has issues but has the best character arc in the piece.There is also Kenneth Griffith as the homosexual medic who despite being downplayed as comedic relief is every bit as dangerous as the other mercs.John Kani plays the super dependable merc Jesse and the always great Winston Ntshona as the object of the mercs rescue mission. This saves my personal favorite character for last the always great Jack Watson as the RSMhis character is the guy I'd want leading me out of a hellish situation such as the one the guys encounter here in this all time great manly flick.Not to mention when Watson's character is retraining them that is my favorite scene in the flick it always gets a good bwahahaha outta me. The whole point of their mission is to rescue a democracy loving ex president of a fictional African country for the purposes of mineral acquisition.Their employer is a British banker played to evil yet constipated perfection by Stewart Grangeras different from Alan Quartermain as a part can get.Of course he betrays them and they have to fight their way through Africa to try to get Winston Ntshona's character to safe ground.They lose a lot of the cast in this section of the movie and it hurts to see characters you learn to love dying some of the most brutal deaths imaginable. The final escape by the Dakota plane is as harrowing as any I've seen in any flickgut wrenching and heart breaking to boot.This is one flick that it's okay for guys to get misty eyed over due to the tragic heroism of Richard Burton and company.It is worth it just to see the rage boiling over in Richard Burton's eyes as they land at the airport and you know that Stewart Granger's character ain't long for this world.If any women are reading this review and your husbandboyfriend is a fan of real movies for men and not frathouse moviesthen you can't go wrong with this one.This is the greatest mercenary movie of all time.".

The screenplay much like the actors playing the key roles is very self aware to not take itself too seriously it's also very funny at times there is some absolute crackerjack slices of dialogue here.The PC brigade and political historians beat themselves around their heads trying to flatten the appeal of The Wild Geese it didn't work.

	schema:headline " Awesome Mercinary Adventure Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I discovered this film when I was like 14 because I was obsessed with the Bond movies after watching The Wild Geese I developed another obsession. No film is for everyone but this one has a lot to love especially for fans of the genre and the cast.Richard Burton plays Allen Faulkner an aged British mercenary hired by a multinational company to lead a team into Africa and rescue the president of a wartorn nation to serve their purposes. It sounds like simple action fluff. It isn't. All the men Faulkner brings along many of whom are members of his old crew have families they might not see again. The biggest focus of these is Richard Harris in a great performance as Capt. Janders who is the single parent to his son Amiel. There's also the complications that ensue when their mission changes purposes midway through. Most importantly is that this film is scripted by Reginald Rose who gave us Twelve Angry Men.Also featured are Roger Moore and Hardy Kruger. Moore is the one I watched the film for and gives a typical Moore performance. Krugar however is given the more interesting character. Like the rest he's an aging mercenary unlike the rest he's South African and prejudiced against black people. The man they rescue Julius Limbani Winston Ntshona is black and Kruger's character must either save a man he sees as less than human or come to grips with his racism.Andrew V. McLaglen is not what I'd call a great director but he does fine here. He keeps a good pace that balances the action and drama. A few of his decisions are a might distracting but I think this is more a reflection of mainstream cinema at the time than one filmmaker's failings. This movie is still a gift to adventure fans and it asks the right questions.The sequel made after Burton's death is a different thing altogether. If ever you see The Wild Geese 2 don't expect what you got here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching The Wild Geese puts me so in mind of those old John Ford cavalry flicks. Not surprising since the Director Andrew McLaglen learned his trade while on the set of those films with his father Victor McLaglen. A fine cast was assembled here for this film. Richard Burton Roger Moore and Richard Harris certainly have all done better stuff but their skill makes The Wild Geese enjoyable. Of the three I think Harris comes off the best his scenes with his young son are very poignant.Richard Burton is a mercenary who is being offered a contract by gazillionaire industrialist Stewart Granger. Train and equip a group of mercenaries to rescue a Nelson Mandela type African leader who has been deposed in a military coup. Burton does the job but when the job is finished he and his mercenaries find getting out a whole lot more than the bargained for.Starting with Where Eagles Dare Burton was trying the actionadventure genre on for size and he did well with that. He came up way short with Raid on Rommel but recouped quite a bit with The Wild Geese. It was his only joint film venture with Richard Harris pairing both the stage and screen King Arthurs from Camelot.Of course action adventure is old hat for Roger Moore. He was in his prime as James Bond when The Wild Geese was done. But Moore shows he can be quite serious here. None of the tongue in cheek deadpan that characterizes a Bond film.The scenes dealing with the recruiting a training of the mercenaries come straight out of John Ford. So are the various types among the soldiers.I liked Kenneth Griffith's portrayal of the openly gay medic with the group. Yes he's certainly stereotypical but the point is he's accepted by the men who really don't care about his sexual orientation when in a fight. Secondly he turns out to be quite the John Wayne type hero in the end. The Wild Geese turned out to be very popular Burton was going to do a sequel Wild Geese II when he died in 1983. Might have been interesting had he done it since it would have paired with Laurence Olivier in that one.The Wild Geese is an actionadventure film to be sure but it's also about loyalty tradition and camaraderie. These men may fight for a good paycheck but they are fanatically loyal to the unit created and to each other.If that ain't John Ford.............................".

We flew airlift support for the French Foreign Legion Belgian and African troops. We were the only Americans in Africa and felt like mercenaries. At that time the African leader was Mobutu.My only fault with the movie is that it did not depict how truly awful the living conditions were in Africa. I thank Euan Lloyd for this movie.

He of course despite this is an 'expert and commands the undying loyalty of all who know him.Richard Harris is an expert too in 'planning'. He has an embarrassingly precocious son whom he loves dearly  oh dear that's a bad portent. Incredibly he also has a bleeding heart persuaded to join the mission only because its purpose is to save the only decent African leader on the continent. However his liberalism doesn't prevent him planning the deaths of hundreds of men by cyanide poisoning. There is even a token black mercenary reassured by Harris' presence that he is not being asked to do anything unworthy.Hardy Kruger is there too as an Afrikaaner who has to move rapidly from dislike of 'Kaffirs' to such respect for this deposed President that he is willing to die for him. His changing mode of address from 'Kaffir' to 'Man' to 'Bloke' is as nauseating as Harris' son's shouting 'Yahoo' when exulting over his planned skiing holiday. It doesn't happen obviously.Roger Moore's available to play a downatheel James Bond alternately stuffing heroin down gangsters' throats and charming airheaded women. 'Isn't he a dear?' says one. Who wrote this stuff? Believe it or not Reginald Rose famous for Twelve Angry Men and Man of the West.The rest of the commandos must be the most middleaged bunch of war dogs ever recruited. Jack Watson the devoted SergeantMajor providing the routine tough training programme. Ronald Fraser and Percy Herbert left over from World War II and another hammy performance from Kenneth Griffith.Various superannuated British actors play duplicitous shadowy characters from business and government. For the mercenaries you see are naive wellmeaning pawns in a murky capitalist game.It's a derivative hypocritical meretricious film which allows a good cast to go through lazy motions instead of acting. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.So why do I watch it so often? Why do I enjoy every minute of the bloody thing?".

	schema:reviewBody "In concept The Wild Geese resembles many other action movies The Dirty Dozen immediately comes to mind despite obvious differences. Tough veteran with a murky background is hired to assemble and train a team that will carry out a dangerous assignment the opening interview explains the mission the team is recruited from among the vet's old friends the team is trained under a tough drill sergeant and the climactic raid unfolds.A latecareer Richard Buron is fine as Colonel Faulkner the mercenary with experience and myriad capable exconfederates. Enter Stewart Granger as Sir Edward Matherson a stuffy Brit with ambiguous motives Matherson secretly brings Burton to England for a dangerous mission to rescue a kidnapped African president named Limbani sensitively played by Winston Ntshone. Burton quickly enlists Roger Moore on hiatus from his James Bond franchise Richard Harris and Hardy Kruger. An old buddy of Burton Jack Watson is the tough drill sergeant who gets the aging group in shape. And they all badly need the exercise because Burton enlists his team from among the retired the underemployed and malcontent and most seem too mature for the mission they are not exactly a dirty dozen but more an arthritic thirty. Beyond the aging leads the rest of the seasoned cast includes Barry Foster Frank Finlay Kenneth Griffith Ronald Fraser and Jeff Corey. As expected from the distinguished names the acting throughout more than meets the demands of an action flick. The screenplay by Reginald Rose which was based on a novel by Daniel Carney is riddled with such stereotypes as the fey gay man the noble African leader and the racist white South African. The plot is often predictable and clichs abound from hostile wives who tolerate their adventureseeking husbands to the requisite if something happens to me speech to a sappy fade out. The superfluous clichs and gratuitous political exchanges between Ntshone and Kruger slow the film and the running time is a bit long at 129 minutes. However Andrew V. McLaglen directs professionally and manages to overcome the script's weaknesses to deliver a satisfying action movie.".

I am sure this is pure Burton rather than Faulkner and is probably an extant ad lib brought on by the fact they would be drinking Ribena rather than the real stuff  it is for me one of the great moments in British cinema! The continuity in the film is flaky. When Moore meets Kruger watch the level of beer in Moore's glass when they cut between camera's. The Bedford S Type trucks they try to escape in appear variously in the training camp and being used by Government forces. But none of these errors takes anything away from what is a superb movie with most of the stars performances so laid back it is untrue. Thanks".

BUT...if you were looking for a thrilling fast paced rollercoaster that's what you will find.For the past year I have been seeking out alternatives to American cinema because it has become so formulaic and awful. I troll IMDb and eBay to see what else is happening in the world. Sure B13 is derivative but it is certainly more exciting than another reimagining of a 70s cop show.The opening sequence took my breath away. I was halfway through the film before I felt it was sage to dart to the kitchen for a drink. I said to my wife THIS is the movie I've been searching for. Even the subtitles were good. The verbiage and spelling were very authentic and slangconversational. It did not feel forced as many foreign films do. It was definitely subbed with the British market in mind as some of the banter evoked thoughts of Lock Stock or Layer Cake or Football Factory.If I want a truly compelling story I'll look elsewhere but check out B13 for the some great fight scenes excellent scenery and mindblowing athleticism.".

When the government learns that local kingpin Larbi or Bibi Narceri  Sami Narceri's brother  even though Bibi Naceri cowrote the script he still had to audition for the part of Taha along with other actors has acquired a nuclear weapon  Damien Cyril Raffaelli and Leito David Belle  the originator of Le Parkour  are called upon to avoid an atomic bomb on destroying the blocks at the heart of District 13 with tactical precision and as save the city . With acrobatic skillfulness and adrenaline pumping belief in their own abilities they throw themselves out from incredible heights and jump from roof to roof  locked doors and 'No Trespassing' signs become irresistible challenges . They confront their enemies in order to find out location the bomb the bomb code is 9293709B13 and his sister Dany Verissimo who spent two whole days on a roof in the freezing cold in ripped clothes handcuffed to a bomb and Luc Besson wrote the part of Lola specifically for her who was formerly kidnapped  but someone is still after them and are forced to once again take up violent means to survive .13th District is an exciting film that contains suspense  thrills noisy action  shootouts and violent fights . The main couple is unabashed in its dedication to fanboy stunt work . From the beginning to the final the noisy action and fast movement is unstopped  including breathtaking scenes in which bounds and leaps through apartments blocks and at moments give the impression that they are flying . Cyril Raffaelli as a hardrock  twofisted agent is topnotch . This is a frantic rehash of Escape from NY  rightly realized in French style . The highlights of the movie are The Parkour  also known in USA as Free Running whose origin was in Yamasaki film directed by Ariel Zeitoun  Julien Seri and also produced by Luc Besson with his production company called EuropaCorps . Duo protagonist more than make up for in an skill to soar across a rolling medley highrise flats blocks . The way in which the actors prove this abilities  is in fact an activity called Parkour and was invented by David Belle himself  influenced by his father Raymond Belle . Cyril Raffaelli and David Belle had three months to prepare all their Parkour stunts for the film . There weren't any special effects  wirework computer graphics... used in 90 of the Parkour scenes . Good cinematography by cameraman Manuel Teran using Steadicam and zooms with numerous locations from Paris slums . The musician Da Octopuss creates a stirring moving soundtrack fitting to frantic action . Lavishly produced by the successful French producer and director Luc Besson . The flick was stunningly realized by the habitual cameraman Pierre Morel in his first film the second was the successful Taken  though Alexandre Aja was originally hired to direct the movie the first . Filmmaker Pierre gives the action a dancelike quality and the whole movie took 10 months for production  idea script casting filming etc  as from January 2004 to October 2004 . Followed by District 13 Ultimatum by Patrick Alessandrin again with Cyril Raffaelli as Capt. Damien Tomaso  David Belle as Leto  Philippe Torreton as Le Prsident De la Rpublique and as well as starring in the film Cyril Raffaelli also choreographed all the fight sequences  however David Belle didn't practice all his Parkour stunts  most of the ones that you see in the film were of him performing the stunt for the first time . Rating Better than average well worth seeing  this is a highly agreeable action movie . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2010 the dangerous districts in the periphery of Paris are surrounded by walls and the dwellers do not have school hospital and even police in the area which are ruled by drug lords. In the 13th District Leito David Belle is a honest man that lives in a clean building and does not permit drug dealers nearby his neighborhood. When he destroys one million Euros in heroin of Taha Bemamud Larbi Naceri the criminal abducts Leito's sister Lola Dany Verssimo and the corrupt police arrests Leito. Six months later the tough and honest Capt. Damien Tomaso Cyril Raffaelli is assigned to find and deactivate a stolen bomb that might destroy the 13th District and the two million dwellers. Together with Leito they have to face the gang of Taha and disclose a despicable secret behind the robbery of the bomb.The unknown Banlieue 13 was one of the best surprises I have had this year. It is pure adrenaline and certainly one of the best action movies I have recently seen. The greatest attractions are the performances of David Belle and Cyril Raffaelli. I have just read in IMDb that David Belle is coinventor of the sport known as Parkour which consists of moving freely in a natural area including climbing on buildings and taking on whatever is in the way. Cyril Raffaelli is also stunt coordinator and stunt. Together they are awesome with amazing choreography that recalls Jackie Chan when he was young and certainly are among the best I have ever seen in the cinema. The direction and the story are also good hooking the attention until the very last scene. Just as a curiosity in the beginning of the movie the guys are watching a Brazilian soapopera with Regina Duarte and Antnio Fagundes. My vote is eight.Title Brazil B13  13o Distrito B13  13th District".

Smooth fluid motion and crisp nobullshit camerawork makes it a real treat to the eye.

For real watch Heat and not as repetitive and drawnout as the usual ones.The whole ghetto atmosphere works really well. Concrete and poverty works fine as scenery. Dialouge seemed good too from what I got from the subtitles.What's there to dislike? Well character development is the sameold. Two different guys team up and saves the day overcome their differences and live happily ever after. It has been done before but at least it's done well here.The music is consistent and fitting so that's more of a matter of taste.Otherwise the movie is pretty much solid.

This movie from the very beginning is very captivating with the smooth shots that flow and literally jump with the characters is amazing. it keeps you in the movie the whole time and the action scenes are the most unique i've seen since matrix but a whole lot cooler. the movie is in french and has subtitles but actually adds to the movies authenticity and cool factor. its great hearing the actors speak in their native languages and it ends up making you want to learn french. the two leads are quite the french hotties and martial arts masters. its a simple enough plot with some twists to it. and less than 90 minutes its well worth your money. i plan on owning this once its out on DVD and definitely am waiting to see it again in theatres when it does come out. i'm not an action movie buff at all but this movie definitely kept my attention with the quick wit and humor from the characters and the quick but focused action. it was really mindboggling stunts that i kept saying ohmigod to. so definitely well worth a watch and recommendation to your friends.".

This movie from the very beginning is very captivating with the smooth shots that flow and literally jump with the characters is amazing. it keeps you in the movie the whole time and the action scenes are the most unique i've seen since matrix but a whole lot cooler. the movie is in french and has subtitles but actually adds to the movies authenticity and cool factor. its great hearing the actors speak in their native languages and it ends up making you want to learn french. the two leads are quite the french hotties and martial arts masters. its a simple enough plot with some twists to it. and less than 90 minutes its well worth your money. i plan on owning this once its out on DVD and definitely am waiting to see it again in theatres when it does come out. i'm not an action movie buff at all but this movie definitely kept my attention with the quick wit and humor from the characters and the quick but focused action. it was really mindboggling stunts that i kept saying ohmigod to. so definitely well worth a watch and recommendation to your friends.";

	schema:reviewBody "The place  France.The time  after 2010.The plot  The French government has erected giant walls around the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods. Inside these walls its a veritable jungle with the strongest and ofter most corrupt ruling.This is the directorial debut of Pierre Morel. He has worked as the cinematographer on Danny the Dog a.k.a. Unleashed and the Transporter. If this movie gives you a sense of deja vu don't worry just flow with it.The movie follows the recent Ong Bak trend of action movies in that there is very little plot or a somewhat lacking storyline but is compensated for by bone crunching and realistic actionathletic sequences albeit in this case with a French flavor.After the opening fly through of the barrio we get a glimpse at one of the protagonists Leito David Belle. Leito is a neighborhood kid who does a good impersonation of Daredevil minus the blindness white stick or red outfit. While surround by crime Leito manages to keep honest and actually fights back against the neighborhood drug lord Taha.This is the first 20 minutes of the movie and it was simply awesome. David Belle is cofounder of a sport called Parkour. It is some EuroAsian fusion of martial arts and running. There was a Nike commercial ??  it was definitely a sneaker ad where this man kept jumping off of random things. The whole point was he didn't stop no matter what was in his way. It seems to be some improvisational running where you figure out ways to get around things. This opening sequence involves a lot of running at full speed and some fighting inside outside and on top of an apartment building. The pace for the sequence is fast and aweinspiring.We are then transported 6 months into the future where we are introduced to our second protagonist Damien Cyril Raffaelli. Damien is the decorated straight as an arrow cop. He follows order and does whatever is necessary within the law to get the job done. Damien's 20 minute introduction takes place in an illegal casino. This is the actual sequence that reminds me the most of Ong Bak the mle combat. It has a similar style of course without Tony Jaa's proficiency complete with the bonewrenching oomphs. Cyril may seem familiar to fans of the action genre. He has been in numerous actions flicks as well staring in Kiss of the Dragon and as a stunt man in the Transporter and Brotherhood of the Wolf.The first two sections of the movie contain the character development while the last section handles the plot. A new type of bomb has been stolen. It has a 24 hour detonation timer on it that is activated once the case is opened. Damien is sent in to defuse it namely to enter a code that defuses the already active bomb. The bomb is somewhere in B13 and Leito is volunteered to be his guide.The movie was definitely enjoyable yet lacking much of a story or a finale. I was reminded of Ong Bak and especially of the Transporter. These movies along with B13 seem to have a rather simplistic finale. The world is a generally good place where a few bad apples take advantage of the good. Most of the time the good simply do not know the bad people exist. They just need someone to tell them and then collectively the good do the right thing which is always done through lawful and sometimes legislative means. There are other movies like most of Jackie Chan's movies that have similar endings. This is not so much a criticism as an observation.There were some scenes that made me go huh.Why does everyone have their names on the doors ? I'm sure each of the characters probably also have their names sewn into their boxers. I did enjoy Taha's Tony Montana impression. It was quite a funny scene. Lastly I would have liked a more extended fight scene with Yeti but otherwise was a good sequence. Outside of the action sequences there were some instances of gunplay. This was definitely not John Woo but I was reminded of the Professional Besson does have writing credits.I thoroughly enjoyed this fast paced action buddy movie reminded me of 48 Hours or Rush Hour  except without the comical copcon routine. I highly recommend this movie for action fans.Celluloid Rehab".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie will be a hit with action fans and no one else. I happen to enjoy movies with action and cool stunts even if the plot is terrible or completely overthetop so I thoroughly enjoyed this movie although the end left me wanting more or something different. Basically if you liked the Transporter movies you'll like this one too. The acting is actually better than I anticipated. The characters are onedimensional as you might expect but the script is decent and the dialogue isn't too corny. In fact if you look really hard there is also a trace of a sociopolitical message in the film. The action met my expectations but didn't surpass them by much. There are a lot of moves that remind me of Onk Bak The Thai Warrior. If you can handle one person fighting an armed gang of a dozen or more and winning or escaping as the case may be then you will be entertained by this movie. This is a genre movie that will be surprisingly similar to the vision you have of it in your head before you see it. But it's worth a watch. You won't be bored by any means. 7 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Review from 2005 TIFF";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Banlieue 13 is set in Paris of 2010 where the poor and the undesirable have been forced into ghettos walled off from the rest of the city and controlled by criminal gangs. One of these gangs led by crime boss Taha played by Bibi Naceri who cowrote the screenplay with Luc Besson hijacks a truck and gains possession of a neutron bomb that is accidentally triggered to go off in less than 24 hours. Undercover cop Damien played by Cyril Raffaelli is forced to team up with ghetto rebel Leito David Belle to retrieve the device. Leito meanwhile has his own agenda with Taha who is holding Leito's sister hostage as punishment for Leito destroying Taha's drugs.Produced by Luc Besson the film is the directorial debut of Pierre Morel who has acted as cinematographer on a number of Bessonproducedwritten films including The Transporter and Unleashed aka Danny the Dog. Cyril Raffaelli who attended the screening is a longtime associate of Besson mainly working stunts or as a body double in a number of movies such as Double Team and Ronin before moving on to acting in films such as Kiss of the Dragon where he can be seen fighting Jet Li in the climax and Crimson Rivers 2.David Belle is an interesting choice in that he is the founder of Le Parkour a movement where people try to move from point A to point B as fast as possible in the most fluid manner as possible without stopping and always moving forward never backward. It is big in Europe and has even made an appearance on this side of the Atlantic in an episode of CSI NY. The movement originated out of work his father did but parkour is adapted to an urban environment.This film is amazing. If you've seen the street chase scene in OngBak The Thai Warrior and thought that it was a refreshing change from all the wire work present in most action films today that pales in comparison to the chase scenes in Banlieue 13. Watching David Belle escape from an apartment building while chased by thugs is like watching poetry in motion. The movements are so graceful and fluid and the things he does are amazing because it is very evident that he's performing the stunts himself and that there's no safety equipment involved. He scales the sides of buildings 20 stories up he jumps from rooftop to rooftop he even slips past thugs in a narrow hallway by bouncing up the walls. And not to be outdone Raffaelli has some great martial arts scenes especially a long sequence in a backroom casino.Plotwise the movie isn't necessarily anything new with the obvious parallel being John Carpenter's Escape from New York. But the action in the movie is so amazing it is well worth seeing.Notes from the QA with Cyril Raffaelli  The movie was a quick shoot taking only about three months and the film was in theatres two months after that.Every action scene in the movie is real there is absolutely no wire work of any kind. It is also evident in the movie that there are also no mattresses or nets in any of the shots.Raffaelli and Belle have talked amongst themselves about a sequel and would love to do one but there's no serious talk of anything right now.Besson was originally going to make one movie with Raffaelli and a different one with Belle but then decided to put both of them together.Raffaelli start martial arts when he was very young and then his mother put him into circus school. He ended up combining the two which led him to become a stuntman. He's now been in almost 70 films 10 of them with Europa Luc Besson's company.He's been a body double for JeanClaude Van Damne in Double Team.Raffaelli's work in Kiss of the Dragon led to the role in Banlieue 13.He is very into martial arts and action films of all kinds from all over but when he is making or choreographing a film he likes to read the entire script to get a sense of the character and tries to be realistic in the stunts and the combat unlike a lot of US films.Raffaelli tried to show the differences between Leito and Damien in their fighting styles Leito being from the street has a rougher style more boxinglike while Damien being from the more civilized part of Paris has a cleaner more calculated style.Since Belle had no background in acrobatics or martial arts Raffaelli took him to Thailand and trained him over a twoyear period.Raffaelli doesn't do parkour himself in the pure sense but has used elements of it in a chase scene he choreographed for Crimson Rivers 2 plus as a stunt professional he feels he is supposed to be able to do anything he's certified in scuba diving skydiving horseback riding driving carstrucksmotorcycles.He has trained in multiple martial arts including karate Tae Kwon Do Brazilian jujitsu and combatstyle kungfu of which he was the French champion in 1997. He had to give up the kungfu competitively because it was interfering with his film work.".

If you've seen the street chase scene in OngBak The Thai Warrior and thought that it was a refreshing change from all the wire work present in most action films today that pales in comparison to the chase scenes in Banlieue 13. Watching David Belle escape from an apartment building while chased by thugs is like watching poetry in motion. The movements are so graceful and fluid and the things he does are amazing because it is very evident that he's performing the stunts himself and that there's no safety equipment involved. He scales the sides of buildings 20 stories up he jumps from rooftop to rooftop he even slips past thugs in a narrow hallway by bouncing up the walls. And not to be outdone Raffaelli has some great martial arts scenes especially a long sequence in a backroom casino.Plotwise the movie isn't necessarily anything new with the obvious parallel being John Carpenter's Escape from New York. But the action in the movie is so amazing it is well worth seeing.Notes from the QA with Cyril Raffaelli  The movie was a quick shoot taking only about three months and the film was in theatres two months after that.Every action scene in the movie is real there is absolutely no wire work of any kind. It is also evident in the movie that there are also no mattresses or nets in any of the shots.Raffaelli and Belle have talked amongst themselves about a sequel and would love to do one but there's no serious talk of anything right now.Besson was originally going to make one movie with Raffaelli and a different one with Belle but then decided to put both of them together.Raffaelli start martial arts when he was very young and then his mother put him into circus school. He ended up combining the two which led him to become a stuntman. He's now been in almost 70 films 10 of them with Europa Luc Besson's company.He's been a body double for JeanClaude Van Damne in Double Team.Raffaelli's work in Kiss of the Dragon led to the role in Banlieue 13.He is very into martial arts and action films of all kinds from all over but when he is making or choreographing a film he likes to read the entire script to get a sense of the character and tries to be realistic in the stunts and the combat unlike a lot of US films.Raffaelli tried to show the differences between Leito and Damien in their fighting styles Leito being from the street has a rougher style more boxinglike while Damien being from the more civilized part of Paris has a cleaner more calculated style.Since Belle had no background in acrobatics or martial arts Raffaelli took him to Thailand and trained him over a twoyear period.Raffaelli doesn't do parkour himself in the pure sense but has used elements of it in a chase scene he choreographed for Crimson Rivers 2 plus as a stunt professional he feels he is supposed to be able to do anything he's certified in scuba diving skydiving horseback riding driving carstrucksmotorcycles.He has trained in multiple martial arts including karate Tae Kwon Do Brazilian jujitsu and combatstyle kungfu of which he was the French champion in 1997. He had to give up the kungfu competitively because it was interfering with his film work.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's erroneous to interpret A Film By Luc Besson that the marketing folks slap on the movie posters these days. Besson has of late been lending his name for that purpose on many movies but nope he's not the director. Usually involved in another capacity like writer or producer.District 13 is one such movie. This is not a film by Luc Besson although it is written by and produced by him. This movie is directed by Pierre Morel who was the cinematographer for another Bessoninvolved film Jet Li's Unleashed. You'll see some familiar stylistic elements from Unleashed in this movie although this one was made in 2004 and shown here earlier as the movie used to launch Cathay's new halls 1012 at cineleisure.Set in Paris 2010 troubled districts get walled in by the authorities. Literally. And District 13 is one of the most notorious amongst all. We get introduced to Leito first a resident of District 13 but as it turns out despite his mean tattoo covered demeanor he has a heart of gold and fantastic springs for legs borrowed from the Yamakasi folks. Played by David Belle he actually is a cofounder of a sport known as Parkour which is demonstrated in the movie as a very free form of martial arts cross bred with the Yamakasi spirit. Leito is a character who's jaded by authoritylike figures as he gets betrayed by the police and has his sister given up as collateral.The other protagonist is Damien an ace undercover cop played by stuntman Cyril Raffaelli. Accomplishing his latest mission doesn't buy him rest as he gets thrust unwillingly into a new assignment of having to locate a neutron bomb stolen and brought into District 13. Given only 24 hours before the bomb explodes and kills everyone in an eight kilometer radius he has to enlist the help of Leito to serve as a guide inside the notorious district.As you would already expect it's reluctant hero meeting another reluctant hero both with huge egos and their own agendas  one to save lives the other to save his sister. Both share a common enemy so that makes it easier somewhat to find common ground to cooperate. However the movie's a tad short to explore these buddy themes as you get into the action thick and fast.It's adrenalin pumping action against an edgy hard hitting soundtrack. You'll initially be wowed at Leito's Parkour scenes which brings back some memories of Jackie Chan movies with his acrobatic maneuvers into confined spaces and of leaping from building to building window ledge to window ledge and rooftop to rooftop. However after a while you tend to get jaded because it's basically the same thing repeated over and over again. The initial novelty wore out and it didn't help that action scenes thereafter relied on the same techniques.Also despite being billed as a nonstop action flick the action actually pauses for long moments to force a discussion on the ridding of the downtrodden of taking extreme measures to round up troubled districts by physically segregating them from the rest using high walls and barbed wires. and of extreme methods of getting rid of such folks deemed as troublemakers.There're also more stylethansubstance scenes not that I'm complaining but some shots were pretty to look at at the expense of the story. As with most action movies you'll also have to suspend belief that while bullets can make nasty holes in metal they will never find a way to penetrate wood or human flesh at least when the heroes are concerned.While the ending's pretty neat you can't help but wonder that this movie is yet another victim of the cool trailer syndrome  having almost all the best bits of the movie condensed into the trailer leaving nothing much in the movie itself.".

Meanwhile Capt. Damien is a topnotch excellently trained cop with a profound belief in law and justice.Once a nuclear bomb is stolen in Banlieue 13 Damien is sent to retrieve the device that threatens the lives of millions. Smack centre in the middle of the district it reappears.

I defy anyone not to be impressed by this sequence of stunts which clearly had no Blue ScreenSpecial effects Please note Bond Producers. From then on the action never lets up mixing Martial Arts  the Free Running. There's also plenty of Gun play for the John Woo element.

	schema:headline " Good fun but...";
	schema:reviewBody "...whatever happened to the director of Leon? Banlieue 13 is a lightweight rerun of Escape From New York.

	schema:reviewBody "The Coronado DVD was for sale very cheaply in one of the Danish department store chains so I bought it. I have to say I'm pretty happy with it.For one thing  the main thing actually  it stars Kristin Datillo. I haven't seen the Chris Isaak Show that has apparently made her something of a household name but I saw her on Hull High a 1990 TV series and never forgot about her. I didn't even know what her name was until I got this DVD so that was a very positive surprise. She's fabulous. Very strong on both looks and personality. And she fits this movie incredibly well because there is a red thread of subtle selfirony that goes all the way through this movie and Datillo has the same sort of attitude while at the same time being a serious and convincing actress and giving a very cool performance.The extra material on the DVD clarifies how incredibly far the producers stretched the budget getting a grand epic and expensivelooking movie out of a meager budget a lot of welldone computer and miniature prop effects and a cheap onlocation shoot in Mexico 30 to have a train speeding by they bought the train drivers lunch!. Very impressive! Considering how difficult it is for the actors to pretend that they're in completely different situations than they really are the performances given must be said to be allround excellent.The movie itself storywise isn't much. For a long time there is no plot other than Datillo's character running around looking for her fianc. As they get embroiled in a centralAmerican revolution with both sides getting weapons supplied by the U.S. the plot picks up somewhat but remains an excuse for the SFX. Technically it's an interesting package but the story really is quite weak. It is saved by Datillo's charisma and the genuinely suspenseful and impressivelooking action scenes. It ends on a kind of critical note in terms of U.S. foreign policy as the rebels are abandoned by their U.S. weapons dealers who decide to back the other side but manage to seize power anyway thus bringing a more democratic government to the country instead of a U.S. controlled puppet government.All in all this movie is and was most likely made as a study of just how impressive a specialeffects spectacular can be created from a very small budget 4.7 million and as such it is quite successful. The DVD cover even claims that it looks like a 100 million movie which in fact is almost true.6 out of 10.".

The story line is there a story line in here? has our frantic Blonde Clair chasing from the perfect surprise weekend in Switzerland to the dry dusty and sometimes tropical banana republic of Coronado. All because her boyfriend lied to her when he said he was going on a business trip to Switzerland. And once in Coronado Clair becomes the centerpiece of a revolution. Sort of a low Budget Romancing the Stone. It is not great it is not really good but it fun. My 13 year old daughter loves it. The film is campy so get out your sleeping bag make some popcorn and enjoy a good B grade adventure flick.".

Actors I have not seen before were impressive in their roles unlike the plastic Hollywood Shakespeareans demanding their closeups. The lead heroine Kristin Dattilo played an excellent role throughout the movie in both comedy barbs and more serious portrayals. I would like to see more of her work in the future as her talent in Coronado was the catalyst in making a fair script into an entertaining movie most armchair warriors relish. If you enjoy special effects as I do in adventure movies you are in for a treat. From a perilous bridge crossing to a remodeling of the Presidential Palace special effects was formidable indeed.

But comparisons fail to take into account that Coronado was made on a 10th of the budget of Sahara which itself was no great film.They've managed to squeeze quite a lot into the film for 4.7million and there is a bridge sequence which works really well. It's just a shame they didn't have more money to get some beter quality actors add a bit more to the script. The story is very predictable with a few twists and turns added it would have been far superior.Fun on a budget nothing original but if you loved Romancing the Stone you'll get some enjoyment out of this. 610".

Actually I would have loved to see more of the adventure Aztec tombs hidden treasures and stuff than the fighting between revolutionaries and junta but it was still okay. Overall the script was well paced had amiable characters was funny at times and never dull or boring.But the editing and effects really are the special thing. They are not overwhelming or breathtakingly spectacular but they have been put to good and subtle use   which is a rare and good thing. Coronado is not a 90 minutes effects orgy where the directors think that 8 cutssecond and a shaky hand camera will create a sense of thrill. The film is not there to display the effects but the effects are there to serve the film  here the hand of the Germans involved in the production may make itself noticeable.  The most memorable stunts the bridge the arrival at the rebel camp are really nicely crafted and keep you on the edge of the seat.Let me be a bit of patriot here After Emmerich went to the States and completely adopted the American style of cinema  not necessarily a good thing IMHO  here we have a new team which gives a wellestablished genre a new own twist. Perhaps finally these are steps to create a German cinema which will be able to compete with Hollywood on its own territory  classical entertainment.I liked every minute of Coronado and I hope the audiences will savour this film as much as I do.P.S.

The subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics  just a cliche. The effects are cheap  and I do not care that the film is low budget  you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. You do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film. 210 on my personal scale. The worst film of the year so far.".

While perhaps not as memorable as Romancing the Stone Coronado is a damn close on the enjoyment level. Best of all Coronado doesn't take it self seriously at all. I groaned at the opening firing squad scene only to lose any reservations in the next scene as our heroine began to tell her story to two guards in a jail. At that point it became obvious really fast that this movie had tongue in cheek and was out to have a good time period. No its not perfect but who cares its fun.I can't recommend this film enough to anyone who wants a confection that may disappear from your mind not long after seeing it but will make you smile while you watch it.8 out of 10 for those who accept this for what it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a badmovie aficionado I was immediately intrigued by the prominent byline on the DVD case boasting about the special effects teamnot the lead actors director or producersthe SFX. I figure this film looks bad the DVD is only 1 and I'll give it a go!This is not a terrible film it was obviously made by professionals. It's competently shot lit and edited it's in focus and the sound effects and dialogue are wellrecorded. The orchestral score by German composer Ralf Wienrich is surprisingly good several cuts above most lowbudget features. The action moves along very well this film is generally entertaining and never downright boring except possibly during the plodding opening credits. The actors do a halfdecent job with heroine Kristin Datillo and dictator John RhysDavies standing out. Reviewers who accuse this film of being the worst ever! belie their unfamiliarity with genuinely boring and incompetentlymade snoozefests by directors such as Coleman Francis. In summary the film is wellmade coherent and fun and the filmmakers obviously knew enough not to take themselves too seriously.The main problem is the script. It's badly clichd overly frenetic not as genuinely funny as the filmmakers want it to be and blatantly contrived to link the SFXladen action sequences together. These factors in themselves aren't fatal as some lowbudget films manage to overcome these flaws. The big problems hit during the movie's second half.The film's first half is your basic McGuffin setup in which stylish California wife Claire Kristin Datillo tries to surprise her fianc Will Michael Lowry on business in Switzerland only to discover that he is actually in the mysterious Central American country of El Coronado and may be involved in an ongoing revolution there. She connects with journalist and adventurer Arnet McClure Clayton Rohner and his cameraman and sidekick go on a quest to find both her lost fianc and the mysterious rebel forces and wind up being pursued by the El Coronado military. Much of the dialogue is silly with numerous oneliners falling flat but this segment of the film is pretty good overall the bridge sequence in particular is very welldone.Then Claire is found by the rebels whose base is hidden in a cavern housing hidden Mayan ruins accessed by flying helicopters through a waterfall!... the shark jumps here.From this point forward the story goes in too many directions at once veering down plot deadends and frequently becoming illogical at best and ridiculous at worst. Our heroine supports the revolution for reasons that never become clearperhaps because the movie would end if she didn't. She finds her fianc who seems set up to be a villain but he never seems very villainous because he gets very little dialogue and then disappears from the story. Rebel commander Sancho Daniel Zacapa is introduced but he never really does anything except behave roguishly charming and rescue Claire when the plot demands it. Rebel leader Rafael Byron Quiros and dictator Presidente Ramos John RhysDavies in the film's funniest performance are introduced however we never learn why the revolution is occurring other than some vague blather about tyranny. OK Rafael is photogenic and gives good inspirational speeches and the Presidente is a pompous buffoonwhich makes one wonder how effective he is at oppressing people.This scattershot plot is accompanied by heavyhanded CGI effects that haven't held up very well and quickly get overwhelming. Any viewers familiar with realworld aircraft and military operations will roll their eyes frequently as the filmmakers disregard basic military tactics and the laws of aerodynamics the film almost seems like outright fantasy towards the end as the director tries to overcome the story's shortcomings by throwing more CGI helicopters tanks and giant torchwielding crowds at the screen. The viewer's disbelief must be suspended VERY high.Older children will be entertained if they don't scoff too much at the dated effects. Fans of bad movies and seekers of cheap and ridiculous entertainment will enjoy it for the sake of laughing at its flaws. Other viewers may want to stay away.One thing this movie has going for it is that it's overthetop tone shtickladen dialogue improbability and ridiculous SFX absolutely beg to be riffed on MST3K The Return Jonah and Joel are you listening?".

	schema:reviewBody "I was drawn to Coronado by its impressive tailer and the subject matter and the movie certainly did not disappoint. Right at the opening credits you're served a treat  Ralf Wienrich's fantastic rousing main theme for Coronado. The opening is worth seeing just for this piece of music. But luckily it's only the start of many great things to come.Coronado is filled with surprising twists. The first of them is the opening premise of a rich woman who decides to after her fianc and ends up in South America in the middle of a revolution. Don't focus too much on this though since this movie is no onetrick pony. Coronado is a skillful blending of a war movie action movie and even an adventure movie in the vein of Indiana Jones. It has many impressive scenes and the plot is filled with twists even right through to the end. And as mentioned the music accompanying it would be worth getting the soundtrack CD on its own.The only major fault that I see in the movie is the 'storytelling' narrative something that seems to have been put in to entertain the supposedly dumb mass viewer. They needlessly try to inject some humor and distance the viewer from the meat of the movie but even these scenes end up serving a purpose.I can't think of any other movie that would make seeing Coronado useless. Coronado is an impressive well thought out movie on its own right and well worth your time.".

The lead actress is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a movie  even worse than JarJar Binks. Dialog tries very hard to be funny almost all the time but it never is. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as for the plot  did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for other than being antigovernment? I guess that didn't matter to anyone  neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield. Don't waste your time. Coronado is neither funny nor entertaining.".

The film needed more of them and Bruce Payne as their boss and less of John RhysDavies who may be a fine actor but here he tries too hard for laughs to little effect.

Only sharpeyed schoolboy Joe Kirby Fowler seems to have noticed but fails to convince a sceptical Detective Inspector Ford Lambert.Undeterred Kirby enlists the help of a gang of bombsitedwelling little cockneys the selfstyled 'Blood and Thunder Boys' to upend the criminals' dastardly plans.

Such a refreshing change from the usual feature films they dredged up for us most of which seemed to date from the early thirties and to be based om motor racing.Having seen it many times since it's difficult now to know what I remember from that first time but I do recall the remark of the sadly missed Joan Dowling when they first descended into the sewers Coo dunnit pong causing great hilarity. Easily pleased or what? Much as I enjoyed reading the reviews here I have to take issue with some. One claims that the lack of swearing among the boy gang indicated some sort of superior morality back in 1946. Actually it was because bad language was simply not permitted in films then and I can assure everyone that in real life there would have been plenty. Another stated that Anthony Newley was in it. He wasn't. I think the reviewer was fooled by the Newleylike looks of Roy played by Stanley Escane. And a third thinks that jumping on the stomach of the chief villain and killing him was a bit strong. I saw the film recently and there is no indication that he was killed merely winded. It was perhaps unpleasant but if anything the scene where the bent cop was catapulted and stunned was worse. That could have killed or blinded him.I was more interested in the review by Robert Temple. I have nothing against the gentleman and he is entitled to his opinion but I feel that some of his comments are misguided and on occasion just plain wrong. He seems for example to read into H and C with its use of bomb sites and derelict buildings some sort of metaphor for WWII but I think he's reading too much into this. The film was made on location in London in 1946 when the makers would have been hard put to it not to include bomb sites. They were an unavoidable backdrop to the action not a part of it though as they existed use was made of them. The film is simply no more than what used to be called a rattling good yarn and thankfully does not contain any 'messages'.Further amid what I have to say is a welter of name dropping Mr Temple not only wrongly thinks that some of the action takes place in Tilbury but also makes a glaring geographical error in placing Tilbury in the East End despite its position in Essex some 12 or 13 miles from the fringes of the East End at East Ham. While there is certainly a Chadwell St Mary in Tilbury this is similarly miles from the scene of the action at the end of the film which is officially at any rate at Wapping and I suspect that Mr Temple has confused Chadwell with Shadwell which is next door to Wapping and therefore does come within the East End.".

A good deal of it really is pretty funny on a laughoutloud level although it's not a comedy as such  the jokes are generally in the throwaway lines and visual gags rather than in the plot as such which is more of a children's adventure story. It's notable to a modern eye that in the 1940s the adolescent heroes of this story are all at work and earning in their midteens there's one sequence at the end where we see what is basically a montage of all the different potential boys' jobs in London from the BBC to the G.P.O. via the icecream trade! The story is the classic Enid BlytonAnthony Buckeridgestyle tale of the overimaginative child who stumbles upon genuine villainy and perceives it in terms of an unsophisticated thriller only for the adults unsurprisingly not to believe a word. The plausibility does get strained a bit when it transpires that all the exotic villains listed in the pulpfiction stories of The Trump are genuine London criminals under the command of the sinister mastermind not to mention the fact that all the authority figures in the film turn out to be in on the plot but it's a good fastmoving production that bears a strong resemblance to children's books of the era and presumably appealed to the same audience. I was actually surprised to find the film unexpectedly sophisticated it offers considerable enjoyment on an adult level and I wonder how many children even at the time would have got all the comic allusions. It is also remarkable as one of the few films of any genre where a vehicle crashes over the edge and doesn't burst into flames!To the modern eye of course the location shooting also offers a fascinating document of a world that has all but utterly disappeared from Covent Garden to the postwar bombsites and a society that has gone with it from bus conductors to milkcarts. Alistair Sim has an entertaining cameo as a timid writer of thrilling tales but the film is mainly carried by the boys who are by and large very natural in their acting style. Harry Fowler in the lead is particularly good.This is a wellmade little film that plays tricks with its genre and with its audience's expectations and deserves a wider reputation I knew it only from a few seconds' montage in a documentary on Ealing Studios and it is far less widely available than their famous later output. The Ealing film of which I was reminded most closely  perhaps because of a similar setting  was actually Passport to Pimlico although this is clearly pitched at a younger audience.".

This is where I get my Angels with Dirty Faces connection from.A few disgruntled viewers say that Hue  Cry lacks focus and central characters.

But seen as the first Ealing comedy proper the Studio is still finding its feet and is gathering talented people to direct Charles Chricton who directed many BIG Ealings screenwriters T.E.B Clarke who is synonymous with Ealing and one very accomplished cinematographer Douglas Slocombe who here manages some Hitchcockian imagery  such as on a spiral staircase and in a room full of circus dummies. Otherwise it's brisk the camera darting about with a film score every bit as vibrant as the escapades.Noone ever though denies the pull and special attraction of Alistair Sim as the eccentric Comic strip creator a Scroogelike hermit living at the top of those scary stairs. That he isn't on screen very much just happens to be one of those things relish him when he is on that's all you can do.The story now to an adult takes second fiddle  lots of boyish conspiracies and such avoiding the police and the occasional fight. Something about a missing page in their favourite comic and they have to use passwords and such getting caught in gangster Jack Warner's wide boy gangsterish crook as far cry from his beloved Dixon of Dock Green!. It is the sights  and sounds  of an almost alien London only a generation ago that makes it all so watchable  and enjoyable. Unlike today with our comparatively lazy and health and safety pampered youth these boy actors literally pour gusto and energy into everything swarming over a rubbled landscape like herds of buffalo in a western.The sound is often a bit thin and distorted but the picture quality not as bad as it could be a little lacking in punch perhaps but surprisingly blemishfree.".

	schema:headline " A wonderfully imaginative film about street kids in bombedout London";
	schema:reviewBody "The word 'hue' is Middle English derived from Old French and means 'to shout or make an outcry'. 'Hue and cry' derives from the AngloNorman French dialect of a thousand years ago 'hu e cri' and describes the outcry made to call for the pursuit of a felon or the pursuit itself of such a criminal. By extension it came later to be applied to the noise blown horn and shouting made when English hunters and their hounds spotted a fox and set off in pursuit of it. At the time this film was made 'hue and cry' was a phrase known to everyone in England and was frequently used in conversation. It only died out in the 1980s. Before that if there were a big fuss in the press over some political issue people would say 'What a hue and cry there has been in the papers today about the Prime Minister's policy' or if justice were not seen to be done they would say 'They have set up a terrible hue and cry over that issue recently in legal circles'. In other words by the 1960s 'make a hue and cry' had come to mean 'make a loud fuss'. It was a phrase that was used daily all over the country for decades but is now as forgotten as the dodo since most of the people who used it as a common expression are dead and they did not perpetuate this usage amongst their children who viewed it as oldfashioned and dropped it. This film was shot on location in 1946 in London and gives mindboggling views of the extent of the ruins left after the wartime bombing. Anyone familiar with London simply gasps with disbelief at shot after shot of rubble and collapsed buildings in which this gang of street kinds regularly play. The ruins are as extreme as those of bombedout Germany which were shown in the newsreels and recur in documentaries about the War today. Seeing how extensive the devastation of London really was brings the issue of the British Bomber Command into better focus and reminds us that the decision to bomb the German cities as flat as pancakes had something to do with rage. War is war you know a point often forgotten in our spoilt age of today. People today seem to think that war can be fought remotely with drones or that war is something which takes place in distant deserts and mountains. But take the contemporary American outrage at 911 and multiply it by a thousand and you will get some idea of how the British felt about the Germans and many still do 'bloody Krauts now running the European Union as a Fourth Reich!' as I have heard it said. So this film has an importance far beyond its story line which is a charming one about children bringing criminals to justice and setting up a hue and cry about them when the police can and will do nothing. The one portion of the story which is really rather silly is the character of the writer of children's' comics played in an overthetop doddering fashion by Alastair Sim. That was terribly overdone and the excess of whimsy makes one queasy. The story involves children's comics being doctored to carry instructions to real criminal gangs for their next robberies hence the children figuring it out and taking action. The British have always been inclined to believe that secret coded messages were carried in their newspapers. Harry Jonas the artist and Walter Sickert's illegitimate son whose name I have now forgotten used to tell me that the secret to Jack the Ripper's identity had been revealed in the crossword puzzles carried by the Daily Mail which was also used to convey coded instructions to British secret agents. They believed all of this absolutely and I have met others who did. The Americans thus do not have a monopoly on paranoia and conspiracy theories as these were widespread in Britain long before they became fashionable in the USA. Here we have an entire film released in 1947 based upon one and a semicomedy at that. This film an Ealing production is often called the first Ealing comedy. I would not call it a comedy per se but it has a definite comic side to it. Nor would I call it a fantasy film as the setting and the kids are too 'real' for that. Many of the kids do brilliantly especially the one tough street girl amongst the gang of boys played by the truly inspired actress Joan Dowling in her very first screen role at the age of 17 she died at the age of 26. These kids represent the authentic Cockney tradition of the East End of London with their selfreliance cheekiness irreverence and daring and much of the action takes place at Chadwell near Tilbury in the East End. An ancestor of mine lived at the manor house of Chadwell called 'The Long House' in the seventeenth century when it was all farms strangely enough. But it subsequently became a Cockney slum area when London expanded in the 19th century. The film is superbly directed except for the Alastair Sim sections by Charles Crichton whose last film which he directed at the age of 78 was the hilarious hit A FISH CALLED WANDA 1988. He also directed part of the great classic film TRAIN OF EVENTS 1949 see my review and my comments there about the spectacularly brilliant actress Joan Dowling mentioned above and is famous for THE LAVENDER HILL MOB 1951. Another extraordinary aspect of this film is the section where the kids wander through the London sewer system which I have never encountered in any other British film. Everything about this film makes it worth watching and certainly enjoyable for anyone who does not require continuous 'smash bang' on a drip.".

	onyx:emotionText "The word 'hue' is Middle English derived from Old French and means 'to shout or make an outcry'. 'Hue and cry' derives from the AngloNorman French dialect of a thousand years ago 'hu e cri' and describes the outcry made to call for the pursuit of a felon or the pursuit itself of such a criminal. By extension it came later to be applied to the noise blown horn and shouting made when English hunters and their hounds spotted a fox and set off in pursuit of it.

The film is interesting because of all the stillevident bomb damage from the blitz. It's all about a group of precocious kidsone in particular.

However when the gang get wind of this they turn the table on the kids and now the police won't believe their wild story about secret codes and robberies. So it's up to the kids to take the law in their own hands and save the day in one of the more rousing finales I've seen in a long time.Excellent and original this one is well worth a look due to clever writing as well as an ending that is very hard to forget.".

Many of them were already earning their bread because the times were hard and many families had lost their men in the war.

Apart from cinemagoing the only source of popular entertainment they had were comics. That was the golden era of the Eighth Art. The film benefits from a very imaginative script. The implausible story is yet engaging and has moments of fine suspense Kirby sneaking into the furrier's shop to inspect the suspiciouslooking crates he and Alec creeping up the staircase to Alistair Sim's flat his realisation of the mastermind villain's identity and the final confrontation at the bombed office block by the river. A fantastic cast of talented youngsters humour suspense lots of excitement and a marvellous Alistair Sim in a tenminute appearance that nevertheless plays a key role in the story. A film that may look very outdated now but still great fun to watch and definitely a landmark in British postwar cinema.".

I can hear them now in Film 'schools' the length and breadth of the land 'explaining' how to 'read' this as a metaphor for an England who had just won  with a little help from their friends  a major war against Germany aided by their cracking of the 'Enigma' code. I doubt whether screenwriter Tibby Clarke had anything more meaningful than a paycheque in mind when he dreamed up this yarn in which a group of unsophisticated teenagers without an 'O' level between them uncover a plot involving a weekly comic book for boys which villains use to communicate details of proposed robberies.

I can hear them now in Film 'schools' the length and breadth of the land 'explaining' how to 'read' this as a metaphor for an England who had just won  with a little help from their friends  a major war against Germany aided by their cracking of the 'Enigma' code. I doubt whether screenwriter Tibby Clarke had anything more meaningful than a paycheque in mind when he dreamed up this yarn in which a group of unsophisticated teenagers without an 'O' level between them uncover a plot involving a weekly comic book for boys which villains use to communicate details of proposed robberies.

Because almost everyone enjoyed a caricature in those days there is the larger than life Alistair Sim to provide that added dimension of playful eccentricity in the person of the innocent writer who is completely unaware of the use to which his stories are being put.

On the way Kirby encounters a variety of lowlife characters including good time girl Rhona Valerie White crooked shopowner Jago Paul Demel and a spiv Joey Carr. Yet Joe emerges triumphant not least because he is assisted by a large gang of youngsters including Scot Alec Douglas Barr and Rhona's workcolleague Norman Ian Dawson. The film contains a memorable cameo from Alastair Sim as Felix H. Wilkinson a scatterbrained writer of lurid popular fiction who tries to charm Joe with a glass of ginger pop but is eventually blackmailed by the teenager into helping solve the crime.Perhaps the film's greatest asset however is the way in which director Charles Crichton uses the locations of wartorn London to tell his story. The Blood and Thunder boys have their hideout in a bombedout building full of secret corners and ruined beams for them to play in. As they pursue Rhona along the London streets we understand how shabby the city looked at the time of filming with very few commodities for sale in the shops. The city was also highly socially stratified with stark contrasts between the poky terraced houses where Joe's family live and the expansively appointed detached houses in the suburbs most of which received comparatively little damage during the Blitz. On the other hand London was much quieter at that time very few cars adorned the streets and horsedrawn carts were still very much in evidence used mostly by tradespeople.Despite its basic good humor HUE AND CRY offers a radical vision for postwar Britain. It suggests that the old social order where children should be seen and not heard has collapsed anyone can now achieve their aims so long as they are prepared to fight for them. Director Crichton also suggests that postwar London is also a center of petty crime a combination of stringent rationing and lack of availability of fancy goods provided a rich huntingground for black marketeers such as Nightingale. Yet perhaps people had a right to expect something more  after all they had just spend six long years fighting for their freedom. Crichton offers the possibility of a solution by showing the children triumphing  perhaps youth will help to usher in a brave new world of prosperity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Darkness prevails already at the very beginning of 'La Moustache' Emmanuel Carrre's proper adaptation of his novel of the same title which he published back in the 1980's. Accompanying the opening credits is Philip Glass' perfectly composed and utterly gloomy Violin Concerto which reemerges throughout the movie and constantly supplies the global atmosphere of the film with an ominous and bewildering touch. Welcome to this year's most abstruse film and eventually the most challenging psychological experiment since 'The Machinist'. Presented at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival in the 'Quinzaine des Ralisateurs' category  a category promoting abstract and rather unusual movies  'La Moustache' follows the intricate story of Marc Thiriez Vincent Lindon an ordinary Parisian architect who slips into a vicious identity crisis after he spontaneously shaves off his moustache. How would you react if I shaved off my moustache? Marc asks his girlfriend Agns Emmanuelle Devos before they visit some friends for dinner. Her reaction is not immediate and she simply replies I don't know I love you with it but I've never known you without it. So while Agns leaves the apartment for a short time to do some shopping Marc takes the risk and cuts off his beloved moustache just like that in order to see his lover's face and analyze her reaction when she returns home. However Marc will be severely disappointed upon Agns' arrival she does not utter one single word. She seems not to notice the major physical change in Marc's face. Nor do their friends. Even Marc's colleagues at the office fail to perceive the absence of his moustache. Is he on the verge of madness? Or has he become the target of a massive conspiracy triggered by his own girlfriend? More weirdly did he even ever have a moustache? Or was it part of some unexplainable imagination? Marc has no clue at all how to react to his baffling new situation When you enter the official movie website a big question mark appears at the end of the flash intro. This question mark is totally appropriate since it clearly illustrates what kind of movie 'La Moustache' really is namely a confusing puzzling drama with an open ending and a number of unexplainable twists flashbacks and mysterious appearances by characters when you least expect it. What is 'La Moustache' about? is the first question of a recent online interview conducted with Emmanuel Carrre. The director himself has no answer to that crucial question. Indeed 'La Moustache' is one of these attentiongrabbing cinematic mysteries that first baffle the spectators and then leave them behind with a bunch of questions unanswered. There are though in this ingeniously structured and passionately filmed movie some easily detectable themes. For once 'La Moustache' is an analysis of a dysfunctional couple tumbling into a conflict driven by mistrust. Marc soon accuses Agns of plotting against him but Agns is deeply persuaded that Marc has in fact never had a moustache. This marks the beginning of a series of violent arguments and disputes. Moreover Carrre's film closely focuses on a man struggling with the inevitable loss of his personal identity. Marc is unable to distinguish between reality and imagination and so he struggles hard to uncover the origins of the problem. He is a man all on his own against the rest of the world. In his apartment he finds some old pictures from a vacation in Bali all of them showing him with a moustache. But is he really the only one to see it? Is the moustache on this photo real or not? He does not know and we do not either. Especially the first part of 'La Moustache' is intensely compelling and dark examining the relationship between Marc and Agns and closely focusing on Marc's progressive battle to keep his emotional and moral nature under control. When his consciousness slowly begins to shut down the tension mounts as the suspense grows and the atmosphere becomes more and more threatening. Carrre has a brilliant vision and he captures Marc's way into madness in a diverse and appealing way. Marc is the perfect role for Vincent Lindon whose look is continually as puzzling as the story itself. He masters his role with ideal perfection always acting authentically. The same can be said about the brilliant Emmanuelle Devos 'La Femme de Gilles' who delivers an enigmatic performance as Agns. Her complex character is a true object of curiosity and no one can trust her. Is she the evil woman ruining the mind of her partner? Or is she the reasonable person? Question marks  gogo. The last twenty minutes of 'La Moustache' which follow Marc to Bangkok where he repetitively embarks and disembarks ferries all day long are quite debatable yet very challenging. The film reaches yet another climax takes another abrupt twist and once again challenges us spectators by sparking our curiosity. Please do not expect a satisfying explanation towards the very ending because 'La Moustache' ain't going to give you one. Many pieces of the puzzle remain untraceable but that's exactly what makes this masterpiece so intriguing and unique. Grade B".

The film reminded me another French film I saw in the theatre recently by the name of Cache which I enjoyed very much. As for it's American counterpart I suppose that you'd be looking at something like Lost Highway David Lynch's bizarre account of a modern urban couple trying to grapple with the unknown. This seems to be something of a genre for the French and they are quite good at pulling it off  as is evidenced with this film  with considerable style and enough depth of plot and character to leave you considering and reconsidering the film for far more than the sadly customary 10 minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "When I was reading the description of this movie for the Sydney Film Festival I was instantly intrigued and I certainly was not let down as it lived both up to this description and my expectation of it.The premise is delightfully simple a man trims off his moustache after discussing the possibility with his partner and after he does so she seems adamant that she never had one in the first place. The entire first half of the film is centred around the conflict that follows and because of its simplicity I think it is the strongest part of the film. At first it is utterly engaging because of the way Marc responds to everyone's apprent disinterest in his new appearance. He is genuinely upset when his friends and particularly his wife do not respond to the change. I thought that it was an effective insight into relationships on the part of Carrere showing how such a small thing can become such a big issue for a couple. The other feature of the first part of the film was the story regarding the radiator which sets up the possibility that this could be an elaborate hoax. Though from the naturalistic perspective the movie takes it is absurd to think that his wife and friends could have orchestrated the entire affair it is to Carrere's credit that the possibility is always niggling at the audience.The progression to the second half of the movie set in Hong Kong was somewhat jarring. The trips on the boat though furthering nicely the interesting water motif that permeated the film got slightly repetitive before the final twist at the end. However the appearance of his wife in his hotel room quickly makes one forget this and really allows the audience to form their own opinion on the matter is this the dillusion of a troubled man or the sick game of a strange wife. The film was excellently written and directed and the music was inoffensive but effective. My only quibble was the quality of some parts of the movie but I think this may have been a problem with the reel that was used. All in all it was a highly enjoyable movie for those who don't like to always know what's going on but most enjoyment can be yielded from it if one appreciates the insights into relationships shown here and not just into continuity of appearance.".

You'll try to think about what you see and try to solve this whole strange piece of art. Its about the choices that we make small choices as to deceide yes or no to cut the moustache and what are the consequences on our life and the impact toward us by the people we know. Am I important to their eyes even if they are called friends will they notify any difference on our life. It's also about the search of our identity and how our identity becomes the one of the other in a relashionship with a lover. You choose what ever is the meaning of this movie but I believe the director has it's own precise explanation about every detail. I have my own I think most of the movie is imagination of the character and the only reality scenes are the ones where he walks everyday in the metro of HongKong depressed after his wife would have left him during the vacations in HongKong where he shave his moustache. Even those vacations are a little bit transformed mentally by the reconstitution it's a flashback and all the scenes in Paris are imagination of a life he would have had with his wife if they would have stayed together with constantly rethinking of his choice of shaving the moustache. It's like Hanneke's Cach or more like Lynch's Mulholland Drive. We travel into the infinite spiral of the human spirit everything is interior and subjective. The music of Philip Glass is sublime and will obsess you. You won't forget this movie even if you don't like it.".

The movie is seen through Marc's perspective which makes it difficult to discern reality from his bouts of schizophrenic hallucinations. At some points the movie reminds me of Lost Highway in the manner with which it represented the split of the protagonist or rather a metamorphosis into two different characters. In La Moustache the split happens at the level of the life of the protagonist his world is constantly subjected to transformations while he more or less stays the same. However in LH we can discern the true part of the protagonist from his imagined part. That distinction is impossible in La Moustache  we don't know where his madness starts and where it ends. He is a total mess and it is upon this ambiguity that everything we see is built.All in all this movie was a really nice surprise that I highly enjoyed and that I recommend for fans of Lynch Cronenberg and psychological thrillersdramas.".

Architect Marc Vincent Lindon has had a moustache since he was knee high to a blueprint and it is he feels part of him then he takes it into his head to speculate on just how much he is identified via the moustache. He starts by asking his livein lover Agnes Manu Devos whether she would still fancy him sans moustache since she's only known him with it she can't answer. So out comes the razor and THEN comes the uneasiness that segues into genuine fright. Not only does Devos not notice the difference but neither do their friends and his colleagues at work.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is a prime example of how the simplest things can mushroom out of control. Architect Marc Vincent Lindon has had a moustache since he was knee high to a blueprint and it is he feels part of him then he takes it into his head to speculate on just how much he is identified via the moustache. He starts by asking his livein lover Agnes Manu Devos whether she would still fancy him sans moustache since she's only known him with it she can't answer. So out comes the razor and THEN comes the uneasiness that segues into genuine fright. Not only does Devos not notice the difference but neither do their friends and his colleagues at work. We are now on the fringes of a Kafkaesque scenario which isn't really resolved satisfactorily.

Nearly all of Dick's work concerned the shifting nature of Identity and the ontological basis for Reality. This movie examines the possibility of Changeshaving a moustache and the impact on a life. In a sense the film is kind of a Black Comedy in that such a minor adjustment would not seem to lead to such dislocation. But that is not the case in La Moustache. The movie begs all kinds of bizarre interpretations so don't expect an easy ride from this French 'Chinese Puzzle' of a film".

So if you want to enjoy the mystery first then stop right now...and come back after you've seen the film.The title is classic misdirection by writers. This story has nothing specific to do with a moustache. It is merely a symbol used to highlight the idea of identity and more particularly the extent to which a husband and wife are aware of each other.The story is as follows the fade in opens with a successful Parisian businessman Marc Thiriez Vincent Lindon shaving off his moustache while having a bath. When confronting his wife Agnes Emmanuelle Devos she fails to evince any surprise. Somewhat puzzled  because only a few moments prior Agnes had said how much she liked his moustache  Marc says nothing but continues on to a dinner engagement to Serge and Nadia Schaeffer Mathieu Amalric and Marcha Polikarpova where they all say nothing about his new look. Later suspecting a trick Marc confronts Agnes at their apartment where she categorically denies Marc has ever had a moustache...Oooops!Dumbfounded Marc has a troubled sleep but goes to work the next morning convinced that Agnes and their socalled friends are out to get him for some unknown reason. At the office and the nearby coffee shop  where Marc has dined all too often  the same situation persists nobody makes any comment about the absence of his moustache.Hence for Marc the puzzle worsens...He begins to panic he searches for the remains of his moustache in the garbage he seeks confirmation from a stranger that a photo from a 2003 holiday in Bali shows him with a moustache. But later that day he asks Agnes to cancel a lunch with his parents  and she replies that his father died a year earlier! Questioning her further Marc realizes with mounting horror that she cannot even recall their friends Serge and Nadia!What's going on here? Am I crazy thinks Marc? Confused and shattered he falls into a stupor and sleeps again allowing Agnes to slip a knockout Mickey Finn to him. Hours later he wakes to hear Agnes and Bruno Hippolyte Giradou his office associate discussing plans to have him committed to an asylum. Frantic Marc runs off to find his parents but is unable to contact them and calls Agnes to meet him while watching from a taxi. After she leaves with Bruno Marc quickly gets his passport a coat and money and goes to the airport where he boards a flight for...Hong Kong!When he gets there he wanders around a bit alternately ferrying from Hong Kong to Kowloon and back a few times  a great metaphor for his indecision  then pays his way onto a coastal trader to finally wind up at an unnamed coastal village. He wanders off from the boat and ends up at a rundown hotel where he pays for a room and falls asleep exhausted...Okay  stop right here all of the above is Marc's dream  or nightmare I guess.The next real scene we see Marc unshaven with many weeks growth wolfing down noodles at a local restaurant. After the meal he wanders back to the hotel where he finds and as the viewer we also find Agnes packing their bags to return to Paris. She tells him to shave off his growing beard and suggests he also remove his moustache. When he does so she remarks how much it suits him. They go to bed they make love she sleeps. Marc lies there for a long while eyes closed. Then he opens his eyes wide blankly and silently screaming am I awake or is this a dream? Fade to black...So here's the real story Marc and Agnes are on holiday near Hong Kong where he hopes to resurrect what he thinks is their dead or dying marital and sexual relationship. One night he has a nightmare about his innermost fears and desires. The next morning fortuitously Agnes suggests he change his image more or less in keeping with his prior dream and so he does. Happily for Marc she actually notices the difference and things appear to be better. Unhappily however aspects of his dream remain most particularly a post card that he wrote out in his dream. Or did he?Hence when Marc stares into the darkness is it truly reality? This is where the writerdirector weaves two fundamental issues together first there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him  which generates the bizarre dream set in Paris while they are both on holiday in China and second there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself. As the final scene very slowly fades to black the camera fixes on Marc's troubled eyes the unspoken question screaming at us am I in a dream now or have I woken up? So does Agnes truly love me or no?That's for you and all of us to decide...When you see the movie watch out for the clues that tell you it's all a dream as the credits roll there are city lights on dark water  water heavily connoting sex  with a sampan just in view a long column of lights from skyscraper  a phallic symbol much repeated later in the story the photos from Bali every lover's dream destination.

	schema:reviewBody "One day a middleaged architect of Paris suddenly cuts off his mustache but his surrounding claim he has never had one. Somebody is wrong and since nobody shares his opinion he has to escape to Hongkong from the forced mental treatment. Here in the meantime he cuts again his regrown mustache and because this time the change was recognized by his wife they again find each other. What is this film all about? Perhaps about the importance of the everyday matters of no significance which can still somehow ruin our life. About whether we really know each other listen to each other or even our closest relationships are superficial? Or are we a witness of a disintegration of an instable personality? There is a shortstory with the same title Moustache written by the French novelist Maupassant in 1883 which can elucidate a different way of interpretation. The story is a real ode to the mustache by a fictitious lady. But one can read about other interesting things in that letter  And mainly I adore mustache because it is French pureblooded French wear. We inherited it from our Gallic ancestors and deserve it like the symbol of our national character. From this point the saucy mustache of our hero becomes the last symbol of a national identity. He and his wife live a life of a typical citizen of a Western world in the multicultural Paris. They prefer sushi to French food travel Bali for holiday and buy Chinese dresses and trinkets in Hongkong. His close surrounding his wife and his friends do not even notice the change caused by the disappearance of his mustache but from an objective point of view policewoman the difference is obvious. The past is coming to an end which is presented by the death of his father and the vain search of the house of his childhood. This necessarily leads to the development of a split personality is it himself who is insane or the others? Is he a victim of a conspiracy or is he suffer from persecution mania? The neverending ferryboat journey between two coasts representing a loss of his footing and the spin of the drum of a washing machine in his dream head becomes a symbol of a brainwash. This film is a story about a man who has lost his national identity and if there is a chance to get it back. There is no answer but perhaps he has to travel to the other part of the world to make even his wife understand yes there is something what we have lost but it is good as it is. Still the last picture is quite worrying a man without a mustache is lying in a dark sleeplessness like in a grave.".

About whether we really know each other listen to each other or even our closest relationships are superficial? Or are we a witness of a disintegration of an instable personality? There is a shortstory with the same title Moustache written by the French novelist Maupassant in 1883 which can elucidate a different way of interpretation. The story is a real ode to the mustache by a fictitious lady. But one can read about other interesting things in that letter  And mainly I adore mustache because it is French pureblooded French wear. We inherited it from our Gallic ancestors and deserve it like the symbol of our national character. From this point the saucy mustache of our hero becomes the last symbol of a national identity. He and his wife live a life of a typical citizen of a Western world in the multicultural Paris. They prefer sushi to French food travel Bali for holiday and buy Chinese dresses and trinkets in Hongkong. His close surrounding his wife and his friends do not even notice the change caused by the disappearance of his mustache but from an objective point of view policewoman the difference is obvious. The past is coming to an end which is presented by the death of his father and the vain search of the house of his childhood. This necessarily leads to the development of a split personality is it himself who is insane or the others? Is he a victim of a conspiracy or is he suffer from persecution mania? The neverending ferryboat journey between two coasts representing a loss of his footing and the spin of the drum of a washing machine in his dream head becomes a symbol of a brainwash. This film is a story about a man who has lost his national identity and if there is a chance to get it back. There is no answer but perhaps he has to travel to the other part of the world to make even his wife understand yes there is something what we have lost but it is good as it is. Still the last picture is quite worrying a man without a mustache is lying in a dark sleeplessness like in a grave.";

Tricked by the style that doesn't clue you into its intentions causing you to walk away unsatisfied.

At first I thought I'd missed something when the film endedthere were just too many dangling plot points and things that just confused me. So I watched the making of featurette on the DVD and one of the main characters confided that she read the script and she was also confused and it made no sense. Some people might like this and normally I don't mind a film that leaves unanswered questions but this goes way beyond this to just confusing and...well stupid. It took a film that might have earned a 7 or 8 and made it at best a 4.Decent acting but a bad script sink this film. But like so many subpar films the DVD case made it sound amazing and worthwhile with phrases like A paranoid thriller in the manner of Alfred Hitchcock or ...a minimasterwork. Yeah right. The film had little to do with Hitchcock's style and comparisons to Hitchcock are a dime a dozen. Many of Chabrol's films even his bad ones are also often compared to Hitchcock's and I'm getting sick of this disingenuous advertising. One of the very few films that might really deserve this comparison is the original LES DIABOLIQUES. In contrast LA MOUSTACHE seemed about as Hitchcockian as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III!".

The question is was it wise from Carrre to do himself the job? Because without being a total failure his work is a very mixed one. Someone like Roman Polanski or Dominik Moll the man responsible for Harry Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien 2000 would have been the man for the job.To surprise his wife Emmanuelle Devos and friends Marc Vincent Lindon decides to shave his mustache and amazingly noone notices it. Worse his wife goes to claim that he's never had a mustache. Who's right and wrong? How will things evolve from here? The material was promising and let predict a terrific eerie film. You can see what motivated Carrre to shoot his piece of work an irrational absurd feud of a couple for a trivial detail which causes its disintegration. If the mystery remains open until the very last pictures and by opting for a deliberately sparse cinematographic writing especially relying on gestures and looks rather than words Carrre doesn't properly handle the unnerving climate such a bizarre story could convey and some keysequences are unsatisfying notably when Devos screams to her husband you have never had a mustache. The dramatic progression isn't really mastered to be convincingly taken in the absurd spiral that eats up the couple. Without mentioning a flimsy end from the moment when Marc flies to Hong Kong and roams there for a long time before landing in a lowly hotel. His spouse finds him back there. How could she know he was there?It's such an underwhelming menu that you don't want to think about it after the screening. Is Marc's wife right? Doesn't she play a shady game with her husband? What does she think of the evidence found by Marc where he can prove he's had a mustache? Actually one doesn't bother about these questions.

	schema:reviewBody "La Moustache opens with a man thinking about possibly shaving his moustache. There are theories in both spiritual and scientific circles that postulate that whenever we make a decision like this we in fact make them both. We filter out the decision that we didn't make and continue to live our normal seeminglylinear life but another reality exists just as real as this one in which we made the other decision.To understand this movie in a multipletimeline context we have to back up to the beginning of the main character's adult life before the movie starts in which he made the decision to grow a moustache at all. In timeline A he never grew one in timeline B he always grew one since he could. The movie thus begins in timeline B. To keep things simple let's pretend there are only these two timelines to worry about.The movie opens with the main character making the decision to shave his moustache. In one reality timeline B he keeps it. We don't see this reality for the next week or so of his life. Instead the decision to shave his moustache is so jarring that he jumps to timeline A or more accurately he jumps to timeline A but elements of timeline B are still known to him such as the photographs of his vacation the license in his wallet and his overall consciousness and memories are still from timeline B. Most of the movie however takes place in timeline A.The fact that he is caught between timelines is psychologically disturbing to him and his wife neither of whom understand the predicament he is in and assume that he is either going crazy or as he assumes at times someone may be playing an elaborate prank on him.Overhearing that his wife might send him to a mental institution he escapes to Hong Kong. He immediately misses his wife and writes a postcard to her that he will be back by the time she gets it but doesn't mail it. He takes a ferry from the city side to the airport side of a river but before boarding the plane changes his mind again and goes back on the ferry. Then he keeps on going back and forth across the ferry until the end of the day when it closes. He never does go back to the airport.The ferry riding is a very interesting element in the film. A decision  the decision to shave his moustache was done hastily in the beginning of the film. Again another decision to not get on the plane and get back on the ferry was made quickly. Was he perhaps trying to trick time into getting him back into the right timeline? Or is the ferry simply a way to experience the same space over and over again  a sameness  that is in fact different every time every time he rides the ferry there are new people and he sits in a different place etc. Even the chairs on the ferry seem to have adjustable backs on them that can swing one way or another so that the rider can make a decision to face backwards or forwards. Only the ticket seller is the same and she never seems to recognize him or wonder why he is riding back and forth Normally we experience sameness e.g. going to work that can seem very much the same every time same coworkers similar work etc. and the ferry is a break from that. Or does the ferry between the city and the airport represent his state of betweenness of the timelines? He doesn't want to go back to France where they might put him in an institution but he doesn't want to go to his Hong Kong hotel where he will be missing his wife. He decides to stay between for this day and he seems content in this betweenness. He doesn't seem that nervous or worried on the ferry. He is cordial even smiling to teenage schoolgirls that are giggling at him. He is learning to be OK with betweenness.The movie then jumps to what seems like days later or perhaps even longer and the main character now has a moustache grown out. The moustache being present is the catalyst to get him back to timeline B and when he gets back to his hotel his wife his there and it is as if she has been there the whole time with him on vacation.That night he asks if she would like to see him without a moustache and she says that she might like to have him try it. This is a different answer than at the opening of the movie where she says that she has never seen him without it and she doesn't seem to be that into the idea of him shaving it. He shaves the moustache but stays in timeline B. Perhaps this time the move is not so jarring because he has done it before. Or perhaps it is because his wife seems more approving this time while they are happy on vacation. Or perhaps it is because he has learned to live in and accept betweenness after his experience on the ferry. All is well. Or is it? As the lights dim in the room the viewer is wondering if he will wake up in timeline A all alone.".

Or is the ferry simply a way to experience the same space over and over again  a sameness  that is in fact different every time every time he rides the ferry there are new people and he sits in a different place etc. Even the chairs on the ferry seem to have adjustable backs on them that can swing one way or another so that the rider can make a decision to face backwards or forwards. Only the ticket seller is the same and she never seems to recognize him or wonder why he is riding back and forth Normally we experience sameness e.g. going to work that can seem very much the same every time same coworkers similar work etc. and the ferry is a break from that. Or does the ferry between the city and the airport represent his state of betweenness of the timelines? He doesn't want to go back to France where they might put him in an institution but he doesn't want to go to his Hong Kong hotel where he will be missing his wife. He decides to stay between for this day and he seems content in this betweenness. He doesn't seem that nervous or worried on the ferry. He is cordial even smiling to teenage schoolgirls that are giggling at him. He is learning to be OK with betweenness.The movie then jumps to what seems like days later or perhaps even longer and the main character now has a moustache grown out. The moustache being present is the catalyst to get him back to timeline B and when he gets back to his hotel his wife his there and it is as if she has been there the whole time with him on vacation.That night he asks if she would like to see him without a moustache and she says that she might like to have him try it. This is a different answer than at the opening of the movie where she says that she has never seen him without it and she doesn't seem to be that into the idea of him shaving it. He shaves the moustache but stays in timeline B. Perhaps this time the move is not so jarring because he has done it before. Or perhaps it is because his wife seems more approving this time while they are happy on vacation. Or perhaps it is because he has learned to live in and accept betweenness after his experience on the ferry. All is well. Or is it? As the lights dim in the room the viewer is wondering if he will wake up in timeline A all alone.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hello viewer. I watched this movie as it was tagged with Mystery amongst others. I like mystery and don't mind additional tags such as drama at all. I regret watching it  wasting time. I'll explain in a moment.First the facts. The movie is about a man in his midlife years who shaves off his mustache yet nobody notices the difference. In fact everybody claims he didn't have a mustache for the past 15 years. Even though we see physical evidence such as recent pictures. We even see him shaving off his mustache. From here on our star sinks into a life of confusion and mental agony.I can't help revealing the end to outline the criticism I have. The end basically leaves us in an ambiguous state. Was it all real? Is he going crazy first signs of Alzheimer midlife crisis? We do not receive any answers and that is absolutely unforgivable. Because a potential big reveal is all the movie had going for.The pace is slow  to end up with nothing. With that I mean that much of the time spent is for our star to ask around if they notice any difference. We got the message after twenty minutes but it kept dragging on. This movie could have been easily shortened by fifty percent and it still would have retained its main narrative of ambiguity.So there it is one sits through this slow movie only to be left with zero answers. The plot is that you have to make up your own reasons. I'm sorry but that will simply not do.I have two good things to say about the movie. First being the music. Philip Morris Glas' nihilistic classic music is really nice if you like classic music. For this movie it reminded me a bit of Vivaldi's Spring. Whilst liking this one may complain that it's too heavy and the complaint might be justified indeed. The second thing I appreciate is the decent camerajob. The budget was only about five million Euros yet we were not treated with shaky handycam like so many lowish budget films do. Lighting angles lenses it all was more or less OK. Meaning watching the movie was mostly easy on the eye.For the good things I rated the movie three stars. The lack of context and answers truly infuriated me. It's not that I desperately need answers but I have been given absolutely nothing. For example John Carpenters' The Thing leaves us in an ambiguous state of the fate of the two survivors. But the ending is satisfying nevertheless because no matter what those two are in deep trouble. Also what happened wasn't their imagination it all was real. So no mystery there. Such context was not the case with La Moustache. Sorry to be this negative but the truth is I think that this movie was a standard project to bait the kind of critics who love deep movies. And it worked for example it won the Directors' Fortnight Award. It's not much but that's how the game works.".

However a white girl seeing a clever black man is never going to be popular and the couple must overcome many obstacles to see their dreams and be true to themselves.Did someone say a black Dirty Dancing?'  Essentially that's what this is although the story is naturally a bit more urban than that film.  The story is about overcoming to reach your dreams and it does it quite well  better than I expected.  The love story is nice without being too romanticised. The obstacles are the usual things in an urban' film  the challenge of mixed race relationships the temptation to back up your crew instead of getting out etc.  These are quite cliched but are still well done.My main problem came with the strength of black culture in the filmnot every black person even in a poor area talks like a gangstaand not everyone says aiiiirite'  and why did Sara only become accepted when she started to imitate black culture and speak in that way.  It may be realistic but I felt that Sara should have been allowed to be herself rather than be seen to be assimilated into the hiphop culture I don't mean that she shouldn't have got involved with the scene  but did she have to lose part of herself to get there?.  However these are minor side issues that many people won't even think about.The cast are good for MTV teens.  Julia Stiles is cool and Thomas is cute and charming.  The rest of the cast fall into so many black stereotypes  we have gangsta friend baby mothers galore useless baby father jealous bitchy exgirlfriends etc.  However they are just what you expect so I wasn't too upset.  Fredro Starr was cool as Malakai  even if the character was just one big hood clich.The soundtrack is hot and the dance scenes are sexy  I wish I could do it! They are much more enjoyable than Dirty Dancing's scenes  although some day this will feel dated too!  Overall I expected another piece of MTV teen tat but I was pleasantly surprised by a story that despite being ridden with clichs is actually very involving and enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "maybe spoilersI can't believe the number of positive reviews i have seen for this tragic excuse for a movie. OK maybe it's not that bad but at the very best it is mediocre.It boasts some grand overacting from the normally very likeable Julia Stiles an oversimplistic plot and to top it all off eveyr actor in the film seems bored with their stereotypical character. There is no chemistry between any of the characters even the hatred between Stiles' character Sara and her 'nemesis' Nikki seems forced and tired. The dancing in uninspired except for the big finale scene at the end.The pace is slow and most of the story telling techniques used are stale and obvious. The characters are flat and worthless for example Derek's friend Malaki whom Derek says 'has a good heart'. This 'good heart' is nowhere in evidence in this movie because he is played as a standard bad guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities. It is impossible for the viewer to understand why the bright intelligent and kind Derek would remain loyal to his jerk of a friend. What does any of this have to do with the plot of a dancer struggling to get along in a new world? Nothing. That's another of the problems with Save The Last Dance there are too many sub plots that are not dealt with in an interesting and entertaining way. Instead of weaving the sub plots together to create a coherent story the sub plots are cut and pasted crudely so that it looks like this Sara moves to the ghetto must try to fit in Sara doesn't like her dad Sara makes friends with Chenille Sara falls for Derek Sara learns how to be hip hop Derek must choose between Sara and the evil Malaki Sara gives up on everything Sara tries again Sara makes friends with her dad Sara triumphs over all her difficulties with one astounding blow. The end. There is very little correlation between different aspects of the plot leaving me the audience feeling bored and hollow.This is not a good movie. It does not realistically show life. It is not inspiring becuase it is uninspired. It is vaguely entertaining but don't have high expectations. I went in thinking it would be energetic and funky and left yawning and wanting to go to bed and forget that i saw it. Wait for the video... don't waste the cash on the big screen... it's not worth it.".

The dancing in uninspired except for the big finale scene at the end.The pace is slow and most of the story telling techniques used are stale and obvious. The characters are flat and worthless for example Derek's friend Malaki whom Derek says 'has a good heart'. This 'good heart' is nowhere in evidence in this movie because he is played as a standard bad guy with absolutely no redeeming qualities. It is impossible for the viewer to understand why the bright intelligent and kind Derek would remain loyal to his jerk of a friend. What does any of this have to do with the plot of a dancer struggling to get along in a new world? Nothing. That's another of the problems with Save The Last Dance there are too many sub plots that are not dealt with in an interesting and entertaining way. Instead of weaving the sub plots together to create a coherent story the sub plots are cut and pasted crudely so that it looks like this Sara moves to the ghetto must try to fit in Sara doesn't like her dad Sara makes friends with Chenille Sara falls for Derek Sara learns how to be hip hop Derek must choose between Sara and the evil Malaki Sara gives up on everything Sara tries again Sara makes friends with her dad Sara triumphs over all her difficulties with one astounding blow. The end. There is very little correlation between different aspects of the plot leaving me the audience feeling bored and hollow.This is not a good movie. It does not realistically show life. It is not inspiring becuase it is uninspired. It is vaguely entertaining but don't have high expectations. I went in thinking it would be energetic and funky and left yawning and wanting to go to bed and forget that i saw it. Wait for the video... don't waste the cash on the big screen... it's not worth it.";

No it's not a great filmI give it a B but I'd see it again.  In fact I did see it again with another set of friends on Saturday night.  All in all I saw this movie with 10 friends of varying sex age and race and all of us liked it.  I think that's a pretty good showing.".

I did not know who she was when the movie was released but have since enjoyed her in Mona Lisa Smile and the Prince and Me and couldn't wait to see her in this film. This was the best work I have seen her do to this point. It was so much better than I expected based on the meager 6.1 stars it received overall on IMDb...Julia was wonderful in it as was Sean Patrick Thomas. Their chemistry was terrific and the story was riveting and the dancing awesome both the ballet and the dancing throughout the movie. I don't know how much of the dancing Julia actually did but all of it was beautifully done.The film was sweet touching and violent and worked in all aspects. The rest of the casting was very good too all the performances were terrific.I will buy it on DVD asap...it was that good! I think it will be enjoyed by men and women I can't wait to have my teenage son see it. Truly a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get one thing straight.  Teen movies are starting to get unbearable. So it is a relief when something like Save the Last Dance comes along and offers something up that's just a little off of redundancy.  There seems to be a lot going on here with the main characters dealing with everything from death of loved ones to single parenthood to racial issues.  You don't see THAT often in teen movies!  But what it really comes down to is DANCE! Julia Stiles plays a former ballet dancer whose dreams are selfimposingly dashed by a tragic event and the rest of the movie is about her rechasing her dream in totally different circumstances than what she's used to mainly being the only white girl in a rough Chicago allblack neighbourhood.  The movie does touch upon a lot of issues as previously mentioned but none of them are explored enough to give  the film a lot of substance.  What does make the film somewhat enjoyable is the dance sequences and the performances.  There seems to be a real chemistry between Stiles who's great in everything she does! and Sean Patrick Thomas who is really talented!  I've only seen him in supporting roles but this film shows he can be a leading man.  The scene stealer award goes to Kerry Washington who is so much fun in every one of her scenes.  I hope to see a lot more of her in the future.  IN A NUTSHELL  It's good to see a teen film that deals with more issues than just prom dates and it will make you think but it's not deep enough to be more than just a dance movie in the same vain as Centre Stage and Dirty Dancing culminating in long dance routine by Stiles and when the routine is over everything is resolved. Are all the issues REALLY resolved?  Only in Hollywood!! Skippy's Rating 710".

I went with my initial instinct and saw the movie and i'm glad i did. This film is so much more than just a teen film. in fact i saw a lot of adults in the audience when i saw it. Save the Last Dance really makes you think about some of the issues that are addressed in the film.The plot revolves around Sara JohnsonJulia Stiles who moves to a very bad part of Chicago with her dad after her mom is killed in a car accident. her mom is killed during this accident while trying to rush to see sara try out for Julliard. Sara is so heart borken by this event that she holds off on dance. When she arrives to chicago she attends a mostly black highschool and has to learn to fit in. She meets ChenilleKerry Washington who shows her the ropes and how to get around in school. She also meets her brother DerekSean Patrick Thomaswho had a shaddy past but now has dreams of going to georgetown and becoming a doctor. Soon they all begin to hang out and go to this hip hop club called steps. Soon derek is showing sara how to dance like them and she picks up on it pretty quickly. soon they meet afterschool and practice and he learns that she once did ballet and that passion for dance soon turns into a romance for the both of them. problems arise when this interacial pairing is put to the test on many occasions.The acting by everyone is pretty good but it's the chemistry of the 2 leads that carry the film. Julia Stiles is a very talented actress who is really breaking out in the industry and i hope more adult work comes her way that will trully test her talent. Sean Patrick Thomas is also good as Derek. he has a very low key charisma and fascinating screen prescence. when these 2 are together however the film becomes so much better because their chemistry is so strong that you honestly want them to be together. The Acting by the supporting cast especially fredro starr and Kerry Washington is also good.The music and Dancing are a real highlight. the hip hop scenes are very fun and energetic and one of the best aspects of the film. also the scenes where derek is tryng to teach sara how to dance is when the film is at its best..I really recommend this film because it was very enjoyable and shouldn't be written off as just naother teen flick. check it out.

Sara is so heart borken by this event that she holds off on dance. When she arrives to chicago she attends a mostly black highschool and has to learn to fit in. She meets ChenilleKerry Washington who shows her the ropes and how to get around in school. She also meets her brother DerekSean Patrick Thomaswho had a shaddy past but now has dreams of going to georgetown and becoming a doctor. Soon they all begin to hang out and go to this hip hop club called steps. Soon derek is showing sara how to dance like them and she picks up on it pretty quickly. soon they meet afterschool and practice and he learns that she once did ballet and that passion for dance soon turns into a romance for the both of them. problems arise when this interacial pairing is put to the test on many occasions.The acting by everyone is pretty good but it's the chemistry of the 2 leads that carry the film. Julia Stiles is a very talented actress who is really breaking out in the industry and i hope more adult work comes her way that will trully test her talent. Sean Patrick Thomas is also good as Derek. he has a very low key charisma and fascinating screen prescence. when these 2 are together however the film becomes so much better because their chemistry is so strong that you honestly want them to be together. The Acting by the supporting cast especially fredro starr and Kerry Washington is also good.The music and Dancing are a real highlight. the hip hop scenes are very fun and energetic and one of the best aspects of the film. also the scenes where derek is tryng to teach sara how to dance is when the film is at its best..I really recommend this film because it was very enjoyable and shouldn't be written off as just naother teen flick. check it out.

The school scenes were so unrealistic  c'mon on her very first day at school a black girl completely befriends her out of nowhere and treats her like she's her best friend even sticking up for her to every other girl in school. Couldn't they at least have set it up better where Sarah does something to gain her trust or her friend has a white parent or anything interesting? Something besides no reason or charity work.The scenes where they practiced dancing in the empty school room they were so stupid it was embarrassing to watch. And practicing how to sit? She's white not a guy. The club dancing scenes also ridiculous and hard to watch. Show me someone in the room making a comment or something. Wasn't the point of this movie to make a statement about racial tension and acceptance? She hardly had any real problems that weren't easily avoided. Even the eventual fight with her boyfriend lasted only 2 minutes and was reconciled for no particular reason.And too often I always notice Stiles acting if you know what I mean which isn't a good thing. Like in a high school play.The scene in the ER waiting room with her friend going off on her that was about the only good dramatic scene. And even that was a clich quote black girls don't have enough good black men anymore that I've heard many times before on TV and movies.Sarah's constant I don't want to talk about it about her boycotting dancing and about her mother...clich like a bad sitcom. Ooh but then she overcomes it all in the end with the help of her boyfriend...how surprising.This was really painful to watch. I gave it a 2 because I've seen a lot worse movies. The script and filming must have been put together really quickly because it seemed like there wasn't much imagination behind it. I actually thought going into it that there would be some interesting viewpoints or more hardhitting scenes. I guess I forgot it was an MTV movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had no real information about the film's story i.e. I didn't realise it was about ballet before hip hop dancing but it was when I saw the scene spoofed in Scary Movie 2 that I really got into it more. Basically Sara Johnson The Bourne Trilogy and 10 Things I Hate About You's Julia Stiles was once an aspiring ballet dancer but her dream to become a professional was cut short by the death of her mother and since she has moved in with her father Roy Terry Kinney. He lives in a predominantly Black neighbourhood and she has to be transferred to a new school where she is one of the few White students. She finds a friend with smalltime ghetto girl Chenille Reynolds The Last King of Scotland's Kerry Washington and later she gets to see Sara's ballet ability. Later after starting a friendship with Chenille's brother Derek Cruel Intentions' Sean Patrick Thomas he teaches her how her ballet skills can be put to use for an audition the one she could have had if not for her mother's death. In a really cool scene he teaches some small cool moves like the spoof in Scary Movie 2 and as time goes by she gains more and more hip hop moves till she has a routine for the judges. There is the small quarrel between Sara and Derek before this audition happens but she sticks it out they make up and she makes a very good impression with the judges mixing ballet with a bit of hip hop. Also starring Fredro Starr as Malakai Bianca Lawson as Nikki Vince Green as Snookie and Garland Whitt as Kenny. Stiles and Thomas are attractive leads the dance sequences especially the all important audition are fun to watch and the soundtrack including songs from Fatman Scoop Ice Cube and Blaqout is very good and not too much sentimentality to sour the film a crowdpleasing dancemusic film. Worth watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "Human feelings are universal whether you are a Chinese living in a crowded and vulgar country village or an American living in a comfortable and affluent suburban neighborhood. However the experiences are different enough that there are subtleties in this Chinese film that only Chinese can truly appreciate.I never wrote an online comment of a film before even though I have read a great deal. Unlike most of other films comments on Chen Kaige's together is surprisingly divided into two extremes love it or hate it. Maybe this observation prompted me to write something to express my feelings during and after watching this film.I grew up in a small town in rural China very much like the one shown in the film. My father isn't a vulgar peasant as the father in the film and I wasn't a prodigy of anything by any measures either. The kind of strong character and sensitivity the kid showed is something I wish I had when I was a teenager. The incredible sacrifice and love the father showed in the film is also a bit surreal to me. In other words my experience is much more real with little melodrama involved.However the film actually made me cry when sitting in the cinema not just because of the melodrama and the music more so because it made me miss my own father and remember many small moments between us that are not so much drama but only our daily experiences.When I left cinema I overheard a middleaged American white couple in front of me making comments a cute little film isn't it? I can tell from the dialogue that they experienced different things when watching the film because they appreciate the details of ordinary Chinese life such as how the coal is used for heating tea. To me those details are not novelties to appreciate they WERE my existence and everyday experiences.I will stop here not to violate the IMDB guideline. After all everyone's experience is unique. Everyone has their ethos deep from their upbringing and culture. I am just glad that this film brings me a Chinese experience of love between a father and a son that I can relate to.".

A beautifully rendered story about the sacrifices we make for art the sacrifices parents make for children and the sacrifices teachers make for their students.  I found myself thinking about the larger questions in life as I watched Han ni zai yikithe struggles of the young protagonist to become a man the heartbreaking dilemma that allows his father to become one as well and the  ways in which we lose our ways in life and luckily how the entry of a new  love in its platonic sense can get us back on the path.At its center Han ni zai yiki is the story of a father and his son. Never have I seen this relationship told with such honesty and impact.  Instead of a perfect father giving pearls of wisdom to a son eager for his approval we see an imperfect man doing the best he can for a son who  is not necessarily appreciative.It is sentimental but that doesn't stop it from being thoughtprovoking or from teaching the viewer something he or she is likely to have forgotten in this age of kungfu special effect sequences and digitized actors.In the U.S. at least we've been saturated with everdumber plot lines plasticized breasts and explosions to emphasize every character realization.  It's unusual to go to the cinema to be treated to a real story with complex and realistic characters in difficult situations that actually have some bearing on our lives.  Together was a breath of fresh air.I hope that the negative opinions expressed earlier don't stop anyone from seeing this film.

Underneath it's about hundreds of things. Just like Tous les Matins du Monde it's about music but also about how people lose the love of music through the events that befall them. What I notice about Together He ni zai yi qi is the theme of ownership  how it eludes those who seek it in music. The acclaimed music teacher Professor Yu reminisces in class on how much he loved music how his love of Vivaldi flourished during the Cultural Revolution despite the threat he was under. But now at the height of his fame he does not enjoy music any more he only enjoys power. The boy's other music teacher has lost his love of music by becoming dispirited and his life has become decrepit. But the film has many other themes. It could be about the inarticulacy of adolescence especially one burdened with impossibly difficult feelings. It could also be an allegory about China. I watched it as Together with English subtitles but one sensed that in Chinese it had other layers of meaning  the notion of the scholar as venerated in Chinese society for instance. There are some things not quite realized and the ending is softcentered but the acting by the son and especially his father is gripping. It's a film that would repay repeated viewings.".

The young teen is a likable kid and the other main characters  two of his teachers and the big sister  are all interesting people.The dialog as with many foreign films is different from what we are used to hearing in North America and I for one find it appealing. At almost two hours this might be a bit long for most people to put up with subtitles but I didn't find that a hindrance in keeping focused on this story. Along the way you get to enjoy some excellent violin playing too. People who like amiablecharacter stories and good music should enjoy this very much.".

	schema:reviewBody "The positive things are all you can imagine and more. The acting is believable the casting just right the music is spectacular as are the performances and the story is nice with a little surprise beginning slowly half way thru and blossoming near the end. Except for that there are no real unpredictable moments. The interplay between the story and music is accomplished masterfully. I remember listening to many of those selections as a boy and how the emotions in the music generated tears. The same emotions are here and yet amplified by the conditions in the lives of the people and the needs that drive them. You know the story a peasant father whose son is a violin talent and who sacrifices everything to move to a big city so the boy can have advanced instruction and rightfully achieve fame and fortune. The boy's mother died when he was a baby and the only thing she left him was a violin the same one he plays now and cherishes because of her. His talent is recognized by a master teacher who long ago has lost the woman he loved and has withdrawn from society with the exceptions of caring for stray cats and teaching untalented students  for his survival. There is a nice minor theme in the relationship between the teacher sinking and the student rising. A secondary theme develops between the boy and a woman he sees and meets at the train station. She is a man chaser and the boy sees beauty and fun in her beginning with an argument with her boyfriend who she kisses on parting. It turns out that she and the boy live near to each other and he plays violin for her. Because of her the father wants to change teachers and convinces an upscale teacher to work with the boy. The teacher reluctantly accepts however the boy doesn't want to leave the first teacher. Another energy to drive the plot.Negative things which likely trigger the PG label are in my opinion minimal. The boy has pictures of women he places in his music books. At first you are to think he is a naughty little boy indeed the father accuses him so and yet you realize eventually that the pictures represent the mother he never met. The boy is enamored by the woman he meets in the train station he even helps her prepare a party for her boyfriend and goes with her when she shops. The father gets angry with him hits him likely for the first time takes the picture of the lady away and the boy hits back unacceptable in his culture. Also some of the women are portrayed as mean in their verbal attacks and this includes a young female violinist. The movie should be fine for any child who can read or understand that Chinese dialect. I'd like to see it again and I'll buy the DVD when it is released.".

Except for the director Chen Kaige who also plays a major role no other actor is really known outside of China.Reactions to Chen Kaige's Together are very mixed.  The story of Chun a thirteenyearold regional violin competition winner from the provinces who travels with his guiding incessantly cajoling  or demanding father to Beijing for advanced instruction and a shot at an international career is original in the sense that it's set in China.  But Chun's journey actual and emotional reflects the life of the child musical prodigy anywhere.Chun's mother disappeared when he was two and he was brought up by his simple but devoted father.  Correctly styled a country bumpkin this obsequious pursuer of any advantage for the boy  for which no sacrifice is too much  reminds me of American parents I've known who correctly or not usually the latter believed their child was a genius who needed to be nurtured AND pushed no matter the psychical cost or the premature loss of childhood.Chun and his father have separate encounters and adventures in Beijing that meld as the story progresses. A young woman Lily who would be a perfect character in a Chinese Sex and the City series  befriends the kid. A sometimes humorous relationship develops she styles herself as Chun's big sister..The budding violinist's first teacher Professor Jiang shares his untidy apartment with an assortment of rescued cats.  He brings the boy to the point where he realizes he can do no more.  Through the father's scheming Chun next takes up lessons with the famous Professor Yu played here by the director Chen Kaige. Yu wants one of his two livein teen pupils to compete internationally and of course the audience is set up for the expected rivalry.The ending is original and affecting without being cloying.  Anyone familiar with the American classical music scene and I am will recognize the universality of Chun's experience. The pressures put on young potential virtuosi whether by Professor Jiang in this film or at Juilliard down the street are enormous.  A kid's wish and need to just be a kid is fiercely subordinated to the vision teachers and parents hold for the young musicians.Perhaps part of the disappointment some feel about Together is that Chen Kaige didn't produce a sprawling masterpiece with the forChina daring political overtones that previously got him in hot wonton soup with the authorities.  This is a politically correct movie in the sense that it doesn't tweak the government's tail or the Party's there's a difference?. So what?  Taken on its own merits Together is about parenting caring balance and its lack ambition and the glories of music.  Many familiar and beautiful excerpts from the Western canon make up this film's score often highlighting dramatic moments.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since there is only one user review posted for this film so far and it is screaming with jealousy and arrogance the proper way to review this film is to defend it as not only legitimate but truly masterful.As an Asian I can attest to a wealth of dramatic storytelling on the Pacific Rim that merely implodes with strained emotions lacking subtlety and patient Aristotelian exposition or even Eastern philosophical bearings.  This film however is a calculated presentation of subtle character elements and moments that substantiate rather than expedite the overwhelming emotions of the story.With reference to the earlier hostile criticism perhaps it is meaningful to describe for whom this movie fails.  One must understand and genuinely empathize with the process of bringing a work of classical music to life  the emotional transferrence the sacrificial nature.  One cannot for example hate classical music.  One must also not be so terrified of ethnic stereotypes and insecure about China on the world stage such that nonaggressive nonviolent stories are perceived as retrogression.  It is noteworthy that for example these storytellers do not need to inflict vengeance upon the playboy who resold the fur coat.  Or maybe more to the point one must be a mature adult or in any case have respect for maturity.This is a brilliant film that all the world should see.  It does not purport to subvert China nor does it purport to be China's calling card.  It's just a great story that resonates with the Chinese experience and then far greater than that the human experience.".

This movie really moved me emotionally and it is a stunning piece of work.Liu Xiaochun is a thirteen year old boy who lives in the country with his Dad Liu Cheng. His dad is desperate to show off the talents of his young son who has a gift with the violin and to give him a good future. Lui Xiaochun eventually befriends a woman in the city who uses men for money though eventually shows a softer side to her a music teacher who is poor and slowly rediscovers his love for music and along the way discovers what is really important for him in his life.There is something just really natural and real about this film. I felt myself tearing up sometimes perhaps because the relationship between the father and son is really just touching but also real. Yes it is sentimental but the performances are just terrific in particular from Tang Yun who plays Xiaochun with a sensitivity that just shows even when he doesn't say his lines. It's written all over his face.The music as well  the violin melodies were just beautiful. It makes me want to go see a concert to hear such great music playing.I'm just wondering if Hollywood could do a story like this and make it work. This is terrific Chinese cinema and just a great movie. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a film about dreams about immigrants who came to Sweden from all over the world in the 60's and 70's. They came for various reasons often political unable to stay in their own countries. Many stayed as they found love and new beginnings. The main feature in this film is the image poetry definitely. It's astounding.There's a feeling of melancholy reminiscent of the film In the Mood for Love and the love theme is quite similar in the way it is portrayed.Stylistically it echoes some of the new wave Italian and maybe French films of the 60's. Yet it still has it's unique expression.

They came for various reasons often political unable to stay in their own countries. Many stayed as they found love and new beginnings. The main feature in this film is the image poetry definitely. It's astounding.There's a feeling of melancholy reminiscent of the film In the Mood for Love and the love theme is quite similar in the way it is portrayed.Stylistically it echoes some of the new wave Italian and maybe French films of the 60's.

I was totally surprised from the warm and good humor the stunning camera and the charm full acting of the leading roles. Another point i really like was the soundtrack especially the old Finnish tango oriental love. Can't take this song out of my mind on that day.

'Joyeux Nol' is a story of war and its effects on soldiers that goes far beyond sentimentality or the opposite emphasis on brutality as found in American films and offers the viewer insights to the responses of young men's minds to the monster of war and how they cope.Based on a true story the film opens with the usual callous killing among three groups of soldiers  German French and Scottish  who face an oncoming Christmas Eve in the trenches the realities of fighting have precluded their getting time to retreat for air. But a miracle happens among the Germans is a famous opera tenor Nikolaus Sprink Benno Frmann who has aligned with his fellow troops in the trenches hoping he can bring some minor sense of Christmas and understanding to them. His soprano partner Anna Sorensen Diane Kruger finds a way to be with him in the trenches on Christmas Eve 1914. Meanwhile the disgruntle troops of all three sectors are planning meager festivities and a bit of relaxation even in the trenches as the bodies of the day's plunder lie in the snow of no man's land. We get to know the French Lieutenant Audebert Guillaume Canet and his orderly Ponchel Dany Boon the German head of the regiment Horstmayer Daniel Brhl and the Scots  especially the priestmedic Palmer Gary Lewis.Christmas Eve comes and the voice of Sprink in reality the tenor Rolando Villazn sings 'Stille Nacht' rising out of the trenches to sing in the open of no man's land. Soon he is accompanied by the Scottish bagpipes and the 'chorus' of the Germans the Scots and the French. They all emerge share gifts of champagne and other libations and agree to a ceasefire in honor of the holiday. It is in this magic moment that the true personalities of these warring men surface and each is seen as a vulnerable puppet of the WW I exchanging addresses to meet after the war. Anna Sorenson has managed to enter the scene and during a communal mass led by Palmer she sings the voice is Natalie Dessay an Ave Maria composed by the film's composer Philippe Rombi the lovers have previously sung a duet version of Bach's 'Bist du bei mir'. For that moment in time the horrors of war melt and the camaraderie of the men glows and is carried into Christmas Day when all three groups of soldiers agree to bury their dead together. Of course the brutality and ignorance of war reengages and the leaders of the three groups enter camp and threaten courts martial and punishment for the troops' lack of military discipline. The film ends in a manner that leaves the audience able to integrate the happenings of that Christmas Eve on the futures of these men.The script is superb the cast is uniformly excellent the sets and cinematography are creatively moody and the musical score by Philippe Rombi is one of the finest in years the ending song 'I'm Dreaming of Home' deserves to become a standard. Would that everyone could see this film a bit of global hope in the cloud of the destruction that shadows our world right now. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to a special showing as one of the events to mark the centenary of the Alliance Franaise in Canada's capital I had the privilege of attending a North American premiere of this remarkable film just two days before today Remembrance Day Veterans Day in the U.S. Both an appropriate theme and a cinematic Christmas gift come early. I think it may become my top film among several hundred seen this year just as A Very Long Engagement  also set in the trenches of the First World War  captured my heart and critic's choice last December. Writerdirector Christian Carion and all the actors do an amazing job in this multicountry Euro coproduction. It should appeal not only to audiences across that continent but to film goers around the world. In addition to presenting a parable from real life relevant for any wartorn age including our own I might add Carion works wonders with frontline incidents great and small while drawing compelling individual character portraits from a top notch Scots French and German cast each speaking in their native language and accents. That goes for even relatively smaller roles for example that of the junior German officer at the front Lieutenant Horstmayer ironically a Jew who recalls a Paris honeymoon with his Frenchspeaking wife as played by the superb young actor Daniel Brhl Goodbye Lenin The Edukators. There is so much more that could be said about this remarkable and timely movie with a timeless message. Even had France not chosen Joyeux Nel as its selection for the 2006 Oscar best foreignlanguage film category I would herald it and rejoice in the advent of a new classic that is in another class altogether from the general run of holiday movies. A story of harsh truths as well as transcendent art it finds humanity and hope in the midst of battlefield horrors. Seasonal glad tidings indeed!".

Great story great film although I agree that both Fhrmann and Krger aren't exactly doing a good job when they are dubbing the touching soprano's and tenor's voices. I wouldn't actually say that she's bad but for a woman confronted at the same time with the horrors of the trenches and the human spirit's ability to overcome them while trying to save her lover from this place her performance is not well particularly emotional.Bizarrely even for Germany the version released to cinemas across the country this week is almost entirely dubbed in German. This I might say adds some strange kind of comedy when ordinary soldiers from the trenches act like they don't understand the other while both speaking perfect German. On the other hand it makes the German lieutenant who actually speaks both English and French look overly ridiculous when he tries to utter chouette.There are so many memorable moments in this film it is hard to come up with them all even immediately after leaving the theatre. But I particularly loved the opening scene in which three little boys in Germany France and Britain respectively are standing in front of a blackboard and are repeating the jingoist everyday rhetoric of the day and the scene in which the church leader is preaching to new Scottish troops that they are on a crusade against evil right after he fired the field priest for performing the Christmas mass with the soldiers who fraternised with each other.In any other context I would have said this is over the top too open a reference to the religiously influenced jingoist rhetoric of certain world leaders of this day  but I'm pretty sure it's an accurate reflection of the indoctrination of 19141945.

	schema:headline " Eventually one of the best Christmas classic that we have...";
	schema:reviewBody "If we could read the secret history of our enemies we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.Joyeux Noel aka Merry Christmas a heartwarming film set in the World War 1 trenches is a  19M joint production of France Germany and the UK with star studded talented cast of Diane Krger Daniel Brhl Brenno Frmann Guillame Canet Garry Lewis and Danny Boon.Merry Christmas is a very poignant film surrounded by beautiful Christmas carols and well written storyline. It is like the heartbreaking moments of Saving Private Ryan plus the uplifting energy of Love Actually combined together in a single package.Christmas Eve of 1914 the English French and Germans celebrated the Christmas Eve together in the war trenches singing drinking and sharing their pictures from home. The film's opening credit is pretty impressive it begins with children of different nationalities talking about their understanding of war. Things like why they should get rid of one another to ease the danger and make this world a better place to live in but the question is do we really have defined or particular enemies? In Merry Christmas unbelievable but true they have extended the fraternization for three more days to bury the victims of war in both sides. I found a very moving scene in the film where the officials are talking about Christmas the day when Christ was born is the very same day when they are burying their comrades. In the end of the film I have my teary eyes when they are all going back to war and forget about their so called crime of fraternization and then they sang the song I'm Dreaming of Home. History has kept this truth for years because on that time they believed that it is a crime of disobedience and disloyalty for their countries. But I guess it is damn better to be loyal to the human race in general right? In one of the last scenes the English priest is telling the soldiers that the World War I is a crusade a battle between good and evil the English and French being the savior and the Germans are the evil ones. Well I know it is pretty controversial but I never believe in the literal meaning of the world 'Crusade' the crusade that they are talking about that there are definite groups of people that would assume the word good and bad is just absurd.Looking at Joyeux Noel the most outstanding aspect of the film is probably the strong direction from Christian Carion he is a very emotional director who can effectively show human reaction to the absurdity and hostility of war. The cast is also very powerful not only because of their acting skills we know that already but it features box office hit makers such as Diane Kruger. But the best performances from the movie came from Daniel Bruhl not because I'm a fan Guillame Canet France' answer to Tom Cruise and Danny Boon the one who played the role of the priest. The film score is fantastic it features old recognizable Christmas carols and I just love the song I'm Dreaming of Home it is so touching and nostalgic. This movie is definitely one of the best five movies of 2005.Last night there are just three people watching the last full show.

	onyx:emotionText "If we could read the secret history of our enemies we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.Joyeux Noel aka Merry Christmas a heartwarming film set in the World War 1 trenches is a  19M joint production of France Germany and the UK with star studded talented cast of Diane Krger Daniel Brhl Brenno Frmann Guillame Canet Garry Lewis and Danny Boon.Merry Christmas is a very poignant film surrounded by beautiful Christmas carols and well written storyline. It is like the heartbreaking moments of Saving Private Ryan plus the uplifting energy of Love Actually combined together in a single package.Christmas Eve of 1914 the English French and Germans celebrated the Christmas Eve together in the war trenches singing drinking and sharing their pictures from home. The film's opening credit is pretty impressive it begins with children of different nationalities talking about their understanding of war. Things like why they should get rid of one another to ease the danger and make this world a better place to live in but the question is do we really have defined or particular enemies? In Merry Christmas unbelievable but true they have extended the fraternization for three more days to bury the victims of war in both sides. I found a very moving scene in the film where the officials are talking about Christmas the day when Christ was born is the very same day when they are burying their comrades. In the end of the film I have my teary eyes when they are all going back to war and forget about their so called crime of fraternization and then they sang the song I'm Dreaming of Home. History has kept this truth for years because on that time they believed that it is a crime of disobedience and disloyalty for their countries. But I guess it is damn better to be loyal to the human race in general right? In one of the last scenes the English priest is telling the soldiers that the World War I is a crusade a battle between good and evil the English and French being the savior and the Germans are the evil ones. Well I know it is pretty controversial but I never believe in the literal meaning of the world 'Crusade' the crusade that they are talking about that there are definite groups of people that would assume the word good and bad is just absurd.Looking at Joyeux Noel the most outstanding aspect of the film is probably the strong direction from Christian Carion he is a very emotional director who can effectively show human reaction to the absurdity and hostility of war. The cast is also very powerful not only because of their acting skills we know that already but it features box office hit makers such as Diane Kruger. But the best performances from the movie came from Daniel Bruhl not because I'm a fan Guillame Canet France' answer to Tom Cruise and Danny Boon the one who played the role of the priest. The film score is fantastic it features old recognizable Christmas carols and I just love the song I'm Dreaming of Home it is so touching and nostalgic.

Set on Christmas Eve in 1914 during World War I soldiers from France Scotland and Germany sing Christmas carols together share champagne and chocolate and say mass before returning each other's dead the next day. The difficulty comes when their commanding officers order them to shoot shortly after this incident and none will having looked their enemies in the face exchanged addresses and learned stories from their enemies' lives. War becomes a shared human experience resulting in a bond that cannot be explained to church officials country leaders or even each other.

The miracle continued into Christmas day and beyond.But I must back up a little and plead ignorance. The miraculous events that took place on Christmas Eve in 1914 may not be as widely known to the world as some might think. This was the European arena of the first World War which was in fact essentially a European war a war that means far less than WWII to the world outside Europe even English speaking North America and Australia. And after all it's over 90 years ago.The story is unquestionably worth telling and judging from the unadorned style of the storytelling it would seem that it was told quite truthfully. The sweeping panoramic aerial shot and grandiose music at the start conjures up sort of a Lord of the Rings feeling but it gets down to earth soon introducing the key characters and bringing the audience to the battlefield.While the events were the best manifestation of the Christmas spirit there is also a embedded love of music which strangely brought to my mind the banjo duet scene in Deliverence. Farfetched as it may sound there are similarities in having music as the bridge that breaks the ice of communication.Happening over 90 years ago this is a miracle founded on a common Christianity heritage which traverse national and language barriers. The movie makers did make a small point that it was beyond Christianity by showing how a Jewish German soldier was moved. It is also realistic that the miracle did not touch every single person  for the Scottish soldier the loss of a beloved brother was just too great.But it was heartwarming that the miracle did not stop at the magical Christmas Eve but continued on into the glaring reality of the bright Christmas Day and beyond in a relatively simpler world at the turn of the last century. Today a miracle of this magnitude would require a lot more. It would be a huge challenge to just write a fictional script let alone find a true story. I am hoping that Steven Spielberg will take up this challenge.".

	schema:headline " The French really know how to make a movie about war.";
	schema:reviewBody "Carion's movie Joyuex Noel has placed a flower of history into the barrel of the gun of war. I cried I laughed. It was gripping. Maybe because I am a Vet. Joyeux got a standing ovation in the theater I saw it in. Common soldiers learned to see past their flags of war  recognize themselves in the face of their enemies. Their realized war is insane childish silly and not for adults. It is no accident this movie came out of France. That whole society is 100 against the US Pentagon war machine pirates bloody attack on Iraq. The punch line in the movie Joyuex that most movie critics seem to miss is that all the mutineers Scottish French  German were them executed by their own officers as soon as they started following orders again. As when all the German soldiers were locked in box cars  shipped to another front line to be forced into another battle until they were all killed. This to try to silence the knowledge of this beautiful Xmas mutiny this great leap forward for the whole human race on Xmas day. To prevent the press from learning about how the war WWI ended before it had even begun. Look at he million of people who died in WWI after this first battle. What would have happened if these 3000 now humanize solders had quite fighting  gone back home  talked about how they stopped the war!. Or to write books about the love they experienced on that day? They had the guns. They could have just started marching back home. I want to know more about this battle. Did any of them survive? Did any of them go on to write books? Remember this was the initial battle in WWI  it stopped the war! This shows the power of soldiers to control war. What if they had refused to follow orders imprisoned the commanding officers as they came from HQ to restart the war  stayed in their fox holes! They could have formed hell they did form an army for peace for a week. If they could have just held their fire for a month they could have stopped WWI before it went any further. The story could have gotten back to their villages. And the press. If they had just held out for a month taken their officers prisoners. Then their own governments would have had to have sent in more troops their own cousins to attack their own troops. The new troops would never have fired on their own kind. WWI would have ended before it ever began. That is the lesson of this fabulous movie. Now how can we reach the teenage boys with this movie? This French cinema director Christian Carion deserves a Nobel Prize for Peace for his excellent  exciting movie. Peace is an economic system. Joyeux Noel exposes how common soldiers can bring peace even in the middle of a war. Using songs. I participated in a Navy mutiny in 1961 during the US invasion of Cuba. I was given a year of punishment duty for refusing to help invade Cuba. So I was really happy to see another movie on how soldiers can say No! to their officers in a musical way  actually stopped a war. Our mutiny in 1961 did not stop the Bay of Pigs but because we 30 sailors at Patuxant River said NO! to our officers as did hundreds more in other military bases President Kennedy knew he had the support of the majority of the common soldier  sailors in the military. So JFK stopped the invasion of Cuba. Because JFK had spine Bush  the CIA then ambushed JFK in Dallas as punishment for JFK?s refusing to attack Cuba. President Kenndy died a hero for participating in our mutiny. God bless JFK. My life story is based on my experiences. True events. I took the time to speak up against an illegal attack on Cuba. While I was in the Navy. Most people can have an exciting life too if they will just turn off the TV get out of their apartment  go fight the war machine. Even by making another great film like Joyeux. There are still great battles to be won  it can be fun based on true events. You will survive  have fun in the long run.We Vets for Peace are now doing marches in all 50 state capitals July 4th 2006 to bring the US troops back home before Christmas 2006. Please join us 415.".

	onyx:emotionText "Carion's movie Joyuex Noel has placed a flower of history into the barrel of the gun of war. I cried I laughed. It was gripping. Maybe because I am a Vet. Joyeux got a standing ovation in the theater I saw it in. Common soldiers learned to see past their flags of war  recognize themselves in the face of their enemies. Their realized war is insane childish silly and not for adults. It is no accident this movie came out of France. That whole society is 100 against the US Pentagon war machine pirates bloody attack on Iraq. The punch line in the movie Joyuex that most movie critics seem to miss is that all the mutineers Scottish French  German were them executed by their own officers as soon as they started following orders again. As when all the German soldiers were locked in box cars  shipped to another front line to be forced into another battle until they were all killed. This to try to silence the knowledge of this beautiful Xmas mutiny this great leap forward for the whole human race on Xmas day. To prevent the press from learning about how the war WWI ended before it had even begun. Look at he million of people who died in WWI after this first battle. What would have happened if these 3000 now humanize solders had quite fighting  gone back home  talked about how they stopped the war!. Or to write books about the love they experienced on that day? They had the guns. They could have just started marching back home. I want to know more about this battle. Did any of them survive? Did any of them go on to write books? Remember this was the initial battle in WWI  it stopped the war! This shows the power of soldiers to control war. What if they had refused to follow orders imprisoned the commanding officers as they came from HQ to restart the war  stayed in their fox holes! They could have formed hell they did form an army for peace for a week. If they could have just held their fire for a month they could have stopped WWI before it went any further. The story could have gotten back to their villages. And the press. If they had just held out for a month taken their officers prisoners. Then their own governments would have had to have sent in more troops their own cousins to attack their own troops. The new troops would never have fired on their own kind. WWI would have ended before it ever began. That is the lesson of this fabulous movie. Now how can we reach the teenage boys with this movie? This French cinema director Christian Carion deserves a Nobel Prize for Peace for his excellent  exciting movie. Peace is an economic system. Joyeux Noel exposes how common soldiers can bring peace even in the middle of a war. Using songs. I participated in a Navy mutiny in 1961 during the US invasion of Cuba. I was given a year of punishment duty for refusing to help invade Cuba. So I was really happy to see another movie on how soldiers can say No! to their officers in a musical way  actually stopped a war. Our mutiny in 1961 did not stop the Bay of Pigs but because we 30 sailors at Patuxant River said NO! to our officers as did hundreds more in other military bases President Kennedy knew he had the support of the majority of the common soldier  sailors in the military. So JFK stopped the invasion of Cuba. Because JFK had spine Bush  the CIA then ambushed JFK in Dallas as punishment for JFK?s refusing to attack Cuba. President Kenndy died a hero for participating in our mutiny. God bless JFK. My life story is based on my experiences. True events. I took the time to speak up against an illegal attack on Cuba. While I was in the Navy. Most people can have an exciting life too if they will just turn off the TV get out of their apartment  go fight the war machine. Even by making another great film like Joyeux. There are still great battles to be won  it can be fun based on true events. You will survive  have fun in the long run.We Vets for Peace are now doing marches in all 50 state capitals July 4th 2006 to bring the US troops back home before Christmas 2006. Please join us 415.";

	schema:headline " Merry Christmas is wonderful yet disposable entertainment...";
	schema:reviewBody "On Christmas eve in the First World War an unexpected truce was agreed upon by the warring French Germans and the Scotsman contingent of the British army. The truce began when extenor turned German private Sprink Benno Furmann gave an apt rendition of Silent Night which the Scotsmen quickly offered to accompany with their bagpipes. Feeling the Christmas spirit despite their hometown being invaded by the Germans the French agreed to celebrate Christmas eve with their enemies. Undeniably schmaltzy and melodramatic Merry Christmas seems to be doomed to be in the company of other schmaltzy films like Pay it Forward or Benigni's Life is Beautiful. However one has to look beyond the evident schmaltziness and keep one's cynicism at an alltime low to truly enjoy the film which I thought was decently made and truly touching. After all one cannot fault writerdirector Christian Carion as the film was based on recorded events that truly happened during World War I. I think Carion tried his best to make the film as grounded and as realistic as possible although sometimes his screenplay gets a bit too oratorical and his direction gets a bit too overhanded with his overuse of the musical score. Carion promptly neutralizes the fuzzy feelings that are generated by warring men playing football and poker on Christmas Day by immediately portraying the sad repercussions of the men's fraternizing with their enemies. I thought that was a very welcome addition to bring back the audience from its suspension of disbelief to a more realistic ground that despite the innate humanity in everyone's heart politics and the irrationalities of war still determine the fates of these men. There are also some technical aspects that I feel could've been polished a bit more. The lipsynching of the songs is quite obvious and very distracting especially since its hard to believe that Diane Kruger can belt out those high and strong note with her anorexic frame. Merry Christmas is wonderful yet disposable entertainment. It is France's submission to the Oscars and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nod as it possesses almost everything that the Oscars want  a war film with themes of peace and humanity and of course the resulting emotion of fuzziness and pride for one's humanity. 12".

The director does a brilliant job in depicting three military units like the Germans French and the Scottish who are fighting the first Christmas away from their loved ones and facing an invisible enemy. While they stop and have informal and unauthorized ceasefire on Christmas Eve. The soldiers whether German Scottish or French begin a platonic fraternization of brotherhood. It's nice to see a film about war that isn't. As they become friends they share good times even for a brief time. Their leaders will face the consequences of resisting to continue battling in no mans land. Yet there are beautiful moments like when they start singing together and playing music.

	schema:reviewBody "Among the many films that take place during Christmas most succeed in entertaining. Some give a credible message of hope with which audiences genuinely identify.However only two movies of which I know succeed in moving audiences and rekindling their hope in the virtues of which mankind is capable It's A Wonderful Life 1946 and this movie.Joyeux Noel is not just a Christmas movie. I imagine anyone who sees this film will make an emotional connection to it regardless of their race color or creed.Based on a true story the film chronicles the start of what was then known as the Great War but what we know today as World War I. It's hard to believe when you read about WWI in a text book but at the time it was the bloodiest war in then recent memory.It's also easy to forget how senseless the war actually was from the very beginning. However this film succeeds in emphasizing the inhumanity of war through a brilliant beginning montage of children from England France and Germany reciting actual text from each nation's respective official war declarations.Putting children in these parts was a smart move because your attention wouldn't perk up if an adult was saying these lines. When children are seriously discussing war in a classroom and not on the playground you know something's amiss. Adding to the cold authenticity the children speak in their own languages.Joyeux Noel was filmed and financed in France Germany Romania and Scotland. It's important to note this fact because if it got near Hollywood EVERYONE in it would be speaking English a move that regularly damages the credibility of many American films that take place overseas.The film continues showing civilians from France Germany and Scotland right when war breaks out in 1914. One young Scottish man is excited to enlist stating that it is the start of his life. His local priest Father Palmer Gary Lewis is not so sure.You are also introduced to two famous German opera singers who are also lovers Anna Sorenson Diane Kruger and Nikolaus Sprink Benno Furmann whose voices are heaven sent. Neither singer is required to enlist in the Great War but they are both sent to the German front lines to entertain the troops on Christmas Eve.After a few more introductions we see the Western Front of the war in France with French German and Scottish soldiers engaging in combat that is far from romantic. You see the trenches not so much of the actual combat but you don't have to guess how ugly the war actually was.Even worse these soldiers are fighting on Christmas Eve when many of them looked forward to returning home to their families. Eventually what begins as Anna and Nikolaus singing for the German soldiers results in the lieutenants of each platoon agreeing to a Christmas Day ceasefire. However thanks to these opera singers what further evolves becomes something more uplifting and moving than just a day off.In 1914 the Great War was far from over. To those fighting in it there seemed to be no end in sight. However on that Christmas Eve as this film so brilliantly elaborates the battle grounds became an actual common ground for all the troops. Seeing that gradual metamorphosis of the land and the soldiers is truly breathtaking.From this point of the movie on you may become an opera fan if you weren't one before seeing this film. You will look at the World War I German army in a far better way if you're an American or British person. World War II may be a different story but go along with me here.Finally you may never listen to Adeste Fideles the Latin version of O Come All Ye Faithful the same way again. It's even more astounding how great holiday songs become better through the darkest of times and that is probably the point of the entire movie.Just like It's A Wonderful Life Joyeux Noel details a bleak time in history and shows how the human spirit of generosity can make a world of difference through even the darkest times. The comparisons to the 1946 classic don't stop there.Joyeux Noel has a story line that gradually builds to a grand conclusion and the sum of the previous events is not equal to its parts. Like It's A Wonderful Life the thrill is seeing how all the circumstances come together to create that conclusion. It may be complicated to detail to friends but once you see the movie you realize it's more profound than just cocktail party chatter.While these two movies differ greatly in their plots they also have a few other things in common. Joyeux Noel with a budget of 22000000 made less than that worldwide thereby making it a flop. It also was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2005 but lost.However just like It's A Wonderful Life it will be considered a classic soon. It may not be next year but it could be 10 years from now or even 20. It's not just an entertaining film but a truly great and important film.There are no magic tricks in this film to remind the characters about the true meaning of the holiday season and for good reason. Kindness and charity are things of which all humans are capable even in terrible times. Joyeux Noel gets that idea. I only hope that others who see this remarkable cinematic achievement will take away that message and still come back to the movie year after year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clandestine Childhood is a coming of age story with a difference. As the title suggests it is growing up under secrecy. The film is set in 70's Argentina where the military junta rules the country and opposition groups are clandestinely active. We follow a 12 year old son of one of these revolutionary couples who is growing up under a cloud of secrecy to protect the identity of his parents. The boy is a normal child who wants to invite his friends home have a girlfriend and all that but can not do so due to the risk of exposing his parents who are wanted by the military dictatorship.The politics and the history though ever present are kept firmly in the background and the film focuses on the boy's story. The fact that the film is based partly on the director's own childhood and specially knowing as he told the audience after a screening that his mother was one of the disappeared during that era makes the film very poignant. An added bonus is the great music in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Infancia Clandestina is a very touching movie. This review is written by an Argentinian so I felt it as a very interesting film in terms of script and acting but more interesting as a historical testimony of our dark ages in terms of dictatorship and guerrilla. It would be fair to write the review in Spanish in order to put my feelings properly but IMDb is mostly an English language site so I want to give other people from foreign countries my point of view with the little English I speak.From my perspective the movie is accurately told in terms of storyline. I would recommend it as a documentary because Benjamn Avila relived his own experience on this movie and because most of the facts really happened with the names changed and that sort of thing. The fact that underlines the tragic story of JuanErnesto is that he is as a child forced to live in a world of fear constantly missing what we think a normal childhood should be. His parents are loving ones but put him in abnormal situations in terms of caring for their livings and raise their children in those violent conditions. In fact the story of the 70's here was that fearful and violent. You are obliged to take a part in the story. That's what the film left me. It's a thought provoking one. And asks a lot of questions more than it tells answers. Ernesto Alterio very good in his role as To Beto is the bond of JuanErnesto to a happy childhood but even with knowing how his life could end from one moment to another tried to remind JuanErnesto and the rest of the family those little moments of humanity that could have been forgotten in the middle of tragedy. There is plenty of humanity but that feeling is volatile and more close to selfindulgence than true happiness knowing the curse of events.On the other hand the guiding line of JuanErnesto's family is that he 'd become one of their soldiers when he'd grown up. Rootless full of hate for losing one by one his loved ones JuanErnesto becomes an adult from one day to another. But this review is not complete if I don't give you a personal opinion of the whole situation. Ideologies partidisms dogma they all conceived death as a part of them. During the movie I often compared the situation with Islamic children or whoever is forced to live in war since a child. They are children and they are manipulated taking part on massacres kidnaps war and dismemberance of their families. They are brutally witnessing the grownups stupidity the absurd sacrifice. Yes it was absurd then and it's absurd now. And that's the thing with the title of this review. Even a kid could realize the barbarism the destruction of life that is presented in the movie. Unfortunately there is little room for choice. I'm not in position to judge the events since I was born after the dictatorship. I'm a son of democracy whatever that means and those stories are told to me but fortunately I didn't have to live those tragic times. But I feel sorry for those kids who had a sad childhood and couldn't choose for a better life. And I blame the dictatorship as well as the contraire ideologies that put them in those awful and despicable situations. Coming back to the movie it's a must. Even if you're not Argentinian. It's beautiful and a bit surrealistic. And it makes you think that some things can never be repeated for our children's sake.Greetings from Argentina!".

I am satisfied and glad I saw it which was loosely based on the director's real life story when he was a child.This story was told from the perspective of a kid called Juan. His parents are the activists during the Cold War known as the Dirty War. After their return to the home country with different names Juan joins the school known as Ernesto. He finds hard to understand his parents' behaviour but comfortably settles with his new fake name with a little help from his uncle. The problem arises when his true identity matters the most. Whether he reveals or not is the crux of the movie's end.In my recent watch I had seen the people who struggle while protesting in a country's revolution. It might be based on real like 'NO' or fictional like 'Night Train to Lisbon' but majority of them end in heartbreak tragedy. Similarly this movie opened its account in a simple manner like most of the drama that based on the revolution theme. Yes of course it confuses at first about what's going on then slowly explain the situation. But all the difference and racy pace emerge suddenly in the last quarter of the movie. Till then I was in the movie trying to concentrate but then instantly put me on the edge of my seat with cute romance and followed by thriller. That the end portion of the story of last 1015 minutes took the movie to the heights.Yes like I said the movie kicks off with a slow and boring pace with nothing much to enjoy earlier and ends in a style.

The title says 'warriors from hell' but I do not recall any menacing looking demons or a single piece of special effects for that matterAnd I'm not counting that wizard's teleportation move which was as stupid as it sounded. The lines are very stupid and I really loathe the wizard's acting especially with his goat wandering rambling. Traxartis for some reason talks like he is out of breath for no apparent reason. The princess is brain gratingly terrible. Mr Relson was the best of the bunch he acted like a smug basd really well. The commentary is great I love the lines like 'hehe! daughter smart!' and 'I have an idea shut up!'. And who could forget 'potatoes are what we eat!'".

Well you see nothing of any interest actually happens! Sure there is some glorious overacting especially from Thom Christopher some atrociously choreographed sword fights enough daft scenes to sink a Frigate and some exceptionally stupid dialogue....all the things in fact that any self respecting BMovie should boast however it all feels strangely flat here.Even the usual nudity quotient is ominously low in this instalment!

This egregiously bad 80's sword swinger ranks up there with the Ator the Fighting Eagle series as the worst of all time.The main character is a smug sleazy idiot with a bad 80's hairdo and an accent that fluctuates more than the stock market did on Black Tuesday. No woman in her right mind would touch him which explains why his love interest in the film is four barrels short of a load. His enemy is a guy who wears more furs and turbans than Liza and gasps out his lines like he's trying to act during an asthma attack. Rounding out this cast is a really annoying princess a stupid wizard who's the lost member of ZZ Top and a sorceress with a grating voice who tries to roast our hero's nutsmy favorite part of the film by the way.The movie starts out in a villageRenn Fest where Deathstalker is being his usual smug oily self. He impresses the local yokels by fighting a guy while standing on a log then goes to a fortune tellerwizard to get his fortune told. I pretty much know what the guy would have told him that his film career was over and he should take that job at the car dealership but he never got that far because the bushy bearded wiz was in conference with a princess carrying a giant faux crystal door handle. The wizard was toting one of these hideous kitsch baubles around as well and apparently when you put them together it is a key that unlocks a fabulous city full of wealthyeah right. Some men wearing metal bats on their heads attack and the wizard disappears by spinning rapidly. He leaves his shoes behind making you wondermost horribly why he didn't leave his clothes behind as well. The princess takes off with our hero and promptly gets killed before she can slap him to head off his sleazy sexual advances. She gives him the Airwick air freshener so that he can go find the other one himself. It would cut his body odor wonderfully.Cut to a later timewhere the bad guy Truxartis? is doing his best Broadway musical singer imitation while going on about how he means to find the other stone and use its magical power for his own thing. He brings some guys back from the dead using the powers of deepest blackest Hell so that they could lounge around his castle pretty much doing nothing. There was a waste of magic. Deathstalker meanwhile has met the dead princess's twin? sister who is on her way to marry ol feather and furs Truxartis. He also meets his love interest a fairly slow and rather strange girl with amazingly big hair and a problem with bathing. Her and he get along well together not a big surprise.The movie devolves into a quagmire at this point with plot points trailing off into nothing one after the other. The dead guys catch up with Deathstalker but instead of killing him as they should they pretty much do what they've done throughout the moviewhich is nothing. The princess arrives at the castle dresses in a silly looking faux harem costume and spends the rest of the movie whining. The sorceress tortures idiot boy the only detraction from the pleasure of this scene being the fact that he's wearing only the tightest of tights while she does this. Arrgh! The scrubby bearded wizard shows up again nobody knows why is captured and tortured by the femme fatale Truxartis and is rescued by Deathstalker in a really lame fighting scene. Deathstalker frees the souls of the dead guys by giving them a mason jar which was no loss to anyone since they were neither scary nor effective and terminally lazy to boot. Truxartis comes to his stupid end the princess and the wizard move into the fabulous citydidn't look that fabulous to me but since the whole budget for the entire movie seems to have been about five dollars and some bags of peanuts that's not really surprising and Deathstalker rides off into the sunset where we hope he gets a severe sunburn.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deathstalker III Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell surpasses Deathstalker II Duel of the Titans. John Terlesky and company in Deathstalker II might as well have been swatting at each other with tennis rackets for all the swashbuckling thrills and chills that the tame first sequel failed to deliver. John Allen Nelson of Hunk looks like he could be the eponymous character. Mind you Nelson is no match for Rick Hill but he is a hundred times better than Terlesky and Mexican director Alfonso Corona shuns the juvenile antics that Jim Wynorski emphasized in Deathstalker II. Moreover nobody gives an embarrassing performance in Deathstalker III that compares with the truly abysmal performance of Monique Gabrielle. Although it isn't as campy as its pathetic predecessor Deathstalker III contains some humor. Director Corona prefers to play things along the lines of the straight and narrow. For example a secondary character dies under tragic circumstances so this second sequel isn't as lightweight as the first sequel. The only flaw in the original Deathstalker was the death of our hero's companion too early in the action. Conversely the character of Marinda here is introduced early in the action and survives until the finale when she helps our unarmed protagonist defeat the villain.Deathstalker scenarist Howard Cohen sticks to the formula of the strong man who rescues a comely princess from the clutches of an evil sorcerer. Occasionally Corona and Cohen generate a modicum of suspense particularly in Deathstalker's torture scene and Cohen scores with one major surprise that enhances the action. Further Cohen has an adolescent character that is good with a bow and arrow appear at opportune moments but he foreshadows the child's skill with the weapon. Basically Deathstalker III revolves around two multifaceted white stones that when combined will yield their power. These two stones will take the owner to Erendor the city of lost treasure. The villainous tyrant of Southland Troxartes Thom Christopher of NBCTV's Buck Rogers of the 25th Century possesses one stone while Deathstalker winds up with the second stone. He obtained his stone from a princess running around incognito to find a wizard. Indeed Carissa Carla Herd of Wild Zone in a dual role has spent the last three years searching for Nicias veteran Mexican actor Aarn Hernn who wanders from village to village prophesying about the villagers' future. One cool looking villain Inaros Roger Cudney of The Border rides around with batwings attached to either side of his helmet. This entry in the quartet of sword and sorcery sagas was lensed on location in Mexico but it is still a lowrent Roger Corman spectacle. The orchestral music by Alejandro Rulfo and Israel Torres captures the atmosphere of this mockheroic nonsense and Troxartes makes good use of a falcon as his eyes in the skies.The first scene in Deathstalker III resembles the opening scene in Conan the Barbarian when the evil warriors stormed a village killed most of the inhabitants and captured young Conan. Deathstalker is enjoying himself at a village festival swapping blows with an adversary on a felled tree as they battle with long sticks. At the same time the long grayhaired wizard Nicias tells those who can afford his prices what their future holds. Nicias wears a long fur robe. Carissa has been looking for Nicias and shows him her half of the stone hoping the wizard to have the other half. Suddenly warriors on horseback wearing ominous armory ride into the village and start slaying people. Deathstalker fights them long enough for Nicias to escape and vanish into thin air with only his smoking footwear to note his presence. Carissa flees and she winds up in Deathstalker's camp where she identifies herself as a princess. Deathstalker is amused by his luck. Why is it I keep getting mixed up with princesses? Carissa tells him about Erendor and its treasure. Enough to make my people strong forever she assures him. Deathstalker isn't impressed. Here I go again riding hundreds of miles fighting whole armies up against magic maybe. In the end all I will get is flowers on my heading telling me how wonderful I am.No sooner has Deathstalker seen his future than the same warriors who raided the village strike his camp and kill Carissa. She gives the stone to Deathstalker. Before she dies Carissa tells Deathstalker about her sister Belizean. According to Carissa It was either me or my sister and she cannot put on her own shoes. This description fits Elizena. Later after Deathstalker eludes Troxartes he stumbles into a valley looking for a horse. He tries to steal one from a mother and daughter who live in the valley and live on a diet of potatoes. Marinda Claudia Inchaurregui of The Bikini War is the daughter who hasn't set foot outside the valley and has never made love to a man. Marinda lets Deathstalker deflower her and then leads him out of the valley. Mom believes that Deathstalker has abducted her daughter so she leads Troxartes' army after them. Once he is safely away Deathstalker runs into Carissa's sister Elizena and Elizena is every inch the stuckup princess that we're used to seeing. Troxartes yearns for the second stone. His mistress Camisarde Terri Treas of All That Jazz asks him Aren't you rich enough without one more jewel? She goes on to add You own every inch of land and peasant between here and the sea and me if you ever noticed. Troxartes points out That city is power. The magic of a thousand generations lives in the stones of its wall waiting to erupt by the one who puts these stone together. When this is complete the world is mine. With it I'll live forever! Deathstalker III is a relief after the abomination of Deathstalker II.".

To me nothing is more annoying in a fantasy movie than when the elements of fantasy are yanked from other movies that did a good jobFor example Almost every Fred Olen Ray movie you can get your hands on will have stolen footage of stop motion dinosaurs from a masterpiece called planet of the dinosaurs. Deathstalker 2 and 4 are horrible about this problem. they feature minutes upon minutes of unmistakable battle scenes from the first deathstalker. Now I suppose part 3 isnt entirely innocent since it yanks the theme song from battle beyond the stars but thats okay. Also I would like to mention that people who see a cover of a deathstalker movie and are disappointed to find the movie is nothing like it are falling for the oldest trick in the exploitation book. Deathstalker 3 is by no means a classic. its a little bit boring and this time the guy playing deathstalker isn't as cool but I give it much credit for not showing me scenes from the other movies in the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell 8 out of 10 John Allen Nelson fills the shoes of the titular Deathstalker in this third outing as he looks to find the second half of a magical stone that promises great riches.The Good There is a phrase tone that gets bandied about often and it is hard to quantify. Some movies just have the right tone that makes them enjoyable beyond any reasonable expectation Thor Ragnarok would be an example of a movie that delivers on a happy adventure level. Flesh and Blood is a great example of one that delivers on a much darker level. Deathstalker and The Warriors from Hell has so many elements that are so wrong they simply gel together into something so right. A perfect feelgood movie to turn off ye olde brain and enjoy a Saturday evening with friends.The Bad Pretty much everything. The swords are more wooden than the actors. The sets are from a high school production of Camelot. Parts of the film looks like it was filmed in a renaissance festival run by Irish travelers. John Allen Nelson looks and acts like he should be playing Steve Guttenberg's college roommate in an eighties comedy about a magic invisible bikini.The Ugly Main villain Thom Christopher brings the bad to a whole new level. When we first meet him he is in full medieval plate armor with bat wings attached to the helmet no really but before long he is in his castle doing his oneman show Faye Dunaway is Joan Crawford in Thom Christopher's epic dialogue Wire Hangers. His fight scene in an outfit that would be more appropriate on Meryl Streep as a mother with latestage breast cancer circa 1986 is more modern dance or perhaps a harem seduction than an actual sword battle.In Conclusion There is a movie called Ulli Lommel's Black Dahlia which has dozens of well deserved onestar reviews on IMDB. Into that mix is my 7 out of 10 review with the following quote.When a pigtailed catholic schoolgirl and two masked guys dance around with severed limbs to a Sinatra tune you simply can't wipe the smile off my face.This movie puts a smile on my face. The potato lady. The batwing helmet. The fact the titular Warriors from Hell would rather just go to the pub. Sorry I can't wipe the smile off my face.".

His arrogance comes off angering and his attempts at sexuality come off as repulsive. You don't believe that anyone has ever desired his help or praised him. Plus his accent lasts about 2 lines.Second the support characters are laughable. The princess is wooden and unpleasant. The other characters are overacted and thoroughly unbelievableespecially in the case of Thom Christopher Troxartas.Lastly it is possible to make a good movie with a low budget. It is also possible to turn this type of movie into lighthearted and fun. But with the hideous characters bad editing and vague plot this movie feels pained and leaves you caring less what happened and praying they didn't make Deathstalker 4.The only positive thing I can say is that the MST3K crew does a decent job of poking fun at it although it is obviously painful for them as well.".

Not as much death as I'd hoped but he does stalk several women in the film who's acting makes plankton eligible for academy award nomination.  I swear I felt bile churning...not in a good way but that was the whole Renaissance Festival fiasco gone horribly dull.  Mike  the bots had to watch this a lot...it shows in the skits.

Deathstalker slaps Cave Dwellers around like Ike Turner.  There's a quest I think and stars a guy who auditioned for The Greatest American Hero and got rejected miserably.  Not as much death as I'd hoped but he does stalk several women in the film who's acting makes plankton eligible for academy award nomination.  I swear I felt bile churning...not in a good way but that was the whole Renaissance Festival fiasco gone horribly dull.  Mike  the bots had to watch this a lot...it shows in the skits.  Oh don't forget sexually repressed wife who finds solace in sadistic torture with vials of melting....thing.  I think there's a spaceship and vicious canids and....oh wait.However I really did detest Cave Dwellers after first viewing.  MaybeDeathstalker will grow on me....then I will get it cauterized.";

The Conan movies may have been escapist pulp the 2nd one may have been misguided and inept but they obviously had the money and the production talent to LOOK good. Nothing looks good here and it short circuits everything the actors are trying to do. The director seems to be fond of his material but he has no ability to mold it into anything compelling or even interesting. It is apparent that DSTWFH is counting heavily on whatever good will the first two movies in the Deathstalker franchise generated. The filmmakers seemed to have swapped out the original actor for a new guy cut the budget and production quality back to Direct To VideoMade For TV levels seriously can you imagine this getting a theatrical US release EVEReven in the late '80s? and generally done everything they could to kill the series dead. Apparently there was a Deathstalker IV though the mind shudders to think of what it must have been like. What little I know about the DS series implies that it tried to distinguish itself in later episodes by being somewhat tongue in cheek and by featuring DS as a rogueish overconfident adventurer. In modern terms his mouth tends to write checks that his body can't cash. That's a decent idea even if The Sword And The Sorceror hadn't already done it but in DS III the script takes the concept way too far by playing the hero as a smug bastard. The new guy RelsonNelson gives the role a game try and he works pretty hard to get his part over but alas he can't even maintain a consistent accent or speech rhythm from scene to scene a dialog coach might have helped. Also a fight choreographer who gave a damn. Sean Connery himself couldn't rescue the part from the low level hijinks presented here and Mr. RelsonNelson doesn't even come close to carrying it off.Similarly annoying is Thom Christopher as the villain Troxartas. Thom actually has some genuine acting moxie  he's the most interesting actor in the film in an overblown hammy way. And Christopher is obviously trying to bring an unorthodox effeteanddecadentbutstilldangerous flavor to his character. But everything he tries every line he delivers just goes wrong for him. None of his choices or the directors or even the costume designers' work at all and he's just irritatingly hilariously bad.The romantic lead lady who plays identical twins BTW is decent looking but she's a stiff here she's utterly miscast for a fantasyadventure movie. She must have realized early into the movie that her part was worthless and so she basically sticks one expression on her face and keeps it there for the entire movie. She doesn't help the movie but she doesn't really hurt it any worse than anyone else  she's just a placeholder. I actually feel sorry for the actress and I hope she went on to better things. So the movie has bad acting from the principles. It has bad writing. Bad costumes it looks like Christopher had to wear his own laundry castoffs for his role. There's a lame soundtrack. There's some of the least convincing fight choreography in the history of Sword and Sorcery movies. There are dozens of lines of dialog that must have looked good on paper but which invariably clink like a lead washer on a sidewalk in the mouths of the actors. If the movie has a saving grace it's that it doesn't seem to take itself very seriously so its not completely loathsome. In fact this is actually a better made movie than perennial Bottom 100 dweller The Cave Dwellers which took itself utterly seriously. However DSTWFH doesn't have the central focus point of Miles OKeefe's cartoon superhero physique to distract the viewer from the mediocrity of the proceedings.Who would enjoy it? DSTWFH is only for the Sword and Sorcery fanatic who will watch ANYTHING as long as it is set in a medievalfantasy setting with archaic costumes and affected speech rhythms. Even if you are such a fan don't spend money to own it or watch it under any circumstances. Well maybe 2.00 for a DVD at the bottom of the remaindered DVD pile at WalMart. You can always use it as a coaster or a skeet shooting disk.".

When you end up hating the protagonist of the film you are watching RUN!!!!!!! I am not even going to comment on the story. It is something to do with twin sisters and this bad guy named Troxartis sic who want to control this army of ghosts who don't look so much like ghosts as they do like knights who have spent too much time in an abandoned warehouse. All of this leads to fittingly enough a nonsensical action climax where the heroine dies but no one is affected by it. Also the princess not the heroine I know I know is a whiny brat. Not that I can blame her seeing that her rescuer is a complete jerk.All of the other aspects of this production are atrocious as well sets music costumes editing etc. There is some hammy acting from Thom Christopher as Troxartis and his wife whose name I can't remember. But they cannot even begin to salvage the train wreck of this movie. BTW what Deathstalker wears in the torture scene is gross. So watch the version on MST 3K.

However somewhere there has to be a line drawn and Deathstalker crosses it. When i first saw this film i didn't know it was third in a series I bought it second hand without a cover. However after trying to watch this I was scared at how bad it was. I don't mind films being made for a laugh and just being done to take the micky out of itself that's one of the the things that makes films like Cherry Falls some of my favorite films. This one however just makes me cringe because of how badly it is made. I couldn't finish the film I just couldn't take anymore of it. I lost the plot halfway through because it just seemed to fizzle out. After steeling myself for a second attempt I still couldn't find it. It was very very hard going to watch. The acting wasn't even second rate it barely deserves third rate. As stated I couldn't find a plot I really lost it half way through and had to force myself to keep watching. Its not even that I don't like the style of film I actually love the medievalfantasy type of film. Conan the Barbarian and Red Sonia are examples of this type of film that i really love its just that Deathstalker doesn't have a decent script or actors like those films do. I later tried watching this film with MST3K insulation and even with the help of Joel and the Bots I barely made it the whole film and was none the wiser to the plot. I love MST3K and this is the only MST3K that i nearly didn't watch to the end. Truly a candidate for worst film of all time. Watch only if you really have literally nothing else to do at all and watch with MST3K insulation that makes it almost bearable. A grudging one out of two.".

A young woman Carrisa seeks the wizard Nicias about information regarding half of the stone she has in her possession. An evil ruler Troxartas has the other half of the stone. His band of men invade the festival seeking the wizard as well because they believe Nicias has the stone.Carrisa escapes with Deathstalker and Nicias escapes as well. Soon though Troxartas' men catch up to Deathstalker's camp and manage to kill Carrisa. She gives Deathstalker the stone and in her last moments charges him with completing her quest of bringing the two stones together.From here Deathstalker faces many challenges on the way to completing the quest. Through out the quest Troxartas men are constantly tailing him and there is constant action. He befriends a young lady who only eats potatoes. He even runs into enemies he's killed who he ends up turning them against their master. Overall the movie follows a fairly played story line so expect the typical ending. Not that this is bad just typical.The story of this movie is OK however there's a lot of problems with the production. It's just not very well done as a whole. John Nelson who play's Deathstalker doesn't even resemble all the elements he boasts to be as the character. Aaron Hernan as Nicias does OK as the wizard and I enjoyed the spinning entryexit spell. Carla Herd plays the dual role of twin princesses she's quite attractive and performs her role decently.The action scenes leave a lot to be desired they remind of effects from movies made 20 years before this one. For example there's very little blood and it's obvious the old sword side stab trick is used throughout the battle scenes. The music is fairly irritating although less so at times. There seem to be parts where synthesizers were used and these seem to be the most irritating moments of the soundtrack. 210".

I kind of liked the original Levottomat as I could identify myself with the main character and I also thought the story and casting were quite good. This of course doesn't mean the sequels are equally good not at all. Usually the sequels simply are cheap imitations and fail miserably.Levottomat 3 proves my case only partially. The story behind all the glitter bad directing and bad acting feels all right at the first glance. Although I would think the idea of female sex addict isn't yet approved by the great public not even by all females. Whatever the case the story is semi decent. The same can't be said about casting choice of actors and directing. I wouldn't like to be disrespectful against miss Grnlund or miss Virtanen but one of them or both together ruined this movie. The sex doctorpsychologist performs equally bad and is extremely unbelievable. Show me a psychologist who would judge someone after just few words said in a emotional storm or as in the case of this movie a slightly darker cloud not a storm? The actors equal to products of human product replacement. Simply horrible and unbelievable.As I said in the beginning the story is quite all right. The only flaw is that the movie is simply unbelievable. I entertain myself with the idea of this being directed and acted by someone else. I smiled slightly for the thought of Kati Outinen being Jonna and Sakari Kuosmanen being Niklas. I would definitely buy the whole thing bit easier. I wish it was set in a bit less glamorous atmosphere in the first place. Come on an architect and a big ad guru? Nobody believes that. How about clerk and accountant? Car repairman and housewife? Waitress and construction worker? Anyway one of the worst ones I have seen 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Kieslowski's colour trilogy must had been some sort of an inspiration to all the unattached trilogies we're having these days. Producer Markus Selin is one of the most influential producers in the Finnish film scene and is often credited as the man who brought Finnish commercial cinema back after some 40 years of absence in late 1990's.The so called Restlesstrilogy was meant to be a series of films directed by young directors about the state of the young adults in Finland. A great subject and a great idea although one could see the commercial aspects of this moneymaking early 30's demographics shine through.The first part of the trilogy Levottomat Restless 1999can be seen as a huge success for Finnish cinema being controversial sexy and very much tapped into the moment in time as well as the subject. The second part Min ja Morrison Me and Morrison 2001 was slightly dimmer success as for some reason it wasn't marketed as the second part. The film and acting were good though the story ended a little suddenly and the deeper aspects of modern young adulthood were more absent than in Levottomat.The third part i.e. Levottomat 3 Restless 3 2004 was a complete letdown of the trilogy. Huge skindeep marketing poor acting poor dialogue poor story and safe and pop choices in casting made sure that the audience felt sick about the whole trilogy. It is told that screenwriters resigned throughout the project and in the end it was just pure bad luck that the last one's name ended up in the credits. Whereas the earlier parts got their young directors to a beginning of a promising career this one must had been the worst callcard for the poor director who obviously didn't know what sort of a moneymaking machinery she was getting into.Sure I should write something about the film itself. Well dialogue in Oxford Finnish is the first thing to take you of the mood of getting into the story. The story itself about sexaddicted young mother getting derailed for her ambitions has a certain contemporary touch to it but the solid numb acting between her and his husband and her and the new lover of doom leaves everyone stone cold. The plot shows how things get from bad to worse and then a shimmering happyish ending.I think the only positive thing in this film was to tie it to the contemporary Helsinki scenery at the time when the nations biggest building project Kamppi commercial and traffic centre was being built right in the middle of the city. Well that's about it.".

Meanwhile her client and TV sex therapist Nora Amira Khalifa identifies her problem and offers to help Jonna to control her sex drive. But like any addicted Jonna believes she can control her sexual impulses and refuses Nora's offer. Levottomat 3 is a sensual but never vulgar drama about a woman that has her life destroyed by her sex addiction. The engaging and erotic story has a good screenplay and performances of an unknown cast. The sexy and gorgeous Mi Grnlund is perfect in the role of a nymphomaniac mother and wife that does not recognize her problem and is ashamed to talk with her beloved husband about her sex drive. I bought this DVD a long time ago but the unfair IMDb User Rating had not encouraged me to watch this Finnish film. Yesterday late night I decided to watch it to help me to sleep and on the contrary I saw Levottomat 3 until the very last funny scene in the credits.

I want to dislike Levottomat 3 but to my dismay I find myself enjoying certain scenes but as soon as the movie has started to win me over it more or less shoots itself in the foot and I go back to disliking it. It's a bit sad because I can see potential in this movie but somehow the film makers haven't really succeeded in bring that potential out and in the end Levottomat 3 just gives me mixed feelings.It definitely isn't a good film but it isn't really a bad one either it's more of a dull film if anything. Everything seems so normal and so bland the story is too low key be a movie even the sex wich is rather vivid almost like censored porn doesn't add enough excitement to catch the viewers interest. However it must be said that this is not as aggressively boring as some of the other films on the IMDb bottom 100 list. That I think is what bugs me with this its not good enough nor bad enough to be memorable its just extremely mediocre. Except for some intense scenes close to the end that quickly dissolve into blandness this movie is thoroughly meh.".

It's a bit sad because I can see potential in this movie but somehow the film makers haven't really succeeded in bring that potential out and in the end Levottomat 3 just gives me mixed feelings.It definitely isn't a good film but it isn't really a bad one either it's more of a dull film if anything.

And that's what we get here a charming dazzling and ultimately Moving film that explores as if for the first time ageold concerns.  Serrault has been here before in Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud so this is a good time to deal with the six degrees of separation aspect.  In 'Nelly' Serrault was the older man and Manu Beart the younger woman in Manon des Source Manu Beart tended goats and here Mathilde Seigneur does the same thing.  So much for trivia. They really put more than the usual five minutes thought into this one because the credits come up over breathtaking aeriel shots of the Vercours and you can see why so many English people are inspired to buy second homes in France or even move there entirely. This is reinforced when in the first sequence we cut to Sandrine Seigneur caught up in a traffic jam in Paris and looking thoughtfully at a travel poster of Vercours on a bus in front of her.  This is economical storytelling and in the very next scene she is telling her mother of her decision to move to the Vercours  in the Rhone Alps  and become a goatfarmer. The mother can't understand natch why a girl born and bred in Paris and a successful computer instructor would want to give it all up to become a sort of recluse about town.  So we get the argument out of the way in the first reel.  Sandrine is a gifted student one of the best in Agricultural school and soon she is ready to invest 450000 Francs in a remote goat farm.  The farm belongs to old Adrien Michel Serrault and he comes with it at least til he can move into his new flat in Grenoble some 18 months away.  We are now ready for the classic battle of Old versus New Young versus Old initial antagonism giving way to mutual affection.  Like I said we've seen it all before. But what we HAVEN'T seen before is two Class Acts like Serrault and Seigneur and what they serve up is pure DELIGHT.  We are spared nothing this isn't a Travelogue because after an idyllic Summer comes the Winter of Discontent so bad that Seigneur seriously considers throwing in the towel.  Essentially a twohander that stands or falls by the the quality of the two pricipals it is also fleshed out with really strong support in the shape of Adrien's neighbor and contemporary Sandrine's colleague from Paris and sometime lover and her mother.  This is the kind of movie that Hollywood has completely forgotten how to make and which the accountants who run the place wouldn't sanction anyway.  Thank God the French and other European countries can still turn them out like this.  1010".

	schema:headline " The farm";
	schema:reviewBody "Sandrine a Parisian young woman who works in computers has had it! She announces to her mother that after taken the course in agriculture she is going to buy a farm and leave Paris. The training she must undergo is not for the feint hearted or people with weak stomachs. The graduates must know all there is to know in order to run a successful business under hard conditions.The farm Sandrine sets her eyes on is owned by Adrien a lonely man of a certain age who has had it. He plans to move with his relatives in Grenoble. The farm he owned and worked all his life is in the RhoneAlpes region of France. Situated on a picturesque spot in that area Sandrine buys it and begins to transform the place. Adrien's only condition is that he wants to stay in his own house for the next eighteen months. Sandrine who wants to get the farm agrees.It becomes clear from the start Adrien doesn't think much of Sandrine's methods. Being computer savvy she begins to sell her goat cheeses in the Internet. She also takes in guests in the modern barn she transformed. Sandrine also doesn't quite like the old man because she perceives how much he doesn't approve of her changes to his farm. Adrien who begins to warm up to the girl makes the first move to annoy Sandrine by doing something to the electricity. That sends her to ask his help in letting her stay with him as it has snowed heavily and her place is freezing.Adrien begins to relax around the young woman as he lets her know about himself and the life he and his wife had together in the farm. Little by little both come together and form a bond that will not be broken because both learn to care for the other one.Christian Carion directed this tale about two lonely souls that are much alike but live in separate worlds. The film is sympathetic to the young woman who decides to pack her glamorous job and make a living on her own in another field. The great asset the director had was the casting of Mathilde Seigner and veteran actor Michel Serrault who must have suffered an accident judging by the way his face looks.

	onyx:emotionText "Sandrine a Parisian young woman who works in computers has had it! She announces to her mother that after taken the course in agriculture she is going to buy a farm and leave Paris. The training she must undergo is not for the feint hearted or people with weak stomachs. The graduates must know all there is to know in order to run a successful business under hard conditions.The farm Sandrine sets her eyes on is owned by Adrien a lonely man of a certain age who has had it. He plans to move with his relatives in Grenoble. The farm he owned and worked all his life is in the RhoneAlpes region of France. Situated on a picturesque spot in that area Sandrine buys it and begins to transform the place. Adrien's only condition is that he wants to stay in his own house for the next eighteen months. Sandrine who wants to get the farm agrees.It becomes clear from the start Adrien doesn't think much of Sandrine's methods. Being computer savvy she begins to sell her goat cheeses in the Internet. She also takes in guests in the modern barn she transformed. Sandrine also doesn't quite like the old man because she perceives how much he doesn't approve of her changes to his farm. Adrien who begins to warm up to the girl makes the first move to annoy Sandrine by doing something to the electricity. That sends her to ask his help in letting her stay with him as it has snowed heavily and her place is freezing.Adrien begins to relax around the young woman as he lets her know about himself and the life he and his wife had together in the farm. Little by little both come together and form a bond that will not be broken because both learn to care for the other one.Christian Carion directed this tale about two lonely souls that are much alike but live in separate worlds.

Make no mistake the venerable Michel Serrault MAKES this movie!  He is downright remarkable as Adrien the long time farmer who sells is farm to the young city girl played well by Mathilde Seigner.  Many excellent scenes including awkward moments for all. The ridiculous comments about cruelty to animals during the filming is not worthy of mention.  This is a fact of life on a farm and obviously the cow scenes were real life  not created for the film.  The pig scene may be painful to watch but effectively makes the point of life and death on a farm  just like the goat birth scene.  As far as the rabbit give me a break we see a live bunny and then one being prepared for dinner.  This can happen in any restaurant on a daily basis.  Yes the hang glider was a bit too much too often but I loved the Volvo the Weimeramer and the dumb goat.  Very personal film with much insight into human nature at all ages.".

This story written by both Carion and Eric Assous is unique a study of human desires needs and compromises that is more human in feeling than most any other film this reviewer has seen.Sandrine Dumez Mathilde Seigner lives in Paris where she slaves away at teaching computer science to students in tune with the age. She is attractive successful popular...and unhappy. She longs to fulfill the dreams of her childhood and become a farmer. Much against her doting mother's advice she enrolls in a school for agriculture and eventually graduates as one of the top students winning the ability to buy a farm in the Rhone Alps. The snag the elderly crusty owner Adrien Michel Serrault who wants to sell his farm yet maintain his idyllic country existence without the wear and tear of farming refuses to move off his own property once the contract is signed for Sandrine to take over the land. Sandrine allows Adrien to stay makes the farm not only succeed despite her novice status but also adds a hotel 'The Balcony of the Sky' to enhance her income from her goat farm whose chief product is cheese. Encouraging the transition is the jovial neighbor Jean JeanPaul Roussillon whose recent selling of his own farm allows him to travel around in his new Volvo with his trusty and hilarious dog Pharaoh. Jean warns Sandrine that when winter come Adrien will become a recluse remembering the loss of his wife the Nazi decimation of the French farms his losses from mad cow disease in the past etc yet Sandrine persists  until the winter comes and all but defeats her optimism. Events bond Adrien and Sandrine more closely so much so that when Sandrine returns to Paris for a muchneeded breather  and liaison with her exboyfriend Grard Frdric Pierrot  Adrien discovers how important to him Sandrine has become. The ending is tied into a surprise that touchingly resolves many doubts and questions and allows the viewer to finish the story on his own! The cast is superb with special kudos to Michel Serrault a consummate actor. The cinematography of the glorious farm location is by Antoine Hberl and the very French musical score is by Philippe Rombi. The film is a delight in every aspect and one that deserves repeated viewings. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very nice movie that most Englishspeaking movie goers will never see. Here in the USA it has the title Girl From Paris but the French title translates to one swallow brought spring. Mathilde Seigner unknown to me before this movie plays Sandrine Dumez a single young lady approaching 30 and living in Paris. One day while running late because of bad traffic she decides to follow her dream to get away from the city and become a farmer. This is her story and also how her life touched that of an old man who thought he had nothing to live for. She was his 'swallow'. Although it is all in French the subtitles are easy to read and is not a distraction at all. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Sandrine enrolls in a two year school to study farming. She is one of the better students and a hard worker. She finds a farm to buy in a beautiful hilly area somewhere between Paris and Grenoble probably closer to Grenoble. The old owner had lost his wife some years back and was just tired of farming but he didn't look kindly upon school farmers and wasn't very helpful at first. In fact it seemed like he wanted her to fail even though he had contracted to remain living there for 18 months. But he slowly warmed up to her when he saw how kind she was and how hard she worked. She converted one building into a hotel and advertised it over the internet as Balconies in the Sky. She sold her goat cheese over the internet. She worked hard every day. Her business was good.In a key scene during the cold winter we see him causing a problem with her hotel's electricity and we assume he is up to no good. But what he wanted was for her to be near him so without heat he invited her to stay with him in the old guest bedroom. A few days later he fixed the problem. They shared meals and conversation and they even danced. Not long before a sour old man he now had a little joy in his life.After a particularly hard winter Sandrine had to take a break went back to Paris even taught two days of an internet class. She considered whether she should go back and decided to. The movie ends with her leading the goats back to the barn in the spring.".

	schema:reviewBody "A stressed Parisienne decides to take up sheeprearing in the Massif du Vercors situated not far from Grenoble France. She buys up a farmstead and the owner of the latter remains on site while waiting for transfer to a town. The film is basically about the tense relationship between the young lady played by Mathilde Seigner and the retired farmer played by Michel Serrault who generally tries to make life hard for her but eventually is taken with affection by the same young lady. I am no fan of Michel Serrault but his performance in this film is excellent as is that of Mathilde Seigner. Although the script is limited in scope the dialogues and development of the characters may be followed with pleasure by the spectator. The dcors are magnificent as the film was made in natural surroundings so we see the mountains change in form and colour according to the passing seasons. I would strongly recommend the film to people of all countries as it has a very universal message. It may be noted that the film was made by someone who has a very rural background. It is now available on DVD in France and the editor has taken the unusual but welcome step of including English Subtitles on the DVD. The title is a play on words because the expression Une hirondelle ne fait pas le printemps'  One Swallow doesn't make a Summer'. So it's as if you were saying  One Swallow has Made the Summer' ! This film deserves to be successful outside France unlike many of the other mediocre productions of that country today !".

The very scenic setting is also one of the film's great strengths. This film indirectly helped me to understand the motivation of periodically striking French farmers and the hold that this way of life can have on Europeans where farming is not as easy as industrialized or as largescale as it is in much of America.Unfortunately the script doesn't probe quite as deeply as it might andPOSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS there is a silly recurring bit of gratuitous and vague symbolism in the form of a parasailer that leads nowhere and acts mainly as eyecandy. The same can be said about the unnecessarily virtuosic and at times vertiginous long opening shot.  I'm undecided about the scenes of violence to animals. Yes living things were harmed  killed really  in the making of this movie and it could have been made without those acts but such things are a common and unavoidable part of farm life and lend reality to a sometimes romanticized portrayal of agricultural existence.  On balance I think this depiction is legitimate and the scene with the cows may have been preexisting footage. It was definitely stockfootage in a manner of speaking.END OF SPOILERSNot a great or major piece of cinema but a worthy minor human document with especially fine acting by the heroine and the two old farmers.".

I'll admit I've never been a fan of graphic violence and my tolerance for it can run hot and cold depending on other factors what's going on in my own life at the moment whether the violence is cartoony and so outrageous it can be laughable e.g. some Tarentino how much justification is involved and so on. I'm not overly squeamish but my level of tolerance is inconsistent. As a result I've put a lot of recent films on my back burner of I'll get around to those someday  high caliber perfectly fine intelligent films that just happen to contain some scenes that I don't wish to put in my head at this particular juncture.However the one thing I always have trouble with is even the suggestion of cruelty or violence toward innocents such as animals or children. I rented Une hirondelle a fait le printemps knowing very little about it and unaware of the animal slaughter scenes it contains. I watched it all the way through and I think it's a fine film in many ways  brilliant performances gorgeous scenery a rather silly but dismissible symbolism involving a hang glider and best of all that which European filmmakers do so well a subtle wellpaced drama about everyday life and the human condition. When the film was over I struggled with trying to reconcile my conflicting feelings loving much of the film but detesting the scene with the pig in particular. I did a little research and learned that the director Christian Carion is from a rural background and that the scene was to be shot once quickly and that he would use whatever footage he got regardless of Ms. Seigner's reaction. I don't believe Carion intended to be gratuitous in his choice to shoot this scene. I think he understands farm life for what it is and certainly what he showed us is far more humane than the horrific practice of factory farming so prevalent in the United States. Also there was a purpose to the scene unlike the scene in Patton where a cow is actually killed on a bridge because it's in Patton's way. I'll never watch that film again what a ridiculous waste of a creature's life to provide completely unnecessary insight into the main character's psyche. Carion in his choice to film the slaughter successfully depicted the hard reality of farm life for those who enter into foodanimal production. Having said all that my final decision is that although I understand where the director was coming from this scene is ultimately too much I regret to say that it ruins the film for me. I still admire the wonderful qualities of the film but it's not one I'll ever want to watch again even if I were to skip the objectionable scenes. No matter how much I justify it intellectually I go back to what I said in the beginning plain and simple this is not an image I want in my head. It wasn't necessary Carion could have gotten the idea across without submitting us to this. All Creatures Great and Small comes to mind  a programme that succeeded in a realistic depiction of rural life without hitting us over the head with gory details. Please understand that I don't believe farmers who raise animals for human consumption are evil. I've known farm families having grown up in the Midwest and they took good care of their livestock and made sure the creatures suffered as little as possible when it was time for slaughter. I'm vegetarian but I'm not a militant I'm not against eating meat I'm very much against factory farming. But I watch films to escape. Whereas I don't need everything sugarcoated I do start to feel manipulated when filmmakers insist on showing us way more detail than necessary. As I sat watching Une hirondelle a fait le printemps I anticipated purchasing it and watching it repeatedly until this scene came up. Unfortunately it cast a depressing pall over an otherwise enriching movie experience. I know there are many reviewers here who love the film and with good reason there is plenty here to enjoy. I'm sorry to say that for me the bad outweighs the good.".

	schema:headline " What on earth have they done to John McClane?!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am heartbroken.It's a sad day to say this but it has to be said A Good Day to Die Hard is a dud. The fifth instalment in the beloved Die Hard saga ends up as the worst of the series so far it falters thanks to a weak characterization even weaker screen writing lack of worthy villains absurd action sequences and incoherent direction. You can bet this movie will be mentioned in the same sentence with Rocky V Superman IV The Quest for Peace Speed 2 Cruise Control Die Another Day and Batman  Robin. Not even the Rrating and the return of the famous Yippie ki yay line in full can save this one.As much as I love action movies I like mine with a side of plot and character of which this film fails at. John McClane one of my favorite film characters of all time is given a horrendous treatment no beloved character should ever be given relegated to a sidekick. This is HIS movie not his son's! From the start he is inexplicably thrust into Russia with no back story of how the previous films over the years have shaped his character now  a key trait that was visible in the previous four films. He is reduced to a wisecracking action supercop and even his wisecracks are weak. However Bruce Willis bless him is still McClane without a doubt as he dishes out the bad guys with weatheredout cynicism in his eyes. He still has it in him and in no way it is his fault that this movie turned out to be nearcrap.Rather writer Skip Woods and director John Moore are to blame. Woods clearly missed the whole point of McClane's essence and likability  he is a vulnerable human  an everyday Joe who only stops the bad guys when there's no one else that can do it. He is a reluctant hero in the first four films he can get seriously wounded as he is up against worthy adversaries that are cool calculative and almost one step ahead of him. Here McClane in the opening car chase and immediately causes mass vehicular damage just to stop thugs from attacking his son shows no signs of vulnerability after TWO major car crashes and has no qualms about killing the bad guys wherever they pop up here. His son Jack Jai Courtney filling in for McClane's sidekick has certain charisma and shows a few glimpses of character development in McClane but it is cut short by the merciless and absurd action sequences.A good action movie has to have a good villain. Die Hard 5 has none. It has three primary villains all of them forgettable. Nothing with the likes of even Thomas Gabriel or Colonel Stuart the Gruber Brothers must be smirking right now in hell. They're not intelligent not menacing not memorable. They're just dumb die and that's it. What was their evil plot? What dastardly deeds do they have? Weapons dealing. Oh the humanity!The film runs at 97 minutes  the shortest in the series. Why the film was released at this length I don't want to know. Nobody complained about the 2 hour running time for each of the previous four movies. Imagine what a better movie this could've been with those cut scenes added back in.John Moore directs with the subtlety of a car crash. He smash cuts every scene puts heavy use of slow motion in the excruciatingly absurd climax and relies heavily on CGI for most of the action sequences. But like all Die Hard movies there has to be at least one sensational action sequence and that is at the film's beginning. The only thing I really enjoyed in a guilty pleasure sort of way about the whole movie was a massive destructive stuntfilled car chase throughout the streets of Moscow. It was an intense and exciting scene. Pity the rest of the movie can't hold up to this sensational chase scene alone especially the end which essentially turns McClane into The Terminator. If you think the F35 scene in Die Hard 4 was absurd hoo boy wait until you get a load of this one.At the very least there's some competent cinematography from Jonathan Sela and a good riveting music score from Marco Beltrami who really knows his stuff when it comes to action as well as incorporating Michael Kamen's themes into this one. If anything the music is better than the movie.There is a 6th and according to Bruce final movie in the works. Here's a no brainer  bring back John McTiernan or Renny Harlin hell even Len Wiseman for all I care and hire a good screenwriter who really delivers the old school action goods. I strongly believe Bruce and McClane can deliver the goods still and ride off into the sunset instead of falling off his horse here. They just need a better story better direction and a more than worthy villain with a respected British actor in the role. The franchise doesn't deserve to die with this. It's too good for that.Shame on you John Moore and Skip Woods.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am heartbroken.It's a sad day to say this but it has to be said A Good Day to Die Hard is a dud. The fifth instalment in the beloved Die Hard saga ends up as the worst of the series so far it falters thanks to a weak characterization even weaker screen writing lack of worthy villains absurd action sequences and incoherent direction. You can bet this movie will be mentioned in the same sentence with Rocky V Superman IV The Quest for Peace Speed 2 Cruise Control Die Another Day and Batman  Robin. Not even the Rrating and the return of the famous Yippie ki yay line in full can save this one.As much as I love action movies I like mine with a side of plot and character of which this film fails at. John McClane one of my favorite film characters of all time is given a horrendous treatment no beloved character should ever be given relegated to a sidekick. This is HIS movie not his son's! From the start he is inexplicably thrust into Russia with no back story of how the previous films over the years have shaped his character now  a key trait that was visible in the previous four films. He is reduced to a wisecracking action supercop and even his wisecracks are weak. However Bruce Willis bless him is still McClane without a doubt as he dishes out the bad guys with weatheredout cynicism in his eyes. He still has it in him and in no way it is his fault that this movie turned out to be nearcrap.Rather writer Skip Woods and director John Moore are to blame. Woods clearly missed the whole point of McClane's essence and likability  he is a vulnerable human  an everyday Joe who only stops the bad guys when there's no one else that can do it. He is a reluctant hero in the first four films he can get seriously wounded as he is up against worthy adversaries that are cool calculative and almost one step ahead of him. Here McClane in the opening car chase and immediately causes mass vehicular damage just to stop thugs from attacking his son shows no signs of vulnerability after TWO major car crashes and has no qualms about killing the bad guys wherever they pop up here. His son Jack Jai Courtney filling in for McClane's sidekick has certain charisma and shows a few glimpses of character development in McClane but it is cut short by the merciless and absurd action sequences.A good action movie has to have a good villain. Die Hard 5 has none. It has three primary villains all of them forgettable. Nothing with the likes of even Thomas Gabriel or Colonel Stuart the Gruber Brothers must be smirking right now in hell. They're not intelligent not menacing not memorable. They're just dumb die and that's it. What was their evil plot? What dastardly deeds do they have? Weapons dealing. Oh the humanity!The film runs at 97 minutes  the shortest in the series. Why the film was released at this length I don't want to know. Nobody complained about the 2 hour running time for each of the previous four movies. Imagine what a better movie this could've been with those cut scenes added back in.John Moore directs with the subtlety of a car crash.

You have a terrible writer Skip Woodseven if I enjoyed The ATeam and a terrible director John Moore. The people at Fox must be idiots because John Moore has not made one good film so to trust him with the Die Hard franchise seemed a bad idea. The film has a lot of action if not too much there isn't any dialog!!!! At 97 minutes it's the shortest one in the series ans it sure feels that way. Every other film in the franchise were longer they gave you more time to explore the rest of the film. But this one feels so rushed like okay let's go there  and then here... The film has no structure. It's like they said alright guys were gonna make this as fast as possible Bruce Willis is fine but it's like he doesn't even talk during the whole movie his chemistry with Jai Courtney is fine. The plot is okay even if you can see the twist coming after 25 minutes. What makes this film still enjoyable is the action even though it's disturbed by shakycam bad editing and bad CGI effects. If they are gonna make another one they should bring back John Mctiernan and make the movie on a smaller scale. Back to basics!! If they make it on a bigger scale than they should make it as good as With a Vengeance.And another thing You can't drive from Moscow to Chernobyl in a couple of hours!!!!!!This is by far the worst entry in the franchise".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the Die Hard series I feel the need to warn others  Don't waste 97 minutes of your life on this movie! Yes it really is that bad. Here's a concise summary of why it's just so bad 1 John McClane's role is really as a sidekick. Why do this to the big man .... why? 2 The movie lacks a bad guy. Does the movie have people that are bad  of course but it lacks that McClane v Supervillain factor. 3 There's very little of the Die Hard humour we've all grown to love. 4 The movie parodies the Hans Gruber death sequence  never  never do this. 5 Jai Courtney is terrible. It's hard to discern if it's the role he's been asked to play or him but either way he come across as a spoiled brat pretending to be Jason Bourne. 6 There's hardly any script  it's as if the script were sandwiched in post production to fit around the bangs and crashes. 7 It's not in the USA. This sounds trivial but it's not  the film just doesn't work outside of its tried and tested environment. 8 The car chase scene  oh my. If you do choose to watch the movie after reading this the good news is that yes it does eventually end  although it may not feel this way. So in summary go plant a tree play football go for a walk in fact  do anything but for the love of all that you hold dear  don't waste your life on this.".

And now sadly A Good Day to Die Hard will join his list of notoriously bad films. As much as I wanted to like this movie I just couldn't not even as a die hard fan of the franchise.First let's look at the selling point. We're promised ONE thing a larger scale as far as action sequels go. The first Die Hard took place in a building the second one in an airport and the third in NYC and the fourth in the entire nation of the United States. So logically Die Hard 5 was going to go international. Well ironically A Good Day to Die Hard feels like the smallest film of the five because the stakes feel so low. The action is endless chaos from start to finish you quickly become numb to it. And unlike previous Die Hard films the terrorist threats never get carried out. I never felt like John McClane was going to lose.The oneliners aren't clever. The jokes aren't funny. The bad family relationship story is getting really old especially when Die Hard 4 primarily focused on the estranged fatherdaughter relationship. And unlike Lucy who just came off as a spoiled brat Jack McClane is introduced by pulling a gun on his own father who we have grown to love over four movies.I can't speak too much about the villain played by Radivoje Bukvi without spoilers but all I have to say is that he has little to no part in the movie. The evil Russian comes off as a clich and again he carries out no threat. I'm dying to talk about the story here but let's just say it has a really brain dead ending.In an attempt to end the review on a more positive note I'd like to say that the movie does have some oh sht moments here and there.

Loud unbearably stupid cartoonishly unbelievable this movie has the emotional impact of an episode of Thunderbirds but without the clever plot.In a nutshell which is big enough for this plot with room to spare Bruce Willis as John McClean tracks down his errant son to Moscow in the usual Hollywood bid to 'reconnect'. There he finds him working as a CIA operative trying to smuggle a vague dissident out of the country. Bruce joins in  as you do. They would have got away too if it wasn't for that pesky dissident getting out of the safety of the car and virtually thumbing his nose at the bad guys to make them chase him. There follows a car chase that's so long and stupid that I considered going to get an ice cream. I could have had a three course meal and they'd still have been there demolition derbying through rush hour. During this chase a transit van roars through dense traffic jams like a knife through butter while the armoured car chasing it is forced to bulldoze its way through walls and over cars to keep up and an RPG rocket is launched at Bruce with the velocity of someone throwing a tennis ball for a dog giving him plenty of time to steer around it. Then after many more bullets are dodged  even really fast ones from an Apache helicopter  the pair are captured by a bad guy and about to be executed. Having just slaughtered about two hundred people in half an hour of mindless violence in this scene the bad guy suddenly slows down and takes time to eat a carrot and emote about a career he might have had in tap dancing just long enough so that Bruce and Bruce Jr can break free and overwhelm half a dozen heavily armed men with only their distracting giggling and a small knife.As usual in Die Hard Bruce remains remains virtually unmarked and limpfree throughout although his regulation white singlet does get grubbier every time he's blown upshot atbeatenthrown off a buildingfalls through a window. So that at least is realistic.Everything else is not. Stupid action stupid dialogue stupid baddies stupid plot twists and stupid science. Did you know that radiation that's been 'pooling in here Chernobyl for years' can be easily eradicated by a quick squirt of weapons grade Domestos and an iPad? Nor me. Lucky for Bruce though as he rushes into the defunct nuclear plant with only his stubble for protection. Oh and did I tell you? All this happens in one day  from Bruce's arrival in Moscow through the mayhem and explosions and the nuclear waste and the drive to Chernobyl which is apparently in a suburb of Moscow. Oh and that the drive is made in a car they steal that just happens to have a small arsenal in the boot? Lucky again.None of it matters because  surprise surprise  Bruce Jr forgives Bruce for years of neglect and calls him Dad for the first time and they fly home as heroes in a sunset glow. The fact that they leave Moscow smoking behind them littered with corpses of innocent bystanders and disappointed filmfans is neither here nor there. There's a running 'joke' where Bruce keeps yelling 'I'm on vacation!' One can only hope it's a long one.".

This movie attempts to have such a complex plot for a Die Hard whereas the other four were so simple that even the dumbest person could tell what was happening.

I couldn't bear to watch the pain that I went through in this film why? Because almost nothing in this movie resembled anything about Die Hard. There was no tone no tension and as a result it felt nothing like Die Hard. NOTHING! The characters really are all awful with the exception of John McClane who still has a bit of relatability to him. Bruce Willis does a fantastic job in the movie but every other member of the cast really didn't appeal to me. The villain was weak John's son was uninteresting and a lame addition to the franchise as if he were there to sell action figures. The story was no fun and the action was all messy This movie does absolutely nothing to resemble the Die Hard films and as such one of the most anticipated movies of 2013 has fallen down a drain with overuse of CGI lame characters and plot uninteresting villain with no real intention and another excuse to make more money out of it.A Good day to Die Hard is a movie that makes you think that this day is a good day for you to die hard.

	schema:reviewBody "First off I am a huge fan of the three first films the fourth film was alright but it didn't feel like a Die Hard movie sadly this one doesn't either. A Good Day To Die Hard is a huge mess. No good plot bad cgi rushed scenes etc. Only thing I found good was the action. An R rating didn't help this one at all. It almost seems like they tried to make this PG13 at first but then changed it to R later because fans were complaining about Live Free or Die Hard's Aka Die Hard 4.0's rating. The movie has PG13  12A violence and this is disappointing. John Moore could of done so much more with this film but instead he messes it up just like he did with Max Payne. Good action but no good story or character development. Jai Courtney who starred in Jack Reacher earlier this year did well on his part and I do hope he returns if they are making a 6th one but I am begging please get a good director for the 6th one since Bruce says it will possibly be the last one. Bring McTiernan back and let him end the series with a huge bang! I am sorry to say this but the film was not good at all. Being an hardcore Die Hard fan I suggest that other fans should just let this one pass.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't even want to acknowledge this as a movie  forget about acknowledging it as a Die Hard movie. Some plotlines are recycled versions of the plotlines from previous Die Hard movies. In Live Free or Die Hard 2007 we saw McClane's daughter having daddy issues now we get to see his son with daddy issues .... so original. I am not saying previous Die Hard movies were totally original they were some sort of rehash of the first one or of the ones prior to them. But all of them were different at the same time. They had their own moments the rehashes weren't a mere rehash. But this one? Holy crap! The rehashing is merely a rehashing. As it is clear from the trailer they are gonna pit McClane and his son against each other ..... which sounds interesting. But as the movie goes on and no spoilers they start getting along the reason behind it is revealed so abruptly. It's not that you don't get a feeling of you're watching a not so good movie right after the first 10 minutes or so  but right after the reveal the fatherson conflict seems so lame the movie loses all its weight and the remaining of the movie feels tiresome. They put certain twists here and there  which I did not expected. But none of them made any sense. In fact the entire planning of events that drive the story feels like a typical screenwriter's convenience relying completely on coincidences and the coincidences are known to the planner prior to its occurrence  Spidey sense I think. The losing of weight I mentioned is so much similar to XMen Origins Wolverine and I happened to know that the monkey who wrote this crap was also a cowriter of Wolverine 1. Also prominent in this movie is the weird characterization of John McClane  he is literally unkillable and is more invincible than Superman. Plus he's an annoying 0le. He isn't a people loving guy who kills just the bad guys. Looks like this writer is the one who made the clown out of Deadpool in Wolverine 1  other writer of that movie being someone who wrote 25th hour and apparently unlikely to ruin a fan favorite character. Bruce Willis plays a parody of his most infamous character John McClane and a shallow and ridiculous version of David Dunn from Unbreakable at the same time. He looks as interested to star in this movie as much as I enjoy the movie Son of the Mask. Also the actions are bad. They have no drama or character moments in them they are noisy and too yellowish orange. At least they could've been well choreographed but that would make this movie a little redeeming won't it? Plus they mock Hans Gruber as if it was so cool to do so. All it does is it pisses off the fans and simply looks ridiculous. And CGI  terrible. I am not someone who complains about CGI normally if it isn't absolutely bad. It looks so fake. Like I said just yellowish orange things that look like MS Paint edits converted into a video of course with some whacky noise. Terribly written inconsistencies everywhere badly directed and will piss you off completely. Yippeekiyay motherfr the makers gave us a franchise killer. It gets an F and a 010.".

	schema:headline " Bruce Willis does what he does best but this is quite simply one of the worst days of the 'Die Hard' series";
	schema:reviewBody "Our hearts go out to Bruce Willis. Truly. Six years after successfully restarting the most important character of his entire moviemaking career Willis has to watch it all crash and burn to the ground with this loud dumb and plain boring fifth chapter the erroneouslytitled 'A Good Day to Live Hard'. Indeed while its immediate predecessor 'Live Free or Die Hard' banked on a winning formula of oldschool heroics with newage sensibilities this sequel is firmly stuck in the past  and the worse thing about it is that it would only be passable by the standards of an 80s action movie.Truth be told Willis isn't at all the reason why this fails to be a good day for the 'Die Hard' franchise. At the age of 57 the man can still run carry a mean weapon and kick ass  not to mention his trademark squint and unflappable wisecracking attitude. To put it simply Willis is still very much the John McClane we've loved in the 80s and 90s and even in the very last movie before this one. But much as Willis tries he is severely let down by a toxic combination of weak scripting and even weaker directing  the former of which by Skip Woods and the latter by John Moore.Little in either Woods' or Moore's filmography suggests that they are capable of rising above mediocrity and this exercise in blandness is proof of that foolish consistency. Let's start with Woods' script which clearly thinks it can be a 'Mission Impossible' by way of 'Die Hard'  so instead of putting the New York City detective in his home turf or for that matter his home country decides to transport him all the way to the Moscow to wreak havoc. The excuse? To reconnect with his long lost son Jack who has apparently turned bad and is now imprisoned in Russia.Nowhere in the rest of the story does Woods manage to convince us that the change in location is worth the while. Even though we are now well into the 21st century Woods still seems stuck in the last so not only are the good guys and bad guys drawn along the lines of Americans and Russians respectively cue the stereotypes about both nationalities the plot has something to do with as archaic an institution as Chernobyl. Oh yes we're back to foiling some nasty Russian's nefarious plan of using the uranium from the site to build weapons of mass destruction.To make matters worse Moore is too daft to realise that the very premise in itself strains credibility. How else can you explain why following scene after scene of destruction around the Russian capital there is no sign of any law and order agency? Are we supposed to believe that the police are too busy or nonchalant to care about some highway chase that decimates pretty much every one of the city's infrastructure it comes across? Or that no authority responds to some helicopter firing round after round after round into a highrise building? We like that our action movies are escapist but not when they ignore every shred of common sense simply for expediency.The fact that we pay attention to these details is in itself telling for despite a frenetic pace that goes from scene after scene of action the movie remains a bore. Shots are fired things get blown up and people get killed from time to time but at the end of the day all that action is staged so unimaginatively that it fails to even interest  let alone excite  you. The pacing within each sequence is too monotonous the sound seems perpetually cranked on loud and the weaponry  plus an overused helicopter  just gets tiresome too quickly. As if to compensate for the lack of any genuine thrills the climax goes over thetop but like the rest of the movie grows so incredulous  especially in slomo  that it is just laughable.Ironically what passes as John McClane's wise cracks is anything but humorous. Most of McClane's lines are in the context of his fatherson relationship with Jack Jai Courtney but are hardly witty or engaging. They are also frustratingly repetitive consisting of John lamenting how Jack nary shows him any respect as a father or John lamenting how he had expected no more than a vacation in Moscow or some inane topic like whether they will grow a third hand after stepping into Chernobyl without any protective suit. If John's lines are horrid the rest of the characters can be no better  and what really takes the cake is when John's nemesis Alik Rasha Bukvic talks about how he used to be a pretty good tap dancer whom no one appreciated.Even more lamentable is how this instalment if played right could have been an exciting new page for the 'Die Hard' series with John passing the baton to his CIA operative of a son Jack. Yet this fifth chapter is easily the worst 'Die Hard' entry and quite possibly might sound the death knell for the franchise. If John McClane had a penchant for landing in the wrong place at the wrong time then 'A Good Day to Die Hard' is Bruce Willis' unfortunate mistake of being in the wrong movie with the wrong people.".

Sure it's not a thoughtprovoking piece of art but it's art done with class integrity and art these films were made at a time when action films were..actually..action films. They had no quickstyle MTV editing that tries to pass itself off as action they were done with pure and honest craftsmanship with stunt men willing to put it all out for all to see. And for that aspect alone they did a commendable job.So now I look at A Good Day to Die Hard with all the trappings that action films are known for and ostentatious hijinks that scream Michael Bayesque action that reeks of his earlier films to date.Bruce Willis plays McClane to a hilt but that's all there is. No heartwarming moments no instances of morality no deep insights into why he kills his enemies John McClane is just that. John McClane. A bravado of words and action that homages the earlier films.The movie at times tries to be gritty and funny at the same time but with such an inane screenplay and unfunny jokes it becomes quite apparent that this film was simply not meant to continue the series. To try to adapt an relic of the '80s and '90s into a modern context with current technology doesn't work anymore. The only exception to this is Rambo where he was fighting against a brutal regime in Southeast Asia. It worked because the setting was raw in it's brutal intensity plus Rambo is a timeless hero and much more plausible. John McClane is just a beefedup Jack Bauer without the hero's legendary outbursts of anger when something goes wrong or impedes him from saving the day. Not once is there a chance for the viewer to root for McClane. He remains lifeless and stiff the very opposite of his portrayal in the earlier films.In an attempt to distance itself from its PG13 predecessor the film makers decided to make this film rated R. Yet it hardly saved the film from it's mediocre direction. I suspect this was due to the large backlash from audiences of Live Free or Die Hard a film that was only a Die Hard film in name only not a true Die Hard film which is evident in the director's inability to handle the material.I tried to keep an open mind after the execrable LFODH but after this I hope Bruce and co. just hang up the wife beater for the final time. No more. John McClane is a hero of the past and should be left there for all time's sake.".

	schema:reviewBody "I gave this 3 stars as compared to the other movies in the franchise. As a standalone action flick I might stretch it to 610.The Die Hard series is all about violent and bloody mass murder that is somehow kept fun because of the characters and dialogue. That's a precarious balance to maintain and this movie just missed the tone of Die Hard completely.The world isn't fleshed out at all. There is no feeling of continuity between this and the other movies. Lucy McClane is thrown in for a brief moment but the otherwise excellent and hilarious relationship between father and daughter that is established in Die Hard 4 is just gone.The characters are bland and twodimensional both on the good and evil side. Perhaps the most grievous exemplar of this is John McClane Junior who just doesn't bother to act at all. There is absolutely no chemistry between father and son Junior being actively dislikeable. At one point I was rooting for the marginally more charismatic bad guy to shoot him in the face. Even McClane lacks his hilarious oneliners and quips. You're going to be heartily sick of the phrase I'm just on vacation halfway through this movie.The story lacks any real cohesion the dialogue is horrible in parts even nonsensical Who's the smart one now? Hey I'm just here on vacation not verbatim.The best action happens 20 minutes into the movie the climax being anything but. It does feature an inexplicably halfnaked Russian guy with CCCP tattooed on his back though so there is that.There is just no point to this movie. It's a mediocre action film with Bruce Willis tacked on.Stay at home and watch any of the other Die Hard movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very minor spoilers ahead!Aw man. It's just sad guys. You know those days when you really wish for something? I mean really really hope for something good? I felt like that about the new Die Hard movie. Mind you I had no great expectations for it  but hopes yes I had those. It could have been so nice. I thought perhaps they'd have learned from the justdecent 4th one bring back the swearing the jokes the confined spaces the hideandseek. You know perhaps even a peek of Holly McClane or TV reporter Dick Thornberg? That would have been so awesome. Instead A Good Day to Die Hard is a weakly written bluetinted shakycam action flick that takes itself too seriously. Got nothing better to do on a Tuesday night? Yeah stay home anyway.Okay fine. So the swearing is back. Yay I thought for a moment somewhere in the first third. But then I remembered the ridiculous twentyish minutes I'd just sat through. Here's a rough summary of the beginningJohn McClane learns his son is in jail in Russia. He travels there to I don't know I guess help him out or talk some sense into him. It's not really explained. But before he goes his daughter tells him not to make a mess. OOooOOOoo foreshadowing.We learn the son is actually involved in a plot to help out a political prisoner at a court hearing. I think.Next thing we know the whole courtroom explodes. Because a mean politician wants the prisoner dead. Son drags prisoner from the rubble into a van outside but as they're about to take off McClane jumps out HE WANTS TO TALK TO HIS SON.Son shoves gun up father's nose tells him he's busy and to back off. Consequently father joins neverending ridiculous car chase across Moscow involving explosions wanton destruction countless car wrecks and people driving off bridges. You know BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TALK TO HIS SON.What the heck did I just walk into?!No seriously it doesn't get much better. First apart from a few well delivered lines by Willis there's little to no humour in this movie. It's all straightfaced and serious. McClane's son is a random CIA dude no special character traits. Their relationship is badly introduced and expanded upon. I hate you  bullets bullets bullets bullets  Okay you know what I love you. Let's go kill more people.Secondly it doesn't look or feel like a Die Hard movie in any way. There was anarticle on Cracked a while ago outlining what it would take and Good Day has none of it. For instance no confined spaces. No hideandseek. No sabotage no catand mouse. Numerous locations instead we go from America to Moscow to Chernobyl and believe me when they reached the last location I really really hoped it'd turn into a DieHard1esque guerilla warfare tour de force. Nope didn't happen. No kickass black guys like in Die Hard 1 2 and 3 either.The direction and cinematography are your typical early 21st century mediocre action flick fare. Except for a beautifully designed scene in an empty ballroom it's desaturated and tinted blue and not even in a cool Payback kind of way. The plethora of action scenes? Mostly nauseating shakycam. Oh and the boobs Willis smiles at in the trailer? Not in the movie. Granted I didn't miss them either. What I did miss was the excerpt from Beethoven's 9th 4th movement Freude schner Gtterfunken again present in the trailer absent from the movie.Refreshingly enough there are some other references to the 1988 classic. We have a deception scene reminiscent of the first encounter between McClane and Hans Gruber. We get a fallingoffaroof scene too served with a little twist. Now if you think those are lame attempts to copy something that used to be good well then I guess then you're right. But hey it's better than nothing.So anything redeeming about A Good Day to Die Hard? A few things. There were some nicely done plot twists I didn't see coming and I enjoyed them. Sadly enough they stick out from the otherwise mediocre writing like Bruce Willis from the rubble around Nakatomi Plaza. Shaky cam aside the action scenes were quite well done and if they used CGI they did it tastefully enough a lot of that stuff looked gritty and real. I also liked the sound mix. Yeah the movie sounded really good. But you guessed right none of that saves it. A Good Day to Die Hard didn't make me angry like Prometheus did but it made me sad. Sad like the sad old eyes of Bruce Willis we get to look at for 2 hours. Spare yourselves the trouble stay home and watch any of the first 3. Or the 4th if you're so inclined. That was decent enough.".

So it seems like the action is there just to satisfy the audiences craving for action. Like the stupid car chase where McClane totals 100 cars because he must talk to his braindead son. The badguys are cardboard characters and clich. I was so happy when this movie got an R rating but without a descent script forget it. Even the fourth movie that got a PG 13 rating was ten times better than this. At least it felt like Die Hard with good acting a good script and nice action.The director John Moore said that people have expectations to a Die Hard movie. That it isn't just any other action movie. Well John you certainly treated Die Hard like any other action movie. I've seen Van Damme movies that are better than this.The funny thing is that Sam Mendes said the same thing about 007 but he still managed to kill the franchise with the awful Skyfall just like John Moore did with A Good Day To Die Hard.".

After movie continued I came to conclusion that world cannot really be populated by that stupid people so it was simply written directed and approved by men who have just received a lobotomy. I think I am right about this one.Movie starts with embarrassing scene with a taxi driver. I don't know if it was supposed to be an ode to international friendship or try to emulate youthful taxi driver from first of the series but it sure looked and sounded bad. Dozen minutes later you see a UAV Drone flying over Moscow. This instant is clear that you're watching science fiction. Even if you could travel back in time to 1940's with much less advanced radars and anti air systems an American drone wouldn't simply be able fly over Moscow. Much less in 2000's while Moscow is over 700km from nearest NATO member border. Then in a capital of police state country that normally has policemen in every street corner and random ID checks are casual thing next to the courthouse ! a firefight occurs with no police to be seen while perpetrators organize family reunions and take long time just wandering around the street with no one to stop them. Okay...The movie is jumping between shaky camera action sequences and father issue drama constantly while both feel out of place. Especially latter since violin music and dumb stares feel artificial and forced.I could go on but I don't want to drag this review out. From the retarded mind of the writer we will also learn that 3000 rounds per minute twin antitank machine gun works as 30 rounds per minute if you're shooting at protagonist of the movie. Ukraine and Russia have no border much like the States so you could easily drive from one to another with a stolen car and trunk full of Canadian guns stolen from Chechen bandits go figure. You can also fly around in both countries in a military helicopter or shoot up buildings in downtown Moscow with no army to interfere. Car can scale 1000 km from Moscow to Pripyat in more or less same time as a military helicopter. Dozens of years of radiation can be easily dispersed with what looks like a leaf blower. Even from metal. Rain water doesn't get radiated. You can happily swim in it. Russian helicopters have magical power to grow back a tail rotor should you destroy one while crashing into building.This movie doesn't have factual errors. It is a factual error.John Mclane we knew was humorous nonaggressive unless provoked had street smarts and good intuition. In Good day it is thrown in only a pinch to say we had it too but it is not the real content of the story in any way. It is quite noticeable here and there.If you loved previous films or at least first three avoid this garbage. Keep the memory happy.".

Lets not forget all the failed heartwarming attempts at compassion between father and son which like the humor was terribly forced.

They clearly made 1 to many. The movie basically just throws you into the thick of a plot that don't really have an idea of whats going on. Lets not forget all the failed heartwarming attempts at compassion between father and son which like the humor was terribly forced. John Mcclanes son refuses to call him dad and refers to him just by his first name how clich. stay away from this movie its trash";

I will spend slightly longer on taking apart this film than the makers spent on putting it together.My main problem with this movie is in fact this entire movie. Never before have I seen so many plot holes so many gaps in logic. The laws of physics biology and yes even chemistry are totally ignored for the full 97 minutes. Not to mention the laws of other school subjects such as Geography Modern Languages and History. Not to mention that they seem to have thrown out all the books on scriptwriting cinematography and direction.It manages to offendalienate the people of Russia Ukraine France and Switzerland in just one scene. That's 262000000 people in the space of 5 minutes. Just for the hell of it I worked out that that means they could have offended the entire population of the world in just under 2 hours 119.86 minutes if your interested.But the film is nowhere near that long. Normally I would complain that it was too short the 97 minutes contained very little really. But in this case I was really glad to see the credits start rolling.But at least they probably found some amusement in the offence in the stark refusal of the writers to look at a map. For the rest of us and especially Die Hard fans see what I did there the offence we take from this movie is not at all funny.As it happens the movie is not at all funny either. McClane seems to have run out of witty oneliners that make his character so good. The bad guys barely speak which rules them out and there's none of the gungho funny moments or threatening situations that make the other films great.There is no sense of desperation for McClane it all seems far too easy for him. But then he is on vacation I guess and it's something he seems very keen to share with everyone he sees.I love Die Hard. I even forgave Die Hard 4 when it CGI'd together a scene from Transformers and and a scene from True Lies to make what I believe is called a terrible error of judgment.I hate this movie. It gets a 310 rating because the acting was actually okay and some of the action was alright too. But this is just drops in the ocean people.Some people may like this movie when they see it but I would not spend any money on it just in case you are disappointed. I bought the boxset of Die Hards 14 which they released when this movie came out and now I am glad I did because I don't know if I would buy a boxset that contained this utterly lazy poorly conceived and executed rushed job that it is. I don't want to own it I don't want to see it again and I don't want it in my house.A Good Day To Die Hard...Jesus Christ.".

	schema:reviewBody "While many people slated DIE HARD 4.0 I enjoyed watching it the few times I've seen it since release I felt like it was a moderately successful way to bring the Bruce Willisstarring franchise slap bang into the 21st century although of course it wasn't as good as the original trilogy. Inevitably A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD followed but the bad news is that it makes the last instalment look like a masterpiece by comparison.This movie really is that bad and it's all down to the people who made it. Much of the blame can be laid at the door of director John Moore who makes even more of a mess with this than he did with MAX PAYNE he can't even do basics like where to place his actors in their shots and he manages to screw up every action scene in the movie and believe me there are a lot of them.Still it's no surprise that the appalling script was written by one Skip Woods who also handled the equally rubbishy ATEAM movie. Woods is without a doubt the worst writer currently working in Hollywood and why people still employ him is anybody's guess.Willis realises he's making a turkey so he makes no effort whatsoever he sleepwalks through this with a monotonous voice guaranteed to send most moviegoers to sleep. This isn't John McClane not even the McClane of DIE HARD 4.0 instead it's just some tired old guy who clearly doesn't want to be there. As his son Jai Courtney is given a onedimensional character and displays none of the charm he brought to his role as Varro in SPARTACUS BLOOD AND SAND.The film meanders from one pointless action scene to the next and we never get a clear idea of who the bad guys are or what they want Willis just kind of stumbles into their plans whatever they are and goes along with it. The violence is mindnumblingly routine and despite the explosive special effects the film offers little in the way of entertainment with an early car chase being the only halfdecent part purely for its destructive visuals. The great Sebastian Koch is wasted en route and the film ends with a CGIfuelled whimper.I hope to God I never have to see it again.".

Make it up as we go says John Mcclane Jr. who is for reasons unknown called Jack for most of the movie. That's also probably what the makers of this film were thinking while shooting this latest addition to the beloved Die Hard franchise. The film feels like it doesn't have much of a script it doesn't have any of the usual oneliners that were one of the reasons that we grew fond of the character of John McClane. Oh there actually is one. Willis repeats  I'm on vacation throughout the film. It is funny the first time he says it but you get tired of it when he says the line for the fifth time. Another big problem is that this film lacks a villain. All the previous Die Hard films stood on the confrontation between McClane and the main villain. They communicated with walkietalkies and didn't even meet 'till the finale. But there was this tension and fear from both sides that there is this possibility that one could bring down the other. I can't go on and call that tap dancing carrot chewing clown a villain. But I don't want to be all negative. If this film wouldn't have Die Hard in name it would have been actually good action flick. You get enough explosions and smashed cars everything you were promised in the trailers. You also get an helicopter smashing through a building which is one of the things I love the most in action films destroying helicopters. As an action flick to waste some time with it is OK. It just lacks in the story and characters department. Bruce Willis doesn't act at all in this film. It's like he goes on autopilot. Plus he doesn't play John McClane the ordinary man from the streets who winds up being at the wrong place at the wrong time and has to use his wit and skills to outsmart the bad guys. No he plays John McClane the superhero who never gets hurt and his only objective is to kill all the scumbags. In all the previous films he wasn't looking for trouble but trouble found him. Here he is looking for trouble.The Die Hard franchise should have been left alone after the brilliant fourth installment Live Free or Die Hard. I guess you can rent this film when you have got nothing better to do on a rainy afternoon and want to kill some time with a simple action movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Good Day To Die Hard basically tries to be the largest part of the series. It takes place in Russia with large vehicles bigger guns and bigger explosion. It could have been a simple fun throwback for John McClane to play around but put aside these action sequences we get an uninteresting plot and a set of forgettable characters. It's pretty unusual for a Die Hard film. It mostly forgets the magic of the series and instead turning this into a typical modern blockbuster where things are only interested in being loud and nothing else. It's still enjoyable to see Bruce Willis shooting and beating up bad guys with his charisma. In the end it's just another blockbuster using an iconic action hero with a quite large scale.The plot is palpably unappealing though it doesn't matter as long as it's as fun as the previous installments. Unfortunately it isn't. The whole film may be surrounded by largely destructive action scenes but when it tells the story it suffers a problematic and inert premise and stuck with a troubled relationship between John and Jack. The film is also a victim of a classic action sequel clich like Indiana Jones The Mummy Star Trek Tron etc. that reveals the unspoken son of the action hero. The problem of this element is the lack of likeness between the personalities of the two. Jack is only labeled as John McClane's son.The characters are surprisingly bland. Die Hard characters especially the villains usually share some charisma with John McClane but here they are just a bunch of idiots causing a lot of damage because they had to so it can be interesting but they end up being annoying instead. Extremely annoying the villains can be much worse than the villains in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. Though MI4 is a well crafted entertainment and has a well told story to cover up those flaws. John McClane here seems to reduce his humanity and mostly treats himself as a joke. Bruce Willis still got it but the script turned him into an insane and generic action hero. Jai Courtney is fine but he could have shared some of the young McClane's personalities so he we may feel that he is really his son.The action scenes are exciting at least. McClane wrecking the entire street and smashing and crashing several cars and trucks. It's an undeniably large over the top crazy sequence. Then there are more shooting destroying crashing CGI and explosions. It's best when it stays that way pleasuring the audience with a lot of decent action set pieces no matter how absurd it gets. Another great thing is it's short so we may not linger to this terribly told storyline unless it spends more of the time developing the plot and the characters but it's too late for that.A Good Day To Die Hard is a gigantic mediocre mess. It probably only exists to set up a new generation for a younger action hero to take over the franchise. But after all of those attempts of giving these icons a son for a replacement's sake I don't think it will ever work. These kids are nothing like their fathers and doesn't show anything interesting about themselves. They are only awesome because their daddies were awesome but you'll suddenly realize they are just lackluster action hero cookiecutters. Sadly even the hero himself is becoming a generic nut that makes you want to let the old man finally live in a retirement home. The action may be big decent and fun but there is nothing else in the end. Die Hard is now a victim of these disposable sequels. It may be huge in scale but it is also huge in disappointments.".

	schema:reviewBody "Part of the problem with this very interesting movie is carelessness or deliberate ambiguity on the part of director Claude Chabrol. The celebrated French master of cinema really is a bit like Alfred Hitchcock in the way he put this film together. He doesn't care so much about the consistency of detail or logic instead what he strives for as did Hitchcock is effect. Begin with a tantalizing premise build tension and then come up with a striking ending.The premise that of a psychologically disturbed woman of high social and economic status Mika Muller played with her usual haunting skill by Isabelle Huppert whose bizarre nature forces her to poison those around her satisfies the formula nicely. The tension is maintained by our need to find out exactly what she is doing and why and how it will affect the husband Andr Jacques Dutronc the son Guillaume Rodolphe Pauly and the young pianist Jeanne Pollet Anna Mouglalis. The ending which is heavily symbolic and deeply psychological however may disappoint some viewers. Note that as the closing credits run down the screen Mika cries and then curls up catatonically on the couch next to a black Afghan in the shape of a spider web. She is the spider at the side of the web waiting for something to fall into it. She can't help herself. That is her nature. And that is why she cries for herself. And notice that her husband does not hate her or rage against her. Instead he seems to have pity upon her as he plays a funereal piece on the piano.Personally what disappointed mealthough I still think this is an excellent filmis the way the ambiguity about Jeanne's paternity is handled. Obviously we can tell by the photos on the wall of the tragically deceased Lisbeth that Jeanne is indeed her daughter since she looks exactly like her. In fact in the next scene Jeanne unconsciously apes the pose in the photo by putting the palms of her hands to either side of her face as Andr watches. Another problem with the film is that nobody except the audience seems struck by the exact similarity.Additionally the truth of her paternity is obscured by Jeanne's mother saying that the mixup at the maternity ward was straightened out to everyone's satisfaction and besides almost as an afterthought she reveals that her husband was not the father that instead she was inseminated by an unknown donor. This silliness could easily be resolved by DNA testing since the movie which was released in 2000 is set in contemporary France. Chabrol uses a lab to establish what drug Mika is putting in the chocolate. Why not use a lab to establish paternity? Part of the reason may simply be that the novel upon which the movie is based The Chocolate Cobweb was written by the American mystery writer Charlotte Armstrong in the 1950's before the age of DNA testing.The real answer however is that Chabrol didn't bother just as he didn't bother cleaning up some other ambiguities like why the son does not confront Mika after he is told by Jeanne that Mika is drugging him. Or why Mika deliberately spills the drugged chocolate intended for Guillaume onto the floor allowing her to be surreptitiously observed by Jeanne through a reflection in the glass of one of the photos. The spilling seems purely a plot device to allow Jeanne a reason to get the chocolat analyzed. Furthermore we presume that Mika who is very rich remarries Andr because she loves him or admires him or wants to be with him. And it can be seen that he would want to remarry her because of her wealth her beauty her elegance etc. However it is revealed near the end of the film that he had all along suspected her of causing Lisbeth's death since he says something like You also washed the glasses the night Lisbeth died. He knew.One can even go to the extent of analyzing this by saying that Mika is the black widow and Andr finds her irresistible. Note the scene in which he suggests they make love to have a daughter and she puts him off by saying that he would be ineffective since he has already taken his Rohypnol. She says next time before he takes his sleep potion they will do it. Furthermore notice that EVERY night he falls into a drugged sleep since he is addicted to Rohypnol. Perhaps this nightly occurrence is pleasant to Mika in a sense an acting out of the black widow's mating ritual again and again.Nonetheless this idea of a woman helpless against her own nature seems a bit unsatisfying. We want something more. And what she does to satisfy her urges leaves us a bit mystified. It seems hardly enough. She drugs the chocolate that she lovingly makes for Guillaume and Jeanne. Why only this? Why this at all? The logic is that she needs to excrete her poison like a spider. The very act of doing it is what satisfies her need. The fact that somebody could take the drug and then fall asleep at the wheel of a car really is beside the point.This tale of the dark psychology within the human soul is the sort of thing that attracts Isabelle Huppert as an actress. She has played in her distinguished career a number of roles that require evil in the human soul. This is one of the more subtle ones. For one of the more striking see her in The Piano Teacher 2001.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Supporting characters are all excellent though the young girl is a bit too wideeyed for her own good. The movie is also fun to watch just for its use of color clothing and art as symbols including allusions to earlier Huppert classics like La Dentelliere. While this might not be Chabrol's masterpiece it would be a good example for any young director to study how a veteran uses the elements of his craft most economically to greatest effect. As for actors watch Isabelle Huppert's face in the closeup during the long final shot  there's a whole acting lesson right there. Not a perfect movie but enjoyable to watch if you have a mind for such details.".

Is it then still possible to hold someone responsible for what he or she is doing? In other words Why do things happen the way they happen? This is IMHO the fundamental question that Claude Chabrol asks in his latest movie Sweet Poison.From very early on in the movie the alignment of characters is fairly obvious A couple consisting of a femme fatale and a detached pianist their dull son and as a twin personality the young alert and beautiful woman and her mother a doctor. Whereas the social relations between these characters are plain couple son daughter the biological relations between them are highly questionable the son had been conceived by a woman who later on died in a caraccident daughter and son might have been swapped on their very first day of life the doctor conceived her child with the help of an anonymous donator of semen the femme fatale had been adopted by her parents. This absurd number of ambiguities seems to indicate that this is really the main theme of the movie. The viewer is led to believe that the swapping actually took place and that the daughter has inherited the musical talent from the pianist while the son inherits the dull unspecificity of his anonymous father.All four main characters  the couple son and daughter  simply live out what has been given to them by nature the father is a famous pianist his daughter follows his footsteps. The femme fatale symbolically portrayed as a spider tries to kill the women that get in between herself and the pianist the mother of the son and the pianist's daughter. The daughter lives an interesting life which includes playing piano. The son doesn't act at all.The femme fatale kills the mother of the pianist's son with the help of sweet poison reflecting the German title Suesses Gift. When the daughter starts to interfere with the life of the couple the femme fatale takes the exact same steps not buying drugs hurting her son's foot sending the woman into town to buy drugs mixing sleeping drugs into the woman's drink in order to kill the daughter too. She behaves like a spider that builds a web and immediately starts to build another one when a scientist destroys the web the spider just made It is a builtin program that's running not something that the wasp decides to do or not to do. When the pianist finds out about his wife's nature he doesn't grab her by the throat or accuses her. He just asks her why she did it and then goes on to play piano. This answers the first question If humans are driven by their nature one cannot hold them responsible for their deeds anymore. Because it is just their nature and they cannot help it.However when the femme fatale tries to kill a woman who is close to the pianist the second time around she fails. Her plan goes the same way as the first time. Whether she succeeds or fails depends on chance i.e. circumstances that lie beyond her influence like better car technology. What determines the outcome of things then  the second question  is not human will or drive but random chance. It is nothing but luck whether things work out or not if we assume that it is all in our naturegenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a thriller suspenseful yet not pushy in its pace. The plot progression edges on at its own natural tempo with piano recitals punctuating the interludes while yes we worry about Mika Muller Huppert's character  whatever might she be up to in spite of her ever so charming and outwardly friendly disposition or is she? In a way it's a light psychological murder drama and we kinda know the seed of evil is with Huppert's character. The trailer and the advertising synopsis suggested that obvious clue. But somehow it didn't decrease the level of suspense. Huppert again exercises her art of subtle acting  that nonchalant facial expression that hardly flinches or betrays her suppressed inner conflicting feelings behind the mask of wellgroomed outfits and demeanor. For the most part we follow the interaction between the other characters good supporting cast Mika's husband Andr Polonski Jacques Dutronc the famous pianist the sluggish stepson Guillaume Rodolphe Pauly whom Polonski wants to cherish but has not the time to understand the growing teenager  whose mother Polonski's beloved wife Lisbeth died in a car accident years ago and Jeanne Pollet Anna Mouglalis the newly introduced excitement in Polonski's life  a protge eager to win a piano competition and Jeanne's widowed mother Dr. Pollet Brigitte Catillon who heads the crime lab. Jeanne is an intelligent young woman besides being a talented pianist with potential and we led to believe her suspicion about Mika and her serving of hot chocolate nightcaps to the Polonski's.Chabrol's writing and directing style never thrust obvious murderous threads in front of us. There are no actual blood or acts of violence we see. Everything seems so civil. Clues are suggestive through conversational exchange between the characters and outside of the frames. That's the masterful beauty of a Claude Chabrol piece  exquisitely presented and delightful to enjoy at ease. The notion of serving up possibly 'poisoned' hot chocolate does remind one of Hitchcock's 1941 Suspicion with Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine including a similar driving scene yet outcome reveals off camera cleverly through a conversation. Lately Huppert's taken on roles that are perhaps psychologically in need of TLC tender loving care here in Merci pour le chocolat in Haneke's The Piano Teacher and in Ozon's who dunnit musical 8 Women  she actually gets to have the most changes of outfit 3 than the other 7 actresses besides performing her number in 'talk through' style sitting down at the piano vs. dancing around singing the song. She's having fun in portraying such characters no doubt.If you enjoy foreign movies a French thriller drama with subtitles by Ian Burley who did the wonderful translated subtitles to the Italian film Bread and Tulips Merci pour le chocolat is for you. Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " Chabrol in teasing mode spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "'Merci pour la chocolat' combines the two most characteristic tones of late Chabrol  the grim relentless Langian formalism carried over from his great midperiod to films like 'La Ceremonie' and the more relaxed comic works like 'Cop Au Vin' or 'Rien ne va plus'.  the seriousness can be found within a plot about individual and family tragedy the treatment is never flippant and the ending is numbing.  The 'fun' if you want to call it that arises from Chabrol's winking contract with his audience offering a magnificently contrived story about parents and children possible switches of babies boyfriends who conveniently happen to be trainee forensic scientists and so can check chocalate stains for poison adding up to a mystery story whose solution is actually revealed in the first half hour. The fun lies not in who done it  there are no other suspects there may not even be a crime  but what is going on in the heroine's head with Chabrol littering clues and red herrings.  He is gloriously helped by Isabelle Huppert's obfuscating performance her character's fundamental blankness  she is an observer judging others' reactions  is varied by vacuousness hysteria somnolence good humour tenderness calculation.  Which of these if any are the 'real' Mika?  In a film characteristically loaded with allusions to Greek mythology Mika is Arachne a spider caught in her own web appropriately the design on her sofa as her defeat sinks in suggesting it was never her web in the first place but that of the bourgeoisie to which she as an orphaned outsider never truly belonged every cunning plan never bringng her closer to the object of her desire the wearyingly narcissistic Polonski.  Of course Chabrol achieves his effects more subtly than mere plot legpulling  as the allusion to Fritz Lang suggests it is the smoothly unstable playing with point of view that unsettles our attempts at definitive explanations.  It might be going too far to suggest that Chabrol's method in the film is Cubist but he has an unsettling habit of breaking up sequences cutting between camera positions as if he is starting a new scene although it's just another angle on the same one.  This can happen when he shifts the focus from one group of characters in a scene to another more distractingly it can happen within one group itself breaking up a conversation with camera angles or colour tones that don't match. Despite the title and the central McGuffin about poisoned chocolate the film's governing metaphor is the music that frequently punctuates the narrative Liszt's 'Funerailles'!.  The central structural unit the preserve of that other Chabrol idol Hitchcock is the double or reproduction  the film begins with a oncemarried couple remarrying the officiary and 'bride' sharing the same red hair.  The main action towards which the narrative leads doubles an action that shadows the entire film the death of the first wife right down to the son suffering the same ankle injury.  The plot is full of parents and their children many of dubious certainty about their relationships.  In the piano sequences the original pieces are doubled by the pianists' interpretations further reproduced in a recording Polonski and Jeanne listen to on two pianos reflecting their bourgeois surroundings they become a weird kind of incestuous sublimation. All this doubling and reproduction serves to further isolate Mika a ganging up on her in terms of form and content increasing a sympathy enlisted enlisted by Huppert's acting and achieving a kind of empty tragedy.".

From the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. It is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. It is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. The plot is not only banal but preposterous. How many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? Maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? In truth their is no tenable plot at all. It is riddle with holes like a good piece of French cheese.Whether intentional or not it is a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. I concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steadycam in this film  it would have woke them all up! Other than it being a nonsense story the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location. A telling line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! Oh dear me.On the DVD Miss Huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. Smirking she says Like they do in the American Actor's Studio! I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor's Studio.If there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when Huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away'. No doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film.Safety Medical Note. In the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never be done. Only cold water should be used.Minus 10 marks.".

Although Merci pour le chocolat is not one of his best contributions to the genre it has a subtlety that shows he is was still up to his tricks when he made this movie.Mika Muller was married briefly to the man she now calls her husband the wearyeyed Andre Polonsky a talented pianist. Mika loves to prepare chocolate a specialty she has known well being as she is connected to the industry. She also loves to lace her brews with a substance that will induce sleeping to whoever she wants to get rid of. Andre's second wife suffered a fatal accident after drinking the chocolate Mika prepared for her and got her and Andre back together again.Mika gets a dislike for Jeanne Pollet a piano student who suspects that Andre is her father. This theory is the result of the revelation that Jeanne's mother tells her about having been switched momentarily at birth with Axel the son of Andre and his late wife. In fact Jeanne sees a possibility in her theory because like Andre she has a passion for the piano while Axel shows no interest. The best thing in the film is Isabelle Huppert who makes another one of her memorable screen characters come alive. One can see in her face the emotions Mika is experiencing. This actress gives a seamless performance about the evil woman who has gone above and beyond to destroy lives. Anna Mouglalis also made an impression as Jeanne the young woman who solves the puzzle and is at the same time an almost victim of the possessed Mika. Jacques Dutronc plays Andre.Another interesting Claude Chabrol film that will please his fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get real people. Nightcap just ain't that great. After reading some of the critical comments on this film I decided there was as much projecting going on by reviewers as by the people who cast the film's imagery on the silver screen.  Chabrol or no Chabrol Nightcap is awkward mechanical scripted incredible unbelievable monotonous and has an unsatisfying conclusion. Yes it has an upside too including Huppert Huppert more Huppert and some intriguingly ominous undercurrents etc. However there's just too much wrong with execution and too little payoff in the end to make this film a worthwhile subtitle read for most nonFrench audiences. In short this is like some really bad early Hitchcock. Recommended only for critics French film devotees film fest groupies Chabrol fans and the like. C".
