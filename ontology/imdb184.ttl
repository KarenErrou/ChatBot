	schema:reviewBody "At last  I've finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of Pakeezah! Up until now I've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off Dubai TV sometime in the '90's with quirky English subtitles dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own. Having thought the world of such a poor and short copy I find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than I thought possible.This was the lovely Meena Kumari's film from start to finish and I believe was planned by her from 1958 on finally realising it in 1971. What a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in Pakeezah necessitating a body double. In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.The story of Purity versus Adversity I can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it but I'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in India. It's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too. But to me it's the peerless golden music by Ghulam Mohammed as sung by the incomparable Lata Mangeshkar  especially Thare Rahiyo  and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding. I've seldom heard such serious beautiful poetic wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack. Singin' In The Rain may be my favourite musical film but Pakeezah has my favourite music  yet Lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her. The only pity is that the also unique Mohammed Rafi only had the one song in here albeit a classic duet with Lata. Because of all this but not blind to its faults Pakeezah is my favourite Indian movie filmed at a time when the Westernisation of India was gathering pace and watched now when Western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur. At the very least watch Pakeezah for a taste of what Indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines the Bollywood Beat and bhangra.".

Some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when Meena Kumari refuses to say YES as an approval for Nikah Marriage Bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy. At the moment Raj Kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of Kumari and onto the legs of Kumar........Kamal Amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years. He had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without Meena's close ups because Meena Kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971.".

Songs on All India Radio especially Inhi LogoN ne were played so often that I was sick of them at the time despite recognising their beauty! Yes it did take all those years to make. This was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film looking at the sumptous sets and costumes not surprising!! Not only does Meena Kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to Lata's voice. Inhi logoN ne has her 50's younger voice while songs that were rerecorded like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development. I only wish someone would find the Ghulam Mohammad songs that weren't included in the film because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them. Lata in a recent interview 2007 rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with apart from Madan Mohan a great personal friend. Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs very unusual. There is only a brief shot of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon. Any other film this song would have had closeups of both of them.As for this being the finest film ever I would beg to differ. It means you have missed a lot of Indian cinema in no particular order films like Barsaat old Devdas older versions Bandini Do Bigha Zameen Garam Hava Dastak Guddi Aan Pyasa Kagaz ke Phool Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam Kabuliwallah Abhimaan Guide Sujatha Bombay ka Babu Daag Parineeta old Umrao Jaan etc. etc. And if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from Barsat Ki Raat to Naya Daur Teesri Manzil Mahal Aag Jugnu Anand Mera Naam Joker the list is really endless!So enjoy Pakeezah but don't miss out on any of the above...".

Aldous HuxleyIt was some years back that my son presented me with a complimentary ticket for a special screening of this movie in Tokyo in connection with some commemorative occasion which totally escapes me now along with the venue. I had never heard of Pakeezah but I had recently returned from my first or second trip to India and my enthusing about my impressions and experiences there had obviously prompted him to give me the ticket that had somehow come into his hands he had no interest in going himself. As things turned out I missed it. But I knew I had missed something special I believe the ticket contained the word legendary and so began what must've been about a decade of searching for it in the erstwhile video stores and today's DVD home delivery rental operations all to absolutely no avail. You can imagine my joy when I finally found the whole thing available for viewing online with English subtitles.Pakeezah Pure Heart is indeed special but certainly not because of the story. It is an ofttold tale of an illstarred woman in this case a tawaif singerdancer courtesan who eventually finds happiness after a lifetime of hardship through some incredible i.e. non credible twists of fate. The plot is frankly ludicrous. The courtesan or rather her mother both roles played by Ashok Kumar rarely appears out of her dancing costume or without makeup even when wandering around a cemetery in the throes of death. Inconsistencies? It is hard to tell in what age the drama is set its times seem at once medieval and modern. I was puzzled when a wellheeled nawab patron stepped out of a horsedrawn carriage wearing sunglasses but later learned that shades could very well have been around in the latter days of steam locomotives. Ditto for the stage sets. There is something extremely unreal and artificial about every character every incident every room every thing. And the vicissitudes of the narrative are predictable in their unpredictability.But what Pakeezah has is beauty and in an abundance that can be matched by few other movies. It is concentrated in its songanddance scenes which are thankfully many. Director Kamal Amrohi was reportedly a perfectionist and the dances in the classical kathak style were obviously the chief focuses for his practice of this predilection. They are truly too much  too rich beautiful to an excessive degree. In creating them he left nothing to chance or naturalness and obsessively and meticulously put his hand to everything in them meaning not only furnishings and appurtenances in interiors but also background scenery and activity out the window and even the skies and heavenly bodies in them which may actually be in flux during the number. Furthermore the musical compositions are without exception as far as I am concerned excellent works in themselves. Even in subtitles the lovely poetic lyrics of the songs sung mainly by playbacksinger godmother Lata Mangeshkar in her prime accompanying the dances ring true and resonate in the heart with a genuineness of sentiment. In short all the elements come together perfectly in displays of total cinematographic art that delight the eye ear heart and mind. Charged with virtually palpable passion and desire to boot the dance scenes are nothing less than intoxicating.The reality of Pakeeza therefore lies in its dance vignettes whose truth and beauty are only thrown into sharper relief by the unreality and mediocrity of much of the footage framing them. Their consummation in the film after 14 years' worth of trials and tribulations attests to the director's unswerving commitment to his aesthetics and conviction in their value. In this sense his is the real pakeezah.Needless to say a 10 for the dance scenes. James Koetting".

	schema:reviewBody "Pakeezah is a story of family of values of pride but mostly of love. It is a story of the love between two people. And the misguided love of fathers for their sons. Or is it love?SPOILERSWhen the son of a rich man falls in love with a prostitute he looks beyond her past and marries her. But as loving as he is that is how stubborn and unforgiving his father is. He rejects his new daughterinlaw who as a broken woman takes up residence in a cemetary where she lives for only one purpose. To give birth to her child. After the child a girl is born she dies and the child is brought up by her mother's sister who runs the brothel where her mother used to work. The girl Pakeezah ends up dancing in this brothel just as her mother before her. One day while travelling by train a stranger Salim accidentally wanders into her compartment. He is immediately enchanted by this wonderful creature though mostly by her feet fetishist?. He writes her a note and she instantly falls in love with the man who wrote this note. Ironically as fate would have it Salim is the nephew of Pakeezah's father. History is about to repeat itself. Or is it?A story about an impossible love. A story about destiny. Pakeezah is considered by many to be a cinematic masterpiece. As a novice to classic Bollywood movies it's difficult to put this film in its context. Comparing it to other movies however I can't help but wonder whether its fame is a hype or not. Undoubtedly it's a beautiful story. But it's also extremely long and at times tedious. A story strung together by unrealistic coincidences. Maybe this is a sign of destiny at work. Or perhaps it is a sign of a weak script!I'm glad I watched it but I infinitely enjoyed movies such as Bobby with Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia and Kudrat with Hema Malini and Rajesh Khanna more and those are also classics in their own right.Pakeezah despite any flaws it might have remains interesting if not for its story then for its history. Pakeezah took fourteen years to complete. Its production was thwarted by the passing of Meena Kumari who plays the main role. Another actress was sought to finish filming this movie and she was meticulously weaved into the story. On another interesting note some might have noticed that Meena Kumari always hides her left hand. The reason for this is that she was very conscious about the fact she didn't have a pinky finger. Finally a word about the music. The songs in Pakeezah are absolutely beautiful and they alone already make this movie worthwile.5 stars".

Watching the actress who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released has the same fascination as watching a train wreck.

Some close to masterpieces others great work and just a few notsogood ones. Like 'Mere Apne' wasn't too appealing for me. Lekin Achanak Hu Tu Tu and Libaas are those I haven't seen yet. But still there are certain elements that are common in almost all Gulzar films. 1. Stories of longing unfulfilled love Ijaazat Aandhi Mausam Machis Khushboo and Kinara 2. Screenplays with strategic flashbacks and flashforwards Ijaazat Aandhi Mausam Machis Kitaab and Kinara 3. Mature multilayered characters who talk like Gulzar all of his films 4. A title that can be interpreted in beautiful ways Ijaazat Aandhi Mausam Kitaab Parichay Khushboo Angoor KinaraThis time it was different. It was again a story of longing of unfulfilled love. But its screenplay structure is slightly different. It looks more like a Shyam Benegal Mrinal Sen Govind Nihalani type of screenplay with Gulzar's dialogues. It takes its own time to grow moves slowly and is not as cerebral as his other screenplay structures. Even the plot points are subtle and not dramatic enough.There is one flashback sequence coming late in the movie. Otherwise it is a linear narrative.Characters are mature but not multilayered. They are simple which is a welcome change from Gulzar. They are poor caught in the simple troubles of life. For them everyday bread is a greater concern than falling in love. They are not very educated and although they still 'talk like Gulzar' they are more like themselves.And the title is based on one of the principal characters.It is more like an European film. Its drama is like that of a Kieslowski film. It is more like an account of the lives of these people than a complete story with dramatic twists.It is still great. And it ends in a beautiful and haunting manner. Moving you deeply.Now the catch.I have watched this film just today. And what I come to know is  the DVD version is abridged. The original cut had a dramatic twist in the end. Hence the lack of drama that I talked about in my comment. I read what the original ending was. But I prefer it this way. The DVD version was good enough for me. I doubt the original cut would have appealed me equally.It is a must watch for Gulzar fans. For those who are new to his cinema you should first go for Ijaazat Maachis Mausam Aandhi Kitaab and Koshish.".

What sets 'Namkeen' apart from his other works is that this one has a more Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Shyam Benegal feel to it rather than the Gulzar signature. It is one of his lesser known films. 'Namkeen' too is a story of unfulfilled love like 'Ijaazat' 'Aandhi' and 'Mausam' but here the story is given a more slice of life treatment a glimpse into the characters' life rather than having it 'follow a plot'.'Namkeen' has a lyrical feel to it a common factor in Gulzar's movies and the landscape I'm assuming it's in Darjeeling is breathtaking. The characters are easy to relate to and endearing. There are only about two or three songs but they are beautifully visualized and the lyrics are mesmerizing.Gulzar beautifully displays Jyoti and her three daughters' struggle to get by every day. These are poor people and their daily concern is winning bread and other necessary requirements such as oil. They don't have time to fall in love but that doesn't mean that they don't have dreams. A voiceless Mitthu expresses her words in poetry while the youngest Chimki is a vivacious spirit. Nimki is the eldest one who keeps the family together as she takes care of all the household activities and makes sure that all the requirements are met while the hardworking mother Jyoti is at work all day. Gerulal brings a pleasant change to their lives.Sanjeev Kumar once again plays a part only he could do justice to. Waheeda Rehman is barely recognizable. Not only does she look different but even her voice is distinct from what we're familiar with. She's clearly a master of her craft. The same can be said of Sharmila Tagore and Shabana Azmi who are nothing short of remarkable. Kiran Vairale is vivacious as the lively young Chimki.'Namkeen' is one of Gulzar's most underrated works and it is a treat to watch. Thanks to Gulzar for giving us a glimpse of the lives of these colourful characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "What I liked about this movie was its ending. Quite unlike in other movies Tapasyaa for e.g. where sacrifice is glorified this movie brings it to the point that sacrifice on one's part does not necessarily bring happiness to others.If Gerulal and Nimki had married right away there would have been hope for everybody. The sacrifice on Nimki's part just brings up hope in Mitthu's heart and she dies of despair when Gherulal doesn't return.Chinki is the only one who takes the matter in her own hands and takes up the work of Nautanki to escape the misery at home. Guided by her Gerulal returns to find Namki old and living in the desolate home a reflection of her own mother. Gerulal's love has still remained the same and they move away. A move which if had been put in action years back might have probably saved lives!Altogether a moving story without getting melodramatic".

	onyx:emotionText "What I liked about this movie was its ending. Quite unlike in other movies Tapasyaa for e.g. where sacrifice is glorified this movie brings it to the point that sacrifice on one's part does not necessarily bring happiness to others.If Gerulal and Nimki had married right away there would have been hope for everybody. The sacrifice on Nimki's part just brings up hope in Mitthu's heart and she dies of despair when Gherulal doesn't return.Chinki is the only one who takes the matter in her own hands and takes up the work of Nautanki to escape the misery at home. Guided by her Gerulal returns to find Namki old and living in the desolate home a reflection of her own mother. Gerulal's love has still remained the same and they move away. A move which if had been put in action years back might have probably saved lives!Altogether a moving story without getting melodramatic";

I picked up the DVD yesterday and was disappointed that the ending had been changed. I remember that it was a very real and tragic yet hopeful ending. The DVD had Girulal driving away in his truck in the final scene song. The original movie had him come back to find the small household gone. Email me if you want to know what happened because I don't want to put the ending here and get blocked by IMDb. Gulzar has always told stories worth telling. He brings together his talents as a writer director and an artist to weave a deeply human story that touches you. He makes it entertaining while bravely delving into the depths of the story even if it's likely to be unpopular. He does this with dialogues that are realistic and yet laden with emotion and drama. I have been amazed at his work in Mausam Maachis Ijaazat and other movies. Certainly one of India's best artists. He deserves to be recognized as such.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's generally held that we learn something every day and my piece of education for today consisted of the fact that the Portugese occupied Goa from the 16th century to 1961 when it was reclaimed by the people of Goa with assistance from the Indian Navy. I learnt this largely from the film PUKAR 1983.Ramdas is a young boy whose father is a member of the Goa liberation party terrorists or freedom fighters depending on your perspective and whose name means something like Patriotism. One night he witnesses his father being shot by another member of the revolutionary party... but he doesn't realise that it was at his father's request since he was wounded running from the police and preferred to die than be captured and tortured. Blaming them for his father's death Ramdas grows up hating all people that call themselves Patriots... he changes his name to Ronnie to avoid association with them. As he gets older he goes into the smuggling business and his lust for wealth and power drive him up the ladders until he is a very powerful crime boss. He is a benign enough crime boss and puts some of his profits from smuggling back into the community... however he still has a burning anger towards the Goan patriots and uses all his power and influence to have them killed and captured when he can.The little boy who witnesses his father's death grows up to be a bigshot gangster and hides a deep anger towards his father's killers is pretty much the archetypal Amitabh Bachchan character and one he'd played many times previously to PUKAR. What makes PUKAR unusual is that the killers are not totally immoral crooks for once  they're considered by most of the population of Goa to be heroes. Ronnie is still an angry young ish man but his anger is not necessarily well directed. Although he's still the main character we're not meant to agree with Amitabh's beliefs or actions... in fact in many ways he is the villain and we're supposed to actively dislike him. Given that Amitabh is one of my personal heroes this made me feel rather uncomfortableOne thing that many a Hindi movie teaches however is that a man can never escape the destiny given to him by his name. Even though Ramdas refuses to acknowledge his name the viewer feels fairly certain it will catch up with him... or will it?Films about revolutions and revolutionaries are pretty rare for Hollywood does THE MATRIX count? and as far as I know for most of the world's cinema. It's only really through Indian cinema that I've had any real exposure to them except perhaps as villainous terrorists. Patriotism is a word even more venerated in India than it is in America and people fighting and dying to liberate their country from foreign occupation are generally well considered... after all it's not that long since India gained independence from long British occupation. Hearing India's popular entertainment king Amitabh denounce patriotism and collaborate with the Portugese occupiersoppressors is particularly strange!Although PUKAR was a big hit and has a very high score at IMDB I don't consider it to be one of Amitabh's better films. Even though he's always played the Dark Hero his role in Pukar isn't one that fits him too well though he still gives a good performance. Perhaps if it was the first Amitabh film I'd seen I'd have appreciated it more but I think the problems are more than just discomfort in seeing Amitabh in an unfamiliar role. The story telling is not handled as well as in his better films such as SHOLAY or MUQADDAR KA SIKANDAR with several jumps and holes that left me a little confused as to exactly what was going on. The film didn't bring out the wide range of emotions in me that I'd hoped either  perhaps because of the slightly clumsy story telling or because the quality of acting on display wasn't all that high notably Zeenat Aman is thoroughly beautiful but not a good actress. Perhaps if I'd been more familiar with Goa's history I'd have appreciatedunderstood more.The film is still quite enjoyable with a pretty good balance of drama and action. Although it doesn't rank amongst Amitabh's great films it must be noted that those films are so great that not being one of them is hardly a major failing. Taken as a part of Amitabh's career it's clearly placed on the downswing but taken as a film in it's own right it's a pretty watchable 160 minutes.710".

He is a benign enough crime boss and puts some of his profits from smuggling back into the community... however he still has a burning anger towards the Goan patriots and uses all his power and influence to have them killed and captured when he can.The little boy who witnesses his father's death grows up to be a bigshot gangster and hides a deep anger towards his father's killers is pretty much the archetypal Amitabh Bachchan character and one he'd played many times previously to PUKAR. What makes PUKAR unusual is that the killers are not totally immoral crooks for once  they're considered by most of the population of Goa to be heroes. Ronnie is still an angry young ish man but his anger is not necessarily well directed. Although he's still the main character we're not meant to agree with Amitabh's beliefs or actions... in fact in many ways he is the villain and we're supposed to actively dislike him. Given that Amitabh is one of my personal heroes this made me feel rather uncomfortableOne thing that many a Hindi movie teaches however is that a man can never escape the destiny given to him by his name. Even though Ramdas refuses to acknowledge his name the viewer feels fairly certain it will catch up with him... or will it?Films about revolutions and revolutionaries are pretty rare for Hollywood does THE MATRIX count? and as far as I know for most of the world's cinema. It's only really through Indian cinema that I've had any real exposure to them except perhaps as villainous terrorists. Patriotism is a word even more venerated in India than it is in America and people fighting and dying to liberate their country from foreign occupation are generally well considered... after all it's not that long since India gained independence from long British occupation. Hearing India's popular entertainment king Amitabh denounce patriotism and collaborate with the Portugese occupiersoppressors is particularly strange!Although PUKAR was a big hit and has a very high score at IMDB I don't consider it to be one of Amitabh's better films. Even though he's always played the Dark Hero his role in Pukar isn't one that fits him too well though he still gives a good performance. Perhaps if it was the first Amitabh film I'd seen I'd have appreciated it more but I think the problems are more than just discomfort in seeing Amitabh in an unfamiliar role. The story telling is not handled as well as in his better films such as SHOLAY or MUQADDAR KA SIKANDAR with several jumps and holes that left me a little confused as to exactly what was going on. The film didn't bring out the wide range of emotions in me that I'd hoped either  perhaps because of the slightly clumsy story telling or because the quality of acting on display wasn't all that high notably Zeenat Aman is thoroughly beautiful but not a good actress. Perhaps if I'd been more familiar with Goa's history I'd have appreciatedunderstood more.The film is still quite enjoyable with a pretty good balance of drama and action. Although it doesn't rank amongst Amitabh's great films it must be noted that those films are so great that not being one of them is hardly a major failing. Taken as a part of Amitabh's career it's clearly placed on the downswing but taken as a film in it's own right it's a pretty watchable 160 minutes.710";

	schema:reviewBody "1983 was one of Amitabh's worst years as not only did he act in flop films but his accident during Coolie almost killed him. Coolie was mainly a hit because of that accident and honestly it was one of Manmohan Desai's bad films. However 1983 was more a crass year for Bachcan because he acted in films like MahaanNastik Pukar and Andhaa Kanoon all of which sank without a trace.After the super success of Shakti1982 Amitabh returned with Pukar which was something extremely different for it's time. The film was about Goa and it's independence from the Portugese people. However Amitabh is against the revolutionaries because he saw his father get killed by the revolutionaries. What he didn't know was his father died because his father was in condition where he couldn't escape any longer from the police. Ramdas changes his name to Ronnie and slowly becomes a rich man due to his illegal works. Randhir Kapoor watches his uncle one of the last revolutionaries die because of Ronnie's betrayal in providing them some weapons. Randhir or Shekhar himself becomes a revolutionary and vows to free Goa from these Portugese people. Amitabh gets Shekhar arrested but later he realizes what a mistake he has committed. Shekar and the revolutionaries weren't bad the police and the Portugese were bad. Roonie saves Shekar from getting hanged and the film ends after an action packed climax.The biggest problem with the film is the sudden change of sides which is unconvincing. Ronnie suddenly changes sides nearing the end because he sees that Shekhar's father was the same guy who saved him from getting arrested in his childhood. This reason is not strong enough for one man to realize his mistake and stop being on the bad side. The movie has several well handled scenes but the flow is missing in parts. The romantic portions are boring and the film drags till Shekhar vows to save Goa from these Portugese people. The ending is stretched but the outcome is good.Direction by Ramesh Behl is good in parts he could've handled the early and post interval portions better. The abrupt change of Amitabh and the dragged song before the climax makes his direction weak.Amitabh Bachchan is a talented superstar for a reason his expressions are good and his dialog delivery is amazing. His action is also quite good. Randhir Kapoor is good in his part he saves the film in the second half because the drag makes the movie boring. Zeenat Aman is gorgeous and her acting is good as well. Tina Munim is OK she doesn't have much of a role. Om Shivpuri is good but he doesn't get a big role like he did in some of his previous movies with Amitabh Bachchan. Prem Chopra as the sinister villain is good he overacts a little in some parts though. The rest provide decent support.Music is the best part of the film Bachke Rehna is a good song while Tu Mainke is good as well. Samundar Me is one of the best and is catchy as well. The other songs are good as well.On the whole Pukar is one of those different Bachchan films that flopped. It could've been better but it's much better than Ramesh Behl's next film Indrajeet1991 which was worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vidhaata is a very enjoyable Hindi movie of its time. Subhash Ghai gathers some of the greatest talents of those times including Dilip Kumar Shammi Kapoor Sanjeev Kumar Sanjay Dutt and Amrish Puri. The story is quite an interesting one and the development is very well brought out. The film does veer into formulaic caricature from time to time. Much of the action borders on the fantasy but then it is well made up for by some intriguing twists. One scene between Amrish Puri and Dilip Kumar which involves the explosion of a car is greatly entertaining. Unfortunately the second half is marred by proceedings which are uncalled for. Similarly the love story involved is not very convincing and contributed little to the story.The main highpoint of this picture is unquestionably the acting. No one can ever doubt Dilip Kumar's extraordinary acting prowess and in this film he turns in what I consider his best work of the decade along with Shakti. He is tremendous as Shamsher a simple working man who turns into a mafia don. This is one of the few Hindi movies where such a transformation is credible and without question due credit for this should go to the actor himself for his renowned ability to portray complex characters with rare natural ease and realism. As his character adopts a new name and identity he appears greatly stylish and sophisticated but his immense love for his grandson and the pain over the loss of his son are utterly convincing. This is just another understated performance which never fails to leave a lasting impact on the audience.The rest of the cast are there to support the screen legend in his authorbacked role and all do well. Sanjeev Kumar is unsurprisingly dependable in a small supporting role and Amrish Puri is excellent in a villainous part which is slightly better than his usual parts of this sort. Sanjay Dutt makes a confident debut and he is well paired with the beautiful Padmini Kolhapure even if the two are the least impressive here. The one who almost if not totally manages to steal the show however is the wonderful Shammi Kapoor whose welletched comic part provides the main glimmer of relief in an otherwise heavy story. He is simply brilliant as Shamsher's agelong and loyal friend soulfully portraying the wholesome admirable kindness of the character and exuding warmth at all levels.Vidhaata is like many films of its kind but at the same time it is a cut above the usual fare presented at the time. In this sense it is a very good film well worth seeing. Ultimately it is the acting particularly by Dilip Kumar and Shammi Kapoor which elevates it to an altogether different level and more than makes up for its flaws.".

Sam's gang is sweetly gunneddown bit by bit and Bugsy is ultimately recruited to get a hold of this new weapon and rebuild the gang which he does with the homeless DownAndOuts and boxer Leroy Smith played by Paul Murphy. Baio is remarkable if you can believe that and most of the performances are amazing!  Jodi Foster excels as vampy niteclub singer Tallulah and Florrie Dugger as Blousey Brown  in her only role to date is wonderful as Bugsy's piquant love interest.  I just don't understand why more of these childactors didn't go on to bigger and better things like Jodi Foster! And whoever played Babyface is remarkable showing threetimes the amount of charisma of Macaulay Culkin. The film was nominated for a series of Oscars and Golden Globe awards and it's apparent as to why.  Paul Williams' score is amazing  so many of these songs should be remade!  If telling you to seek this one out for sure!".

Fat Sam's gang is under threat as another gang is trying to take other there territory and doing this very successfully as they have Splurge Guns. Whilst as Fat Sam's Bugsy meets Blousey Dugger and they start dating. One by one all of fat Sam's gang is killed off and only he is left. Bugsy then promised Blousey he will buy them a ticket to Hollywood so to get the money he begging to work for fat Sam and help him save his business but will he succeed and will him and Blousey ever make it to Hollywood? This is a very unique movie and they will never by one like it. It is unique in3 ways.1. It is a gangster movie which uses child actors which brings a knew type of energy to the movie.2. It uses splurge guns instead of real guns which use dream instead of bullets and this makes the movie more suitable for younger children and 3. When the children are singing it's not actually them singing which make the songs sound nicer but is also quite a comedic effect to see this big strong voices coming out of such little kids .I also think it is interesting that some of the actors become very famous actors when they got older such a Scott Baio and Jodie Foster. I think this movie is great and there is just something about it is just great and all the characters are so lovable. It's just a great family film for anyone and is suitable for all ages and everyone will enjoy it!".

It makes the film feel more lowbudget than it should.

Instead of real guns they have either guns that splurge out custard pie to kill people or just custard pies. 3. The songs are very fun and very varied sort of fun but not completely cheerful which is good. 4. The idea is very good and must have been worked on quite a lot even though the plot goes all over the place in confusing directions. 5. This film is enjoyable for a wide variety of ages  although best for those aged 9 and up.A gangster gang in America are losing business and most importantly  men. Meanwhile Bugsy Malone a member of the gang lives casually and easily also talking to a new woman called Blousie Brown.

	onyx:emotionText "I am inclined to list a number of reasons why this film is special and one of a kind.1. This is a gangster film and yet all the cast are children. They do an amazing job. 2. Instead of real guns they have either guns that splurge out custard pie to kill people or just custard pies. 3. The songs are very fun and very varied sort of fun but not completely cheerful which is good. 4. The idea is very good and must have been worked on quite a lot even though the plot goes all over the place in confusing directions. 5. This film is enjoyable for a wide variety of ages  although best for those aged 9 and up.A gangster gang in America are losing business and most importantly  men. Meanwhile Bugsy Malone a member of the gang lives casually and easily also talking to a new woman called Blousie Brown. On both sides of the story things are soon about to change...Enjoy Bugsy Malone! ";

	schema:reviewBody "One's expectations for an early60s B movie from American International Pictures are never very high. But this movie was a surprisingly well thought out  thoughtprovoking story.Just as a family has left LA for a vacation in the woods the US suffers a massive nuclear attack on all its major cities from uh an unnamed enemy. Wink wink... But you won't find any marauding mutants here. In fact this film isn't about nuclear war per se. It really wants to explore the nature of civilized society. The father well portrayed by Ray Milland is grimly determined to protect his family at all costs for as long as it takes for order  civil authority to be restored which he's sure will be a long time coming.The father is a good man but a little paranoid  controlling. This probably wouldn't be noticeable in normal times but now they're in a panicked rush to escape the LA metro area  gather enough supplies to last for months in the wilderness  ahead of all the other people who are starting to clog up the freeways  empty out the grocery stores along the escape route. The contradiction between following the rules  protecting your loved ones in desperate times is very effectively illustrated as he makes some reckless decisions along the way.Normally for a low budget 60's film like this I wouldn't even bother thinking about how it could've been improved. But since it's so good at presenting a major moral dilemma in a realistic way think of these nits as a sign of respect Milland's character could use a little more introspection but of course so could a lot of early 60's dads! Not that Milland's performance was wooden  it was great. But his character had a very constricted personality. His wife could use a little more assertiveness. She actually realizes this and explains that she's still in shock over the attack  but after Sept. 11 a lot of us understand that after a good catharsis we can deal with a lot of trauma that initially would immobilize us. After having a good cry she could've acted as a better conscience for some of the father's more paranoid acts. Also the daughter's character needed some fleshing out.But of course this is an early 60's film and clearly made on a low budget. And given its time  budget it is an amazing gem of a film. Definitely one to seek out!".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say I had the greatest expectations for this lowbudget postapocalyptic thriller directed by none other than Ray Milland. Though his career was undoubtedly in something of a downturn by the early 1960s the Oscarwinning actor briefly found new life in the realm of Bmovies starring in Roger Corman's 'X The Man with Xray Eyes 1963.' The previous year however Milland indulged in his occasional interest in directing in total he has five features to his name as well as numerous television episodes with 'Panic in Year Zero! 1962.' Against all odds this underappreciated gem is among the best of its kind somehow even managing to outclass Stanley Kramer's starstudded 'On the Beach 1959' of three years earlier. Ever since I read Arthur Conan Doyle's The Poison Belt in 2007 I've wanted to make my own postapocalyptic film and fascinatingly this is exactly the sort of production I'd envisioned sparse in action and characters but utilising the family's isolation to bring home the terror of their predicament.The theme of nuclear apocalypse was most common in the early 1960s when relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were at their most hostile. Some films such as Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove 1964' and Lumet's 'FailSafe 1964' chronicled the events leading up to such an incident whereas Kramer's 'On the Beach 1959' took place in the following months. What these bigbudget offerings have in common is that they focus primarily on the bigplayers in the Cold War particularly the government and military officials. 'Panic in Year Year!' deals out of budgetary necessity more than anything else with ordinary people in an unfathomable situation and is all the better for it. When Harry Baldwin Milland takes his family on a fishing trip the sudden flash of light emanating from Los Angeles is initially mistaken for lightning followed by the mundane remark that I hope it doesn't rain. The Baldwins are a regular American family who don't deserve to have their lives and lifestyles exploited like cheap pawns in a game of chess.It's interesting that the charming rogues of the 1940s such as Ray Milland and George Sanders turned into convincing familyorientated men during their autumn years of acting. Milland is excellent in the main role a dedicated father and husband who in his determination to persevere finds himself abandoning the very civilised morals for which he is fighting. Despite creating a strong sense of the chaos and lawlessness that accompanies a national catastrophe the film's message is still an overwhelingly positive one that the bonds of family and friendship are a crucial necessity in difficult times. There are of course a few unlikely plot turns  by coincidence the two groups of people who seek refuge in the Baldwins' hideaway are the very two with whom the family had had previously altercations  and the occasional moment that can only be described as Bmovie silliness my favourite is the announcement that the sole outcome of an urgent United Nations meeting was to give this year a dramaticsounding name. Even so 'Panic in Year Zero!' is a gripping and unforgettable addition to the sciencefiction genre.".

By the time he wound up at AIP he was little more than a hasbeen to the public. But he retained real talent as his directing and starring in this and other Scifi pictures of the period shows. When given a free hand as in Panic In Year Zero! he took on challenges otherswould have shied away from and showed that he still had a lot to offer. Sadly big time directors continued to ignore him and the end of his life was defined by roles in Frogs and The Thing With Two Heads  films far worse than anything with Corman's name on them.Panic in Year Zero! displays the basic conflict of compromise Ray's character must compromise his beliefs and code of behavior in order to preserve what he cares for. His constant conflict with his wife displays the conflict betweendiffering ideas of what needs to be preserved  to her saving the family by acts of savagery is unacceptable and the only way to preserve civilization is to apply its rules in every situation. The ending seems to redeem Ray but the fact is that the questions raised are answered by each viewer in the course of the film in his or her own way. Events in the film are not onesided and Ray's relation to the hardware store owner calls into question his position and correctness perhaps by allying himself earlier with other decent people trying to survive Ray could have saved his family from some of what it endures. As we now reacclimate ourselves to an era in which the possibility of limited nuclear attack from national or independent terrorist groups seems more likely than Mutual Assured Destruction it is possible that films such as Panic in Year Zero! offer us important ethical problems.

	schema:reviewBody "Former matine idol Ray Milland directed this lukewarm melodrama about a family of four embarking on a fishing trip when Soviet nuclear warheads rain widespread destruction down on the United States and devastate every major city from coasttocoast. The NATO countries suffer similar disasters so you knoweven though the filmmakers never specify it that the Soviets started World War III. The Baldwins hear an explosion after they have left home. In the distance they see a massive mushroom cloud hovering over their hometown of Los Angeles. Panic in the Year Zero explores the transformation that Harry Baldwin Ray Milland of Safecracker experiences between the time that he leaves his home in Los Angeles and winds up at his new home in a cave in the mountains. Once Harry learns that civilization as he knows it has vanished he starts behaving like an entirely different individual. Law and orderthe justice system as a whole has collapsed and men with guns rule the land and these unscrupulous gunmen try to take what they want because America has become a jungle. Initially Harry pays for everything that he can carry in his trailer and he spends every last cent until he runs out of money and resorts to taking everything by force of arms.Meanwhile Harry's wife Ann Baldwin Jean Hagen of Sunrise at Campobello has difficult getting accustomed to the demands that this change of lifestyle has imposed on them. When three hoodlums try to waylay them on the highway Harry's son Rick Baldwin Frankie Avalon of Guns of the Timberlands wings one of them. This act of violence terrifies Ann. Eventually Ann accepts their fate and learns how to use a rifle. The family crosses a bridge into the mountains but Harry destroys it to prevent others from following him. They take up residence in a cave that Rick had found during an earlier fishing trip. At one point Harry had to steal from a hardware dealer but he promised to pay Johnson Richard Garland of 13 Fighting Men back. He even hands over his wallet with his identification and credit cards. Later after they have established themselves snugly in the mountains the Baldwins run into Johnson. The first time that they met in Johnson's hardware store Johnson got the drop on Harry but Rick slipped up behind him with a gun. Basically the same thing happens again but Harry lets Johnson go and hands him his revolver back. Harry plans to visit Johnson but before he can the three young hoodlums from the highway jump Johnson and his wife and kill them.Later two of the hoodlums catch Harry's daughter Karen Baldwin Mary Mitchel of Twist Around the Clock while she is alone and rape her. Ann shoots at them but she misses every shot. When Johnson met Harry again he mentioned the three men living it up in a house and making a racket. Harry and Rick check the house out and Harry kills Mickey Rex Holman of 20000 Eyes and Andy Neil Nephew of The Young Savages with a pump action shotgun while Rick watches. Killing the two hoodlums tears up Harry but Harry and Rick find a hostage Marilyn Hayes Joan Freeman of Come September and they bring her back to the cave. Eventually Carl Richard Bakalyan of Operation Bikini catches Marilyn off guard when she is supposed to be watching out for Rick as he chops firewood. Rick manages to kill Carl but he takes a slug in the leg and Harry piles the family into a car and tears off into the darkness to find a doctor. While this is happening the Baldwins hear a radio report that a peace has been established and relief stations are being established around Los Angeles. Harry finds a doctor in a deserted town Dr. Powell Strong Willis Bouchey of Five Guns to Tombstone and Strong patches him up but tells Harry that Rick will need a blood transfusion. Just as they seem to be getting somewhere Harry and family are waylaid by men with machine gun. Miraculously the men turn out to be soldiers on the prowl for survivors and they send Harry and company to a nearby aid station. Life begins anew.Panic in the Year Zero is a tolerably entertaining low budget Cold War affair that is concisely directed by Milland. The problem with Milland and the screenplay is that both are far too dark to be entertaining. The film contains virtual no humor and Milland emphasizes the dark quality of the plot. Our hero has a hard time morally justifying his larcenous actions and the wife lives in denial. It is a tragedy for most of its running time despite its hopeful ending. Mind you it's nothing memorable but as a survivalist tale it is aboveaverage. High School Hellcats lenser Gilbert Warrenton's black  white widescreen photography is good.".

The survival themes don't change and it does get realistic to see how far a civilized person will go when faced with tough choices. This movie takes you there. I got some stomach wrench meaning tension during some scenes where you might find yourself rooting and taking sides. The question of what would you do just ropes the viewer in and the movie itself takes us there when the two main players disagree on main issues. I couldn't help but think that I would become a little more ruthless than portrayed but then again everyone handles emergency differently. Check yourself out while watching. It is important to note that food shelter and clothing become extremely important in a crisis with money and certain material items becoming near worthless until order is restored. This is a good reminder of that subject. There is rape killing and theft plus more handled very well allowing the viewer to know what happened instead of seeing it. That's the way it was back then in the movies. Today they go all out leaving this viewer in a tight spot. I don't like to see in your face certain subjects for the thrill factor. I am more supportive in this as long as what takes place is critical to the storyline and to keep in credible but with class not crass. Enjoy Ray Milland and his supporting actors who do the job fairly well. Good movie to snack with and of course have a tasty drink on standby. Sandwich works too. Enjoy and don't panic....".

But someone who does it out of unavoidable necessity is not a monstersomeone who does it casually and for laughs IS.By the way I went through Hurricane Katrinawhich did little damage here in New Orleans and more importantBarthelemy's Flood which is what ruined the city west of the Industrial Canaland I can tell you that breakdown of order as described by the news media was colossally exaggerated.It was no where near as dangerous as described.";

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of apocalyptic fiction I'd been dying to see this movie for years . I'd first heard about in John Brosnan's highly regarded scifi critique Future Tense. A father and his family survive a nuclear attack on the United States and leads the brood in a desperate fight for survival . Okay it's a premise often used in this type of genre but it's one that works well and makes you think that that only civilization separates us from animals hence its common usage . After finally seeing the movie I'm not surprised that it's little seen  it's dreadful It's always a sign of a bad movie when the opening score seems at odds of the genre the film belongs to . You want a gritty film set in a post nuclear hell ? Then what better that having a cool jazz score ? Hmmm I'm feeling mellow baby  someone roll me another doobie daddyo . This is the fundamental problem with the movie  it's called PANIC IN THE YEAR ZERO but there's absolutely no panic whatsoever  none . Upon finding out LA has been nuked patriarch Harry Baldwin leads his family to the nearest diner and despite being witnesses to world war three customers are more interested in what's missing on the menu . Right so millions of people have just been vaporised and all you're worried about is not getting your side order of eggs ? Right on daddyo . Just roll me another one and lets listen to some more cool jazz It's impossible to buy in to this scenario at all . There's no political build up to the nuclear strike . For those of us who remember the peak of the cold war in the early 1980s you'd know something like a war in the Middle East or Central Europe would lead to the inevitable use of tactical nuclear weapons finally leading to strategic nuclear weapons meaning the end of humanity . Here however all the indications is that the nasty communists in the USSR and China have launched a preemptive nuclear strike  a later radio broadcast confirms this . If that's the case then why didn't the communist block use all their arsenal ? Only the very major cities in the west like New York  LA  Philidelphia  London  Paris and Rome are destroyed . Why such a half hearted attack that invites hellish retaliation ? The whole point about a preemptive strike is to stop an enemy nation retaliating against you . Maybe the Politburea were too busy smoking pot and listening to decadent bourgeois jazz to care daddyo ? That said the subtext seems to be about survivalism in much the same as as a John Christopher novel . Indeed you can't help be reminded of his 1956 novel The Death Of Grass  so much so that you believe the producers have stolen many of the ideas of the book then decided to set it against a World War 3 backdrop which doesn't work at all . Despite seeing a mushroom cloud in the distance and talk of fall out most of the characters don't react as you'd expect them to in the face of civil devastation  no one for example comes to the conclusion that money will be worthless . Despite being ahead of the game Harry slugs a greedy gas station owner and leaves for the money for the gas . Incidentally there's not the slightest hint of irony to this and the film continues in this vein It's interesting how well received PANIC IN THE YEAR ZERO has been on this page . One can't help thinking this reception is down to be it being a rather audience friendly film . After seeing the BBC nuclear holocaust teleplay THREADS away back in 1984 I couldn't sleep for days . Likewise despite its numerous flaws NO BLADE OF GRASS based on the John Christopher novel also stuck out in my mind due to its bleakness . Here however bleakness seems confined to a family getting there fishing trip ruined for a few days . One can accept the Hays Code being enforced during this period but it doesn't excuse the lack of logic and the excess of right on daddyo muzak".

	schema:reviewBody "Panic in Year Zero 1962 aka End of the World CONTAINS SPOILERS The Cuban Missile Crisis ignited an explosion of excellent movies dealing with nuclear holocaust including FailSafe 1964 Dr. Strangelove 1964 Stanley Kubrick's followup masterpiece to Paths of Glory 1957 and Lolita 1962 Spartacus 1960 is very good but it is what it is and The Bedford Incident 1965. The theme was explored from slightly different angles Seven Days in May 1964 Twilight's Last Gleaming 1977 Wargames 1983 The Manhattan Project 1986 By Dawn's Early Light 1990 and with varying degrees of verisimilitude A Day Called X 1957 This is not a Test 1962 The War Game 1965 The Day After 1983 Threads 1984 quite consistently through the end of the Cold War. Most of these movies deal with a big picture view and at least in part give a ringside seat to the councils of the decision makers at least the local ones in Threads. There are some very good exceptions of course particularly Malevil 1981 and Testament 1983.Panic in Year Zero appeared a year before the missile crisis and follows a family of four who happen to be driving away from Los Angeles on a vacation when the city is destroyed as they try to survive the growing chaos in the surrounding areas. An AI exploitation picture the low budget precluded dramatic scenes of large scale carnage or destruction but allows at times for a surprisingly intelligent examination of some of the moral issues about survival self defense and self preservation. For instance Ray Milland who also directed by the way has to overcome his son's Avalon initial reluctance to use a rifle later Avalon is actually eager to use it. As soon as Milland sees this he scolds him and makes clear that he must be prepared to use the gun if necessary but he should never want to or enjoy doing so and must always be on guard against his own inclinations that way.Neither FailSafe nor Dr. Strangelove and other than by implication On the Beach 1959 for that matter  which Arch Oboler did better in Five 1951 in my opinion show weapon effects so their minimal use here is not an issue in and of itself. The problem is how much they and the social dislocation are attenuated there is no sense of real chaos because the movie never fully allows the thin veneer of civilization to flake off something done very effectively in the last fifteen minutes of Miracle Mile 1988 and so the theme of these four being the maintainers of ethical standards amongst a collapsed society rings false. And in the same sense the finale finds the protagonists essentially having passed through the crisis and gives the movie rather a happy ending. My guess is AI as usual wanted to give the audience a good entertaining scare but not seriously frighten anyone.Still a very worthwhile movie in many ways  certainly worth watching if one enjoys these types of dramas  and deserving of inclusion in the Nuclear Disaster film canon. And it's always nice to see Ray Milland acting and directing after he found that weekend he misplaced.XYZ".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard for me to review this movie without prejudice because to me Chris Farley is the funniest person I have ever seen.  Even though my adoration of the late comedian precludes me from giving a impartial rating of this movie I can at least admit that this isn't one of his best efforts I still loved this movie it's just not my favourite Farley flick.  Nevertheless I'm going to take the easy way out and say Come on take it for what it is a Chris Farley movie.Farley plays Haru an orphan adopted at birth by a clan of ninjas.  He is raised under the pretenses that he is the Great White Ninja. Needless to say his development is much anticipated by his teachers .  Unfortunately to the dismay of everyone he grows up to be overweight and klutzy. While the ninja graduates are out celebrating Haru finds himself alone at the retreat when a mysterious woman Nicollette Sheridan enters looking for help.  Believing Haru to be a ninja she hires him to spy on her boyfriend an assignment he accepts with great enthusiasm.  Hot on the boyfriend's trail Haru witnesses a murder and eventually ends up in Beverly Hills. Surviving on dumb luck and a designated guardian ninja Haru never gives up on his task.Like I said before this isn't Farley's greatest contribution to his comedic resume. But make no mistake this is a funny movie.  Farley's bread and butter is his propensity to bumble and stumble in any given situation  walking into poles falling down stairs crushing coffee tables etc. Since his character is expected to be agile and sleek the comedy in Beverly Hills Ninja is that much funnier.  The exact same formula worked for Farley's SNL character Barney the Chippendale's hopeful.Many critics felt that by this time Farley was a onetrickpony whose act had nothing more to offer than jokes involving head and groin injuries. Perhaps his choice in films were poor but to don't deny him the recognition of his talent is unfair. Watch the movie and you'll see Farley display all the qualities of a great comedian intelligence timing pathos.  He was a tremendous talent and I will miss him very much.".

One day a few months later it came on payperview. Due to a technical glitch the cable company unscrambled the payperview channels all day long. It also happened to be raining and generally miserable out so my buddies and I decided to watch this movie. We had three payperview channels and one of the channels showed a single movie all day long. Guess which movie it was.The first time we watched it we thought it was goofy even stupid and didn't really care for it. However like many teens we mindlessly watched it again . . . and again . . . and again. We watched this film all day. Why? you ask because it truly gets better every time you watch it.I think the reason is because this is a stupid film and when you first watch it you're too smart for it. Eventually though the IQ points seep out of your head and you're able to fully enjoy this great movie.The bottom line Watch this film at least 5 times not necessarily backtoback but it helps. It will grow on you. Even if you don't like Farley watch this film for Chris Rock. Rock's performance is perfect despite being too small of a role. Farley's performance is perfect as the bumbling but goodhearted Great White Ninja. Even the chicken's performance is perfect. If you find the concept of a fat white ninja involved in an Asian gang war mildly provocative check your brain at the door and enjoy.".

Beverly Hills Ninja however is appropriate for most children 10 and over. Pretty mild by today's standards.One of my favorite performances in this movie is the work of supporting actor Robin Shou.

	schema:headline " Funny Farley";
	schema:reviewBody "It is undeniable in saying that Chris Farley has a presence on the big screen. He offers another gem of a performance in this one. He was found on a stormy night be Sensei and was named Haru the prophisized Great White Ninja. The beginning of the film shows him training to be a ninja with such funny stunts as him trying to lift a burning cauldron with his open forearms spilling it all over the others. On the day of truth he is not selected to graduate and become a ninja. The plot of the story is simply this  He is proposed by Allison Page to help her in a steal mission against a counterfeiter. Not all goes to plan when he witnesses a killing. He uses the matchbook that Allison gave him to determine that he must go to Beverly Hills in her aid. Little things like Farley leaving his shoes at the door of the hotel everytime he enters and the janitor sweeping them up everytime shows his native roots. The director was great at adding such small but noticeable tendencies to make it more realistic.Farley walks around looking for Allison dressed as a pimp  he is supposed to blend in with the locals  but that is not a good way to do it. All the while Gobbei the best ninja declared by Sensei can be seen on the otherhand with his face painted to look like he is part of a statue. Throughout the movie he helps Haru and is his shadow to make sure he succeeds in his mission without Haru knowing he is being helped. Now forget the plot it isn't going to win any awards. The meat of the film  what you really are there to see is Chris Farley pull off his hijinx. Funny scenes such as when he is in a Beverly Hills strip joint and he is up on stage and sees a hot stripper he shakes his fists and says repeatedly I am one with the universe I am one with the universe as a ninja SHOULD be but he cannot resist her and starts dancing along side her comically rubbing his nipples and then revealing his tight white undershirt which he attempts to rip. The crowd of men all the while are cheering for him and he falls off the stage flat on his back breaking a table and is thrown out by the bouncers. Then when two men are shot out the buildings window by Tanley's goons and land by the garbage where Haru has been pushed an Asian ladies repeatedly screams out the window which is classic and made me laugh. Another great scene is when Farley staying on his quest to help foil Tanley's plan goes in disguise into a Japanese restaurant as a sushi cook person. This is the funniest point in the film and involves Farley flipping a shrimp down a woman's dress and he pulls it from her breasts sniffing it and making some sort of funny comment. The final funny scenes is his pretending to be the money printing guy  I won't go into much but this was the best part of the movie and near the end too.I like the soundtrack from I'm too sexy to Kung Fu Fighting it was great. We see little of Chris Rock in this movie a hotel employee who wants to learn how to become a ninja like Haru and chases chickens to learn. It was Farley's spotlight and so deserved. Farley R.I.P.".

Beverly Hills Ninja is nevertheless a valiant attempt.  It is filled with classic moments which will not be soon forgotten.  Examples include Haru protecting Sensai's ninja house when he first meets Alison and nearly destroys singlehandedly the entire place and the superb dialogue such as You do not have Ninja intuition.  In fact you do not even have normal intuition.  Who can forget such classic movie moments?But probably the most enjoyable aspect of Chris Farley's movies is watching the response of others watching Chris Farley in action.  Chris is one person you really love or you really hate.  One of these extremes always prevails. And for those of us who truly enjoy his work nothing brings more joy than seeing the look of disgust and outrage on another person's face as they watch Chris Farley.  Watching people toss and turn in their seats just hoping to get out of the theater as soon as possible really brings happiness to Chris Farley fans everywhere.  It only highlights the high quality of his work and the lack of a sense of humor on others' part.  Although we can always enjoy his movies in video nothing will compare to the full theater experience.  Beverly Hills Ninja takes this aspect of his work to a new level.A great movie and one definitely to watch multiple times.".

Chris Rock makes an unusual but entertaining appearance and so does Nicollette Sheridan before she became popular. One of the greatest things about the low quality of this movie was the music that was selected. I really found it funny how corny the music was and it added to the hilarity.

	schema:reviewBody "I am by no means a Chris Farley fan I'm not sure why some people think he is so funny most of his humor seems so forced and just makes him look like an idiot. But my boyfriend just kept on telling me how funny this movie was and was tormenting me on how I wouldn't give this film a chance so finally I just decided to go ahead and see what it was about. Now that I've seen it while I think it is still very stupid and has some of the worst acting that I've ever seen in my life I think this was one of those films that it was so bad that it was good. I think the only thing that really made me laugh about this film was Robin Shou I haven't seen him in any other film other than Mortal Kombat so it was amusing to see him in this film. He was so serious in this film and that his character as a ninja getting into these silly situations was just priceless. Chris Farley was alright I have to admit that I could actually stand him in the film I know that sounds bad but from me trust me that's a compliment.Haru is the fat white ninja he was raised by the ninja master and has never succeeded at being a ninja like his brother Gobei. But when Haru meets a girl who names herself Sally Jones she needs help from a ninja to find out if her boyfriend is a murderer. It turns out that he is also in a big counter fitting scam and Haru wants to help her out and goes to Beverly Hills to find a way to capture him. With the secret help of his brother and his protg Joey Haru will help his dove and learn the life of a ninja in Beverly Hills.Over all Beverly Hills Ninja is a stupid movie it has bad acting and a silly story but for some reason I did laugh a few times. It made the film kind of enjoyable even for a Chris Farley film. I think my favorite part was the Japanese kitchen scene where we see Robin Shou dressed as a woman and how Chris Farley accidentally kills a guy who is about to kill him. So give this a look if you are interested in seeing a silly comedy that's pretty much what Beverly Hills Ninja is.410".

She is a woman with problems and she needs an agile cunning quick witted ninja to help her. Seizing the opportunity Chris offers his services to her and thus the adventure begins. This movie is standard Farley humour which is buffoonish and anarchic  but that isn't a bad thing as far as I'm concerned. The best part of the film is when the aforementioned woman asks who the character who Chris plays is and he wastes no time in telling her that he is the Great White Ninja that was foretold about in the ancient prophecies. Handily enough the one copy of these precious words exist in scroll form and are located nearby. Chris shows her the scroll trying to unscroll it to the part where he is mentioned. The problem is he is holding the ancient and valuable manuscript over a misplaced candle and the priceless scroll is set alight. Farley reacts by throwing a bucket of water over it and ruining it forever! As if he wasn't in enough trouble already! Anyway go and see the movie  You'll understand!".

Finding out Sally's boyfriend is a counterfeiter and murderer Haru with the help of hotel bellboy Joey Chris Rock and unknowingly with the help of his ninja brother Gobei Robin Shou takes down the counterfeit ring and finds his place among the ninja clan. Beverly Hills Ninja is full of individual comic gags that are hilarious in their puritycall it sadistic but sometimes it's just plain funny watching a guy unwittingly walk into a lamppost while carrying on a conversation. Farley was a master at these triedandtrue gags which reach right back into the origins of comedy. But it's not all slapstick a scene where Haru is so taken by dancers at a local strip bar that he joins in is reminiscent of the mudwrestling scene from Stripes.

I loved the script and the characters were good and original. The music which is chosen is also great and really fits that whole 80's theme. It's very clear that the makers used a long time picking out every song. I almost felt like I was back in the 80's of Norway. I simply loved all the small details throughout the film such as posters behaviors and clothing.My favorite thing about this movie is the mix between humour and drama. The only bad thing I can say about this film is that it is too short. I think some of the scenes should last longer. The scenes where Yngve and Jarle met each other for the first time went too fast. Now as I said I don't know how the book is. But anyway it's still a great movie.".

Everything has a slower pace then what we are used to nowadays and it's wonderful.The love triangle is very compelling and convincing. Young boy meets the most beautiful other young boy and falls in love without even understanding why or how it will effect his life. In a time and place that being gay is not very well accepted the story makes a very honest and truthful statement.The acting of all the cast is very good. Yes there is talent in Norway!

It is generally the case that fans of books are disappointed with film adaptations and so it is fair that some may dislike the film. However the apparent lack of narrative again understandable from having read the book is not something I personally noticed. The thought and feeling of the characters is conveyed through that beautiful idea that not everything has to be said  the silence of the characters the unspoken lines the long nothings all resemble what it is like to be and think and feel in the far more incomprehensible reality than we usually see in films and hear in songs. All of the characters show great depth and are cast perfectly  having never seen a Norwegian film before it was a nice change too.The story itself was original but simultaneously was perfect for something to relate to. Set in the late 80s  at the time of the collapse of the Berlin Wall  when music culture had a very strong influence but where political and social values were uncertain it creates a very suitable backdrop to a story about such uncertainty. The time period was represented very well in the film with the soundtrack chosen very well. And then there was Fortapt that beautiful song that Jarle Klepp writes. My only criticism is that it was too short and that the editing was a little off in places  the changes between emotionally contrasting scenes was too abrupt in places and so created some confusion.It doesn't quite trump The Shawshank Redemption but Mannen Som Elsket Yngve can sit content as my second favourite film so far.".

We follow Jarle a regular teenager with a band friends and a girlfriend who he is very much in love with. But when he meets Yngve everything changes and he finds himself neglecting everything and everyone around him. Everything but Yngve that is.The movie manages to keep the plot going and the actors are absolutely brilliant but as always when it comes to adaption something is missing. Unfortunately what is missing is very much key and what made me love the book in the first place. It's like they didn't have enough time in the end and tied everything together as quickly as they could. Despite this Mannen som elsket yngve is a film that I like. Sadly unlike when it comes to the book it's not a film I love.This movie was so close. But it was another 15 minutes away from being great.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has a very dated feel about it it's almost as if it were made in a much more homophobic time rather than in 2007. Whilst it's set in 1989 it has that gayequalsmiserableending gayequalsdeathaspect that curse so many state funded Continental European gay films. I mean come on if films like Maurice and My Beautiful Laundrette which were genuine 80s films manage to portray a gay positive ending why on earth can't this film?Why do I say it's homophobic? Because if the hero had fallen in love with a second girl as well as his girlfriend would the film have ended as it does with the suicide attempt and the boy in a mental institution? Would the hero have acted that way towards his secret love at the party?  If the hero's secret love were a girl what would the hero have shouted at her? Oh you bitch you heterosexual bastard Do you think I'm straight? No no the miserable ending was utterly homophobic and inexcusable. Totally inexcusable. This film reminds me for some reason of a 70s US film called A separate peace in which the gay love interest has to die! But that film was from the 70s and was written during the 1940s when gay writers were riddled with internalised homophobia from the society in which they grew up.The failure of the love affair was because of the writer's selfhomophobia and inability to see the logic through to its end.Now if the ending had been happy that would have made for a much braver and much more interesting film. Can you imagine if the hero had fetched his lover from the mental institution and they'd walked out together and publicly and openly proclaimed their gay love to their former girlfriends and friends and school mates? That would have been a much better film.There were good aspects to the film. I liked the fact that both boys were not that attractive not muscular were average boys. I liked the way the relationship with the mother and the father and the girlfriend were portrayed. But I was waiting all the way through for the happy ending for the boys to declare their love for each other and for this reason I was so disappointed with this awful miserable ending.OK you may say Well that wasn't what the author was trying to say. Well what was the author saying? What was the point of the film? Was it just to reinforce the horrid view that gay love always ends in suicide and death and mental illness??? And further why would the Norwegian film board or whoever put the money up for this fund such a gaynegative film? Is the Norwegian film board homophobic? Were there really no gay positive films to fund?Overall a most disappointing film and yet it had the potential to have been so much better.".

The father is obviously an national Indian treasure as a wonderful serious actor. The son is clearly a gifted comedian and maturing sensitive actor. Ash Rai? She's one of a kind too and she clearly knows how to pick 'em in her leading men. By the way Ajay Devron her leading man in Straight From the Heart Raincoat and as that nefarious terrorist in KHAKEE is another example of her very good taste in who appears opposite her on screen.BB is delightful especially for Bachchan the son who did great work here in various con man roles and in his interaction with his perky little costar Rani Munkerjee. Of course the whole thing is a bit of fluff from beginning to end and anyone who expects more should leave as soon the first energetic musical number hits the screen.The narration by Bachchan the father and his eventual inevitable appearance as the worldweary cop chasing these carefree con kids is worth the wait. Of course it is just like every other American cops 'n robber spoof that I've ever seen nobody really gets hurt.Now the surprise and joy for me was the socalled 'item number' in the bar with father son and their costar from other recent movies Ash Rai. The drunken banter no I don't speak Hindi and had to rely on the subtitles and body language was very funny to me despite or maybe because of this obvious handicap. Their interactions with Ash prior to the dance number were perfectly timed comedy reactions too. The dance number itself ripped up the place and Ash looked as if she was having a lot of fun flirting with two of her favorite men. Now that's entertainment in my book and in any language.Go rent BB or even better buy the DVD and add it to your Bollywood collection. That's what I'm doing right after I finish this review.

The movie has got it all groovy North Indian dance steps dancing on the train selling of Taj Mahal.BAB is about two dreamers from small towns of UP Rakesh  Abhishek Bachchan  and Vimmi Rani who in the quest to fulfill their dreams elope from house and bump into each other. They both faces failure at the first stage so they both decide to twist things around and get into conning.

His home work is obvious from many small points in the movie. THe opening scene of a Kite stuck in a TV antenna  the songs which are played in the background were just sheer right on the target. Songs like  CHalat Musafir  really captured the feel of North India. Using Taj Mahal as a backdrop for the marriage and their unconventional Vows were all brilliant.Performance wise Rani Mukherjee is absolutely awesome. The way she captured the emotions her get up and talking style of a young Punjabi girl was point perfect.Amitabh Bachchan's comedy is still the best my god what timing. Abhishek Bachchan has seriously grown up as an actor and he proves his point in BnB .Abhishek and Rani are a treat to watch and they were so lively on the screen it gets you into the moment. The bus scenes where Rakesh tells Vimmi about BNB is amazing then the scene on Mumabi CST station where they confess their love shows their on screen chemistry.SEL gives a good enough soundtrack with songs like Dhadhak Dhadhak and Chup Chup Ke the soundtrack of the movie is really worth listening. Aishwarya Rai looks amazing on screen and Amitabh and Abhishek were marvelous together. The Bar scene between Abhishek and Amitabh is all about brilliant timing of comedy.

However after the brief introduction to each the audience is quickly taken on a ride with the duo Bunty and Babli as they travel from city to city cheating people out of their money. Abhishek does a terrific job as Bunty and of course Rani is perfect as his accomplice Babli. The film has enough laughs to last through to the very end. Even Amitabh the veteran Indian actor is comedic in his role as the police officer chasing the two. Aishwarya's dance number was a pleasant addition to the film.

It has its color loud music and spoonfuls of melodrama like the thousands of Hindi films that preceded it. However it also has a pair of antiheroes as the leads Bunty and Babli are lovable criminals that love crime. The sheer exuberance of the characters as well as the actors is one of the main selling points of this film.The music is likable though the shooting of Chup Chup Ke looks exactly like that of the song Saathiya from Shaad Ali's previous film. It could have been removed. The item number with Aishwarya Rai is practically forced into the screenplay with a pair of pliers and could also have been removed.The movie also unnecessarily milks a scene between Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek. The two get completely drunk and have a boring drawn out conversation about love that may leave you squirming in your seat. What a waste. This was meant to be a mesmerizing scene as it's their first time acting together but it instead becomes a good time to take that bathroom break.However those gripes are minor compared to the rest of the film. Abhishek Bachchan gives a good performance and hams it up like a pro. Rani Mukherjee is further cementing her stature as one of the few true actors in commercial Hindi cinema. She handles the humor check out her catty fight with a Miss India contestant and the melodrama with ease. Amitabh Bachchan is a cool cat. All of it works well because no one is taking it too seriously. It's pure entertainment.All in all I'm glad we're seeing popular films that shy away from the love triangles characters that are too perfect to be human and poor production values.

It starts of well with the one hummable song of the entire movie and pretty shots of North India. It picks up tempo as 'Bunty' and 'Babli' meet and embark on their modus operandi but quickly loses out on account of a string of forgettable songs and sloppy editing. Rani's vivacious attitude her colorful Kurtis the plan to lease out the Taj Mahal and the encounters between Amitabh and Abhishek Rani's Punjabi accent and Amitabh Bachchan's dialog delivery are great. The songs the 'item' number the occasional sentimental scene between Rani and Abhishek are awful. Overall a 610.

	schema:reviewBody "Abhishek and Rani team up as partners in crime as they try to steal all of India's money in this hilarious movie! Starting out as two innocent souls fed up of the smalltown life the two run away in hopes of fulfilling their big dreams of fame and fortune. After running into too many road blocks they try to go the easy way out by well stealing. They never run out of ideas to fool people. The best and most creative scene is the one with the Taj Mahal! Both Abhishek and Rani give a great performance. All the songs are great be it Chupke Se or Dhadak Dhadak. This movie features the king of item numbers with the Bachchans and the mesmerizing Aishwarya in Kajra Re. She finally does an entertaining role be it just a song after all her serious films like Raincoat and Chokher Bali. Coming from U.P. and being intimately familiar with some of the filming locations I took full delight in watching this movie! Amitabh of course is excellent. His music video is fantastic. Just when you think you've laughed all you could Amitabh makes sure his rapping skills leave your eyes watering!".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see the movie on Friday house full Saturday house full and it went on till I reached a point of absolutely no hope left in life. Then I decided to step inside a shady old haunted theater and finally see the movie I was so eagerly waiting for all these days. I knew I loved the movie from the word go! And I had expected that but then I had expected a lot of senseless humor too which I never found. All I got was vintage bollywood stuff something that we proudly do best. Now this is the stuff great movies are made of. What stuff? Let me address that quintessential India the rustic real romantic carefree unpredictable India that you never get to see in the otherwise high brow flicks. The entire movie is picture perfect from start to finish. I am very sure the DVD is gonna be a rage when it comes. The popular aspects of the movie have already been discussed so I would want to mention the finer ones. If one watches the movie closely one sees traces of Maniratnam the mist and the melody the suspense the vacuums felt at a lonely railway station with the smoke accompanying the restlessness. This tells where Shaad Ali Saigal comes from the best school of cinema in the country. There are some movies that you tend to revisit in your thoughts very often. B n B is one of them for sure. It goes far beyond what a normal light romantic comedy would like to achieve and it accomplishes a cult status of its own in unique ways. People like Kunal Kohli who think Hum Tum was the bible of the bollywood romantic comedy genre may pick up a lesson or two from here if they still have some sensibility left with them. A special mention for the brilliant camera work that makes you feel you are a part of the roller coaster journey through all those lovely locales and the infectious music that refuses to leave your mind far after it has left your car stereo. And who can miss to mention the impeccable timing of Abhishek. If Yuva was coming of age movie for him he roars like a king in this one and rips all the criticism apart in the rock solid screen presence and the fearless stare at the camera. Way to go Abhishek! You see him and Rani and you feel like where were they all this time when all we were subjected to in the name of comedy was something that sounds real smelly! Big B cant be missed out from this comic caper either. Play on!! There is one Bubli and thats for sure!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bunty aur Babli has all the ingredients of a blockbuster  impressive starcast novel story mindblowing music sizzling onscreen chemistry and to top it all an item song that is well set to be a nation's new anthem.After a successful debut with Vivek OberoiRani Mukherjee starrer Saathiya Shaad Ali is back with yet another great movie. Of course it may disappoint all those craving for Hollywoodlike cinema Black Page 3  etc.  Bunty aur Babli is 100 Indian  textbook Bollywood style. So you have Abhishek Bachan and Rani Mukherjee playing two ambitious fortuneseeking smalltown youngsters who run away from their families to make it big in bad Mumbai. The duo turn into formidable conpair thus inviting upon themselves the wrath of a UPbhaiyya type cop Amitabh Bachan. The film's initial half is much like a rollercoaster ride while it is the later half that involves the Big B chasing the masquerading duo. Finally the product is a movie providing wholesome family entertainment in typical Bollywood flavour. The ending may appear a bit damp but allinall its a movie worth seeing.ACTING Abhishek Bachan is fast growing out of his illustrious father's shadow and carving a niche for himself. AB is fantastic in the film as the trickster Bunty. Rani Mukherjee on the other hand is fast rising to be the next 'actress of an era' after Madhuri Dixit. she is turning out to be the industry's biggest goldminer with a string of 5 recent successes already to her name. After a serious role in Black Rani enthralls all by another great performance in a contrary role. The Big B as usual stamps the film with his quality and it is quite useless to praise him here. And last but far from the least is Aishwarya Rai.............it can only be Ash who can floor the audience and leave her mark on a film featuring three of Bollywood's biggest names in a role comprising just of a 7minute item song. The gorgeous body the heaving breasts the backless choli the tempting face the hypnotising eyes and of course the drooling dance moves  Ash is at her irresistible best in Kajra Re.Special mention for ShankarEhsaanLoy's fabulous music delivering what should be the best musical blockbuster of the year. Each song of the soundtrack is innovative and is destined to be a hit.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was not bad but it was not excellent either. The last quarter of the film was so botched that it makes you wonder if it was the same writer who wrote the beginning and middle who also wrote the end. It was such a shame to see such an upbeat riotous fun film go down with a clunk like that. Nevertheless it was a hit at the box office and the Rani  Abhishek show proved to still hold heat. They play a couple of oddly matched lovers who go on a Robinhood type of crime spree through various parts of India when they don't get their way in life and elude authorities for as long as they can. Personally Amitabh Bachchan was wasted in his role as the police detective on their trail to the point that someone as lovable as him gets annoying after a while. His role was overblown and not needed to be frank. Aishwarya Rai shows up towards the last quarter of the film to add some much needed spice to the now dragging on plot with her item number 'Kajra re' which she does stunningly well but not enough to save the rapidly souring storyline. Perhaps they should have included her in the script as a distraction for Amitabh's character I don't know but at that point I'm thinking anything would have worked. I enjoyed the film but it could have used a better plot twist and not to mention a better ending. Note to director Never remake something you can't make better!".

	schema:reviewBody "If I was to say that Bunty  Babli is the product of a genius I would be telling a lie. However if I were to say that B  B is utter nonsense I would then again be telling a lie. The truth according to how I see it is that BB lies somewhere in the middle of this spectrum and can be described as an adequate movie. Rani mukherjee's acting performance is adequate just as abhishek bachan's is although the latter being slightly better than the former due to rani's slight overacting performance in the crying scene when they first meet each other in the movie. Amitabh bachan was also adequate in his performance although I thought there were times when his bad acting shined through. The parents were OK on both counts..To those of you who do not know the story Bunty  babli is a narration of 2 twentysomething year old male and female individualists who have a strong dislike for societal conventions. They have ambitions of their own but are not taken seriously. They live in a small and impoverished town somewhere in north India which fails to complement their ambitions. One night acknowledging that the only way to fulfil his dreams of becoming rich and famous is to escape from this claustrophobic town Abhishekh bachan runs away from home. Coincidentally Rani mukherjee does the same because her parents were compelling her to marry against her will. Both embark on their own autonomous journeys which eventually leads them to each other. Because both were in the exact same boat they had several commonalities which allowed them to relate to each other eventually spawning a question in both of their minds how can we get money to go to Mumbai?. Abhishek had a desire to go to mumbai because he had a business proposition to discuss with potential investors and Rani wanted to go to mumbai because she wanted to become a contestant in the miss India contest. Trusting their instincts both decide to con a local man into giving them the money they needed to go to mumbai. They succeed and leave with 15000 rupees. From this point onwards they are known as Bunty  Babli fake identities. However as their needs become bigger and bigger as they walk their journey their cons begin to develop both in terms of quality and quantity and eventually they become con artists. They become so commercialised that every newspaper begins to write about the mysterious duo. Then they both fall in love with each other and get married..Following this somewhere near the interval of the movie Amitabh bachan is introduced as a cunning police officer who embarks on a mission to catch bunty  babli. However after several failed attempts to outsmart the duo Amitabh realises that catching BB is not as easy as he had anticipated. As a result he accepts this as a challenge and vows to catch them at any cost.In the meanwhile BB become so engaged in their acts of con that they fail to realise that they have become criminals. The movie then follows a cat and mouse game and in the midst of this rani becomes pregnant with Abhishekh's child. This is the turning point of the movie because now their priorities change and they both decide to give up this conlife as the aftermath may affect their child. Ironically amitabh bachan catches them at a time when they had repented for their sins but unfortunately nothing is to stop amitabh from bringing them to justice. Luckily with time Amitabh develops a softspot for the trio baby inclusive and decides to let them free. Bunty and Babli go back to the small town where this story began and live normal lives.The final segment of the movie begins with an unprecedented visit from Amitabh bachan. He hires the duo to solve a complicated police case and they happily become conartists once again their task being to con criminals this time.I would recommend this movie to be watched on a Saturday night when you do not really have anything important to do. However it isn't a total waste of 2.5 hours.I rate BB 610".

After that the pace slowed down quite a bit as Big B's character is introduced. Some of the scenes appear to be forced. The plot itself seems to be based on either Matchstick Men or Catch Me If You Can. The concept of the 'con' has been borrowed and the usual Bollywood elements added to it. The bar scene before the Aishwarya number has been dragged quite a bit. What truly pulled this one off is superb acting by Jr. B Rani Mukherjee and the supporting cast which is quite minimal in its appearance. One wonders if the director had a choice or if someone was hogging footage get it?. Both the parents are missing for quite a bit while BB are romping it up. The reaction in the small town to BB's exploits also could have been worth exploring but isn't shown.Overall its an entertaining movie the musical score is good except for one song. One should not watch it as a realistic movie rather as a fun caper that oozes lots of small town charm. There are definitely shades of films made in the 70s 80s and one feels the influence clearly. Not surprisingly this has been a hit grossing 4 times its budgeted cost.".

One should not watch it as a realistic movie rather as a fun caper that oozes lots of small town charm. There are definitely shades of films made in the 70s 80s and one feels the influence clearly. Not surprisingly this has been a hit grossing 4 times its budgeted cost.";

	schema:reviewBody "Shaad Ali the son of the wonderful director Muzaffar Ali Umrao Jaan Gaman Anjuman and the Assistant Director to Mani Ratnam graduated to become a director in the sorry Saathiya  which he follows up with another sorry fare BB In this movie Bunty Abhishek Bachchan and BabliRani Mukherjee are two dreamers from their respective small towns who tired of the limited aspirations of their parents run away to explore their dreams. As is inevitable they bump into each other soon enough form a bond and spend the rest of the movie together. Realizing big dreams are good for small towns only they resort to conning and become the celebrated Bunty aur Babli for their ludicrous scams and cons never wearing a mask and yet never being recognized. Cue DCP Dashrath Singh Amitabh Bachchan the man who MUST catch them  he seems to be the only intelligent cop. Figure the rest  no surprises. I have a very weird thought that Shaad Ali may have seen Catch Me If You Can and decided to make candyfloss or LaddooJalebi out of it. Shaad should stop making movies really. He just does not have it in him. And maybe just maybe after this movie he may actually never be able to make a movie again anyway. Amitabh Bachchan is in overdrive. The Big B is clearly overexcited at being in the same movie with his son and he ruins it by overacting in every scene. Or the lack of a director left him directionless. Rani Mukherjee is in the movie in ruralkurtas with the deepest neck I have ever seen. She looks the 21year old Babli like any other 28year old would. Abhishek is the only performer in the movie doing justice to his role. His comic timing is good and with Yuva  Dhoom this actor proves yet again that he is growing with every next movie. The ShankarEhsanLoy songs are all a mess and this is the worst job Gulzar has ever done. After the wonderful soundtrack from Saathiya I expected this movie to have at least one decent composition but. The choreography  costumes are also thirdrate it features some of the weirdest gyrations in the weirdest apparels I have ever seen. One thing I did like about the movie was the background sounds. Almost every scene is accompanied by a song playing in the background  from Kabhi Kabhi to Mai Hoon Don! to Pinjre Wali Muniya. These songs suit each scene so well that very soon I was playing a guessing game when each scene started. For a movie of this kind I did the best thing possible  went with a group of 16 and loudly enjoyed the movie for everything it didn't have. If you were in the same screen as my gang I'm sure you realize how much fun we had.My Rating  2 of 5 for Small B  the sheer fun I had".

The weakness lies basically in a thin story line which an equally weak screenplay as well as uninteresting dialogs surprisingly penned by ace writer Jaideep Sahni doesn't bring impact. The finesse of taking shots by director Shaad Ali is also missing compared to his previous Saathiya. A few opening scenes were okay which sets the tone of the film but later when the characters goes out of character narration turns lifeless. Songs and Music is very mediocre and does not support narration. The only novelty is the experimental dig at paying tribute to the films of 1970s in terms of certain tacky sets overdonegaudy costumes Dance movements as well as use of back projection in a scene could all have been inspiring and brought freshness if film has something to offer content wise but it all misfires as every thing here is so predictable that it kills the curiosity factor completely. The result film fails as even a bizarre film or a rollercoaster road movie or a mindless tapori immoral entertainment. Even neat performances by the trio Amitabh Abhishek and Rani also do not bring any magical moments so vital for such film which basically works on treatment of certain scenes. Also cameos done by host of talented actors viz. Raj Babbar Prem Chopra Ranjeet Ravi Baswani Rameshwari Tania Zaetta and above all an item number by Ms. Rai makes you wonder whether it is unemployment or insecurity which made them accept it. More than anything else what surprised me most is the fact that all the telecast audience reactions or published reviews of this film talks about its certain qualities which I only wish that this one possessed. Overall true to its name the reaction it evokes on watching is equivalent to burst of a bubble. While watching the only thing audience is waiting excitedly is Ghanti of The End.".

The matter of Indian Bonnie and Clyde who love being famous with Amitabh Bachchan chasing them then ends up forgiving them could have made a good heist thriller musical comedy with sentimental side indeed. But Abhishek Bachchan was there along with belittlement too albeit Abhishek alone is enough !Abhishek has a mute charisma and  most importantly  CAN'T ACT AT ALL. During the whole movie I couldn't stand him on screen doing anything spending the time cursing him waiting him to act the way anybody would wait for having water out of squeezing a stone ! It was bad experience especially while having The Big B himself around. I mean the comparison was horrible enough to recall the long oneshot scene with them both talking and moving like drunks where one was doing the job effortlessly and one wasn't doing it at all. Another problem concerning the presence of Bachchan senior which's the tragedy of him being responsible of pushing his son into the showbiz and  sorrowfully  his birth in this world in the first place !The bore was powerful. The thickness of the numbers turned the movie into an exhausting series of music videos. While being basically a comedy the dialog was no lighthearted. The jobs of the 2 leads weren't interesting by any mean. The last heist was so fabricated to achieve a chase anyway. Review its disasters with me the coincidence of Bunty and Babli meeting the officer who by coincidence too forgot his ID with them after at short notice he became the head of security in the airport which coincidently at another short notice has a gold to be transported which attracts the 2 leads to steal it while the delivery of Babli's baby happens ALL AT ONCE !Then a list of hows how Babli could move that easily after the delivery? How Prem Chopra the lorry's deriver provided the 2 fugitive leads with disguise that easily and speedily? and the most of all how the officer could be waiting for the 2 leads in the train station BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL ???!!! How he knew their target place? How he managed to precede them?.... Well this is why ladies and gentlemen we in Egypt name anything extremely unbelievable in our daily life  an Indian movie. The thing is we used to say it about their very movies beforehowever with pleasure !The character of Amitabh wasn't made well. The sound effect which alerts about new scheme was so annoying and repeated for unbearable many times. The try of impersonating Amitabh Bachchan's naive persona from movies like Don by his son was so pathetic. Speaking about naive what the heck that ending was? Were the movie makers that optimistic to think that they made a hit which could spawn a sequel ???? Yet nothing and I mean nothing can outclass the embarrassment of Kajra Rethe the number of Amitabh Bachchan Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai together that was unnecessary and ENDLESSLY LONG. I bet they wanted to gather the family of stars the father his terrible son and the last's wife in one song anyway anyhow even that served no one any good !Some moments assure that we have a talented director. For instance the short scene of Amitabh Bachchan studying the 2 lead's way of thinking in their room seemed lovely and tangent with the supposed comic spirit of the whole thing. But that was used miserably with nearly awful script and utterly awful lead !The survivors  After copious career it's rare to see Ranjeet nowadays. He did for instance 16 movies in 1984 to only Bunty Aur Babli in 2005. Hence seeing him even in a cameo as the store owner is a delight before brining a lot of memories. Add to that Chup Chup Ke it was nicely scored and shot. And Rani Mukherjee no doubt she chewed up the scenery with her true acting and beauty. I have never seen her sexier yet. Some outfits were outrageous for an Indian star and the fact that Mukherjee was in them was the only fact in this fake parade of luster.It's a show that wanted us to have a good time. I didn't. I deplored instead feeling sad for  a talentedless actor of a talented star a talentedless actor who stars a movie a talentedless actor who has a megaexaggerated chance that many talented ones wouldn't and finally a possible good movie that didn't happen ! P.S  Seeing Amitabh Bachchan ending the movie with the rap song B N B having naked girls dancing hip hop around him was ugly rather deformed thing. The marriage of his image and Shaggy's one didn't work. The Indian cinema's borrowing from the MTV ended up this time as disgraceful beggary !".

Yet nothing and I mean nothing can outclass the embarrassment of Kajra Rethe the number of Amitabh Bachchan Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai together that was unnecessary and ENDLESSLY LONG. I bet they wanted to gather the family of stars the father his terrible son and the last's wife in one song anyway anyhow even that served no one any good !Some moments assure that we have a talented director. For instance the short scene of Amitabh Bachchan studying the 2 lead's way of thinking in their room seemed lovely and tangent with the supposed comic spirit of the whole thing. But that was used miserably with nearly awful script and utterly awful lead !The survivors  After copious career it's rare to see Ranjeet nowadays. He did for instance 16 movies in 1984 to only Bunty Aur Babli in 2005. Hence seeing him even in a cameo as the store owner is a delight before brining a lot of memories. Add to that Chup Chup Ke it was nicely scored and shot. And Rani Mukherjee no doubt she chewed up the scenery with her true acting and beauty. I have never seen her sexier yet. Some outfits were outrageous for an Indian star and the fact that Mukherjee was in them was the only fact in this fake parade of luster.It's a show that wanted us to have a good time. I didn't. I deplored instead feeling sad for  a talentedless actor of a talented star a talentedless actor who stars a movie a talentedless actor who has a megaexaggerated chance that many talented ones wouldn't and finally a possible good movie that didn't happen ! P.S  Seeing Amitabh Bachchan ending the movie with the rap song B N B having naked girls dancing hip hop around him was ugly rather deformed thing. The marriage of his image and Shaggy's one didn't work. The Indian cinema's borrowing from the MTV ended up this time as disgraceful beggary !";

So he decides to fly the coop! Vimmi aka Babli a wannabe Miss India has dreams and desires that she wants to fulfill. Unfortunately for her her parents fix her marriage. As what all girls of marriageable age are supposed to do. But the young and vibrant Vimmi wants to follow her dreams before she can settle down so she too decides to fly the coop! Along their individual journey the two meet. Being honest and sincere leads them nowhere so the two decide to fulfill their dreams by conning and swindling people. And so the duo BB are born. At first their crimes are on a small scale but soon BB make a career out of conning people.From cheating a hotel owner to robbing a mall to leasing the Taj Mahal to a foreigner. BB start doing crimes just for the fun of it. During the course of their 'work' BB get closer to each other and gradually fall in love.Their antics become nationwide news. Everyone sits up and takes notice of the two known as the smoothest conartists in the country. Much to the annoyance of inspector Dashrath. Who's main mission is to catch these two swindlers.Bunty aur Babli can be best described in three words light fun and a little crazy. The film starts off as a rollercostar ride. Keeping the viewer glued way into the second half. But the pace of the narrative slackens towards the finale. As the situations tend to get boring and predictable.One of the biggest flaws in BB is the many loopholes in the writing itself. The main two protagonists openly conning and swindling people all over the country and no one knows how they look. Didn't anyone even have the sense to make a sketch of them? Also inspector Dashrath makes catching BB his main mission in life but at the end he simply lets them go because their sorry for what they did? Weird! Honestly if the writer had only put a little sense into the storyline.Plus the ending is completely snatched from the Steven Spielberg directorial brilliance Catch me if you can.Apart from the above mentioned flaws. BB is still a decent entertainer. The first half is a joy to watch. While some of the situations in this half may seem unreal it still manages to bring a smile onto your face.The second half starts off promising as a new character the inspector is introduced. But as I said the end sequences could have been better.Music by SEL is good and goes well insync with the theme of the movie. All the songs have been well picturized.Cinematography is adequate. Dialogues are witty at times.Performances of the three principal characters are the glue that holds the film together. Rani Mukherjee is a delight to watch! She plays the spirited and perky Babli with extreme conviction. Abhishek Bachchan finally delivers a competent performance. He handles the comic sequences adequately. But he still needs to brush up on his dancing skills and expressions. Amitabh Bachchan is good. He tries his best not to go overthetop and succeeds.Aishwarya Rai sizzles in the much talked about item number. Yes people  she has never looked so hot! Shaad Ali succeeds at making a light funfilled entertainer. Although nothing compared to the directors earlier offering Saathiya.Not recommended for people who thrive on intelligent cinema. Trying to find logic in the goingons in BB will just give you a headache.In the peak of summer Bunty aur Babli is the most chilled out offering. Enjoy! 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting movie. It is a tendency of Italian exploitation movies in general to eschew logical plotting and character development to focus on elaborate cinematic set pieces. While this usually works with gialli and some would say cannibal and zombie filmsit is often problem in the Italian crime films where the set pieces usually involve shootouts and overlong car chases two areas where the Italians had NO chance of outdoing biggerbudget Hollywood films although they often did their damnedest. This film is interesting therefore because it DOES have a lot of character development especially among the villains three privileged youths that become desperate criminals after their cleancut but increasingly psychotic leader Blondie starts a gun battle during a botched gas station robbery. One of the other youths is a more obviously deranged thrill seeker while the third youth the wheelman is decidedly nonviolent but loyal to a fault to his two friends.Rounding out the cast is the girlfriend of the wheelman Eleanora Giorgi who ironically sets the whole thing in motion by reporting the robbery plans to the police and mistakenly telling them that the trio only have toy guns. The head cop meanwhile is played by Tomas Milan usually the psychotic heavy in these type of films. Milan lends an iconic presence and is an interesting character in that he is not unsympathetic but is also not the usual borderlinefascist rebel with a badge often seen in these movies. Mostly he just proves tragically incompetent at stopping the rampaging youths.The plot is mostly pretty believable except for a scene where they hook up with another group of youths and shootup and rob a grocery store even killing their own accomplices for no good reason. There's some pretty gratuitous nudity including a pretty sorry excuse to get Giorgi topless but who's gonna complain about that too much?. The ending is typically cynical but that's one thing I admire about these films over the violenceglorifying Hollywood versions. See this if you like Italian crime thrillersor even if you don't.".

Being a hardcore fan of Italian cultcinema I am always looking forward to watching gritty Poliziotteschi from the 70s in particular when the script was written by master filmmaker Fernando Di Leo MILANO CALIBRO 9 LA MALA ORDINA IL BOSS... and the credited star is the great Tomas Milian whose impressive career covers the leads in all sorts of Italian cult movies and Poliziotteschi in particular most notably Umberto Lenzi's films such as the brutal 1974 masterpiece MILANO ODIA LA POLIZIA NON PU SPARARE.While YOUNG VIOLENT DANGEROUS which is a wrong translation as the original Italian title translates Free Armed Dangerous is an entertaining and worthwhile film I cannot deny that I was slightly disappointed in director Romolo Guerriri's movie. My two main complaints are the fact that Tomas Milian had far too little screen time and that the musical score was crap by the high genre standards. The Italian Poliziottesco is a politically incorrect brutal gritty and testosteronedriven genre and a large part of the greatness of its violent and sleazy masterpieces consisted in the greatness of its scores which accentuated the grit and action. The score to this movie is the constant repetition a boring and wussysounding hippiesong which seems terribly out of place.My second complaint about the movie is Tomas Milian's role. Milian is cool as always but his role is far too small. Also Poliziotteschicops are meant to be unorthodox ruffians who hate criminals and take the law in their own hands as opposed to sensitive social workers who blame society for the evildoings of criminals. The movie is about a bunch of spoiled kids from good families who start robbing and killing people just for the heck of it. Their triggerhappy leader is played by Stefano Patrici who is best known for being offed by toughcop Maurizio Merli in Umberto Lenzi's ROMA A MANO ARMATA 1976. The youths are violent all right but they are also quite annoying especially one idiot with a stupid grin who constantly cracks painful jokes. The 'good' female lead is played by the beautiful Elonora Giorgi who is best known for her role in Dario Argento's INFERNO 1980.In 1974 Tomas Milian had played one of the alltime greatest villains as the diabolical Giulio Sacchi in Lenzi's masterpiece MILANO ODIA. Also a murderous psychopath on the loose Giulio Sacchi was sadistic and purely evil and believable in just that. The babyfaced killers in this film tend to annoy. Nonetheless the film has its qualities. It is gritty and sometimes quite suspenseful and it has several outbursts of sleaze and bloody violence. The cinematography is great especially the carchases are very wellfilmed.Overall LIBERI ARMATI PERICOLOSI is a decentenough film that should entertain my fellow Eurocrime fans. However the genre has brought forth many films that are far better people who are not yet too familiar with Poliziotteschi are welladvised to check out anything by Umberto Lenzi Fernando Di Leo or Enzo Castellari before this.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the days before those innocent acts of trolling each other on Facebook and revenge porning each other the youth of yesterday were content simply to drive around Milan acting like jerks robbing banks and shooting innocent people in the face. This is their story.Three young guys  Blondie Hunky and the annoying Joe plan to rob a petrol station in Milan but they don't know that Hunky's girlfriend has gone to the police and tipped them off. She does make the mistake of telling cop Tomas Milian that they have toy guns though toys that turn out to be real as several cops and a petrol station owner are gunned down. Now Blondie and the rest are on the run but instead of keeping their heads low they hit banks recruit others to rob supermarket then kill said others with hot lead.Milian can't figure out why some rich boys would go on such a crime spree but at least he takes time out to blame the parents for their lack of attention to their kids. To be honest that's the only time he shows any emotion here as Milian doesn't have much to do besides try and track down the trio as they kill everyone they meet and get Hunky's girlfriend caught up in it too. Milian really just looks concerned smokes and becomes increasingly dishevelled.We spend a lot more time with the youngsters instead. Hunky never kills anyone but goes along with the crime spree and only seems to enjoy things when he's outrunning the police in a car chase. Blondie however is the leader and although he doesn't show much emotion he's might have a thing for Hunky Hunky's girlfriend spots it during the car chase too plus he doesn't get involved in a gang bang earlier in the film which someone ruins by farting!. That leaves Joe the weak link in this film as his character is so annoying. He's the hyperactive 'joker' of the pack but his jokes are only funny to himself and he laughs at them in a shrill moronic bray at least in the Italian language version. The only time he calms down is when one of Blondie's mates refers to him as being the village idiot which results in said mate being machinegunned in the face.I'm sure writer Fernando Di Leo is trying to say something here but I didn't catch it. This is a nihilistic cavalcade of violence all set to Tomas Milian's jaw clenching. That cheesy song at the start was awful though  maybe that's what made them go nuts?".

	schema:reviewBody "It took a while to grow on me but by the time I had finished with Young Violent Dangerous I realized how much I enjoyed the film. I found myself caring about the characters and what would become of them. Young Violent Dangerous is the story of three young punks out getting some kicks by knocking over a gas station. Their crimes soon escalate bank robbery murder kidnapping etc. to the point where they get the attention of the entire Milan police force. The film is filled with some unexpected violence as the young thugs show just how tough they are and how little they care about human life. Throw in a few decent car chases and you've got a nice little Poliziotteschi. The ending is another unexpected moment with a nice twist.While Tomas Milian gets top billing he really does very little other than smoke cigarettes talk on a police radio lecture people and stay about three steps behind the young criminals. Eleonora Giorgi and Stefano Patrizi are the real stars as the kidnap victim and head of the gang respectively in a couple of very nice performances. The low point of the film is the character played by Benjamin Lev Joe. He's supposed to be the clown of the group Why do all gangs have one of these guys? but he comes off as an utterly ridiculous hyenalaughing moron who I grew to detest more and more as Young Violent Dangerous wore on.".

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost I love it when a movie fulfills the promise of its own title! Far too often this isn't the case though. With a title like Young Violent Dangerous director Romolo Guerrieri and writer Fernando Di Leo generate quite high expectations but they also definitely deliver them to the max! The antiheroes in the film are young they behave incredibly violent and they become gradually more and more dangerous! It's also quite remarkable how a relatively small subgenre of exploitation cinema like eurocrime brought forward so many different and versatile streams. Within eurocrime you have the regular Poliziotteschi movies tough coppers chasing robbers mafia sagas gang war movies and vigilante thrillers. There also exists another and much lesser known stream focusing on rich spoiled and derailed teenagers that go on a murder rampage for no other apparent reason than kicks. Terror in RomeViolence for Kicks starring Antonio Sabato is an example of this and Young Violent Dangerous pretty much falls in the same category as well. The film starts with the beautiful Lea nervously sitting at the desk of grumpy police commissioner Tomas Milian. She comes to report that her boyfriend Lucio together with his friends Blondie Mario and Joe is about to rob a gas station with fake toy guns. The police prepare an ambush but the the guns turn out to be very real and Blondie and Joe kill four policemen. Instead of showing remorse they continue to terrorize the streets of Milan. Lucio is reluctant but he cowardly follows Blondie who's the leader of the trio and the completely nihilistic madman Joe. They rob banks only to threw out the money back in the streets and invade a crowded supermarket where they even massacre a befriended gang in cold blood. When Blondie discovers that Lucio's girlfriend Lea betrayed them to the police they kidnap her and try to drive out of Milan. The DVDcover proudly announces that contemporary big star Tomas Milian plays the lead role but actually his role as the embittered commissioner is rather dullish and familiar. He smokes a lot gives lectures to the fugitive teenagers' parents about how it's their fault and commands his squads to pull up road blocks road blocks and more road blocks! The crooks stay well ahead of the police but the intrigues come to the surface. Lea grows increasingly disgusted by her weak boyfriend Lucio and Blondie takes advantage of this. Di Leo the genius behind Milano Calibro 9 and La Mala Ordina which are arguably the two greatest Poliziotteschi movies ever made once more delivers a fastpaced and actionpacked screenplay full of unexpected twists uncompromising violence and deeply unpleasant characters. In other words genuine and hardboiled exploitation cinema like they could only make it in Italy during the seventies! Stefano Patrizi is excellent as the cool and stoic antihero. Benjamin Lev's character Joe or Giovanni is often quite irritating especially because of his exaggeratedly moronic laughter but I do like the idea of an utterly relentless lunatic. Young Violent Dangerous definitely contains a lot more character development than the average euro crime thriller but it's not at the expense of the action and excitement. There's a bit of gratuitous yay! nudity principally provided by beautiful lead actress Eleonora Giorgi and also  of course  a typically cynical and downbeat climax. Most certainly recommended if you like Italian cinema of the '70s  and who honestly doesn't?".

The budget seems quite high but it is used on the style of the film and the filmmakers never concentrated on the story. Dharmesh Darshan is a completely weak director because he always thinks that style is more important than story then why doesn't he become a cinematographer? In the film Anil Kapoor behaved as if India's finance minister had levied a tax on smiling. Akshay Kumar played a top pop singer who sang everything but pop songs. As for Kareena Kapoor she essayed the role of a straying lover wife and mother who preaches that a lover can be unfaithful but mother can't! Really? In that case why did she stray at all? She was a mother even when she started her extramarital affair so what was she talking about?".

Kareena Kapoor who I usually like spent the entire film with her eyes wide open looking shocked and was otherwise utterly expressionless. This I blame as well as everything else on truly bad directing. They drone on and on about Indian culture and renouncing of the self for the good of others  but none of it seemed genuine. The main characters sleepwalked through the performance and I do not understand how talented actors like Anil Kapoor could have agreed to acting in this. The side characters of Manoj Bajpai and Shamita Shetty only serve to annoy. I am still reeling in horror at the fact that I wasted my time in this utterly pointless manner.

	schema:reviewBody "'Hum Aapke Hain Bewafaa Dhadkan'Bewafaa Dir Dharmesh Darshan Cast Akshay Kumar Kareena Kapoor Sushmita Sen Manoj Bajpai Shamita Shetty and Anil Kapoor. Written by Robin Bhatt Dharmesh Darshan and Raj Sinha. Rating There is this game where you watch a movie go back home and think of different alternate endings to it. After the many versions if the actual ending still seems more interesting then you've lost. Dharmesh Darshan probably played this game after watching Sooraj Barjatya's 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun' and his very own 'Dhadkan'. Mr. Darshan must've thought what if Madhuri Dixit had actually married Mohnish Behl in the former and Sunil Shetty had returned in the latter to find Shilpa Shetty willing to leave hubby Akki? Now develop these plots and what you get is a fair idea of Darshan's 'Bewafaa'. Sadly even though Mr. Darshan must've considered his endings more interesting he still is the loser!Welcome then to the shakalaka baby family in Montreal Canada. We have papa Kabir Bedi firang? mummy Nafisa Ali badi beti Sushmita Sen and chotti beti Kareena Kapoor. Sen is Aarti married to AdityaAnil Kapoor a businessmanwe're not quite sure what business he does? who has little time for his family and probably mistakes his wife for a personal assistant! Aarti dies leaving behind two twin daughters. You guessed it right! Within a reel chotti beti AnjaliKareena is married off to Aditya and sent packing to New Delhi. Living in a loveless marriage her life is provided a pacemaker with the return of her former love hold your breath Indian Raja?!?Akshay Kumar a popular popstar. Old flames are lit again and the lovers decide to elope. But there's a spooky coupleManoj Bajpai  Shamita Shetty to cope! Oh nope!! The audience is left with no hope!!! Follow a predictable storyline then to a tiring climax where everything is restored. The audience is bored. Yeh dil manage no more!!!The whole movie is riddled with songs that emerge out of nowhere like land mines in a war zone! Mind you the songs are good to listen they are just not used properly. The first half drags along with only the beautiful sights of Montreal keeping you interested. The second half promises a similar fate but things are made lively with the entrance of DilManoj Bajpai and PallaviShamita Shetty. Bordering on the line of vulgarity Manoj Bajpai delivers a hammy performance but there is a guilty pleasure in watching his antics. A tip Mr. Darshan publicize Bajpai's character. Kareena is passablesorry Bebo 'Bewafaa' won't do for you what 'Raja Hindustani' did for Lolo while Sush is seriously challenging the position of Simi Garewal as Miss Grace. It is common knowledge that Akshay Kumar has a cocky attitude which can be used to his advantage when cast in roles similar to the ones he essayed in 'Khakee' 'Aankhen' and 'Mujhse Shaadi Karogi'. But here as a lover boy he is at his stolid best! That leaves us with Anil Kapoor. This man is like wine he's only getting better with age. In a thankless role he acts his part with dignity. Only for him and a fairly decent secondhalf 'Bewafaa' is not as bad as it sounds!Abhishek BandekarRating  Poor  Average  Good  Very Good  Excellent25th February 2005".

People may have thought they'd see an intense film about betrayal Bewafaa  Unfaithful in the light of such films as Murder. But this one is a slow stretched boring and flawed film with no story. So unrealistic that you feel it is actually for kids. I mean Kareena wakes up at morning all madeup like a clown?This is a weak show. Not a single funny moment no excitement no love story nothing. This is a collection of situations taken from different films and it's incredibly dull. Just follow she marries her late sister's husband cares for his children soon her previous lover comes back out of nowhere they hardly speak and someone decides to blackmail her for no reason?? Oh and there the melodrama only starts  a climax full of tears by all the cast members and a separation accompanied with a song... Old clichs cheap dialogues and poor execution. At the end of the film you sit trying to understand what was it all about...Kareena is lifeless and bland. You can tell her that her car is burning outside and she'll still have the same indifferent expression. Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar are the same  no impact no character. Shamita Shetty is hot Manoj Bajpai is annoying as never. It's terrible to see such a great actor playing this silly overthetop character and accepting any role in this film in the first place.The film's saving grace may lie in some of the songs but Bewafaa is still one poor attempt and that's simply because the director tried to take this immature script way too seriously.".

I manged to rate it two stars just because of my love for Akshaye Kumar despite my hating him in this film and some good songs from the film. But even the good songs are not enough to save this clunker! It deserves 0 stars otherwise! Kareena Kapoor plays a young teen growing up in Canada and who is coming of age. She has a boyfriend Raja played by Kumar who is an aspiring pop singer and whom she hides from her family because her family has the impression that she is a good girl and stuff. One day her older sister played by Sushmita Sen comes back home to visit with big news! She and her husband played by Anil Kapoor are pregnant with twins. Anjali K.Kapoor is ecstatic for her sister so much so that she confides in her sister her love for her secret boyfriend. Sen's character agrees to meet with Raja and instantly she likes him and they catch up on getting to know each other during a song number. A few weeks later Anjali goes to the airport to pick up her sister's husband and brings him to the hospital where upon reaching she finds her parents with distressed looks on their faces. The mother announces to both of them that Sushmita's character is no more she passed away during childbirth and naturally they are both shattered. Then the most surprising thing of all happens. Anjali is asked to marry her sister's husband so that the twins will grow up with a mother and even more surprising Anjali forgets about Raja and does as her parents have told her. She moves back to India with her new husband and slowly tells herself that in order for her new husband to appreciate her more she will have to make her like her sister as much as possible which includes dressing like her talking like her and in general doing everything like her. You would think with all that fluff and stuff they would have ended the film right? Wrong. They bring Raja to India now a star and make him bump into Anjali and a game of cat and mouse ensues between Anjali her husband his friends who are on to her game and Raja. Then the film ends with Raja aka Indian Raja formally addressing the audience watching the film which made me cringe to no end. Save yourself from this soapopera and watch Sisila the classic instead!".

Akshay Kumar is generally a good actor but why he chose to star in this. Anil Kapoor has given us great performances in the past not anymore.

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest I have not been a fan of Dharmesh Darshans films. He has an knack of remaking classic films and making an absolute hash of it. Raja Hindustani was a remake of 60's classic Jab Jab Phool Kile Mela was a remake of Sholay and now we have Bewaffa which is a remake of Gumrah. There is not really a script to speak of just a chain of sequences. Not even the performances are noteworthy the person that sticks out is Manoj Bajpai who overacts through all of his scenes.The only redeeming factor is the music by Darshan loyalist Nadeem Shravan. My favourites are either the title song or Yaad. I am now dreading to see what classic he makes an hash of next Kuch Kuch Hota HaiOh no Amar Akbar Anthony Oh good no. Avoid at all costs.".

I'm going to start of with the performances. Akshay Kumar's performance is well below average he doesn't do much and his costumes don't do him any favours. Kareena Kapoor is also well below average and the way in which she's acted in the film doesn't convince the viewer that she can do those kinds of roles. Sushmita Sen was OK as was Anil Kapoor. The music is good. The two best tracks are 'ek bewafaa hai' and 'yaad yaad'. The direction though it has to be said is quite bad but the screenplay is OK. Overall this film is a waste of time. I give it 310.".

It's a bit exaggerating but I think that is necessary for the comedy like the exaggerating facial makeup of old Chinese operas. I think I finally realized after a month watching the movie how the stories relate to one another.SpoilerAt first as we follow Kwan Kwan to the Aunt's apartment we see that she is a modern woman educated tidy and has strong morals. There is a lot of details that give off her little woman personality but she still tries to be a brave responsible citizen. I think that a lot of modernage women have similar difficulties.As Kwan Kwan leaves we stay with Aunt and see how her life changes. It seems little by little the morals she held goes against her. I think Chow Yun Fat is more than just a swindler and it's difficult to tell. Concentrating the movie's plot on their love affair seems too narrow. I think the different parts of the story talks about a certain modern moral dilemma that we have. Love friendship family generation gap you always want to do good but it turns out bad.After all this Kwan Kwan visits again before he heads off to another stage of life and we see as he does the postmodern life of his Aunt. How eventually we all return to our roots give up the complicated life out there but still missing the excitement and possibilities.".

I think Chow Yun Fat is more than just a swindler and it's difficult to tell. Concentrating the movie's plot on their love affair seems too narrow. I think the different parts of the story talks about a certain modern moral dilemma that we have. Love friendship family generation gap you always want to do good but it turns out bad.After all this Kwan Kwan visits again before he heads off to another stage of life and we see as he does the postmodern life of his Aunt. How eventually we all return to our roots give up the complicated life out there but still missing the excitement and possibilities.";

This is when bringing her visiting nephew home she does a couple of quick skips moving towards the door of her apartment. I would be blowing everything out of proportion if I were to suggest that this little bit of body language in revealing all the frustration and optimism hope and fears of this middle aged woman caught in the tides of changing times. Read from this anything you wish or nothing.Next comes a scene that must bring to mind Zhu Ziqing's 18981948 moving prose Beiying Retreating figure that depicts a young man's feeling at a railway station where his loving father is seeing him off. It's almost the same setting as Aunt sees her 12yearold nephew off after his sojourning in Shanghai. After saying goodbye watching Aunt move slightly awkwardly away and finally disappearing into the crowd the young man can't help showing the feeling of bittersweetness reflecting on how despite generation gap and conflict during his stay a bond of affection has developed between him and this sometimes irritating aunt.Then comes the comic relief. The scene is the staircase leading up to Aunt's apartment on the twelfth floor. From a low angle shot we see from Aunt's back how she is struggling middle aged and not exactly slim with bags of grocery. In even worse shape however is her recently made friend carring a huge water malon a con man as a matter of fact so deliciously played by Chow Yunfat. Having seen him recently in Curse of the golden flower is an unequivocal reminder of the amazing breadth of versatility of this wonderful actor.Most punchy however is a flashback from the POV of estranged daughter played by Zhao Wei how as a little girl she saw her mother walking away from a worthless husband and a helpless daughter suitcase in hand never bothering to turn her head with even just one brief parting glance.As suggested by my summary line Aunt is not unlike a road movie except that the scene is stationary in Aunt's humble apartment in modern Shanghai. Mentioned above are only a few of the many characters that come into Aunt's life. Who is aunt anyway? According to Director Hui in an interview with a local magazine Aunt is a woman falling far behind the trends. She has only two ways to go either be comfortable with where she is or catch up. She tries the latter and that's where you get the comedy and the poignancy both. I cannot leave this brief report without mentioning the original music by Joe Hisaishi who is equally comfortable with Kitano Takeshi Fireworks Kikujiro and Miyazaki Hayao Spirited away Howl's moving castle.".

Instead it's a depressing story of how a woman's life slides downhill.I had other problems with the film as well. As someone who has lived in China for seven years I can definitely say Siqin Gaowa seemed too dowdy to be a Shanghai woman and Chow YunFat looked too suave and sophisticated to be a middleaged Mainland man. I also didn't see the point of the young boy's character although I guess it is an Ann Hui trope if that's the right word to have a character's story told through the eyes of a kid. He was a real cypher and was barely in the film at all. How could he even know that stuff about his aunt? Using the child's perspective in Song of the Exile worked well but not here at all. I also couldn't buy Vicki Zhao Wei in her role and her appearance and back story came so out of the blue that it almost seemed like a joke.All in all a big disappointment but I wouldn't have been so upset about it if the film's advertisements didn't make it look like a comedy. I really dislike when advertisers pull people into a film under false pretenses. If it is a tragedy fine advertise it as a tragedy. Just don't mislead audiences.".

	schema:headline " HK Neo Reviews The Postmodern Life of My Aunt";
	schema:reviewBody "Life is a journey Ann Hui have always been an exceptional talent and the pact of realism in her films like July Rhapsody pin points her distinct style of direction. In Hui's pursue for realism there is always a message that reflects and affects the life of any part of the audience. Whether it is the rebellious teenager years the struggles of middle age or perhaps the need to adapt into the ever changing world of today Hui's films have someone for everyone. In The Postmodern Life of My Aunt Hui ventures into the issue of older people and their struggles to keep up with the rapid growth of modernise cities such as Shanghai. It is a struggle that is relevant to everyone of us and with a brink of the eye Neo can not imagine what it will be like for him in 50 years time  whether he will be grasping on the comfort of the old or adapting into the ever changing society of the future. The film reminds the audience of our parents grandparents and realising that ultimately change is inevitable and the struggles that they face are seemingly real and tangible. There is a quote from the aunt Siqin Gaowin that seems frighteningly realistic  It doesn't matter if you cheat me when I am still 17 but if you cheat all my money now it is like a dead end for me as I cannot earn it back. It is all the more shameful and disgusting when the audience think back to all those headlines of fail companies and within those companies there are millions of pensioners who have their entire life saving within.The movie goes like this Siqin Gaowa The Day the Sun Turned Cold stars as Ye Rutang the eponymous aunt of the title who lives in Shanghai alone but happily. Her fortunes change however as she soon fall victim to scam after scam perpetrated by a series of surprising con men including her own nephew Guan Wenshou and a wouldbe opera singer Chow Yun Fat who attacks her weakest point her heart. With so many people valuing her money over her as a person how can this strong woman maintain her stalwart but increasingly outdated dignity? My Aunt is not a film that is all too concerned about the plot but rather as the title suggests it is about the journey of one's life. It is an interesting and fascinating adventure to witness through Siqin Gaowa venturing through one scam after another until finally noticing how much the world have changed. Shanghai has become ultra commercial and the urban myth about the obsession of money is fast becoming the truth than a random saying. The scenes of Siqin in the car as she look out the window of the commercialize lighting in the night time as well as millions of car lights roaming across the screen like ants coming in and out of their nest. It is a sight that she can never imagine seeing 50 years ago. Ann Hui smartly produces the film in a satirical manner and in many ways the beauty of the film lies in Hui's use of images to speak louder than words. Perhaps the most shocking scene of all apart from Chow Yun Fat bedding Siqin is when we encounter a typically hot chick before realizing that half her face is burnt. It is a shocking yet sympathetic sight as the audience realize the imperfect nature of humanity and emphasizing on a theme that Hui is stressing upon what we see if not always what we get.Siqi Gaowa portrays an immensely difficult role in a rather natural and understated manner as she is torn between the comforts of the old and the frightening prospect of the new. The moment she realizes that Chow Yun Fat is a conman the expression within her face is worth embracing as she finally realizes that it is a world she can no longer fit in. It is worth noting that despite Chow Yun Fat single handedly lifts the film to another level it is nothing more than a glorified cameo. It is all the more disappointing that all the trailers emphasize on his involvement in the flick which once again indirectly alludes to Hui's central theme of what you see may not be the truth. In another cameo performance the much missed Zhao Wei plays Gaowa's daughter in a relatively good performance.All in all The Postmodern Life of My Aunt is by no means accessible to everyone but it is ultimately an art flick about the seemingly reality of old age and life. It ponders the audience to question about their future and the fears of old age. The parallel struggles of Gaowa are as close as grandchildren will understand the struggles that our grandparents are going through until the audience experience it themselves. It is a frightening process to imagine about what was once cool is now totally out of date but then again who knows what will happen in 50 years time. Perhaps cars will be flying across the universe people can walk across the ocean or everything may remain pretty much the same. Ann Hui is to be applauded for creating something so real and so affecting. It is by no means Hui's strongest work but it is a film that allows us to explore and journey into the unknownI rate it 910www.thehkneo.com".

Since the stories around the aunt are not connected with each other it's like watching 5 movies in a row. The story is just not good enough to keep the audience interested what's happen next. The music is to heavy to a supposed to be funny movie and does not support the story at all. It seem's the writer who wrote the award winning movie Peacock as well is better in writing sad stories. Yun Fat Chow  Siqin Gaowa play nice but there is no magic you can feel between them. A astonishing performance unfortunatelly to short gave Shi Ke as a poor mother with a sick kid in a hospital. Unfortunately for Chao Wei her performance came last when you already lost interest. If you really want to see a funny Chinese movie with a great story watch Crazy stone.".

Her college education and fluent British English does not save her from making mistakes after mistakes. Each time she does so I really feel for her. I get so disappointed and saddened.

	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin singing the praises of this little gem that I just saw for the first time recently? It establishes itself permanently in my good graces as a viewer because by default it provides a near documentary look what with its plentiful use of location shooting of Southern California circa 1967. It captures more strikingly than any film I know the texture of a particular time. The cars the clothes the signs the drive in the suburban houses speak subliminal volumes it is nothing short of a neural map of a time.This is Bogdanovich's first full directorial effort. He had shot part of Wild Angels for Corman a while before and Corman was impressed enough with his work there to offer him his own feature. These details and more are related in the excellent Bogdanovich commentary track that amazingly is included on the new budget DVD. To secure the assignment he had to agree to incorporate 20 minutes of footage from the Corman cheapie The Terror or that was the plan at the outset and shoot an additional new 20 minutes or two days with Boris Karloff. Throw in 40 minutes of your own storyline invention and voila instant New Drive In Movie Roger Corman style. The project eventually grew beyond that. The final tally 125000 by Bogdanovich's recollection with 25000 of that going to Karloff for 5 days shooting. Bogdanovich's first script killed off Karloff half way through to accommodate the budget and schedule. Sam Fuller it was who advised him strongly to ignore all that stuff if the story demanded more than 2 days with Karloff. Targets feels like a European film of its time. This says to me above all that Bogdanovich wanted to make certain he was making a modern film his own film and not an easy pastichehomage to the American directors he had enshrined in writing before becoming a director himself Ford Hawks Hitchcock Welles et al. I would almost call the narrative voice he assumes here passive. The absence of a film score adds to this feeling. But it is not semidocumentary there is nothing even remotely Dragnet about Targets. It is spare clean modern lacking in embellishment or decoration but the people speak naturally move fluidly and seem real. And there is a stillness again a feeling enhanced by the lack of music that creates verisimilitude but also a general sense of unease. The story of Targets is based on the case of Charles Whitman the young man who climbed a tower in Texas in 1966 and staged a sniping siege on pedestrians and motorists below. An editor at Esquire had suggested this as a great film topic to Bogdanovich when he was writing some film criticism for them. Bogdanovich and his wife at the time Polly Platt based their first scenario on this news story and got a major script doctor assist from director Samuel Fuller The Big Red One Shock Corridor Pickup on South Street. One of the most interesting things the new DVD commentary track points out is the number of times Bogdanovich achieved remarkable long take tracking shots. I missed them on first viewing they are so discreetly handled that even a diehard film fan and geek may be unaware of them. Too often this is the sort of shot that calls a lot of attention to itself as a flamboyant statement of the director's mastery for its own sake. It would have been easy for a firsttime director to get snared in flashy gamesplaying. But instead these takes are slipped seamlessly into the weave of the story enhancing the everyday feel the naturalism of Targets. The best long take scene and one of the most telling scenes in the movie begins with a couple of minutes of the family sitting in the darkened living room watching The Joey Bishop Show on TV Mom and Dad beg early work tomorrow and head off to bed the young couple go down the hall to the bedroom where the wife dresses for work then we go back to the living room where Bobby sits alone for a bit watching TV. All without a cut. It is a charged still few minutes in which Bobby makes his one and only sad little bid to talk out his inner turmoil with the person to whom he is closest. This doesn't even get into the touching and amusing Karloff subplot about an old horror star resignedly coming to terms with his obsolescence. He says his type of horror can't match the horror of the modern world and as proof he holds out a newspaper with a headline about a teenager shooting six people in a local grocery.Small budget films do not get any better than this. Neither do most large budget these days. 10 stars. See it.".

	schema:headline " Bogdanovich Fuller Corman Karloff four big names one disturbing exploitation film";
	schema:reviewBody "The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation in fact it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society  and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic. The crucial question is whether a quasiautistic or lowgrade schizophrenic disturbance helps us to explain the violence spreading today.  Erich Fromm In 1965 teenager Michael Clark positioned himself upon a hilltop overlooking Highway 101 south of Orcutt California. Using a Mauser rifle equipped with telescopic sight he fired upon passing cars killing three individuals and wounding six. Clark committed suicide when police rushed his hill. A year later Malcom X was assassinated.In 1966 Former US Marine Charles Whitman embarked on a shooting rampage at a university campus in Texas. He killed 16 people and injured 32. Whitman killed his victims from a university tower observation deck. Earlier that day he murdered his wife and mother at home. Two years later Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy were assassinated.Today Roger Corman is well known for producing and directing a string of low budget Bmovies and exploitation films. Targets is one of his most interesting. Seeking to exploit the string of assassinations and shooting rampages that were rocketing across 1960s America Corman gathered together thirty thousand dollars latched upon the vague idea of a film based on the life and killings of Charles Whitman and hired a young Peter Bogdanovich to direct the film. Targets was Bogdanovich's debut. He was hired because Corman could pay him virtually nothing. Bogdanovich would go on to make a number of critically praised films but few are as interesting as this nauseating little horror movie.Bogdanovich would write the film's screenplay with the help of director Sam Fuller both artists elevating the film beyond your usual Roger Corman fare. Bizarrely Corman stipulated that Targets include footage from The Terror a horror movie he had made years earlier. As ageing horror movie legend Boris Karloff renowned for his roles in early silent and sound horror movies The Mummy The Body Snatcher many iconic early Franenstein movies and many Universal Studios horror flicks owed Corman two days worth of acting Corman also stipulated that Karloff be written into the film. Bogdanovich obliged.The end result is a film with two narrative strands. On one hand we follow Karloff's character who plays an ageing horror actor struggling to find modern roles an obvious allusion to Karloff and his own career whilst on the other hand we follow a character called Bobby Thompson a retired Vietnam veteran who seems like an upstanding all American boy until he embarks on a murder spree. Both narrative strands don't intersect until the film's climax.Much of the film watches from afar as Bobby does mundane daily activities  talking to his parents girlfriend coworkers shopping watching TV sleeping etc  the film conveying a kind of depressingly hollow postwar America in which cement strip malls driveins and junk food are the equivalent of culture and in which everyone is atomised automatised and drearily locked into their own private cubicles. The film's horror is apparent even before Bobby begins his killings Bogdanovich latching on to a kind of banal sunbaked urban hell the complete opposite to the romantic moody noirish urbana of Taxi Drivr highways ceaselessly spinning cars like conveyor belts gaudy post war architecture antiseptic suburban homes the giant bland cisterns of oil refineries the tacky warble of TV and radio. The film's aesthetic sickens. And then the killings begins.Bobby's murders are shot with a similar tone of ambivalence or detachment Bogdanovich forcing us to watch as Bobby matteroffactly shoots his parents and lover and then perches himself above a highway. Here he emotionlessly snipes the drivers and passengers of passing cars. No overt attempt is made to psychoanalyse or investigate Bobby's motivations. The film's tone is simply one of nauseating indifference. Unlike most horrorslasherexploitation films Targets never feels like its been designed to tantalise. Of course salacious plots and exploitative hooks were always Corman's chief aims but Fuller and Bogdanovich short circuit their producer. How successful they are is arguable.The film ends with Bobby and Karloff meeting fittingly in a cinema. It is here where oldhorror collides with new the ancient classic blackandwhite horror movie star of yesteryear facing up to and superseded by a new nihilistic generation. Karloff's character hearkens back to Bela Lugosi Universal and Hammer Horror classics. Bobby's Hitchcock's Psycho Powell's Peeping Tom and the gore slasher zombie and exploitationhorror waves that would follow.

	onyx:emotionText "The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation in fact it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society  and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic. The crucial question is whether a quasiautistic or lowgrade schizophrenic disturbance helps us to explain the violence spreading today.  Erich Fromm In 1965 teenager Michael Clark positioned himself upon a hilltop overlooking Highway 101 south of Orcutt California. Using a Mauser rifle equipped with telescopic sight he fired upon passing cars killing three individuals and wounding six. Clark committed suicide when police rushed his hill. A year later Malcom X was assassinated.In 1966 Former US Marine Charles Whitman embarked on a shooting rampage at a university campus in Texas. He killed 16 people and injured 32. Whitman killed his victims from a university tower observation deck. Earlier that day he murdered his wife and mother at home. Two years later Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy were assassinated.Today Roger Corman is well known for producing and directing a string of low budget Bmovies and exploitation films. Targets is one of his most interesting. Seeking to exploit the string of assassinations and shooting rampages that were rocketing across 1960s America Corman gathered together thirty thousand dollars latched upon the vague idea of a film based on the life and killings of Charles Whitman and hired a young Peter Bogdanovich to direct the film. Targets was Bogdanovich's debut. He was hired because Corman could pay him virtually nothing. Bogdanovich would go on to make a number of critically praised films but few are as interesting as this nauseating little horror movie.Bogdanovich would write the film's screenplay with the help of director Sam Fuller both artists elevating the film beyond your usual Roger Corman fare. Bizarrely Corman stipulated that Targets include footage from The Terror a horror movie he had made years earlier. As ageing horror movie legend Boris Karloff renowned for his roles in early silent and sound horror movies The Mummy The Body Snatcher many iconic early Franenstein movies and many Universal Studios horror flicks owed Corman two days worth of acting Corman also stipulated that Karloff be written into the film. Bogdanovich obliged.The end result is a film with two narrative strands. On one hand we follow Karloff's character who plays an ageing horror actor struggling to find modern roles an obvious allusion to Karloff and his own career whilst on the other hand we follow a character called Bobby Thompson a retired Vietnam veteran who seems like an upstanding all American boy until he embarks on a murder spree. Both narrative strands don't intersect until the film's climax.Much of the film watches from afar as Bobby does mundane daily activities  talking to his parents girlfriend coworkers shopping watching TV sleeping etc  the film conveying a kind of depressingly hollow postwar America in which cement strip malls driveins and junk food are the equivalent of culture and in which everyone is atomised automatised and drearily locked into their own private cubicles. The film's horror is apparent even before Bobby begins his killings Bogdanovich latching on to a kind of banal sunbaked urban hell the complete opposite to the romantic moody noirish urbana of Taxi Drivr highways ceaselessly spinning cars like conveyor belts gaudy post war architecture antiseptic suburban homes the giant bland cisterns of oil refineries the tacky warble of TV and radio. The film's aesthetic sickens. And then the killings begins.Bobby's murders are shot with a similar tone of ambivalence or detachment Bogdanovich forcing us to watch as Bobby matteroffactly shoots his parents and lover and then perches himself above a highway. Here he emotionlessly snipes the drivers and passengers of passing cars. No overt attempt is made to psychoanalyse or investigate Bobby's motivations. The film's tone is simply one of nauseating indifference. Unlike most horrorslasherexploitation films Targets never feels like its been designed to tantalise. Of course salacious plots and exploitative hooks were always Corman's chief aims but Fuller and Bogdanovich short circuit their producer. How successful they are is arguable.The film ends with Bobby and Karloff meeting fittingly in a cinema. It is here where oldhorror collides with new the ancient classic blackandwhite horror movie star of yesteryear facing up to and superseded by a new nihilistic generation. Karloff's character hearkens back to Bela Lugosi Universal and Hammer Horror classics. Bobby's Hitchcock's Psycho Powell's Peeping Tom and the gore slasher zombie and exploitationhorror waves that would follow. The film's climax plays like a raging metaphor for the collapse of the Motion Picture Production Code the death of Old Hollywood the stupidity of lax gun control laws the disintegration of the nuclear family the real results of post war economic expansion the impossibility of the American ideal and the festering rot behind both modern society and audiences who demand blood as compensation for their own lives.

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Bogdanovich is a man that to me is too intelligent to make a film without anything to say. With that in mind however if Targets does have a point to it it is masked well. The only thing resembling any kind of comment is that the film professes the differences between screen horror and real life horror but even this idea is put forward in a muddled way. That being said however Targets is a world away from being a bad film. The film marks one of the last performances for the great Boris Karloff and serves as a nice swansong to his career especially as he's almost sending himself up in this film. The great man plays Byran Orlock an aging horror film actor who has decided that he wants to retire. However things are not as simple as that as on the same day that Orlock is due to make his final public appearance at the screening of last movie Roger Corman's 'The Terror' there's a serial killer on the loose who's taking pot shots at people with a sniper rifle. As real life horror and screen horror icon clash...who will be the resulting victor? Despite the point being rather muddled Targets makes up for that with the exciting way that the plot plays out and the stream of tributes and comments on Karloff's sorry Orlock's career. It's nice to see Karloff enjoying himself and the introspective nature of the movie ensures that he gets the chance to do this. Peter Bogdanovich is well known for being a director who is also a fan of cinema and this movie also gives him a chance to tribute the medium that he evidently loves. As a fan of cinema myself it always makes me happy to see this sort of thing and that marks another reason for my enjoyment of this movie. The way that the plot plays out makes the movie predictable but in a way that adds to the idea of 'real horror' as we can see what's going to come it's like a car crash  it's obvious what's going to happen yet all we can do is just sit back and watch. On the whole this is a classy thriller and while it never hammers home it's point enough to ensure that you know it's actually got a point it works because of it's tension and well paced plot. This will also be a must see movie for fans of the great Boris Karloff.".

Targets is his last great film and also the final film in which he noticeably feels comfortable and motivated to act. In practically all of this other post1965 appearances Boris Karloff already looked more dead than alive but here you can tell he clearly wanted to play this role. Many many thanks to writerdirector Peter Bogdanovich who  under the protective supervision of Roger Corman  cast Boris Karloff in a role that couldn't have been played by anyone else except maybe Vincent Price like Bogdanovich own supportive character even funnily mentions at one point during the film. Byron Orlock is an aging and stubborn who's convinced there isn't any interest anymore in the grotesque Gothic villain monsters he portrays. After the test screening of his latest film Byron suddenly announces his retirement much against the will of his producers personal assistant and a young aspiring director who just finished writing a screenplay especially for Byron. They all urge him to reconsider his decision and at least make it to his planned public appearance at a drivein theater. Meanwhile in the same city young and confused weaponfreak Bobby Thomson is about to snap mentally. He bought a trunk full of artillery and wrote a letter warning people that many will die before they catch him. After randomly having shot people in cars from the top of an oil reservoir Bobby flees from the police and hides out in the drivein theater. Targets is loosely based on the tragedy caused by Charles Whitman who killed and wounded over forty people in Texas on August 1st 1966. Perhaps the US was still too much in a state of shock to realize so shortly after these ream events but Targets makes a powerful statement regarding the alienation of youth and the largely uncontrolled weapon legislation. I encountered some criticism stating that the two stories are largely unconnected and that particularly Karloff's story is random and irrelevant. I heavily object since Byron Orlock physically represents the oldfashioned definition of horror creepy old madmen safely entrenched in their Gothic castles whereas Bobby Thomson embodies the new and grueling type of horror which we sadly are confronted with on a near daily basis. Targets basically builds a symbolic bridge between vintage horror and modern terror and it's truly fantastic that Boris Karloff helped building it. The sniper sequences are immensely disturbing especially opposed to the cheesy borrowed footage of Corman's The Terror playing at the drivein and the film bathes in a genuine ominous atmosphere whenever the character of Bobby Thomson walks into the screen. The interactions between him and his wife are saddening uncomfortable and unsettling all at the same time. Personally I always thought The Last Picture Show was Bogdanovich's only true masterpiece but that was before I laid my hands on Targets. This film is even better.".

I will be buying this excellent DVD with the hilarious and fascinating commentary by the director he is an amusingly droll fellow and if any of his other films contain commentaries as lively and enjoyable as TARGETS then i am going to be the first in line to rent DAISY MILLER. Just kidding. But that doesn't make me any less impressed with TARGETS. It truly is a first rate thriller that still has a remarkable power. This is one of the very first modern psycho films. Bravo to Bogdanovich and company for this one. Very well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the things I truly like and admire about Boris Karloff was that he pretty much kept on playing in the same sort of movies and played the same sort of roles throughout his entire career. Seems to me he looked for movies and parts that suited him and more let movies adapt to him rather than the other way around.It's also a well kept secret Karloff actually was a pretty good actor! In this movie he definitely gets to show some of his skills and I really enjoyed him in what later turned out to be one of his final roles.But really it's not a Karloff movie and I also most certainly don't see him as the lead role in this. It's actually best to know as little as possible about this movie since that way you shall definitely enjoy it most just as I pretty much did. It's a movie that constantly throws you off. The one moment you think the movie is going to be about one thing but it then later turns out it's being about something totally different and unrelated!You could see this movie as one that has two simultaneous story lines in it. Both of them are seemingly unrelated to each other but they of course come together toward its end. Not in the most convincing way and it seems a bit random all but I don't know the randomness of it seemed to sort of suit the movie.It's because it also has some other very random things going on in it. I'm referring to the sniper who truly randomly picks his victims and goes on a terrible killing spree. There is something very uncomfortable and horrendous about it and I'm not even kidding when I say that this is one of the most violent movies I have ever seen purely due to the randomness and pointlessness of all the killings! And I really mean and say this all in a positive way.It besides all gets shot and buildup in a very effective and also realistic way. Director Peter Bogdanovich certainly did a great job handling its tension and it will put you on the edge of your seat and let you hold your breath for a few seconds.It's really surprising how great and original this movie is! I say surprising since this isn't exactly being a movie that is well known anywhere. It makes this a criminal underrated movie that most definitely deserves to be seen by more!810 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The script is very good and the story has many admirable themes that to me are still relevant today. The ending is also very memorable very involving emotionally and structurally.

	schema:reviewBody "Ageing horror actor Byron Orlock Boris Karloff has just finished what will be his final film. The campy nature of the horror films he stars in and the decline in moral society leads him to believe that horror films are no longer scary especially when compared with what is happening in the real world. Young director Sammy Michaels Peter Bogdanovich has just written a great script especially for Orlock and tries to persuade him to rethink his retirement plans on the buildup to Orlock's final public appearance at a drivein for his new movie The Terror. Meanwhile suburban husband and gunobsessive Bobby Thompson Tim O'Kelly is planning a massacre using his sniper rifle starting with his wife and family.As usual when it comes to Roger Corman productions the story behind the film is just as interesting often more so as the film itself. Karloff apparently owed Corman a couple of days work so he was handed to Corman protg Peter Bogdanovich and told him to make whatever film he liked  as long as it was cheap quick included footage of his film The Terror 1963 and drew on the recent Charles Whitman killings. So with the help of screenwriter Samuel Fuller Bogdanovich crafted an intelligent shocking and extremely interesting film that what way ahead of its time.Targets is many things. On one hand it is a warm loveletter to the legendary actors of old. In one scene Michaels enters Orlock's hotel room them both being drunk and watch the end of Howard Hawks' The Criminal Code 1931 which starred a younger Boris Karloff. They briefly discuss the genius of Hawks and Michaels comments on what a fine screen presence Orlock really Karloff was and still is. It is also a firstrate thriller. Tim O'Kelly is very effective as the cleancut allAmerican boy who is becoming increasingly shaken about the person he finds himself becoming. In reallife Whitman was found to have an aggressive brain tumour that was believed to be the cause of the sudden killing spree. The violence though not gratuitous or exploitative is shocking and nasty. The murder scenes are shot with a slow and detailed precision that are scary given the reallife occurrences.Most interestingly the film is a commentary on the generation gap in both society and in cinema. Michaels states that all the great films have already been made. Of course this is not true  America was about to enter its true golden age when the likes of Martin Scorsese Steven Spielberg George Lucas Dennis Hopper Francis Ford Coppola Michael Cimino and Bogdanovich himself shook Hollywood to its core. But Michaels is reflecting Orlock's fear of the new. Orlock is retiring because it's a young person's world and he feels he no longer has his place. The film builds up to the inevitable meeting of Orlock and Thompson  the old vs. the new if you will.Targets is quite hard to sum up. It is genuinely a hidden gem and a true original that should be seen by anyone interested in cinema. Karloff would sadly pass away a year after this film was released and he gives what is possibly his finest career performance. He has no scary makeup or sets to drown him out. He is simply an old man walking stick and all. Although he made a couple more films after this Targets seems his true and fitting exit from cinema. This is close to an 'A'movie that I've seen a Bmovie get and again proves that Roger Corman was a true cinema genius.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

We're never really too sure what it is but there's something. Bogdanovich somehow manages to create this sense of foreboding without ever really giving any hint of anything extraordinary happening. There is something bubbling under the surface. Bobby Thompson played enigmatically by Tim O'Kelly has dinner with his family living with his wife at his parents house drives his car and not much else. He looks a bit bored sometimes but don't we all.We get the first hint of something seriously wrong when Bobby and his Dad James Brown go shooting. Robert Thompson Snr goes to put the cans and bottles they have just been shooting back upright. Meanwhile Bobby aims at his father and tracks him. We see the father through the sights and are not sure what we're looking at. Is this a victim of a practical joke or a man soon to be murdered? When the father sees his son he immediately scolds him and Bobby apologises for fooling around.Bobby kills his mother and then his wife. That's how suddenly the film changes. The murders happen very quickly and without much blood. We are reminded that murder can be very unglamorous banal and often all too normal. Bobby gets his collection of pistols rifles and knives and then embarks on a shooting spree. He shoots at drivers on the freeway from atop a gas tower then at the audience at a drivein from on top of the screen. It also takes a while for the audience and the authorities to realise that someone is shooting and watching the people watching the film totally unaware of Bobby's presence is very unnerving. People die all around us and some struggle wounded from their cars. This is the stuff of nightmares and resonates today especially with recent developments in D.C.The subplot of Boris Karloff's character the retiring Horror film star Byron Orlock is somewhat confusing and could be described by cynics at least as simply a way in which Bogdanovich gets a 'name' associated with the film. However it does work well in so far as the denouement sees the old and world weary Orlock capturing the cowering sniper the old man facing death with dignity whilst the young man goes insane trying to learn how to live.This is a disturbing film that is way ahead of its time and deals with the human condition in a way that many films which came after accomplished but few before ever did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very strange thriller from director Peter Bogdanovich who at this early stage was a green hungry raw new talent in need of both selfcontrol and focus. Bogdanovich who also appears in a small role attempts to correlate the stories of two disparate characters an exsoldier turned sniper and a retiring horrormovie actor Boris Karloff about to make his final publicity appearance at a drivein movie theater. Why these two men should ever cross paths is apparently the key ingredient to what intrigued Bogdanovich to this type of material the irony of it and so forth but he fails to make clear what the violent journey has meant in the end or exactly how Karloff can bring clarity to the mind of this maddog killer. The director seems to be struggling to make a point about the effects of moviefantasy vs. reallife alienation but since this hasn't been much of an issue for twothirds of the picture's length the climactic events are muddled and not all that satisfying. Surely there are some coldly shrewd observations made here most often visually without dialogue displaying Bogdanovich's wildly imaginative director's eye and a skill for storytelling through imagery he also gets a world of help from his gifted cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs. Unfortunately the rudimentary aspects of the reedy plot are clumsily presented and the movie gets off to such a heavyhanded start that one is never sure whether the tone is meant to be satirical farcical or suspenseful. As a lowbudget early effort the film definitely shows promise seen today we are able to gauge just how much growth was necessary on Bogdanovich's partand how much ground he did indeed cover in just a few short years.  from ".

The director seems to be struggling to make a point about the effects of moviefantasy vs. reallife alienation but since this hasn't been much of an issue for twothirds of the picture's length the climactic events are muddled and not all that satisfying. Surely there are some coldly shrewd observations made here most often visually without dialogue displaying Bogdanovich's wildly imaginative director's eye and a skill for storytelling through imagery he also gets a world of help from his gifted cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs. Unfortunately the rudimentary aspects of the reedy plot are clumsily presented and the movie gets off to such a heavyhanded start that one is never sure whether the tone is meant to be satirical farcical or suspenseful. As a lowbudget early effort the film definitely shows promise seen today we are able to gauge just how much growth was necessary on Bogdanovich's partand how much ground he did indeed cover in just a few short years.  from ";

A split story of an aging movie star Karloff wanting to retire and an unhinged sniper Tim O'Kelly going on a shooting rampage. The two stories intersect brilliantly in the film's climax. Watching this you would think the director was an old pro not a novice. Bogdanovich who also acts in the movie and does a surprisingly good job makes the most of the limited budget he was given. He also makes clever use of footage from Karloff's movies The Criminal Code and The Terror. Karloff is fantastic in a role that would be a perfect coda for his career. Yeah he made some more forgettable lowbudget horror movies after this but this is such a perfect final film for him that I prefer to think of it as such. O'Kelly is also good in his only notable film role. It's a remarkable movie that's multilayered and perhaps as timely today as it was then. If you enjoy Karloff then of course it's a mustsee.".

It is obvious enough how these two plotlines will meet though they will lead to a bit of a letdown of a climax. Really this kind of just... stops. The aforementioned is an odd mix anyway and for the explanation we need look no further than how this came to be. Roger Corman approached Peter saying he had to use footage from The Terror and film Boris for two days and then he could do the rest over a few days. He had to figure out how to make the combination work and this is what he came up with. That in mind he did a great job and really the majority of this is welldone. It's pretty wellpaced never leaving you bored. Tension is built wellthe lack of score other than radio works really well it's shot and edited nicely enoughusing guerrilla techniques! And applying tips from Hitchcock and Hawks making it superior to average low budget pieces and it is genuinely funny when it tries to be. Acting is finewell with a couple of standout performances the British gentleman is fantastic and the gunman is memorable. It is exciting effective shocking and honestly does surprise you. The 86 minute running time passes quickly and the details and realism work in its favor. There is a lot of bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with an interesting commentary track and a good 13 and a half minute introduction both by Bogdanovich. I recommend this to fans of thrillers. 810".

Bogdanovich did something unexpected rather than simply working around the existing footage he set his story in the modernday casting Karloff as aging horror star Byron Orlock who is considering retiring from the movie business. Meanwhile a cleancut American kid Tim O'Kelly who looks a bit like Richie Cunningham has just decided to go on a killing spree his crimes modelled on reallife University of Texas sniper Charles Whitman. Bogdanovich's distant clinical approach is genuinely chilling the audience feels little empathy for those fleeing figures in the distance recalling Orson Welles' ferriswheel speech in 'The Third Man 1949' Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever? If I offered you twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stopped would you really old man tell me to keep my money or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spare? Indeed as Bobby Thompson Tim O'Kelly sat atop the oil refinery taking pot shots at passing cars I found myself subconsciously and rather shockingly guiding his aim. Only in the drivein theatre does Bogdanovich bring Bobby's victims into the foreground made all the more shocking because for a time only the audience realises that moviegoers are being silently and bloodily snipered where they sit.The stories of Byron Orlock and Bobby Thompson work for the most part entirely independently but the two threads eventually come together and in a very clever way. Boris Karloff is effectively playing himself the film even including snippets from Hawks' 'The Criminal Code 1931' and Corman's 'The Terror 1963' both reallife films in which Karloff had appeared. His character's dissatisfaction with the moviebusiness stems from a lifetime of playing someone else becoming so closely associated with the horror genre that others have come to define him by his screen persona. Consider Sam Michaels' Peter Bogdanovich reaction to waking up next to Orlock and indeed the actor's own start of surprise at seeing himself in the mirror. That Orlock's persona of horror could overshadow even the truelife evil of Bobby Thompson is a testament to the incredible incalculable power of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "The idea of charttopping 'Genesis' frontman Phil Collins playing the role of notorious eastend Great Train Robber 'Buster' Edwards was enough to put me off this movie for life. I didn't see it until many years after its release and only then by accident on television.I have to say that I owe Mr Collins an apology. If he'd not had so much previous form in the popcharts I'd have hardly recognised him.The socalled Great Train Robbery was the most audacious and successful crimecaper carried out by the biggest team of amateurs in British Criminal history. It naturally suited the authorities of the day to hype them up as a cunning ruthless brigade of experts because it helped draw a veil over their own lax security and profound political embarrassment that the heist engendered. Compared to the vicious homicidal scumbags of today these guys were little more than a bunch of chancers. Notorious BigMan Ronnie Biggs was only involved by invitation as an afterthought. He was a tradesman but this job offered more.It's a lowkey representation of the crime which I suspect more aptly represents the bumbling uneducated behaviour of those involved who simply got very lucky and then became extremely notorious. Collins excels as the workingclass wideboy getting in far too deep and never stopping to consider the broader implications of stopping one of Her Majesty's Mail trains and stealing millions of pounds.His confusion and inability to contend with the juggernaut that follows is entirely believable. Likewise Julie Walters as his longsuffering but doting moll of a wife torn between what the proceeds could offer and her hankering for an ordinary stable family life.The culture clash in Mexico is perfectly realised. Untravelled and untutored English homebodies who have never done anything more exotic than pick winkles on Southend Pier suddenly find themselves in a hot tropical paradise that actually proves to be anything but. They can't have the food and drink they grew up with. Everything is 'foreign'. They don'tunderstand the language the currency they're confused by everything and everyone. Like true Brits abroad they don't adapt well. His wife is first to crack transported away from all of her family and friends the familiar if drab neighbourhoods that now seem like heaven. The cultureclash is finally shattered open when one of their children sickens and they have no idea what to do or say. They can make no sense of the hospital. Their anxiety and confusion is an objectlesson. For 'erindoors' it's the last straw.Eventually stricken with homesickness and with finances depleted Edwards goes back to face the music. The establishment will show no mercy. It's a blatant miscarriage of justice. But it was not the first nor would it be the last.We finally see him at his flower stall much older and little wiser. Edwards was a hapless nobody a smalltime criminal prospector who hit paydirt. The Robbery was the second biggest thing he experienced because it changed his life. His wretched suicide much later was the biggest because that ended it.It's a movie that I found thoroughly entertaining against all expectations and won over a deeplyheld prejudice about popstars taking to an acting career and using their singing status to leapfrog undiscovered strugglers.".

Phil Colins can act although he hasn't really had the chance to show that in very many roles since. The fact that you could pick this movie up free on DVD recently with a newspaper and if you missed that offer can pop into any Poundland in the UK and pick it up for a pound on a double bill with Diamond of Jeru I'd recommend you looking it up...even only if its to hear that great soundtrack again..510".

The robbery itself is dealt with roughly a half hour into the picture. We get no sense of how a small time crook like Bustera man whose main accomplishment seems to be stealing mannequins from shop windowsgot involved with such a major criminal enterprise. Furthermore we only get the vaguest sense of who the planners of the crime were. At times I found myself wishing the film had been about the ringleaders instead.Instead we get over an hour about Buster and his family's time on the run. It isn't particularly interesting and even comes across as repetitive as Buster moves from one hide out to another. Although the strain on his family makes for some touching moments it's not enough to carry the movie.The film's happy ending especially falls flat given the real life Buster Edwards's suicide a few years after the film came out. Seeing Buster walk away with his wife seemingly happy when the real man was actually an alcoholic haunted by personal demons is almost heart breaking.The film's one reason to be remembered is for its soundtrack which features two classic Phil Collins hits. Unfortunately they only appear at the end of the film.".

It supposedly recounts the infamous Great Train Robbery of 1963 from the perspective of Ronald 'Buster' Edwards  probably the most well known participants although not the most important. Just a pity then the planning and execution of 'the job' only takes up about twenty minutes.The remaining running time before and after the Robbery including a fairly lackadaisical police pursuit and the extended holiday in Mexico is a dull kitchen sink drama between Phil Collins and his beloved Julie Walters she's the long suffering wife he's the lovelable rogue heart of gold good family man lives by 'respect' etc.In other words Buster sets the template for any or all of the cheeky chappy Mockney geezers in the endless cycle of runabouts and capers we would see a decade later.Given the level of talent involved the acting is generally quite good  but it could have been better Walters's incessant whinging soon grates Collins isn't bad in the lead role but he doesn't make much of an impact either. The soundtrack is OK but overall I'd say Buster was a bit of a chore to sit through.That the film downplays the violence of the robbery the critical injuries sustained by train driver Jack Mills the threats to Post Office staff and the unsavoury background of the principals  most were professional criminals who did not baulk at using force and were who were aware of the risks of who they were ripping off  caused great contraversy at the time. Sure one or two minor members may have been unjustly sentenced but I'd question how much public sympathy there was for these 'Robin Hoods' when the extent of Mr Mills's ordeal became known.Try Bank Heist Thief The League of Gentlemen or The First Great Train Robbery if you want to see a decent heist movie with a lot more tension and comedy. Compared to these gems Buster is a bit of a letdown.".

This is the true story of Buster Edwards Phil Collins one of the thieves who carried out 1963's Great Train Robbery. He goes into hiding as the police are not letting the case go and arranges his wife June Julie Walters and child Nicky Ellie Beaven to meet him in Mexico along with pal Bruce Reynolds EastEnders' Larry Lamb. It is obvious his wife isn't very happy with their new life and Buster must choose between a paradise life and freedom or his family and possibly prison. Also starring Stephanie Lawrence as Franny Reynolds Michael Attwell as Harry Cape Wrath's Ralph Brown as Ronald 'Ronnie' Biggs Christopher Ellison as George Sheila Hancock as Mrs. Rothery Martin Jarvis as Inspector Jack Mitchell Clive Wood as Sergeant Chalmers Anthony Quayle as Sir James McDowell Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Michael Byrne as Poyser Harold Innocent as Justice Parry Rupert Vansittart as Fairclough John Benfield as Jimmy John Barrard as Walter Carole Collins as Linda and Amy Shindler as Susan. Collins has made songs I like including Against All Odds In The Air Tonight and You Can't Hurry Love if I'd paid full attention I might have seen that he does alright. Maybe also that Walters slightly steals the show but never mind I saw enough of the really likable Lamb as Collins' pal and the story looked okay so I am happy with what I did see for now. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Two Hearts it did win the Golden Globe. Worth watching!".

Sadly the only thing I cold remember of the film is the music and I don't just mean the songs written and performed by Phil Collins the actual score was fantastic and very suited to the movie and is definitely worth remembering. Another shock was how god an actor Phil Collins is. He plays Buster down to a tea and manages to hook you in with his sympathetic but inglorious performance.Buster and his wife June are down on their luck with the life they lead. Buster refuses to go out and make an honest living he only believes in making money the con artist way and this is where the plan comes together for what would be known later as The Great Train Robbery. Not long after the robbery the police are on the hunt for all who took part and its not long before they have everyone in their grasp apart from Buster and his partner in crime Bruce. This makes them both flee to Acapulco with June later joining him. The story isn't anything special its more biographical and just follows what we know about the man himself and it's the starts of the movie Phil Collins and the great Julie Walters that keeps us watching what becomes of these people who we can really relate to.The movie has heartbreaking moments with a Phil Collins catalogue to support it I don't know how anybody can ever say a bad word about the movie because it is flawless but at the same it isn't a masterpiece either. its just a nice film which is very watch able and makes you feel good in the end.".

	schema:headline " Well Made but Glosses Over the Sordid Details";
	schema:reviewBody "Possible SpoilersIn August 1963 a gang of London criminals robbed the Glasgow to London mail train and stole about 2500000 in used banknotes in what became known as 'The Great Train Robbery'. This film tells the story of Ronald 'Buster' Edwards one of the gang not just his part in the robbery but also his life on the run afterwards. Although most of his accomplices were quickly arrested Edwards initially escaped to Mexico but later returned to Britain where he was imprisoned for fifteen years. The film was advertised under the slogan 'He'll steal your heart' and the character portrayed by Phil Collins is if not exactly a lovable character certainly a likable one. Whatever his other faults may be Edwards is shown as a devoted family man and the most important relationship in the film is that between him and his wife June. When he goes to Acapulco to live a life of comparative luxury on the proceeds of his crime June and their young daughter Nicky accompany him. June however loathes life in Mexico where she cannot speak the language and hates the food and returns to England taking Nicky with her. Buster is forced to choose between his family and his freedom as he knows that if he goes back to join them he is likely to be betrayed and arrested. Both the main roles are well played. Phil Collins amply refutes the prejudice that singers cannot act and should not be allowed to try and he receives excellent support from Julie Walters as the narrow insular June quite unable to adapt herself to the culture and lifestyle of any part of the world located more than about two miles from the Elephant and Castle. For nonBritish readers this is a workingclass district of South London. There is also a good deal of nostalgic sixties detail the fashions the flickering blackandwhite televisions the garish geometrically patterned wallpaper and the music. Several pop songs of the era feature on the soundtrack. The Great Train Robbers all received heavy sentences some of thirty years in jail and the film suggests that this was as a result of political interference in the judicial process. This may be true the robbery certainly came as a great embarrassment to Britain's Conservative government. The government prided itself on a strict stance on morality and on law and order but two months previously it had been involved in a major scandal when one of its senior members John Profumo had been forced to resign as a result of sexual impropriety. The punishments doled out to the robbers may have been a way of demonstrating to the nation that the government was winning the fight against crime. Insofar as the film shows that all the robbers were punished for their offence some possibly more severely than they deserved it cannot be said to glamorise crime unlike some fictitious 'heist' movies which show the criminals getting away with it or which like 'The Italian Job' add an artificially moralistic ending to an otherwise amoral film to keep the censor happy. Nevertheless I was still unhappy with the way in which some of the aspects of the robbery were treated in 'Buster'. In the actual robbery the train driver Jack Mills was beaten over the head and seriously injured when he tried to resist the robbers. This incident is omitted from the film. Buster complains that he and his accomplices have been treated more harshly than Profumo was 'for sleeping with a tart who gave all our secrets to the Russians' implying that the authorities are more lenient towards upperclass wrongdoers than towards workingclass ones. In fact Profumo was not charged with any criminal offence and neither he nor his mistress Christine Keeler was ever involved in espionage. The Great Train Robbers may not have been engaged in an 'act of organised banditry' or 'warfare against the community' as a judge said about them in a fine example of judicial hyperbole but neither were they workingclass heroes putting one over on the establishment as the film likes to imply. They were simply petty criminals who got lucky and pulled off a big one.The fictitious Buster Edwards as portrayed by Phil Collins might have been capable of stealing hearts but I doubt if his reallife counterpart was quite so engaging. 'Buster' may not glamorise the life of the criminal but it does I feel gloss over the more sordid aspects of a reallife crime story by turning it into a romantic comedy. As I watched it I felt that if June had really loved Buster she would have tried harder to overcome her aversion to eating chilli con carne rather than fish and chips. And if he had really loved her he would have found a more honest way of earning his living. 710".

	schema:headline " Buuels superb subversive denial of religious ethics";
	schema:reviewBody "Few film directors have worked with the sheer power and subversiveness that Spanishborn Luis Buuel have. Viridiana is one of the best examples of the exiled Spaniard's feelings towards religious faith and its virtues or his strong denial of religion as a virtue. Buuel started out as a Surrealist and although he left the Surrealist Circle of Paris lead by Andr Breton he always kept elements of Surrealism in his work to the bitter end. So too in Viridiana where dreams play a small but important part of the narrative dreams being the Surrealists' main theme as a way of discovering repressed sexuality and aggression. Viridiana is a young nun who is on the grounds of showing human compassion talked into visiting her uncle Don Jaime who is ill. Don Jaime played by Buuel regular Fernando Rey is caring but perverse. He falls in love with his niece and does everything with the help of his maid to keep Viridiana from parting to the convent including lying to her and seducing her while she is trainquilized. I am not going to give away all the events of the film but the corruption of humanity and Christianity are soon evident as Viridiana tries to help poor beggars and give them a worthy life. Her attempts at Christian charity are only met with selfpity and egocentricity as the beggars go on a rampage reminiscient of the last supper of Jesus christ and his disciples. Violence murder gluttony and rape are all included to make a clear picture of the way the beggars have lost their human virtues to the hardship of poverty. We see the events through Viridiana's eyes and everything she goes through suggests a broken belief in the goodness of both human beings and the faith she kept for so long. A masterpiece in revolutionary cinema this film won the Palm d' Or at Cannes in 1961 and the Spanish Board of Film were all fired afterwards as Franco's regime could not quite swallow that Viridiana was the official Spanish contribution to the Festival.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viridiana may be one of the least surreal films in Luis Bunuel's career more than likely but it has perhaps the most acidic satire in any of his 1960s work. It's a film that actually might be a good portal into the director's work for those who haven't seen much or any of his work though one could always vouch for Discreet Charm or Un Chien Andalou first. It's actually got a very straightforward narrative without too many punches pulled in delving into the characters' psyches. We're given the compassionate caring but also very mixedup Viridiana played by Silvia Pinal beautiful and kind but in her ultraCatholic character is someone who cannot be tempted in the least. She is one would suppose the most conventional character and we're just supposed to take for granted in Bunuelian style that she's just like this way. No bother this is a masterpiece of ensemble anyway and an ensemble practically all nonprofessionals it almost seems like Bunuel picked some of them from the same village that provided Las Hurdes. It's bitter and depressing in its view of humanity but it's expertly crafted all the way and it builds towards a tremendous climax.For a while it seems like something very peculiar is going on with Viridiana and her uncle Fernando Rey in only a supporting role but one of his very best performances when he invites her to stay at his home but won't let here leave due to his infatuation with her. Indeed we see in one of the funniest bits early on that he even tries her shoes on and attempts to have his way with her when drugged. But Bunuel's film for the most part isn't necessarily as hilarious in its satire as in his other classics. Actually it's really more of a dramatic effort here which is all the more fascinating to me Bunuel can pull off making what seems at least for 23 of the film to be a sincere look at how a woman makes an attempt to overcome a tragedy in her family Rey's character's end by taking in vagrants and homeless folk and cripples while her 'cousin' takes over the bourgeois duties. On this level Bunuel and his screenwriters have a fantastic control over the mood of scenes and then spiking with little visual details things that just strike his fancy i.e. in the attic with the cat and the rat or the teats on the cow or the crown of thorns....BUT then there's a day when Viridiana has to go into town and those she took in take over the joint so to speak and it makes the nighttime party scene in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest look tame by comparison. This is where finally as if in a rush of clarity Bunuel unleashes the fury of his satire as one sees what the kindness and support that Viridiana tried to do if not out of the genuine goodness of her heart then as just a way to clear her religiously guilty mindset over Rey's Uncle completely reprehensibly backfires. At this point one sees Bunuel at his naughtiest most crude and still as is a given with him playful one of the greatest moments in the filmmaker's career comes when he deliberately sets up the Last Supper for the bums. Then finally one sees a very cruel and almost dehumanizing catharsis but maybe it's not really at the same time. There is a powerful message working through much of the picture where religion class attitudes are all tested in the sense of restrictions how far is too far with temptation and free will? For Bunuel it can be anything which is why the outcome of Viridiana taking in the homeless and destitute becomes her psychological downfall see her hair let down towards the end and her blank drained face at the card table.And yet all through the symbolism that seems ambiguous girl jumping rope and very direct burning of crown of thorns and with the scathing mix of sordid drama and blackasabull comedy Bunuel never loses sight of his vision and Viridiana is a constantly watchable effort with his gracious intuitive camera and his sharp ear for the truth in every character's dialog. Frustrating at times you bet and its sensibilities on human nature and the decisions made make one rethink what it is to be either rich poor or in the middle. But it's also one of the director's best films and a very deserved Golden Palm winner.".

	schema:headline " Buuel's case study on bourgeoisie plight and its underlining cause  having been conditioned to live under the influence of false and misconstrued religious beliefs";
	schema:reviewBody "Regardless of the inhibitions that it may engender it's always a matter of great cachet and honor to review the work of a virtuoso like Luis Buuel. Calling Buuel merely a moviemaker would not only be an understatement but also an invidious remark. Buuel was a pioneer in every sense of the word and his works avant garde and highly influential. He is regarded as the father of surrealism in cinema and his predilection for the morbid and the obscure had earned him the tag of a 'fetishist'. Buuel's directorial debut Un Chien Andalou a prototypical work on Surrealism is a living example of Buuel's vision and imaginative genius as a moviemaker and more importantly as a student of cinema. Buuel was averse to explaining or promoting his work and ironically his surrealist works are so personal distinctive and elaborative in style and manner that no one but Buuel was worthy of judging or explaining them. Fortunately for me the first Buuel movie that I have ventured to review does not deal with surrealism. Viridinia is a story of a young nun whose inexorable resolve for redemption ironically takes her to the brink of moral corruption. Viridinia revolves around bourgeois middle class modus vivendi and deals with controversial themes of gluttony blasphemy and adultery which have been an integral part of Buuelesque oeuvre. Buuel was a staunch maverick and fittingly his iconoclastic works relentlessly flouted the bourgeois morals and the very root cause of bourgeoisie plight  the conservatism and hypocrisy camouflaged in the preaching of Catholicism and Christianity. Viridiana not only stands equal to the task of mocking organized religion and hypocrisies associated with it but just like other Buuel works also manages to bring in a humanistic element with a somber yet sensual touch. The questions that Buuel manages to pose through Viridiana are so straight and naked that even a saint of divine proportions or a champion of human rights will not only look askance in want of candor but will also be forced to squeal in ghastly terror while trying to answer them. Such was the impact of Viridiana on the The Roman Catholic Church that the Vatican's official newspaper published an article calling Viridiana an insult to Catholicism and Christianity. The movie was banned in Spain and all its prints were destroyed as per the orders of the Spanish autocrat Francisco Franco. These exaggerated responses were clearly not responsive of the subject material that Viridiana showcased but were the mere consequences of the questions it posed and the answers that it demanded.Viridiana is a young nun on the verge of taking her final vows. She is asked by her Mother Superior to pay a visit to her estranged uncle Don Jaime who has repeatedly expressed his keenness to meet Viridiana. She remembers that her uncle was never there for her whenever she had needed his support. Despite the absence of an emotional urge she decides to pay him a visit simply out of courtesy. Don Jamie is a recluse rotting in the abject solitude of widowhood which is making him more vulnerable and desperate with each passing day. Upon meeting his nubile niece he notices a striking resemblance to his deceased wife. This ray of hope reinvigorates a new sense of purpose in his life as he decides to put forth a marriage proposal in front of Viridiana. He implores her to wear his wife's wedding dress which she reluctantly obliges. When his maid Ramona informs Viridiana of his intent to marry her she is appalled and Don Jaime appears to have dropped the idea. However Ramona secretly drugs Viridiana drink and Don Jamie carries the unconscious Viridiana to her room with the intention of raping her but falls short of doing the ignominious. The next morning he bluffs that he has made her his and hence she is no longer pure enough to return to the convent. Seeing her undeterred he concedes the truth but fails in convincing her fully. Viridiana immediately leaves for the convent but at the bus stop the authorities reveal her that Don Jamie has committed suicide and has left his entire property to her and his illegitimate son Jorge. Deeply disturbed Viridiana decides not to return to the convent. Instead as an act of penance she brings home an assemblage of beggars and devotes herself to the moral education and feeding of this underprivileged lot. The things become a bit more complicated on the arrival of Jorge who shows a strong inclination for Viridiana. What ensues is a series of amazingly bizarre yet poetic sequences which can best be cherished through viewing rather than description. The penultimate scene depicts the beggars posing for a photo sans camera around the table in which they seem to collectively resemble the figures in Da Vinci's Last Supper a chair substitutes for the door which now cuts into the fresco and removes Christ's feet. This scene in particular earned the film the Vatican's opprobrium. The controversial finale adds a completely different dimension to Viridiana elevating it to new levels of cognitive interpretation. In a nutshell Viridiana is a truly fascinating cinematic experience catapulted to new heights of magnificence by Buuel's mastery and his unflinching ability to depict the sad and abysmal reality of living under the influence of false and misconstrued religious tenets. Viridiana along with The Diary of a Chamber Maid 1964 are great means of acquainting oneself with Buuel's oeuvre and can serve as an excellent mock exercise to prepare oneself before exploring Buuel's exceedingly challenging surrealistic works. 1010httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:headline " Buuelesque Extravaganza";
	schema:reviewBody "Forty years on and Viridiana' is one of the very few almost unique examples of classical Spanish cinema to have survived the turmoil of the latter half of the last century. It remains as a little light in the midst of the darkness of the Franco Rgime which promptly banned it or as an insouciance to the Vatican which promptly excomulgated everyone concerned with it.Buuel's genius is apparent in every frame the eye for detail nonetheless permitting that impromptu evanesqueness which lends exquisiteness to these memorable scenes above which shines the Last Supper'. And it is precisely this scene which gives one the impression that the real stars in the making of this film were the motley beggars taken in from the streets. Silvia Pinal and Francisco Paco' Rabal are not outstanding in this piece even the incomparable Fernando Rey is overshadowed by the band of social outcasts. The sheer poeticness so brilliantly captured by the camera roaming among the vagabonds is cinematographic exquisiteness carried to its extreme every grimace every wrinkled nose the debauchery is what makes the principal actors be no such thing but secondary actors overwhelmed by the nuances and gestures of these untouchables.

	onyx:emotionText "Forty years on and Viridiana' is one of the very few almost unique examples of classical Spanish cinema to have survived the turmoil of the latter half of the last century. It remains as a little light in the midst of the darkness of the Franco Rgime which promptly banned it or as an insouciance to the Vatican which promptly excomulgated everyone concerned with it.Buuel's genius is apparent in every frame the eye for detail nonetheless permitting that impromptu evanesqueness which lends exquisiteness to these memorable scenes above which shines the Last Supper'. And it is precisely this scene which gives one the impression that the real stars in the making of this film were the motley beggars taken in from the streets. Silvia Pinal and Francisco Paco' Rabal are not outstanding in this piece even the incomparable Fernando Rey is overshadowed by the band of social outcasts. The sheer poeticness so brilliantly captured by the camera roaming among the vagabonds is cinematographic exquisiteness carried to its extreme every grimace every wrinkled nose the debauchery is what makes the principal actors be no such thing but secondary actors overwhelmed by the nuances and gestures of these untouchables. Brilliant filming indeed  whether intentional or not or whether this be only my personal interpretation after seeing this film three times in the last twenty five years is of course open to debate.

	schema:reviewBody "There will never be anyone like him. Since he shocked audiences with his extremely subversive Surrealist film L'AGE D'OR which showed a Christlike figure emerging from 120 days of unimaginable debauchery in a remote castle looking oddly sensual and sexually free he's gone hand in hand with poking fun at those who believe in God in the Church and the privileged.Due to his personal political and religious beliefs he was a staunch atheist he had been selfimposed to exile with the rise of Francisco Franco who from the midThirties onward threw Spain into a period of repression and stagnant evolution a situation common and typical of nations under a dictatorship. Bunuel's later success in the country who came to adopt him as one of its own  Mexico  brought Spain's eye focusing straight into Bunuel's and Franco decided that maybe Bunuel could be make a movie to his own liking. After all Spain wasn't yet known for having a strong cinematic presence until then despite the San Sebastian Film Festival and it could use all the help it could get. Bunuel up until then was Spain's main exponent of intelligent cinema even in his for hire and less controversial movies from his Fifties period which at their most Neorealist always had hints of his fondness for Surrealism.Would it that Franco had an inkling of what Bunuel one of the strongest most stubborn personalities from the past century whom I admire had in store as the ultimate rabbit trick. Bunuel grudgingly returned to Spain under the advice and financing of Gustavo Alatriste and produced one of the most scathing attacks on Catholicism yet the story of Sor Viridiana the great Silvia Pinal blond and detached in that Hitchcockianblond way making her debasement the more fun the nun who is so devout you want to whack her in the head with a frying pan who returns to her homestead where her uncle Fernando Rey lives and finds that she's up against some interesting opposition and a systematic stripping away at her own faith. First with the assistance of his faithful but slightly amoral maid Ramona Margarita Lozano he decides to drug Viridiana and blackmail her into staying at his house after seeing how similar she looks to his deceased wife and perversely enjoying how she looks in his dead wife's wedding gown. While he stops short of raping her in her sleep he isn't above telling her she can't leave because they've had sex. Viridiana horrified decides to leave even when he tells her he lied. Of course in typical Bunuel style he interrupts her attempt at escape kills off the uncle and has her return to the house.An action interrupted has always been present in Bunuel's work. In THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE it's the simple act of eating and socializing. In THAT OBSCURE OBJECT OF DESIRE and BELLE DE JOUR it's intimacy with a loved one. Here it's not only the return to the safety of religion but altruism as well. Viridiana now the mistress of the house has to share it with her cousin Jorge Francisco Rabal a man serving as Bunuel's doppelganger as a pragmatic man who believes only hard work will pull the country out of the muck it's in. She takes in the homeless the disabled and the poor giving them food and places to sleep and their daily prayers. Jorge has other plans. In a wicked sequence Viridiana gathers the homeless into prayer as workers steadfastly go around their duties. Bunuel cuts from her glowing blissful face to the dirty activity around the construction. It's almost as if Bunuel were saying It's not us interrupting your prayers  you're the ones who aren't doing anything. You're in the way of our daily work. Parallel to this a poignant scene where Jorge shows his humanity towards a dog who is walking under a cart tied which he rescues from its fate. Watch as not a minute after he's purchased the dog from its cruel owners another cart trudges by with a dog tied to its underbelly. The cycle of casual cruelty won't stop.The taking in of the beggars proves to be Viridiana's undoing. While she and the entire household are out the beggars take control of the house set up a mock dinner party that spins out of control which Bunuel films as a reverse Last Supper with the ultimate act of sabotage thrown at it as a woman lifts up her skirt to the camera. While regaining control of the house won't be an easy task  Viridiana is nearly raped again but saved by Jorge who is able to manipulate one of the homeless men into releasing him  it's clear that Viridiana's actions coming from a misguided good place have almost destroyed a generation's worth of tradition in the form of a household. Because Jorge is the character who emerges as the strongest with his knowledge of how to run an estate he represents the future of Spain and in having Jorge Viridiana and Ramona faithful to the end wind up playing cards in an intellectual threesome the movie hits its mark in effectively killing religion in favor of the practical matters further seen when a little girl without knowing burns the cross of thorns Viridiana used when she would go into her excruciating prayers as a nun.A brilliant movie possibly one of the most significant of last century one that smeared Spain's upper class society as it did the Church and the one that got denounced by the Vatican as if that would matter.".

	schema:headline " That Obscure Object of Desire meets Nazarin";
	schema:reviewBody "The controversial satire was banned by the Spanish government for obscenity and blasphemy after it had received the Golden Palm at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. Viridiana is a young nun Mexican actress Silvia Penal who is assigned by her mother superior to visit her widowed uncle Don Jaime Fernando Rey on his farm just before taking her final vows. Viridiana reluctantly agrees to meet with her uncle whom she never knew but who has supported her financially all these years. Don Jaime is obsessed by her cool virginal blond beauty and he sees her as reincarnation of his bride who died thirty years ago on their wedding night. Jaime begs Viridaina to don her aunt's wedding dress after which he drugs her with the intention to corrupt her. What Don Jaime does is unspeakable. He represents in the film the decadent old aristocracy but nothing is that simple and obvious in Bunuel's films. Bunuel gives some of his own sexual fantasies fetishes and dreams that he freely admits to Don Jaime thus making him more human. Viridiana winds up as a farm owner along with her uncle's illegitimate son Jorge Francisco Rabal humble and spiritual Nazarin of Nazarin here plays absolutely different man. Viridiana following the great traditions of mad Spaniards originated by Cervantes and continued by Nazarin takes seriously great ideas and tries to live accordingly when she attempts to make the farm a heaven for local homeless beggars. They pay her back for her kindness and care by throwing the wild party inside the house during her absence that culminates in making the funniest life caricature of Da Vinci's the Last Supper I've ever seen and by attempting to rape her when she comes back earlier than expected. Viridiana is a woman of virtue but all her good intentions lead nowhere. I am not surprised that the film was banned and all copies were ordered to be destroyed Silvia Penal in her interview recalls the dramatic story of two copies of the film that were saved and buried so they could wait for the better times I am surprised how Bunuel was able to make this super dark dramedy about the inability of the Catholic Church to deal with the realities of the world at all in his native Spain when Franco was still in power. Technically Viridiana is a perfect film odd and enigmatic behind the seeming simplicity. It's power lays not in the set decorations stunning locations or the colorful costumes but in a way people interact. When asked what were his ideas behind his films Bunuel answered I have no ideas it is all instinct.It took 17 years to bring Viridiana home to Spain where it was first shown at the theaters in 1977. It took another 29 years to transfer it to Criterion DVD. Now it is available with several interesting bonus features that include interview with Silvia Penal from 2006 an interview with Richard Norton the Cineaste editor and the best one the parts of the film about Bunuel that was made back in 60th and the man in the documentary is as enigmatic odd charming brilliant and sinister as his films are. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "The controversial satire was banned by the Spanish government for obscenity and blasphemy after it had received the Golden Palm at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. Viridiana is a young nun Mexican actress Silvia Penal who is assigned by her mother superior to visit her widowed uncle Don Jaime Fernando Rey on his farm just before taking her final vows. Viridiana reluctantly agrees to meet with her uncle whom she never knew but who has supported her financially all these years. Don Jaime is obsessed by her cool virginal blond beauty and he sees her as reincarnation of his bride who died thirty years ago on their wedding night. Jaime begs Viridaina to don her aunt's wedding dress after which he drugs her with the intention to corrupt her. What Don Jaime does is unspeakable. He represents in the film the decadent old aristocracy but nothing is that simple and obvious in Bunuel's films. Bunuel gives some of his own sexual fantasies fetishes and dreams that he freely admits to Don Jaime thus making him more human. Viridiana winds up as a farm owner along with her uncle's illegitimate son Jorge Francisco Rabal humble and spiritual Nazarin of Nazarin here plays absolutely different man.

The rich in this film know how to control their subversive tendencies because they are taught how to handle their position their money and simply their manners.  The poor and disabled are naively given opportunities and gradually make an unbelievable mess of it without ever considering the moral implications of their actions.  Viridiana is the kind soul who makes the naive mistakes like helping the beggars in the wrong way.Although this is the great Fernando Rey's French Connection Cet obscur objet du dsir and here speaking Spanish first and shortest collaboration with Buuel it must be his most convincing performance.  His character Don Jaime morally blackmails Viridiana accompanied by psalms.  This delicately illustrates Buuel's loathing of churches and convents where Viridiana lived that cannot prevent people from their sexual desires.  A contrast is made with the beggars later in the film who listen to Hndel Beethoven and Mozart without properly hearing what it is but have fun and unfortunately take advantage of their newly acquired personal wealth.The surrealism and magic realism will be presented again by Buuel in later years after 1966 and also in ngel exterminador 1962 but this film is one of Buuel's subtlest and best acted and has a clear message without being superficial or pedantic.  To what extent it is a parody on The Last Supper I don't know and also I can't figure out what this somnambulism also in Tristana '70 should mean in religious terms.  But Buuel and cinematographer Jose F. Aguayo also Tristana delivered a worthy film that may be Buuel's least outrageous but most realistic and aesthetically perfected film.  'Journal d'une femme de chambre' Buuel 1964 is one film that comes close to that.  Also 'Charme discret de la bourgeoisie' and 'ngel exterminador' seem to deal with a Last Supper in their own brilliant way.910".

	schema:reviewBody "The criticism of intent is a killer on bad films that have no real depth and do not last a few years beyond their intent's purpose. Such was reemphasized to me watching Spanish filmmaker Luis Buuel's vastly overrated black and white 1961 'shock classic' Viridiana. Of course all the alleged shock value had to do with Buuel's puerile attempts to poke fun at and scandalize both the Roman Catholic Church and the regime of Fascist dictator Francisco Franco and nearly five decades later it looks more like a college prank video than any serious cinema. Furthermore it is not in the least bit subversive as many poor critics claim because its criticism of the Church especially and even then was so manifest as to make one wonder if those who claimed it had subversive qualities even knew what the term meant.Of course given Buuel's start as a Surrealist superstar that overused and often misapplied term it's no surprise that much of his filmic career would be seen through such a pretentious lens especially by fans masquing as critics rather than dealing with the individual films and whether they fail or not. The fact is while Viridiana is a reasonably capably made film on a technical level although there is no standout cinematography musical scoring nor interesting visual compositions it fails because its screenplay is abysmal. As in other 'classics' of his whose luster has faded think Belle De Jour Viridiana is larded with cardboard characters caricatures and outright stereotypes that are bad enough alone but given that they are not put to any truly subversive use makes them all the more a wasted effort. They also suggest the paper thin grasp of reality especially the political sort that die hard Leftists like him are often represented as having making him the biggest unintended caricature of all those associated with the film.Yes Buuel is not as pretentious and lacking in filmic basics as that other Surreal fraud Jean Cocteau so what? That doesn't make Buuel a Master not even close despite all the praise tossed his way. Viridiana fails not for a huge error or two but for an unending string of little wrong and inane things such as ridiculous symbolism Viridiana sleepwalks and tosses ashes into Jaime's bed and a film that moves far too quickly and gives no real insight into anything especially its characters. For ellipses to work they must be deployed within welldefined characterization so that viewers can reasonably extrapolate the elided events. Without that the missing elements shortchange both the tale and the characters.Furthermore the film's criticism of Roman Catholicism is absolutely depthless it has been done before and since and done better. There is no intellectual rigor nor a hint of poesy. The political intent overwhelms the minuscule art. And without real characters who gives a damn what is intended? The exercise is rendered pointless by its own incompetence something that haunts most of the Buuel canon which may explain why Viridiana film and character have such vacancies in their gazes.".

What Bunuel did was to bite the hand that fed him all the way to the shoulder blade. Viridiana is virulently antiCatholic some felt to the point of blasphemy and it's imagery proved shocking way beyond the point of forgiveness. Like all great works of art the film still shocks today so forceful is Bunuel's message.The storyline is simplicity itself. A young novice is asked by her uncle to visit him at his chteau before taking her final vows and entering the convent. Consumed by lust at her resemblance to his late wife he drugs her with the intention of raping her but then can't go through with it. Nevertheless he tells her that he did and subsequently hangs himself. Feeling she has been violated the novice renounces her vows but moves into her uncle's house determined to devote her life to helping the poor and flagellating herself to atone for what she sees as her sins. The film culminates in one of the most extraordinary sequences in all of cinema as the beggars she has taken in pillage the house and finally rape her in a mock reenactment of Da Vinci's 'Last Supper' to the strains of the Alleluia Chorus.All of this of course proved much too much for the conservative staunchly Catholic regime who promptly had the film banned and had they had their way would have had all prints destroyed. Whether or not they recognized it as a devastating satire of Swiftian proportions viciously barbed and often very funny is debatable. Facists are conspicuous by their lack of a sense of humour. Regardless it sealed Bunuel's fate in Spain for the rest of Franco's reign and marked the beginning of one of his most productive periods though he was never again to reach the inspired heights he reached here. I doubt if any film made since has surpassed it.".

They are the most degenerate lot of beggars fornicators and thieves she could have put together. They are in no way appreciate of her help and end up trashing the house in a drunken bacchanal.Meanwhile the illegitimate son of the uncle is reveling in his new good fortune by kicking out his girlfriend and making moves on Viridiana. After she sees that her efforts at charity are useless translation if first you don't succeed then quit she resigns herself to probable mnage  trois with the cousin and the maid.Depressing and dated it is not one I would recommend. Buuel has done so many better films.";

It has a much sense as making a movie about an atheist who at the end gets hit by a truck and having creator at the end jump out and yell See? See? This is why atheism is wrong Im sorry Mr. Buuel I love you but that's barley a reasonable argument if not childish and I find the scene of burning Jesus crown depsite of very strong symbolism in a pretty poor taste. It's still a very interesting and well put together movie to watch even if not good as some other of Buuel's work.

	schema:headline " Despite being brought back specifically to make a Spanish film Buuel just lets loose and tears into everyone and everything.";
	schema:reviewBody "Viridiana's recent BBFC classification was a '15' certificate rendering it mature enough only for anyone over the age of 15. I suppose that is a true testament as to how well Viridiana has held up over the decades the fact a film from the early 1960s when censorship was not as relaxed as it is now can get rereleased and still get slapped with a censorship rating on par with stuff like the second Terminator film and Saving Private Ryan. Even the director's own 1950 film entitled Los Olvidados got a '12' certificate in 2007 a film that I would consider a tad more disturbing than Viridiana. Such is the power I suppose and such is the controversy Viridiana still carries  a film that was banned in Spain until 1977 when the last remnants of Franco's reign as Spain's ruler was occurring but additionally disowned by the Vatican church.But Francisco Franco was never a big fan of Luis Buuel anyway to the point Buuel had to flee the country. Viridiana was one of only very few films Buuel ever made in Spain but it was hated enough by said agents to get it banned and loved enough by others for it to win the 1961 Palme d'Or in Cannes. The film itself with all this aura and history is a curious beast. It's a film that makes great use of certain filmic 'spaces' and studies them accordingly a film that dips in and out of horror great melodrama and taboo romance whilst having it all play out within a very ominous and large Gothic house that consistently houses some really rather slimy characters.It is Buuel's attack on religion in general that attracted most of the criticisms although at the very core of the film is a young and very religious character whose name is of the title that being Viridiana Pinal. As a nun it's the tearing out of the religious space she should be inhabiting and putting her through an emotional grinder that attracts the early attention a rendering her of the 'everyday' type  an event that forces her to drop her religious life and place her someplace else that raises the most eyebrows. The girl in question is Viridiana a young female nun visiting her uncle in a remote manor house in rural Spain. The uncle is Don Jaime Rey a man who when taking about the house in which he lives in mentions its overgrown grounds and uncleaned interior in the same casual breath as he does loneliness and potential mental illness. It is not down to bad acting or bad delivery it is a sly inclusion of something as trivial as unkept grounds mixed in with heartfelt confessions of a man near to suicide.Part of the mind games in Viridiana is its establishing of a central character in Don Jaime before branching out into something else altogether. The eeriness and disturbance of Don Jaime's actions builds in a neat but very unnerving hierarchy mentioning that she looks like what his wife looked like before she died before trying to convince her to try on the wedding dress she wore the day they were married during which you can see the lust in Jaime's face as he asks her. What follows is a marriage proposal before an attempted escape on Viridiana's behalf and then the supposed rape of Viridiana.Naturally she leaves utterly disgusted but is forced to return to the manor house upon news of Don Jaime's fate. From here the film opens up into something else  it becomes a film where Viridiana runs the house with Don Jaime's son Jorge Ribal and his own partner named Lucia Zinny. Viridiana in a kind state of mind offers several poor and diseased people the chance to live on the grounds as well but not in the house. Later on though these poor people will inhabit the house. It is a haunting passage of events during which they are inhabiting a space unbeknown to them a rich space in which the poor are now at home in. I could pluck some wild examples out of the air in regards to 'rich' spaces being inhabited by those we do not expect to see inhabiting them anything from a particular episode of television show The Simpsons in which two carnival workers squat in the family of the show's title's home to 2005 Bruce Willis vehicle 'Hostage' in which three individuals established to be of a poorer variety take over a postmodern cliffside villa.Both these examples as well as Viridiana carry a certain menace to them the predicament that things are where they don't belong and are running free without rules. This resides when you watch Viridiana. I wouldn't say the predicaments were 'uncanny' in any way but they carry a fascinating ingredient this side of menace. It is additionally during this segment the infamous 'Last Supper' scene is played out as these filthy individuals reenact the famous painting and play the roles of the disciples as well as Jesus himself. Just like in said examples the poor in Viridiana examine the tables and exquisite furniture in the house they touch the table clothes and poke around  alienated and confused but with their curiosity aroused all the same. The finale to Viridiana is a further jolt out of the blue a desperate situation that needs to be resolved very quickly and quite brutally. As an historic piece Viridina works wonders and as a piece by itself it is equally fascinating.".

	schema:reviewBody "In many ways Buuel's nontraditional cinema adheres to Mulvey's theory of the male gaze and the female image. However one must also consider that Buuel does not seem to be subconsciously adhering to this traditional practice but instead building sequences and later in his career entire films upon this idea. In Un Chien Andalou the female character is at one point treated as an object of lust by the cyclist. In Los Olvidados Jaibo takes the same stance concerning Pedro's mother as does Viridiana's uncle toward Viridiana in Viridiana most of the male characters in Diary of a Chambermaid toward Celestine and all of That Obscure Object of Desire chronicles Mathieu's search to attain his unattainable object of desire Conchita. Female characters are often put on display but not for the same purposes as for example Mulvey's performing woman. Buuel's lens is intrusive and voyeuristic but is so often placed their under the guise of a voyeuristic character the milk dripped on Meche's legs seen by Jaibo the drugged Viridiana taken advantage of by Don Jaime observed by the maid's daughter and several scenes in That Obscure Object of Desire which interestingly enough focuses more on Mathieu the voyeur than what he is seeing. In terms of how Buuelian male characters exercise their pleasure phallically penetratively and sadistically many Sadelike situations are set up in his early films the forced fondling in Un Chien Andalou Don Jaime's possible rape of the drugged Viridiana and L'Age d'Or's climax plays out Sade's 120 Days of Sodom with Christ as the head of the libertines. In a way Buuel adhered to these traditional gender depictions but he did it in such a selfreflexive and shockingly novel way that instead of merely presenting female images for a voyeuristic audience he makes a commentary on these images and the nature of voyeurism itself forcing us to confront it rather than simply watching.Tying into these ideas is psychoanalytic film theory Mulvey claims that films are linked to the perspective and ideology of the director. In terms of Buuel one cannot really say that his films exemplify this model as practically everything in Buuel's films is subversive. One cannot say that Buuel's ideologies are inherently linked to what the camera shows us as contradictions abound in Los Olvidados and Land Without Bread questions are raised but no definitive answers given. In films like Viridiana and Diary of a Chambermaid society is seemingly condemned. L'Age d'Or and The Phantom of Liberty include social commentaries but are for the most part injected with surrealistic silliness. How can we say that Buuel's films are intrinsically linked to Buuel's ideology? We cannot therefore we must view Buuel as a subversive innovator one who may have adhered to certain cinematic norms but twisted others in directions that could not be any further from the status quo.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry Buuel fans I know comparisons are odious but if I had to pick the definitive Maestro between him and Fellini I'd say Fellini without a doubt. And Viridiana gives me the best arguments. Let's face it this is a dated movie hardly a classic. The raw value of a classic is above all its resilience to time and V. doesn't do well through that test even more considering that its lasting value comes from that slap in the face to Franco and from a rather gratuitous blasphemy scene. Also the movie is not the fruit of an unique stroke of creative genius but instead a work with sources of inspiration in two traditional Hispano American cultural creatures.Most Buuel reviewers fail to recognize where he gets his real sources and influences. For ex. they say of Phantasm that it got no structure when the fact it has one that of a novela picaresca a genre born in Spain in 1554. The protagonist of the N.P. is usually a man born in the lowest strata of societygen. an orphanwho grew up having to endure numerous hardships under the yoke of cruel miserable masters including assorted clerics and blind men. Structurally a NP is a sequence of short unrelated stories their only common link being the picaro its protagonist. About Phantasm Buuel himself said once that his initial idea was to use one single character as the link so I'll rest my case there. You can do further research but let's just say the mood of a NP is usually ugly one of utter disenchantment even if the picaro tries to keep a brave face when telling his storybecause he's also the narratorspicing it up with dark humor. For ex. in Lazarillo de Tormes the essential NP the way he got rid of his blind masterhe sayswas to put the man in front of a post telling him there was an irrigation ditch in the way so he had to jump as far as he couldso you can see there the traditional inspiration for the ugliness and cruelty of the beggars here. The other traditional source which inspires the first part of the movie is Hispano American melodrama mostly Mexican and Spanish.Contrary to North American melodrama which focuses on intrigue plot twists clash of personalities Iberoamerican melodrama is corny sappy and it focuses mainly in getting the waterworks going. One plot line that was used and abused for decades was for ex. that of the poor woman who gives birth to and illegitimate child who is then taken away and given in adoption to a rich family. Decades later the still poor woman goes to work as a maid in a wealthy household and guess what...You got it the master of the house is her lost son. So when the last episode comes out their coming together there's no one single handkerchief to be found in the whole city.The main character here comes right out of Hispanic melodrama that's why I don't like it specially when Pinal overdoes the virginal vestal. It is as if once given her marching orders she would have switched herself to make for the sappiest soap opera heroine. Come on I've known girls like that but never one like her. In real life they usually lose that innocence as soon as they step out of the convent. Viridiana is unrealistic a caricature no wonder the movie seems to become real only once the beggars are left alone. It would have been better if Buuel had thought of her as just another down to earth character but it seems he was bent on keeping her above the crowd as some kind of a metaphor. Of a Spain torn between its traditional forces maybethe Church and a decaying land aristocracybut I fail to see there in what Arrabal's Jorge can be compared to Franco. Franco wasn't a urban liberal at all but an ultra conservative uber traditionalist dictator and war criminal. That's also why returning to Viridiana I prefer actresses from outside doing Hispanic heroines when it comes to melodrama. Hispanic actresses can be good at comedy satireas Pinal certainly is in Simon and Exterminating Angelbut when it comes to melodrama they seem genetically programmed to ham it up to tune themselves to get the audience's waterworks going full blast or else they may think they have failed.So while Fellini was instrumental in giving birth to a new film genre Italian neorealism and then went to create his own universeFellinesque we call itwhere the characters born of his own fruitful imagination memories could evolve at ease there's no such equivalent in Buuel's work. Buuel got propelled into surrealism in his association with Dali of course but he is more apt at showing his philosophy of lifehis disenchantment with mankind and its pathetic attempts to reach the transcendental its habit of debasing everything it touches his own amazement at the weirdness of the situations we find ourselves many times in lifeand also at bringing memories and dreams to the screen he was more apt at that than at creating a new universe where his own characters could live and evolveas Kafka did in literature and Fellini in movies. That's why many Fellinis are timeless I could watch them many times over while quite a few Buuels are already irremediably dated as Viridiana. I say 6.510 of interest mostly for film students and Buuel fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Buuel didn't intend Viridiana to be sacrilegious. Just an uncompromising view of a world that can't be saved. The film's quite unmistakably partitioned into two halves. The first half begins with the eponymous young woman played by the stunningly beautiful young Silvia Pinal with a marble sheen of purity and innocence and the depth of an alltoorelatable psychosomatic susceptibility to all that act upon her such as her unpredictable uncle played with offputting sincerity by Fernando Rey whose tragic selfdelusion causes him to fetishistically associate Viridiana with his late wife. Much like The Virgin Spring another religiously themed 1961 masterpiece Viridiana's journey is portrayed so serenely sensually and gracefully that when we face incredibly powerful uncomfortable or enigmatic moments we haven't even seen them coming and when we have they've already pounced on us. With every quality of every production specialty the effect is sheer simplicity no instability despite whatever viciousness or emotional tremors making them all that much more inherently poignant.That's vital to its thematic consistency as well as its sensory impact. There is a scene near the convergence of the two acts that involves an intended rape foiled by guilt a tormented attempt at blackmail that results in a muddle of confessions and guiltridden fabrications and ultimately an offense taken so deeply that even a figure of such pious naivete and selfpunishing reverence cannot grant forgiveness. Offense and forgiveness seem to be the film's central preoccupation embodied by wellintentioned people illequipped for life. Throughout the second half Viridiana instigates goingson brought about by her feeling of guilt one detached from any methodological or ceremonial sense.This half explores Bunuel's commitment to change as Viridiana gathers a group of local vagabonds to care for and shelter on the uncle's estate a daunting blind man a scuttling jester a woman with two babies a pregnant woman a gimp a prominentseeming old guy from another sort of movie a singer a dwarf and a leper. The drifters epitomize an array of human potential that Buuel wants neither to reject nor commemorate but to challenge which is why the film despite the dismay of several of its moments and the devastating chaos of its later scenes is invigorating instead of just disheartened or dismal. What we are seeing is both horrible and droll and we're the better for not having turned away.The film's thoughtful and measured. It's gracefully shot each image communicating something distinct and particular which is to be anticipated from an alleged fetishist. It makes no patent clearcut assertion but rather delivers Buuel's view that our animal natures are invariably waiting to spring. The lecherous uncle is not portrayed as a horrible man as much as a forlorn and despondent one who longs to indulge a sin but lacks the required impropriety. Nor is the eponymous nun's cousin a lecher nor is she a fallen women and the beggars merely act as they've been acclimatized by the social order.Left with the estate to themselves for a day the tramps search the main house eyeball the paintings the linen the silver and opt to have a banquet. In a magnificently cynical cut Buuel goes right from an early moment of this searching to a late point of the feast the main course demolished bottles everywhere and everyone inebriated. One of the babies cries two women have an atrocious wrestle the leper puts on Handel's Hallelujah Chorus to which a succession of small subsequent actions lead to utter chaos. The screenplay possibly suggesting the sensation instead of the reality mentions carnage and an absurd orgy. In the film's most notorious moment everyone assembles along one side of the table for a photograph of a scene that unmistakably mimics The Last Supper.It's very likely that Bunuel knew more about irreverence than the pope did. But the sacrilege is not hostile to God and Jesus. It's against the trust in improvement at least in its traditional implications whether in the guise of a character's ideas for civilizing the estate or of Viridiana's mission to enrich the vagabonds' lives. The beggars are not vile or evil. They're the disorder of life itself a keepsake that bliss curiosity and desire can at any time resort to devastation and brutality. This is not an case against those unquestionably positive things or an demand for rules and doctrine. It's a portrait of a civilization that doesn't value its own needs. Buuel's cynicism and indignation embroil the miniaturization of our idea of change and improvement our limited efforts to reach it through reasonable or didactic preparation and our eager contempt for the disorderly influences without which no civilization would be human.To me the most special and important scene in this film is not entrenched in religious controversy but in the hopelessness of existence and it encapsulates Buuel's view of life It's the scene with the dog tied to moving carts by ropes that'd choke it if it stops hurrying. Viridiana's cousin buys it to save it from its running distress yet he doesn't see as he turns away another cart with another bound dog coming the other way. This is the man who's about to disparage Viridiana for her endeavors at generosity. A film like this is invigorating. It's helmed by a sharp idiosyncratic brain. It's not another reductive rendering of reassuring feelgood fabrications. All the time there's another cart and another dog bound to it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's no wonder that Spanish surrealist Luis Bunuel made most of his films and Mexico and France they were probably the only countries at the time tolerant enough for his brand of weirdness. Seeing his movies you see where the producers of The Addams Family got their inspiration like his compatriot Goya Bunuel has a taste for Gothic horror and the kind of monsters the sleep of reason produces. Viridiana was made in Spain with Mexican money and a Mexican star Sylvia Pinal. Pinal plays an innocent novice who returns home before taking her final vows. Unfortunately she attracts the unwanted attention of her creepy uncle The French Connection's Fernando Rey who bears an uncanny resemblance to Gomez Addams. When she resists his advances he hangs himself. Viridiana now thinks she can never be a nun so she opens a homeless shelter instead. Unfortunately the beggars and tramps she brings in are ungrateful scum who trash the place and she has to call the National Guard on them. Realizing the pointlessness of doing good in a world full of evil Viridiana gives in to the sexual advances of her playboy cousin. The climax of this film is the blasphemous obscene but undeniably funny homage to Leonardo's Last Supper that the late Robert Altman ripped off in the movie MASH. Bunuel a selfprofessed Marxist hated the rich but judging from this movie he didn't love the poor very much either. One gets the impression that he hated people in general. Then there's Bunuel's trademark antiChristian message. You have to wonder what hold the Catholic Church had on Bunuel for him to feel the need to attack it so stridently in so many films surely Christianity must have had some attraction for him to hate it so much. Still in spite of its twisted ideological perspective this is an immensely entertaining film. Bunuel was perhaps the cinematic equivalent of Jonathan Swift except he didn't love individuals.".

	schema:headline " Becky Bloomwood's Alright with Me";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been a longtime fan of the Sophie Kinsella Shopaholic books which feature the lovable but compulsive Becky Bloomwood. So I wasn't sure what to expect out of the movie version.Rebecca Bloomwood is a lovely redheaded young woman who loooooves to shop. I am not talking about the reasonable kind of love where she goes monthly or even weekly to see what's new at her local boutique. I am talking about an addiction as powerful as any drug out there. When she walks past a store the mannequins talk to her and convince her that this only this particular item has the power to make her feel better more attractive more alive. She shops using 12 credit cards including her Gold Card which is encased in a block of ice in the freezer in case of emergencies. The tone of the film is comic so it's not a tragic type of addiction but we understand that Becky has a problem and she needs some serious help.Rebecca also has her own personal bill collector stalker type person following her around named Derek Smeath. All told she owes Mr. Smeath some 16000. After losing her job as a journalist she decides to apply for her dream job fashion correspondent for Alette magazine. For Becky this would be equivalent to an alcoholic working in a brewery. The job gets filled before she can arrive but a sister magazine from the same magazine group Successful Saving is hiring. The man at the front desk assures her that the magazine group is a family and once you're in you're in. The only problem is that the magazine that ends up hiring Becky is a financial advice magazine. Not exactly the type of place that suits Becky's lifestyle or assets.Becky's boss is Luke Brandon a handsome wealthy man with lots of energy and a black sheep complex. He never feels he can please his parents and leads a life of stress. He's amused by Becky's antics and impressed by her candor. Becky's writing for the financial magazine is a surprise hit. She writes about financial restraint in such a way that the average layperson can relate comparing it to shoes. It seems like everything's going swell with her new job and a surprise romance with Luke. Derek Smeath can't get a leg in since she's convinced her colleagues that he's an exboyfriend stalking her. But like any liar knows Becky can't keep the truth from her friends and family for long.I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and sincere. We like Becky because she is flawed. She doesn't have it all together but her style and spirit charm everyone around her. Sure she's addicted to shopping but we don't despise her for it. Instead we relate because what woman hasn't given in to the siren song of a signature scarf now and again. The pull of a good bargain is a powerful thing and this film is bound to be a hit with the average female.The acting is suitable for the film. Nothing revolutionary comes out of it but Isla Fisher will likely be back in many a comic role. The pacing of the film keeps you involved but there are enough heartfelt moments to keep us focused.Some have said that the timing for this film couldn't be worse. With the world in an economic downturn do we really want to smile and nod at Becky's need to buy buy buy? Well I say this film is healing balm. The nation will recover from this minidepression but in the meantime it's kind of nice to voyeuristically enjoy Becky's indulgences. I have had to natch my weekly Starbucks and batten down my bank account hatches so I need a little reward even if it's done through Becky's pocketbook. Also anyone who watches the film will realize that Becky goes through her own hard time and she finds a way to get through it. She comes up with her own entrepreneurial scheme to pay off her debt. This is what we all need to do during the difficult times. Find a way to get through. Becky is my hero.".

The man at the front desk assures her that the magazine group is a family and once you're in you're in. The only problem is that the magazine that ends up hiring Becky is a financial advice magazine. Not exactly the type of place that suits Becky's lifestyle or assets.Becky's boss is Luke Brandon a handsome wealthy man with lots of energy and a black sheep complex. He never feels he can please his parents and leads a life of stress. He's amused by Becky's antics and impressed by her candor. Becky's writing for the financial magazine is a surprise hit. She writes about financial restraint in such a way that the average layperson can relate comparing it to shoes. It seems like everything's going swell with her new job and a surprise romance with Luke. Derek Smeath can't get a leg in since she's convinced her colleagues that he's an exboyfriend stalking her. But like any liar knows Becky can't keep the truth from her friends and family for long.I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and sincere. We like Becky because she is flawed. She doesn't have it all together but her style and spirit charm everyone around her. Sure she's addicted to shopping but we don't despise her for it. Instead we relate because what woman hasn't given in to the siren song of a signature scarf now and again. The pull of a good bargain is a powerful thing and this film is bound to be a hit with the average female.The acting is suitable for the film. Nothing revolutionary comes out of it but Isla Fisher will likely be back in many a comic role. The pacing of the film keeps you involved but there are enough heartfelt moments to keep us focused.Some have said that the timing for this film couldn't be worse. With the world in an economic downturn do we really want to smile and nod at Becky's need to buy buy buy? Well I say this film is healing balm. The nation will recover from this minidepression but in the meantime it's kind of nice to voyeuristically enjoy Becky's indulgences. I have had to natch my weekly Starbucks and batten down my bank account hatches so I need a little reward even if it's done through Becky's pocketbook. Also anyone who watches the film will realize that Becky goes through her own hard time and she finds a way to get through it. She comes up with her own entrepreneurial scheme to pay off her debt. This is what we all need to do during the difficult times. Find a way to get through. Becky is my hero.";

Isla Fisher and most of the other characters were stereotyped into oblivion to the point where you couldn't relate if you wanted to. And why would you want to relate? They were for the most part selfish shortsighted curiously loud and generally intolerable. But the main reason that compelled me to turn the movie off is that I found it completely insulting. Viewers are supposed to suspend reality and believe that Fisher finds fame and success as a financial writer through her ridiculous metaphors about shopping. The fact that she's too dumb to take her own advice and yet she still somehow manages to fool everyone around her is just too much reality for me to suspend. Moreover the portrayal of a woman who finds success in finance through only dumb luck and cute outfits is an insult to all the women who find similar success in that field through their intellect and drive. I read the book and liked it enough to read the whole series but this movie effectively removed all the nuances and details that made the book and the pretty distasteful habits it depicted bearable. I guess the sad irony is that I paid to watch it while all the people involved with it are laughing all the way to the bank. Don't waste your time watching this abhorrent airbrushed fairy tale and if you have a daughter of a formative age please don't let her watch it either.".

Becky Bloomwood loves shopping  Not in a natural way. Virtually every time she passes by a shop window she sees something that she must have. All her buying decisions are purely impulsive. She even drives her friend up the wall with her problem and in result she begs Becky to seek help at Shoppers Anonymous  a club for recovering shopaholics.This movie is a funny charming and heartwarming adaption to Kinsella's book. It even provokes a few tears. I recommend this movie to everyone I know. I'll rate it 910 because it simply wasn't long enough.".

The acting is poor even though there is a number of wellrenowned artists present. The fashions is more than once more than twice absolutely disgraceful especially for a fashion themed movie. The plot is flat and it lacks much sense. The main character is annoyingly irresponsible. The list goes on and on but there is something more that is really frightening. The movie is basically about a person who suffers from being a shopaholic. She has actual illness which makes her buy everything she sees on the display which gives her an adrenaline rush. We all know that there is such thing. Nothing wrong about making a movie about it either. The problem is that this is not handled in any good way in the movie. The girl gets off easy she barely learns her lesson and on top of everything the poor debtcollecting worker is being shown as a negative character for reasons I cannot fully understand. What's even more frightening I can see this movie being a guideline for hundreds of women who in deed have a spending problem who do spend more than they make and I doubt that this movie will make them rethink their actions au contraire they will find it as an excuse to develop their habits even further. As far as I am from preaching about the state of economy I really thought that this movie carried a certain amount of wisdom instead of this I was left with a moronic picture for braindead.

For sure I will be looking out for movies Directed by PJ Hogan to avoid them. Sorry that I am so negative but its was unfair to pose this movie as entertaining. It speaks volumes for America to see U.S. Box Office 44268860 What!! my god. It also very outdated comedy. Nothing really was confessed!. it probably is the most illtimed and appallingly insulting movie in recent memory.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to give credit where credit is due Confessions of a Shopaholic does have some engaging moments of comedic credibility. But unfortunately not enough to provide the film with a high interest rate. Confessions of a Shopaholic stars the perky Isla Fisher as Rebecca Bloomwood a fulltime magazine writer who also moonlights and daylights as a fulltime shopaholic. Ms. Bloomwoodgale herself persistently shops  shops and has run her credit card balances to astronomical rates. Rebecca is in denial that she has a consumer addiction even though she continues to confront many credit card denials in her shopping sprees. She inadvertently gets hired to work as a journalist in out of all places a financial magazine. However her overridden goal is to work as a fashion journalist in the monarchic fashion magazine Adelle. She starts writing columns in the financial magazine with the alias the girl with the green scarf on the nightmare of commercial manipulation and consumer zaniness. Yes! That is true! Is this great country or what? Oh wait memo to self this is a movie! Rebecca's personal list includes a humble editor boss whom she falls for a best friend roommate who tries to control her shopamanian ways and parents who want to pursue their R.V. road trip dreams. Eventually and predictably Rebecca does get herself in several hot water scenarios caused by her consumer craziness and persistent blasphemy. So therefore she does go through the selfrealization addiction process. Director P.J. Hogan's stereotypical depictions of the consumer industry did not provide me anything of originality to get all charged about. However I must not discount the fact that I did like how he directed Isla Fisher. She was The Fisher Queen of this film with her zany but yet fervent performance Isla is sure to have her master thespian card renewed with other comedic leading roles in the foreseeable future. However the rest of the cast of Confessions of a Shopaholic are not worthy of a credit thespian increase. Screenwriter Tracey Jackson's script was not of a laughitall blue light special material but commendable enough for a few laughs in return. Due to our nation's economic strife Confessions of a Shopaholic might not be the ideal movie to watch these days but then again as was previously mentioned It is a movie! So this yours truly movieholic will try to sale it to you at a moderate price.  Average".

That cutting edge charm in the star's previous roles is frequently present but with a tried and tested formulaic plot that charm is always hanging in mid air.This isn't a star driven film and with an ordinary story and hardly any humour you wonder what the purpose is. It juggles the addiction of shopping and overdramatic central character too much to balance specifically on either entertainment or drama.Based on Sophie Kinsella's best selling novels Confessions is designed to appeal to people who simply were born to shop and enjoy spending money without considering those disastrous consequences. So cue all recent high street sellers names add in awkward spurts of humour and encode a tried and tested narrative and you have your typical story for the current fashion industry. And at a time of a certain credit crunch what's better to remind yourself of the people who have money to spend? So here you have the potential to convey current political issues and show disastrous ramifications and amazingly this does not. Rebecca finds a job and soon she is the talk of the town and she is single so a romantic interest is thrown in as is the challenge of a new job and everything starts to escalate on exactly the same day and she is in trouble etc.It's hard not to be surprised by how ordinary this film actually is. The trailer says it all. Though the book is based on an English girl's addiction the film is an American adaptation and you get the feeling if this was a British film there would be more dramatic consequences and a more realistic and surprising turn of the problem rather than this frankly boring take.My friend who forced me to see this film with him was laughing beside me at how bad this was. However I found it so bad and such a waste of money that I couldn't even do that. Confessions of a Shopaholic is your typical story wrapped around touchy subject that is undeveloped inaccurate and down right poor.".

When I went to the particular cinema they said to just Go in The cinema was just over halfway through Confessions of a Shopaholic ...I pretty much guessed by what was said what had happened up to that point... And indeed it was a blessing... Myself a reforming Shopaholic  It was a message to know there's more to life than buying stuff. Now my Shopaholicness was very different to hers. I'm not into high fashion for me it's more books mainly scifi fantasy for the escapism fantasyscifi action figures and newagey things like crystals again more books and also pretty house things and fun stationery ... Now some things I need but I did have a tendency to go overboard and have been badly in debt ... So ... vastly different shopping habits though the movie helped me realise what I knew deep inside. I don't need a Harry Potter Knight Bus or a Jedi Master toy to rescue me... I don't need all this stuff to make me feel better  like Rebecca said in the movie shopping makes the world get better ... and then it isn't anymore... It's like a high from a drug or alcohol I guess ... or a sugar high  feels good at first though that feeling is shortlived.I thought the movie illustrated this brilliantly .. I was amazed to see so many people trashed this movie as 'insensitive' in an economic downturn... These morons seemed to miss the whole point of the movie ... and they saw the whole thing too I'll wager. They would have seen how upset Rebecca got during the talk show ... How she realised she had a problem and repented... How she would not let her Dad sell the Winnebago ... How she went to 'Shopaholics Anonymous' ... How she used her mind and came up with a solution. She turned her Dream Job down at the end as it went against her integrity  knowing it would make girls and young women into fashionshopping addicts ... How's THAT for integrity?! How her imagination made mannequins seem to beckon to her with all this stuff... And how at the end of the movie she was in that godawful bridesmaid dress and rag bag ... and they 'beckoned' to her with the flashy red bag and slinky shiny outfit ... You saw the temptation on her face ... the struggle ... And how she overcame it with sheer willpower. These fools obviously missed the whole point of this movie  It was about OVERCOMING addiction!!! It could've been Confessions of an Alcoholic or a DrugSex Addict or Confessions of a Gambler or any other addiction ... about how they struggle with their addiction. Shopping can be a serious addiction too but most people seem to miss that. Makes you wonder about the intelligence and integrity of some people what they see it right in their faces and miss the point and harp on and on about the opposite of what the movie was about. Duh. There's a long movie about these people. It's called Confessions of an Idiot. ... The 100 volume DVD release has 5000000 hours of extra footage!  I hope that many Shopaholics see this movie and like Rebecca learn to overcome their addiction and realise they are beautiful shining souls and do not need a bunch of stuff to feel good. People suffering form other addictions can also use this movie as a parable to kick their addictions.And more people pay their debtcollectors with one pennycent pieces! HAH!".

Against our better judgment we went and saw this poor excuse for an entertaining movie. We should have known better. I won't get into the plotwas there one? What surprised us were the number of well known actors who must have been desperate for a paycheck who agreed to be part of this film. Joan Cusack John Goodman John Lithgow Kristen Scott Thomas Lynn Redgrave and Julie Hagerty sold their souls to the devil to earn some cash. I knew the economy was bad but this? The acting was so over the top it wasn't even funny. Too many exaggerated reactions especially by Julie Hagerty. I found myself wanting to wrap a green scarf around my eyes so I wouldn't have to watch the slapstick comedy and predictable scenes. What was the director thinking? I know I haven't written a very concise review of this film but it was horrible and its hard to write a review on a film this bad. The only things we liked in the movie were the gesturing mannequinsclever and cute and the acting of Hugh Dancy who was the only one in the film that showed their acting chops. Save your money and go see Slumdog Millionaire. A two instead of a one because of the mannequins and a big thumbs down. You can bet that if anyone writes a positive review of this movie they are somehow connected with it and it is in their own best interest to write positive comments because the average movie viewer unless they are 13 years old and younger won't like this film. P.S. Where besides New York City do women wear such a mixture of clothes at one time? I love bright color but really who truly dresses like that?".

There's really more to that than just that sentence but I don't want to bore you.What's really embarrassing and yet subtly intriguing is that Entertainment Weekly's film critic Owen Gleiberman gave this film an A rating. That puzzles me because I really couldn't see how he could give this movie that much praise and give so many others such crap I won't name the titles for the sake of argument.Oh and by the way I wasn't dissing on Lawrence of Arabia in my summary.

Certainly its eye opening in its details and very graphic nature but I'm not sure its very good. Essentially a collection of talking heads with some demonstrations both graphic and suggestive it tells us a great deal but I wasn't sure what it succeeds in what its trying to do. While I know its an attempt to bring to light the chocolate side of people's sex drive it falls down on any notion that these subjects cross all sexual orientations and genders. The problem is that most of the people interviewed seem to be men there are only handful of women on screen. This under cuts the notion and reality that these things are the enjoyed by people of all genders and sexual persuasions.Adding to the film's trouble is the infomercial style the film often adopts. While the style was clearly dictated by the circumstances the film and the subjects are somehow lessened as a result I didn't hate the film but I didn't find it all that great either. If you're curious and very open minded and not disturbed by graphic depictions of sex of all varieties and I do mean all then you might want to try it but if you're vanilla then you'll want to stay away from this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a screening of this several months ago and have been patiently waiting for news about when it was going to be getting released because it was one of the most romantic films I've seen in a long time. The movie tells the story of Sam Jennifer Love Hewitt a young American musician living in London with her British boyfriend Ian Paul Nicholls. We learn a little bit about the couple in the first 13 of the film and how Ian may be too involved in his work to really pay attention to what is going on in Sam's life which leads to the two having an argument right before Sam is involved in an auto accident which leaves her boyfriend in pieces... until he is given a second chance to relive the day. Essentially the film is showing the importance of not taking for granted every second you have in a relationship because you never know when it could be taken away from you and how all of your actions have tremendous meaning in yours and your loved ones lives. The story is very involving and it has a really emotional ending which makes the impact of the whole setup that much stronger. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the big name here and she gives a good performance. She's much more subdued than I've seen her in previous films and it helps bring her natural charm to the forefront. Paul Nicholls is an unknown to most Americans but he is someone I do know from his 'Eastenders' days as my exgirlfriend watched that British soap on PBS loyally and I must say he was very impressive. Very charismatic and genuine leading man material. I'm sure all the girls will go crazy over the accent. The two have very good onscreen chemistry especially with all the highly emotional scenes in the latter half of the movie. Tom Wilkinson was great in a small role as the taxi driver lending his ear to Ian with his relationship troubles. The film is really touching and has some of the most beautiful scenery you will ever see of the English countryside in the second half of the film in which you follow the couple as they relive the day that changed their lives. A very romantic beautifully shot film. Here's hoping it gets the exposure it deserves.".

	schema:headline " A moving well crafted romance with standout performances";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended the Sarasota Film Festival recently. If Only was the opening night film there but I passed on the initial screening. However it generated great buzz from those who saw it so I caught the second screening of the film at the festival and I must say I was stunned at how good this film was.Emily Jennifer Love Hewitt and Peter Paul Nicholls British newcomer are a young couple living together in London. Peter is a British businessman Emily an American is an aspiring singer. The film opens with some sweet light hearted comedy as we are introduced to the couple. However when the two have issues many young couples deal with they are left on a bad note when suddenly tragedy strikes and their relationship is ended. It is very hard to get in to more detail without giving away too much of the film but let's just say we are treated to a touching dramatic story of a romance as we see what a unique opportunity could bring and how we should never take for granted what we say or do in relationships because of what can happen in life.When you run in to a film of this nature you always wonder about whether the film will try too hard to pull the heart strings to manipulate an emotional reaction but the movie is so great at avoiding that. The film is genuinely touching with outstanding intelligent writing moving and serious with nice sprinkles of humor when appropriate and very well paced direction. The acting to me though is the biggest shocker. I'd never heard of Paul Nicholls before but he is a very charming presence. Another reviewer mentioned Hugh Grant and that is spot on. He is a very charismatic young actor and could develop in to a star down the road. Tom Wilkinson a staple in very strong independent films In the Bedroom being his favorite of mine though The Full Monty has always been near the top of my list as well graces the movie with another good performance in a supporting role. The biggest standout to me though has to be Jennifer Love Hewitt. I've seen a few of her films and while she was attractive and charismatic at times I was fairly unimpressed with her ability as she was usually glossy and two dimensional. I had major doubts about her ability to actually be a lead in a good dramatic film which is why I skipped this before the great festival buzz but I have to say she was perfect. Her physical attributes are more subdued in this film sure she is pretty but she has to actually carry this film on her skills as an actress and she pulls it off. She shows range nails some very emotional scenes and does something that is the key to pulling off this type of role which is make you care about what happens to her character. Her happiness comes across as genuine as does her excitement at a major event that occurs in the film as does her pain. The performances by Hewitt and Nicholls are what make the climax of the film so dramatic and emotional. This film should advance Hewitt's career beyond the type of run of the mill Hollywood fare that she has based her movie career on so far. She shows great potential as a good leading lady in more serious films which frankly is the last thing I expected going in to this film.If Only is independently produced it is not a studio film which is why it was showing at the festival as it is making the rounds looking for U.S. distribution. As is often the case these types of films allow the discove ry of great newcomers Nicholls and the chance for more established actors to stretch themselves outside their previous mainstream work Hewitt in hopes of making a small film that beats out the major studio work with quality in writing acting and directing and this film has accomplished that goal. I hope that this film finds the success it deserves down the road it was the surprise and treat of the festival for me and many others in attendance. It is a beautiful love story and an extremely effective film at keeping you involved in the development of the characters for the full two hours. Thumbs up from me and keep an eye out for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well heres the deal. As an actor myself I like to think that I know what I am looking for in a good film. I think this is one to see.Samantha Jennifer Love Hewitt is in love with her boyfriend unfortunately he doesn't pay any attention to her. She is living in London attending school there to be with him. She is a music student and aspiring singersongwriter. Ian Paul Nicholls is wrapped up in his job and is taking her for Granted. A twist of fate occurs and makes him realize what he has.Honestly this is the one of the first times Jennifer Love Hewitt has made an impact on a film. She stands out as a true actor in this production. She also Produced this film which makes her a force to reckon with in Hollywood. She also lends her vocals to the soundtrack which is worth it. The two songs she performs in the film are wonderful.English actor Paul Nicholls is a wonderful addition to this cast. He is a breath of fresh air for our films considering American cinema is plagued by the likes of Nick Cannon and Paul Walker types. Nicholls offers Americans a look at our future Hugh Grant. His performance is considerably good playing both the horrible boyfriend and the loving boyfriend within the same film. He never makes you think twice about his integrity or especially his acting.I recommend this film to anyone who is a Jennifer Love Hewitt fan or to anyone who is a romantic at heart. This one will get ya'. Director Gil Junger did a wonderful job and Writer Christina Welsh succeeded as a first time screenwriter. I look forward to any projects they take on in the future.I also hope that an American company picks this film up for distribution soon.".

Straight to the point.The message is just simple If you love someone don't waste time of showing how much you love him or her. On how much you value him or her. And how much you appreciated him or her for being there with you.The movie was perfect. So if I were you you find ways and watch the movie. If your into a relationship you watch it with your sweetheart.

However I had forgotten to ask the one question I always ask my girlfriend before watching one of these at the end do they kill off the guy and send the girl on saddened but stronger now and ready to face her triumphant future without him? Alas once again it seems the only great lover is a dead one. Jack!! Jack!! I'll miss you so!! she says as Jack sinks into the freezing Atlantic. Sorrywrong movie. I do lose track as the bodies fall away.";

As in US soap not UK soap... I don't think you'd see Paul Nichols performing in a concert hall on EastEnders as Joe Wicks would you? It is a nice cute movie though and I admit it made me cry some tears at the end. The acting was very good I thought. The one thing I can't believe nobody is commenting on though was the total ripoff of the German movie Run Lola Run! Well maybe it was an homage to that brilliant movie. They even practically copied the RLR soundtrack in the scene when Ian was running to Lotte's flat! I do like such movies like this where people get a second chance to change things so though it can't touch Run Lola Run it's definitely a nice TV movie to watch and think about.".

I can only recommend this movie especially because of the many lovely moments and the excellent dialogue. My only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a bit too smart for its own good and that it doesn't always ring true. The actors are very good too especially Nick Nolte Joely Richardson and the young Whittni Wrightwho is wonderful. They're not the really big names like in the two aforementioned movies but they did a very good job. Also look out for the character played by Albert Brooks which is very familiar with Jack Nicholson's character in AS GOOD AS IT GETS. It almost seems a trademark of James L. Brooks who keeps delivering the goods with his original and always fresh romantic comedies. Don't miss this one! 810".

The set of this movie must've motivated these actors to beyond their usual performances..........maybe because the script is so greatthey all get their shots at character development..... I can think of 5.       There's Nick Nolte I've never DISliked him but his physique combined with his sweet fatherly attitude makes for the perfect combination it makes him very attractive. Joely Richardson I've only seen in one other movie but she keeps you interested in her character all the way through however quirky weird or whimsical. Nolte's daughter Wright is SO believable as the spoiled little rich girl brought up by manhater Tracy Ullman !'s character as mom. The two other characters are supporting one is that lady who does Marge Simpson's voice and her love interest. All these characters develop and learn.    This film also ironically gives insight into the film industry and how truly unglamorous Hollywood can be. Nick Nolte must cry in a room full of people withOUT the director even being there a group of ladies who work in casting  are asked when deciding yayor nay on this actor if they would sleep with him.    But in the end it stays true to its source meaning it doesn't look completely down at Hollywood or anything else. It's just a really adorable feelgood movie.Did I mention adorable?Sep".

Nick Nolte keeps everything going as usual with his marvelous acting.  Is there any other big guy actor who can cry believably well maybe Harrison Ford?  He was just terrific so believable as the father who didn't know what to do with his spoiled brat daughter.   And wasn't Whittni Wright amazing?  I can only hope that was acting as I've seen plenty of kids just like her.  The supporting cast was terrific.  It was hard to pinpoint what there was about this movie that made it not quite so good as it could have been. Perhaps it was that it really was an inhouse film one that anyone who has been through what the various characters have could identify with but perhaps not us out in the hinterlands coming from Wyoming to Australia I'm definitely hinterland!.  Kudos to actors and director for keeping this film together.  With lesser talent it could have fallen flat on its face.".

It was refreshing to see Nolti do this type of thing although I'm not surprised that he did it well. He's an actor who has over time honed his skills to an art form. I'm not sure that he is appreciated as much as he should be. Anyway in my opinion I'll do Anything is underrated here. I give this flick a high mark and hope that my participation in the vote will raise the average score of this fine movie. For those who have had their fill of movies that focus on violence try this delightful James L Brooks production for a change of pace.

I've always liked Nick Nolte but he's never been one of my 'favourites'.

She is so utterly natural and believable capturing the exasperating but ultimately disarming precociousness of childhood perfectly. It's a pity she has stopped acting I think she would be amazing. It's also great to see Julie 'Marge Simpson' Kavner on the screen she's severely underused by Hollywood  a great talent remember 'Radio Days'? And by the way the film is about much more than an errant father mending his ways and changing his attitude toward his neglected kid it's about a man unsure of his own worth finally changing his attitude toward HIMSELF.

His professional life is diminished by the likes of arrogant producer Burke Adler Albert Brooks who ropes him into being his driver. His wife leaves their daughter Jeannie Whittni Wright with him even thought he hasn't seen her in 2 years. He's attracted to likeminded production assistant Cathy Breslow Joely Richardson.Nick Nolte has an angry intensity. I think James L Brooks is looking for that odd couple with a gruff old guy and a little girl. I get it but it's the anger in him and quite frankly the little girl that makes it hard to laugh at. The little girl has a streak of meanness in her. She's not just the quintessential cute little girl. She's yelling for the first half of the movie. The duo has their cute moments but not any funny moments.Albert Brooks has some funny moments but he doesn't really fit the stereotype of a Hollywood producer. He's a more bumbling character than that. It's hard to see him push anybody around.".

	onyx:emotionText "Matt Hobbs Nick Nolte is a working actor unable to get good gigs. His professional life is diminished by the likes of arrogant producer Burke Adler Albert Brooks who ropes him into being his driver. His wife leaves their daughter Jeannie Whittni Wright with him even thought he hasn't seen her in 2 years. He's attracted to likeminded production assistant Cathy Breslow Joely Richardson.Nick Nolte has an angry intensity. I think James L Brooks is looking for that odd couple with a gruff old guy and a little girl. I get it but it's the anger in him and quite frankly the little girl that makes it hard to laugh at. The little girl has a streak of meanness in her. She's not just the quintessential cute little girl. She's yelling for the first half of the movie. The duo has their cute moments but not any funny moments.Albert Brooks has some funny moments but he doesn't really fit the stereotype of a Hollywood producer. He's a more bumbling character than that. It's hard to see him push anybody around.";

But as it is the movie isn't particularly successful. It does have some interesting behind thescenes moments that show the working of the Hollywood machine behind the curtains and the performances aren't that bad. However the movie can't seem to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama. It might have been possible to mix those two genres but as it is here the two extremes don't seem to fit together. Also the key relationship in the movie  between the Nick Nolte character and his daughter  seems for the most part not very indepth so much so that the emotional ending doesn't seem deserved. The kind of slow pace of the movie as well as its length almost two hours doesn't help matters. It's not actively bad but there's not much that will stick in your mind after watching it.".

	schema:headline " Witty Romantic Comedy Let Down by Its Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in a world of perpetual sunshine in the south of France BEAUTIFUL LIES DE VRAIS MENSONGES has a plot with distinct echoes of CYRANO DE BERGERAC. Former UNESCO translator Jean Sami Bouajila now working in a hairdressing salon writes an anonymous loveletter to owner Emilie Audrey Tautou. Although not knowing who the author is Emilie convinces her mother Maddy Nathalie Baye that the letter has been written for her mother's benefit Emilie subsequently writes two more anonymous loveletters for her mother pretending that they have come from the same author as the first letter. Further complications ensue but the story ends happily enough.Pierre Salvadori's film looks at the gulf separating words from meanings what the characters say  either in written or spoken discourse  and what they actually mean are often two different things. This is especially true of Emilie who convinces herself that she is acting in her mother's best interests but ends up being utterly selfabsorbed. Her narcissistic nature is summed up by the frequency of shots where she sits in her office a bottle of vodka in hand trying to pen new loveletters for her mother. Emilie comes across as a basically unattractive person in the precredit sequence she is shown cutting the fringe off one of her customer's Ccile Boland's hair even though the customer specifically insists otherwise.By comparison Maddy is meant to be represented as an innocent victim  unable to come to terms with her exhusband's Daniel Duval's decision to leave her for a younger woman her life is in pieces as she sits on the sofa in a nightdress. The prospect of a younger man falling in love with her gives her renewed energy so much so that even when Emilie tells her the truth Maddy still invites Jean round for a romantic dinner for two. But here's the rub  at the end of the evening she decides to bed Jean while being perfectly aware of his feelings for Emilie. We are left to wonder why is Maddy taking revenge on her daughter or is she at heart as selfinterested as Emilie?For the first fourfifths of DE VRAIS MENSONGES director Salvadori creates a lightasgossamer romantic comedy with serious undertones in which gesture assumes as much significance as word. The shotreverse shot sequences involving Emilie and Jean where the two of them try their best not to disclose their true feelings for one another are beautifully handled as is the sequence where Emilie's tonguetied employee Paulette Judith Chemla tries her best to explain something to Emilie while not looking her in the eye. The ending however is a bit of a copout  although order is restored we are left to ponder the lack of moral scruples influencing the characters' behavior even that of Jean. One wonders precisely how women are viewed in this apparently liberal society.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Beautiful Lies";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Pierre Salvadori reunites with actress Audrey Tautou from their earlier collaboration Priceless but don't get your hopes up too high that Beautiful Lies would be a solid enough follow up especially if you enjoyed their earlier film on how some would fake a relationship or trade love for money. Salvadori continues with the offbeat romantic comedy premise involving make believe with this film but alas it came through as a rather predictable affair.It's hard to sustain a relationship based on a lie and things get a lot complicated here when lies become the foundations on which romantic relationships favours and that between parent and child get all built upon where an innocently anonymous letter from a hair salon handyman Jean Sami Bouajila to his boss Emelie Audrey Tautou the salon coowner gets tossed aside by the latter since she obviously paid no heed to it only for that attention to be retracted when she realized that her mom Maddy Nathalie Baye is due for a romantic lift from her prolonged sustained depression since her husband Marc Paul Morgan left her for someone younger and nubile to be his artistic muse.Thus begins a series of contrived misunderstandings and lies built upon lies with the constant letter writings from Emelie posing as an anonymous admirer only for her ruse to be unintentionally skewed way off the mark when Maddy thinks it is indeed Jean who has hidden feelings for her no thanks to an errant Jean had to run which took him to dropping off the letter. Naturally this follows plenty of hidden meanings and Emelie trying to come between the two for fear of an expose guiding this film to some laughable light hearted moments.But it turned into a chore with Emelie having to beg a reluctant Jean to continue a charade to entertain her mother for fear of her mental and emotional state with Emelie none the wiser that Jean was actually the originator of the letter to her declaring his love from afar. Oh the pain involved to help a loved one in her time of need yet having to compromise one's principles to act out a lie and worse to lead a senior citizen on in some hope of a second wind of romance. It may sound like a fun premise but trust me it certainly was a chore to the character of Jean and somehow this translated to the whole narrative giving you that sinking feeling of being unable to bail out from something forced upon and unpleasant.Beautiful Lies got condemned in a certain way with a whole host of unlikeable ones. Emelie begins with a good intent but in efforts to save her own skin from embarrassment and to keep her madcap idea under reins she turns into some crazy control freak who frequently lies manipulating Jean and of course causing undue strain with her staff at work. Manipulative and scheming Audrey Tautou does pull this one off to a certain degree until it became repetitive no thanks to Emelie's constant exasperation. Jean also went into an about turn with his descend into probably one of the biggest cinematic jerks as well one without courage to walk out of a morally compromising position and assisting an ugly on the inside woman with her grand scheme. Only perhaps Nathalie Baye's portrayal as the emotionally helpless mom brought about some light to the film if not for the last few scenes of the film to really show her off as an opportunist with no qualms to turn tables.Without characters you genuinely feel for and a narrative that was in a hurry to conclude with a convenient ending sticking out like a sore thumb one too perfect in many ways to sweep all development under the carpet Beautiful Lies is extremely far from beautiful and you would probably be better off watching any of Tautou's earlier works. Certainly not one of her best roles to date stuck in a story based on a joke that had gone too far it isn't interesting.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Pierre Salvadori reunites with actress Audrey Tautou from their earlier collaboration Priceless but don't get your hopes up too high that Beautiful Lies would be a solid enough follow up especially if you enjoyed their earlier film on how some would fake a relationship or trade love for money. Salvadori continues with the offbeat romantic comedy premise involving make believe with this film but alas it came through as a rather predictable affair.It's hard to sustain a relationship based on a lie and things get a lot complicated here when lies become the foundations on which romantic relationships favours and that between parent and child get all built upon where an innocently anonymous letter from a hair salon handyman Jean Sami Bouajila to his boss Emelie Audrey Tautou the salon coowner gets tossed aside by the latter since she obviously paid no heed to it only for that attention to be retracted when she realized that her mom Maddy Nathalie Baye is due for a romantic lift from her prolonged sustained depression since her husband Marc Paul Morgan left her for someone younger and nubile to be his artistic muse.Thus begins a series of contrived misunderstandings and lies built upon lies with the constant letter writings from Emelie posing as an anonymous admirer only for her ruse to be unintentionally skewed way off the mark when Maddy thinks it is indeed Jean who has hidden feelings for her no thanks to an errant Jean had to run which took him to dropping off the letter. Naturally this follows plenty of hidden meanings and Emelie trying to come between the two for fear of an expose guiding this film to some laughable light hearted moments.But it turned into a chore with Emelie having to beg a reluctant Jean to continue a charade to entertain her mother for fear of her mental and emotional state with Emelie none the wiser that Jean was actually the originator of the letter to her declaring his love from afar. Oh the pain involved to help a loved one in her time of need yet having to compromise one's principles to act out a lie and worse to lead a senior citizen on in some hope of a second wind of romance. It may sound like a fun premise but trust me it certainly was a chore to the character of Jean and somehow this translated to the whole narrative giving you that sinking feeling of being unable to bail out from something forced upon and unpleasant.Beautiful Lies got condemned in a certain way with a whole host of unlikeable ones. Emelie begins with a good intent but in efforts to save her own skin from embarrassment and to keep her madcap idea under reins she turns into some crazy control freak who frequently lies manipulating Jean and of course causing undue strain with her staff at work. Manipulative and scheming Audrey Tautou does pull this one off to a certain degree until it became repetitive no thanks to Emelie's constant exasperation. Jean also went into an about turn with his descend into probably one of the biggest cinematic jerks as well one without courage to walk out of a morally compromising position and assisting an ugly on the inside woman with her grand scheme. Only perhaps Nathalie Baye's portrayal as the emotionally helpless mom brought about some light to the film if not for the last few scenes of the film to really show her off as an opportunist with no qualms to turn tables.Without characters you genuinely feel for and a narrative that was in a hurry to conclude with a convenient ending sticking out like a sore thumb one too perfect in many ways to sweep all development under the carpet Beautiful Lies is extremely far from beautiful and you would probably be better off watching any of Tautou's earlier works. Certainly not one of her best roles to date stuck in a story based on a joke that had gone too far it isn't interesting.";

	schema:reviewBody "Emilie runs a beauty salon. Her father is in love with a 20 year old is seeking divroce and her mother Maddy is depressed. Jean who works in her salon sends Emilie an anonymous love letter. Emilie is least interested but then decides to send this letter to her mother to lift her spirits. Sure it did but then she had to make up two more letters on her own. Maddy mistakes Jean as her writer. Emilie is in serious trouble. This is a brilliant romantic comedy. Mistaken identities misunderstandings untold love search for love all its there but there is a touch of class all over too. The characters are brilliant. Emilie really wants to help her mother come out of the depression so she doesn't think twice before sending her a love letter. Only later does she realise how difficult it is to create one by herself which she cannot without the help of being drunk. At the same time Emilie is somebody who walked out of a relationship when she realised her partner was more educated than her and is a man of letters. A simple reason why the beautiful love letter she received didn't touch her at all. When she finds out that Jean is an intelligent chap her irritation with him is wonderful. In fact the series of firing and reappointment of Jean is really funny. Maddy is depressed because of her husband but she is a literature person so is moved by the adorable love letter. The way the love letter lift her spirits is really good. But she is soon depressed as the passion is absent in the second letter. Her search for the writer and her following up for Jean and her final realisation of the truth it is all quite wonderful. Jean is a man of letters knowing so many languages who took up a maintenance job in the salon only to be near Emilie. But he is kind and sensuous too. So his frustration and kind of being out of mind after the forced kiss with Maddie was really excellent. There are also couple of other small characters like the partner of Emilie etc who all does their part in the story.Except for the final moments when Maddy realises the truth or Emilie understands Jean the movie moves on with brilliant moments of subtle fun. How can the French be so good. Its unbelievable how some scenes dialogues and characters are created. It is the reactions and expressions of the characters of course with the situations which makes the incredibly funny moments and it is really brilliant. Almost all the scenes involving Emilie Jean and Maddy for the three fourths of the movie offer excellent laughs. At the same time we are also worried about their future and are touched by the three for how things turn up for them towards the end. A small lovely turn brings the movie to a nice end.Adurey Tautou is brilliant and brilliant. What an actress. She is living Emilie in the screen is quite easy to say. But there were really tough scenes here where she had to give those spontaneous reactions and she excelled in each of them. A terrific performance. Hopefully like in the case of many other movies within a few years this movie would be remade in Hollywood. I can see Julia Roberts playing Emilie and the movie becoming an international hit. Fans of Hollywood will again rave about the greatness of Hollywood like it happened with many other remakes and these brilliant artistes behind the original would be forgotten.".

Unfortunately one similarity that is glaringly missing is the sheer energy of Ms. Tautou's' former director and mentor JeanPierre Jeunet. Whereas Jeunet is like a brightly illuminated comet hurtling through the sky Pierre Salvadori's style is more akin to a slow moving iceberg. And that is what the film is  an iceberg.Nearly all good romantic comedies have some essential ingredients energy dynamism warmth identifiable characters quickfire humour and empathy  think Bridget Jones Notting Hill et al. Sadly none of these ingredients are present. Not even the exceptional Nathalie Baye is able to drag this film from the doldrums. It is nothing more than a montage of scenes where very little happens or engages the viewer. Clearly Sami Bouajila did his best but his forte is serious drama and that's where he should stay.The one shining light in the film is Judith Chemla. With her very expressive face and mannerisms she has a promising future.It is quite sad that Ms. Tautou has concentrated on 'glamour' films since leaving Jeunet  Coco Before Channel Priceless. At heart she is an exceptional comedy actor. Regretfully Salvadori is not the director who can direct and showcase her talents. Unless she wants to stay on the periphery of French cinema Ms. Tautou needs to ask herself how best can she deploy her many talents.".

	schema:headline " An accessible and lightweight French comedy featuring everyone's favourite Audrey Tautou";
	schema:reviewBody "Love seems especially beautiful when it happens in France doesn't it? We've all imagined ourselves as the beautiful people headlining French movies like Amelie 2001 A Very Long Engagement 2004 and Priceless 2006. Is it just coincidence that the abovementioned movies feature French cinema's darling Audrey Tautou? Here we have another romantic comedy starring the lovely starlet and her pixie crop.Tautou plays Emilie probably paying homage to Amelie the character which made the French star a household name an owner of a hairdressing salon who receives a hand written love letter from a shy handyman. She dismisses the passionate letter at first but when she realises that her mother is still distraught over the betrayal of her father she decides to resend the letter to cheer the upset woman up. What follows is a series of misunderstandings and an awkward love triangle involving a man caught between two women who are mother and daughter. This is your usual French charmer with a tried and test romantic comedy formula. You'd be chuckling instead of roaring in laughter at the setups and the occasional sexual innuendos you'd be impressed with yourself yet again because you could see the ending coming one quarter into the 105 minute movie and you'd have no problem sitting through this lightweight and accessible production where everyone well is a charmer.We are talking about the caricatured characters here ranging from Tautou's smart alec but lovable protagonist Nathalie Baye's Catch Me If You Can mother character who seems a little too hungry for sex Sami Bouajia's Days of Glory handsome handyman and other supporting roles written to provide additional laughs. This isn't exactly a bad thing though  the people in the world written by scriptwriter Benoit Graffin may lead everyday lives like ours but there is something particularly charismatic about how they appear on screen. This makes us common folks desire for a lifestyle like theirs and that's probably why everyone loves French cinema. Tautou and her signature bob does nothing new here but still manages to have you siding with her idiosyncratic and quirky character. Baye steals the show as the mother whose love life is turned upside down after receiving a zealously written love letter. The actress manages to deliver a comical performance which provides the energy for the film. Bouajia isn't too bad either as one can only imagine his frustration as he finds himself caught between two women. Supporting characters played by Stephanie Lagarde and Judith Chemla complete the likable ensemble cast. As this isn't a sweeping romance drama you can expect standard production values read simple cinematography and simple art direction which are more commonly found on TV movies. This also isn't a bad thing because your attention should be on the character's jesting and bantering.Director Pierre Salvadori who also co penned the screenplay is obviously hoping to repeat the success he enjoyed on Priceless five years ago which also starred Tautou. A romantic comedy like this will be easily enjoyed by the masses but it may also be conveniently filed into the category of one of those French comedies you've watched before.www.moviexclusive.com".

We've seen Audrey Tautou in quite a few movies by now and yes we did laugh a lot and sometimes loud. So if some reviewers want to put it down so be it but I think it should not deter anyone else to be well entertain. I get a little amused when I see some of those critics about the story falling in very predictable along other criticism. But I seem to remember in my early years around Paris going to the Comedie Francaise with our class and for a penny thus perched on the very top of the theater we would laugh our belly out watching plays like Tartuffe sometimes corny to the most and predictable to no end but always very funny. Don't quote me on Moliere's Tartuffe as it is simply one of the play title I just remember. The point these were masters plays and their farces were very funny too. Although I'm sure one could just as easily pull them a part. Going back to Beautiful Lies and why this language decided this tittle against the French literal translation  'Some' True Lies? I think it sustained a good pace and good timing to let us appreciate the humour. I perhaps would have like a more speedy and decisive ending once everyone knew what really had happened  however this really would only apply to the last ten minutes. Don't fear go and see it. It'll take your trouble away for the duration!".

The french theoretician of seduction Jean Baudrillard has devoted a whole book on this the most sublime order that dares defy even desire in its heightening of ritual and artifice to put it in a very abbreviated form.Yet Salvadori gave a coup to that in the final spin of Priceless he exposed that you can seduce the other after your hesitating partner asked you so and this is a proof of love but this does not work the other way round. This is a great dialectic demonstration of love.

Do I have to literally seduce your mother the other par excellence in order to get through to you? The cast is excellent even though I think Tautou has slightly misconceived the tone she has to strike for her role especially in the light of the excellent Bouajila and Bayer they are truly something some true actors.Some complain or stand halfway to embarrassment that the film lacks class and smells too much of TV production values I was a bit shocked in the beginning too but the film is shockingly economic in a way but when halfway in the film we witness the theater of shadows I won't spoil it this marks true sophistication for the reason also that after that the film does not shy away from complexity but it is exactly then that the mother emerges in all her real symbolic imaginary faces and Bouajila follows the scenario's cue with finesse.Never vulgar selfexcusing or indulging gracefully simple and cutting this is a true achievement. I watched it twice in a row fascinated by its crystal clear structure and magisterial even haughty in the final chapter rhythm that risks go unperceived. The end with its fake abruptness which was a true celebration of the image of the mother cut loose at last and the closing credits with its peculiar evocation of highschool french series from the nineties verified in a way that this is a film we may have to catch up with in subtle departments.Thank you monsieur Salvadori et merci.".

Back in 1999 Tonie Marshall wrote and directed Venus Beaute' which centred on the Beauty Salon of the title and three of its employees all looking for rejecting andor finding love. Nathalie Baye had the lion's share of screen time as the senior of the three employees the other two being Mathilde Sagnier and a young actress who had caught Marshall's eye Audrey Tautou whom she cast as the youngest of the three. The film picked up several awards including no less than three Cesars the French Oscars for Best Film Best Director and Best Newcomer Tautou. Now eleven years later Salvadori casts Tautou as the owner of a hairdressing salon anxious to secure a love life for her mother none other than Nathalie Baye. Technically Salvadori made two mistakes because Baye walks away with the picture from under the nose of the 'star' Tautou. To be fair Baye is one of the finest French actresses of her generation and has walked away with more pictures than Tautou has appeared in. Salvadori of course worked with Tautou on Hord de Prix Priceless outside France which scored at the box office despite a dubious premise which it really needed Billy Wilder to get away with. This time around Tautou is noticeably losing the bloom of youth which has been her stock in trade for so long  as well she might at 35  and appears to be straining at times to look cute. On the other hand plots like this  mistaken identity involving romance  are mere finger exercises for French movie makers so there is a certain amount of charm and skill on display but the best thing about it by a country kilometre is Baye.".

Walking into it with expectations would have ruined it for me.The movie is well directed and cast despite the fact that many of the actors are related  this is a happy surprise when the credits roll. The premise is that a separated celebrity couple gets back together for their sixth wedding anniversary much to the happiness of most of their friends and colleagues and begin to plan a family and a move to England from Hollywood.Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming make a credible couple on the verge of stardom or hasbeendom depending on what takes place in the coming year relocating to England to have a baby or having Sally act the part in Joe's new movie.  It becomes clear near the end that the desires of each aren't what was expected in the beginning of the film.The only disappointment was Kevin Kline's character.  This role was the least interesting of the group he efforts a semibelievable cynical hollywood type who holds genuine affection for his children.  I just didn't feel anything for him although Kline shines as would be expected.  Small quibble.Phoebe Cates plays the most believable character Sally's best female friend and makes you wonder where she's been lately.  She comes terribly close to stealing the show by nailing her role with Oscarquality acting and frightening emotion.  We all have or deserve a friend like Sophia.The other surprise star is Mina Badie who evolves from the apprehensive and abrasive neighbor to untethered libertine by the conclusion.  I'm not sure why she doesn't want more acting roles.There was a tad too much nudity in the pool scene although it is explainable but aside from that I would recommend this to anyone whose prechild relationship is not currently on the rocks.".

What begins as a celebration of sorts becomes a character study that examines the lifestyle of the selfabsorbed and those driven by ego and we get to see the people behind the fame.'  And while on one hand The Anniversary Party' written and directed by Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh appears at first to be the kind of party you could find at anyone's house at any time in any place subtle differences begin to surface that separates it from what could be considered the norm.'  Because beyond certain corporate similarities the entertainment industry is quite unlike any other and that goes especially for the people who inhabit it.  Sure actors writers directors etc. are people just like anyone else but their particular perceptions and priorities necessarily shift them into a unique position within the landscape of the human condition wherein they exist amongst their own and for the most part play the game by their own rules.  This is a generalization of course not every actor or artist lives in the style depicted in this film but many do.  In the final analysis Hollywood is not called LaLa Land' for no reason and Cumming and Leigh know it.  Welcome to a world in which anything is acceptable anything goes and usually does.Writerdirector Joe Therrian Cumming and actress Sally Nash Leigh have prepared a party to celebrate their six years together not that they have actually been together' the entire time but according to the actorartist math it's close enough.  Close friends and associates have been invited to share whatever this is with them as well as a couple of neighbors Monica and Ryan Rose Mina Badie Denis O'Hare who have certain issues' with Joe and Sally.  And much to the chagrin of the aging' Sally whose career seems to be on the wane Joe has invited the hot young upandcomer in town Skye Davidson Gwyneth Paltrow to the party.  As the evening wears on into the early morning hours true feelings are gradually revealed amid a game of charades rather a production' of charades these people are forever on' as well as the sharing of a certain product' given as a present to Joe and Sally by Skye.  And so what began as a celebration in the cold hard light of morning just may be remembered as something entirely different.  Welcome to the wonderful world of show biz.The daughter of actor Vic Morrow Jennifer Jason Leigh was born into the business so to speak Alan Cumming on the other hand will have to come up with his own excuse.  But they have collaborated perhaps conspired' would be more accurate to bring to the screen an interesting thought provoking story that for all intents and purposes seems at least as if it could be a composite of actual experiences and people they have known.  Which means they've succeeded in delivering a film that has the decided flavor of reality about it and for the most part it's extremely engaging and often riveting drama.  it may be a film that many will have trouble connecting with though if only because it is bound to fall outside the realm of personal experience for them.  Most of the issues in this story are simply unfamiliar territory to the greater part of the world's population with the exception of those dealing with the more universal themes like the appreciation of a child's song or the irritation of the perpetual barking of a neighbor's dog.What really sells the project though and maintains interest is the excellent ensemble cast the filmmakers have assembled here portraying an inordinate number of characters driven by lookatme! egos yet each presented within their own unique perspectives and contexts.  At the center of the fray of course is Cumming and Leigh each of whom do a solid job of anchoring the myriad situations and scenarios generated through by and around them.  Leigh successfully conveys a sense of insecurity consistent with Sally's current status and Cumming does a good job of making Joe quite unlikable affecting as he does the look attitude and personality born of an overblown and bloated ego.  it's a portrayal that effectively points up the absolute boorishness that can be found within this community.Paltrow meanwhile perfectly captures the essence of the shallow and relatively clueless ingenue the vast majority of whom become a flavor of the week before disappearing into the obscurity of Hollywood's human outbox.'  While Phoebe Cates as former actress Sophia Gold represents the opposite end of the spectrum a young woman perfectly content with her current role of wife and mother.  And Kevin Kline is convincing as her husband actor Cal Gold who though successful is still visited with insecurities and doubt and his performance is one of the highlights of the film.Also turning in performances that stand out from the rest are Mina Badie Leigh's real life halfsister as the neighbor who comes to the party offering conciliatory overtures toward a more neighborly' relationship John C. Reilly as Mac Forsyth a veteran director struggling with his latest project the star of which just happens to be Sally Nash and Peter Sellers look alike Michael Panes as Sally's talented friend Levi.Rounding out the exceptional cast are Jane Adams Clair John Benjamin Hickey Jerry Parker Posey Judy Jennifer Beals Gina Matt Malloy Sanford and Owen Kline and Greta Kline Kevin and Phoebe's real life children as Jack and Evie Gold.  A film that is more interesting than entertaining The Anniversary Party' nevertheless offers the viewer a chance to vicariously explore and experience Tinsel Town from the dark side of the curtain some will find it exciting while others will deem it decidedly unglamorous.  Either way Cumming and Leigh are to be commended for making it real.'  It's the magic of the movies.  710.".

	schema:reviewBody "I looked at this DVD for the first time in at least 5 or 6 years. I am a fan of the genre but had forgotten about the film.Looking back at it after all this time I now understand what made this flick so forgettable.Do not get me wrong a couple of these type of ensemble movies are among my alltime favorites including The Big Chill and It's My Party. This movie however is nearly unwatchable in parts.Sorry but the casting of the entire Kline family to play....The Klines...was cringeinducing. Similarly the central characters are not believable from the getgo. The entire movie plays out as an actors exercise with dollops of insider references sprinkled throughout to give everyone a sense of what Hollywood is allegedly all about.I am not sure how many times the term 'selfindulgement' popped up in my mind while watching this but it was my primary thought through the entire first halfhour. With a setup this superficial any of the developing drama was bound to fall flat.

I am a fan of the genre but had forgotten about the film.Looking back at it after all this time I now understand what made this flick so forgettable.Do not get me wrong a couple of these type of ensemble movies are among my alltime favorites including The Big Chill and It's My Party. This movie however is nearly unwatchable in parts.Sorry but the casting of the entire Kline family to play....The Klines...was cringeinducing. Similarly the central characters are not believable from the getgo. The entire movie plays out as an actors exercise with dollops of insider references sprinkled throughout to give everyone a sense of what Hollywood is allegedly all about.I am not sure how many times the term 'selfindulgement' popped up in my mind while watching this but it was my primary thought through the entire first halfhour. With a setup this superficial any of the developing drama was bound to fall flat.

	schema:reviewBody "If you are reading these comments then you may be looking for some insight before you rent this movie or after you had just seen it.  Most of the unfavorable comments arise from the perspective of Ryan Rose played by Denis O'Hare the neighbor or outsider of the Hollywood business and the audience of the movie.  The entire movie shot in digital video DV is like this loud barking dog represented by critics acclaiming the movie as one of the years' best and the audience just can't stand it.  They want to just kill the dog see How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog and go on to the next movie.Well if you feel that way so be it.I think this movie is a real gem.  If you're looking for a real plotyou won't find much here except some surprising character revelations.  This film is shot in a dogmamagnoliatenebaums style where the moments and emotions fuel the movie rather than a specific character transformation from point A to point B.  It's a comedy where the actors' and directors' intent is to poke fun in their own lives and world.  If you're looking for sympathetic characters with no flawsyou won't find any here except maybe the neighbors who are the outsiders.  Then again these characters were not made to be sympathetic but for you to take them as who they are.The film starts out very slowly like the preparation of any party.  While the leads do not take any part in the actual preparation a glimpse into their lives are seen.  The camera and directing moves around like a voyeur into different rooms and conversations when the partygoers arrive.  The directing style is very close and personal intimate and claustrophobic at times but raw and real.Real and as real as it can ever get in Hollywood.  For example two couples are played by actors who are married to each other in real life Kline and Cates the Golds and Hickey and Posey the Adams.  Kline and Cates' real life children also participate in some very very adorable scenes which may lend to their future acting careers.  The photographs on the wall were taken by Jennifer Beals who has photographed the couple a lot in preproductionthough you can't see them up close.  Otis is Jennifer Jason Leigh's dog outside of this film and in this film.  Even the yoga instructor and props are part of Leigh's life.  Cumming and Leigh wrote the scripts with these SPECIFIC actors and actresses in mind thus giving them mannerisms they actually do on film and also not on camera.  There is this portion in the film where the guests came up with toasts celebrating Cumming and Leigh's anniversary.  However these toasts were not scripted but improvised or written by the characters themselves to surprise Cumming and Leigh.  The toasts themselves were very creative and yet within their characters.  Cumming even signs his own book in real life called Tommy's Toy for a neighbor.  Cumming claims in the DVD that he will finish that book sometime this year.Yeah whatever.Sure all this seems very selfimportant indulgent stereotypical Hollywood glamour but I haven't seen any authentic casting like this in any other movie.  Even though they are all actors playing actors who are close friends in real life it is an effortless and authentic kind of feeling you get when you watch them interact with each other. If you didn't know that beforehand then maybe you won't be able to tell the difference.I enjoyed this one scene when they were playing Charades.  I guess actors take this game seriously because in a way it is their craft so they pick these obscure titles from novels songs or whatever for the other team to guess.  But in one scene Jerry Adams the business man plays by Hickey goes absolutely ballistic and overly competitive.  Like a whining critic cursing at a bad movie for cheating him out of his money and time he hilariously verbally jumps on his own teammates for not going on to the next syllable or not getting the point.  Don't you know someone like that when you are playing this friendly board game or party game?Possible spoiler ahead.There is no real plot but two points the movie attempts to get across. First of all everyone is flawedthe dialogue scathingly points out the scratches on every character.  These flaws are mainly demonstrated in the Hollywood perspective of deciding to have a child.  Second the choice of having a career versus having a child and family is the centerpiece of this film.  The issue is brought out in the interactions between Jane Adams child but still working and stressed Cates two children not working and happy? and Leigh working but going downhill but her husband wants a child.   This depends on the maturity of the charactersi.e. whether or not they are still thinking they are 10 years younger than they really are and the flaw in Leigh's character not willing to give up her career and her desire to play some role she can no longer play.  Though it also seems Leigh's character's personal life in the film is affecting her acting career in her latest project it is an introspective look on the choices we make in our personal lives in terms of drawing a line between the workplace and home.  If the line becomes blurry or it doesn't exist in this glass house they live in then how would you cope with it if you were in their shoes?  Are their shoes any different form ours?The ending seems somewhat forced and abrupt but overall for a 19 day shoot I guess they did the best with what they had.  710.  I was pleasantly surprised.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not sure I can conjure the words to describe how abhorrently bad this film was.I feel like filing a civil case against the producers for pain and suffering. Even though I was it months ago I cannot rest until I get this out of my system. I can never look at Alan Cummings a great actor the same way again...The only reason I can see that people would rate it highly is that 1 they live in the same LANY industry crowd andor 2 they know someone affiliated with the production.I don't mind that there was really no plot and a great deal of ad hoc many good films today explore alternate styles and succeed. But this was essentially a professionally edited LA home movie. Sitting through the entire thing was akin to your uncle holding you captive to his Paris vacation video.You develop no sympathy for any of the selfabsorbed film industry characters except maybe the otherwise normal neighbors who complain about the dog. If as many people comment this was a true insight and satiric look at the LA crowd then I am ashamed to be a part of the same nation as they. A culture of people whose lives revolve around how many names they can drop how many awards they win how much money they make how cleverly they can backstab everyone around them and how many pictures of themselves they have in their richly decorated homes. Ugh.The precious speeches given at the party with deeply meaningful gifts were the worst torture. You come to despise the main characters and then need to sit through a celebration of their love for each other? I kept thinking...this has to end soon and then like a bad business seminar where you pray for a coffee break another awful speech would ensue.And don't get me started on the midfilm tragedy that unfolds. Dear God why did we need that on top of everything else. A vehicle for the actors to show how great they are by displaying the full range of their talents? Pass the Prozac.Anything redeeming? Yes 2 things. 1 the actors truly must be talented to evoke such a strong reaction I will give you that and 2 if you see this and it reminds you of your life and your friends use it as a barometer to indicate the desperate need for immediate changes.".

They take ecstasy and have some dramatic revelations. Thecentral relationship is a woman who has married a gay man proving howsmart she is and making it hard to care about the bed she or her maidhas made and is now lying in. Gwenneth Paltrow appears in this film as abeguiling young famous actress who when on drugs does a very odd danceby the pool at which point I thought that I was the one on drugs. Sheis lovely to look at but I still wonder if anybody is upstairs if youknow what I mean. Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as always as is KevinKline but everyone else suffers under the weight of the mediocrescript. This is no Big Chill or even Little Chill it's just roomtemperature.".

That she was one of the forces behind this film made my decision to rent it easy. As always her performance as actress here is relentlessly professional  she knows her job and does it well.The script is  well questionable. Written by the central characters for themselves and their friends filmed by apparently a circle of friends about lives in the movie industry. As Heinlein said There's no shame in writing but do it in private and wash your hands afterward. This is either masturbatory or selfrevelatory and it's not easy for this audience to know which. That's okay  it was an interesting evening's viewing and it'll find its way into my personal collection sometime soon.The acting is flawless  no clunkers no false notes and some points of excellence. JJL was in particular good at showing a side I'd have thought she'd be afraid to face  the aging hasbeen. Many of the company I'd not seen before  but everyone down to America the maid shows their characters beautifully.I don't really know if this movie was supposed to show the insiders' view of life in the movie industry or a parody of that life  but it's an engaging story. It could have used a bit more sparkle and perhaps a bit less pathos in one evening  but it did ring true throughout.Folks either like this or loathe it  I suggest that you watch it yourself and see what camp you land in. My daughter was a tad surprised to find how much she enjoyed it.Daughter 14 sez Very odd. It shows movie stars writers and important people  being just like normal human beings are.".

The storyline as a whole is the only significant problem I have with the movie. It is more or less the events that take place during an anniversary party consisting of important people of the entertainment world. Of course this variation of people does lead to a gettogether that deviates from what one would expect from the average party. Nevertheless an anniversary party is still just that meaning charades and singalongs are only amusing for however long one can tolerate them.

Under the effect of Ecstasy revelations are disclosed and relationships deteriorate among the group.The Anniversary Party is a deceptive pretentious and boring apology to Ecstasy. One of the best and first movies about reunion of friends that I recall is the wonderful Peter's Friends. Since then I have watched dozens of this type of independent lowbudget movie and The Anniversary Party is certainly one of the worst. The story begins without any previous development of any of the many characters and the viewer understands how they are connected to each other along the story. However the story goes nowhere and the ambiguous lead character Joe Therrian is not clearly defined he seems to be a shallow bisexual selfish man without giving attention to his wife to his needy sister to his muse to his neighbor and only caring to his dog. The other lead character Sally Nash seems to be a decadent insecure confused actress. With two unpleasant people hosting different guests with their heads full of alcohol and drugs the screenplay could not be much better. My vote is five.Title Brazil Aniversrio de Casamento Wedding Anniversary".

This woman is regarded by many in Hollywood to be a great actress which does in part explain why American movies are so awful. She is a dullard. Her name in the cast list of any movie is like a warning that a dull movie lies in store  and she MADE this one. I got the impression from the film that she thinks that it represents how people truly are and what real life is  but if for some reason she happens to be reading this let me say emphatically to her that it does NOT. Of course it does paint a picture of her tragic little world of NY to LA movie types  but that is her problem and there is a real life beyond Hollywood's artificial one it's telling how these adults take Ecstacy a kiddie drug that provides users with artificial emotions to go with their artificial lives. I do not want to be a part of that world and do not want to attend their parties therefore I am sorry that I watched this. It might be a good wakeup call to anyone who dreams of movie stardom though. These people are so full of themselves because they are so empty of everything else.

And a false myth is born.Although there is a complex epic plot the film feels more like a series of still pictures. There is a lot of symbolism and the plot slows down so that you can fully enjoy it. Apart from the story the Bathory also takes some time to explain how myths are created and abused to serve ones needs. The acting is outstanding but does not stand out as much as the Hungarian costumes that make the film look fresh.Unfortunately the movie is significantly flawed by repetitive comic relief in which two monks use various inventions to spy on the countess. They seem to have come from another movie and make you question the taste of the writers. Should there be a version without those comedians a 910 rating would be appropriate.".

In some moments she seems to be sadistic and in other moments she seems to be very pure. The subplots with the Italian painter and the two spymonks are quite unnecessary and ridiculous.In the end director Juraj Jakubisko wastes a great budget and a story with a good potential with a confused tale of greed and treason.

It doesn't try to be blandly mainstream the director is too talented for that he has too much vision to fit in with the prosaic  boring and anodyne rot usually filling our screens. This film entertains with gusto flair beauty and horror. One may quibble with any film and look for faults but this film is fascinating and compelling suitable for anyone interested in the drama of the life of Erzsebet Bathory. One soon comes to see through the eyes of the lead characters their brutal and beautiful world lives and breathes again shockingly before our eyes.Erzsabet's story is told in a such a colourful dynamic and thoroughly gripping way that certainly had me looking forward to seeing more like asking for a second helping of a surprisingly delicious pudding I relished what I found to be so enjoyable after having heard such bad reviews. Erzsabet's life and times were brutal and this is shown graphically but not too eye wateringly. The performances are highly entertaining and extremely powerful especially the characters of Erzsabet Caravaggio and Thurzo. Some have quibbled about the English accents of the actors but actually I thought Ezsabet's Hungarian accent rather convincing the chill of steel to the edge of her voice. It is a very accessible story so who would be so daft as to require the actors to speak Hungarian and so lose half the audience who are either too dense or lazy to read subtitles. Frankly a ridiculous quibble one does not notice anything but how fine the performances truly are.Visually stunning and beautiful the script gives us a thumpingly good story and altogether it is a mesmerising piece of cinema. It is so powerful that twenty four hours after watching it still haunts me and I look forward to seeing more from this director and creative team. I feel I've discovered at last a piece of English language cinema that isn't formulaic that isn't dull and predictable that isn't the same old same old that isn't like every other pleasant enough but unimaginative 'product' here is something unique and artistically brave and exciting. Altogether I think one would have to be in a very sour and unforgiving mood to find fault. If you want to be entertained and why else watch everyone should enjoy this unfairly maligned but unusually fascinating film.".

When honestly... if they had somewhat of a more open mind.. they would have got it. As well.. if they had read the description of the movie.. it clearly says this is the story of opposing the thought of her being an actual serial killer a.k.a Historical Fiction film.Anyways....The flashbacks or dreams or whatever... were showing you the mind of Elizabeth and what she wanted despite the fact she was going crazy and could not tell between reality and dreams. The green dreams most of them were showing the future and the moment it happened it showed you again to be reminded. As for the acting... I saw nothing wrong with it at all. It was not BRated at all.. and I can tell you this..Anna did one heck of a job compared to some very famous actresses like Megan fox who cannot act at all. I do agree some of the comedy with the monks in there was out of place.. but there was a reason behind it I am sure. Other than that... this movie was NOT a waste of time and I'd watch it over and over again.So I rate this 910. It is worth a watch... unless your one of those people who always fell asleep during history class and do not know the true story of Elizabeth Bathory. and again this is Historic FICTION film.".

You'll also either love or hate the involvement of painter Caravaggio. Historical inaccuracies aside and the unnecessary humour injected usually by the monk this incarnation of the legend is very interesting and adds food for thought to the tale of Bthory. In addition it gives an interesting portrayal of politics religion and royalty of the time.Anna Friel is fantastic as the missjudged Erzsbet Bthory and gives a wonderful performance full of range and emotional depth. It's not all out horror a possible nod to Ingrid Pitt in Countess Dracula 1970.CoStar Karel Roden is on top form as Juraj Thurzo and Vincent Regan is notable. The supporting cast do just that. The principle characters have strong motivations for their actions and the morale choices are at times shades of grey.It's not without its faults but there's a handful of interesting dream and hallucination sequences and enough twists on the tale to keep you watching.

I also really liked the twist on the Bathory tale which I wont describe here to avoid spoilers but I will say it may be the best thing to come from the film. There were times I truly enjoyed watching Bathory and was enthralled by the story.But having said all these nice things and recommending a watch for certain people I cannot emphasize enough how dreadful this film was. The dialog was horrible many of the actors in important roles come off as amateur at best and the worst crime here is the addition of the monks as poorly conceived vehicles for exposition and totally unnecessary comic relief. This element of the film is so terribly bad and inappropriate that whoever introduced it into this film needs to never ever be involved in making another movie again because they are clearly incompetent. That may sound over the top but I cannot stress enough how much it hurt this film. I saw the need for exposition but it could have been done in a myriad of more appropriate ways and the comic aspects were so completely out of place here it killed any mood the film created. It truly helped ruin what could have been a fantastic movie.That is the most obvious example of what makes Bathory so disappointing  seeing the potential of what could have been great constantly squandered by bad film making. They made a world class epic film with excellent technical work a great reimagining of the Bathory legend and a good performance by Ms. Friel but regularly sabotaged it. The entire time I watched it the thought running through my mind was It could have been so good! so it was quite a frustrating experience.I gave Bathory a 4 which I think is fair. To explain  on one hand it may deserve a bit higher rating but on the other hand I was originally going to give it a 2 or 3 simply because when the film was at it's best you see it could have been an 8  10 but they just kept ruining it. I went higher because I felt a score that low wouldn't give enough credit to the people who did a very good job in an otherwise bad film but anything over a 4 would be rewarding the incompetence as well.What a missed opportunity.".

Little is left of facts and the rest are testimonies obtained by tortures those aren't much reliable. I read a lot of reviews on IMDb of this film rarely flattering. In my opinion it deserves better. Bathory 2008 is beautifully made into a sad dreamlike tale. I was positively surprised how much attention was paid to costumesscenographyobjects accuracy. Thanks to that I felt more and could imagine better the spirit of 16th century. Much attention was paid to details again costumes carts and amazing locations. Film well worth seeing. The only fall back for me was the strange mix of English speech with heavy Hungarian accents. I just detest this kind of universalization. Why not make a film in Hungarian with English subtitles? Much better.".

Little is left of facts and the rest are testimonies obtained by tortures those aren't much reliable. I read a lot of reviews on IMDb of this film rarely flattering. In my opinion it deserves better. Bathory 2008 is beautifully made into a sad dreamlike tale. I was positively surprised how much attention was paid to costumesscenographyobjects accuracy. Thanks to that I felt more and could imagine better the spirit of 16th century. Much attention was paid to details again costumes carts and amazing locations. Film well worth seeing. The only fall back for me was the strange mix of English speech with heavy Hungarian accents. I just detest this kind of universalization. Why not make a film in Hungarian with English subtitles? Much better.";

It's my opinion that if you didn't find it amusing then its most likely more of a cultural difference than a matter of taste. This type of humor is very common in Slovakia and Romania. I'm saying this as a SlovakAmerican someone married to a Romanian and who lived in Romania for five years.I also agree with the reviewers who point out this is a postmodernist historical fiction. It's more of a fantasy than either a horror tale or historical biography.Yes there are some flaws with the pointofview at the beginning. The first part was disjointed because it kept switching plot lines and character focus but the second and third parts worked magically. I'm sure it also seemed complex or confusing if you are not familiar with the inner struggles and politics of the Hungarians Slovaks and Romanians at that time. But I find it interesting and even amusing that the conflicts still continue within these reviews about whose version of history is right or best  the Hungarian Catholics the Lutherans the Slovaks the Romanians in Transylvania etc. That's basically the point of the movie! We'll never know the truth unless we could have had some spies there writing it all down in a record that also verified the other evidence. Every noble family and religion in that space has always had political power motives in presenting their own versions of history. It gets so crazy and sad at a point that all you can do is make a joke like the monks and try to laugh so you don't go crazy too.".

The dialogues are awful the characters are weak and the political situation depicted is so simple and primitive as if it was made up by pupils of a Slovakian primary school.The battle of Esztergom the city is Hungary's first and main archdiocesan centre one of the 12 most important battles against Turkish occupation is fought in this film among a dozen tents.Caravaggio who never went to Upper Hungary is an important character of this film. Represented as a bisexual having sexual relationship with Erzsbet Bthory he escapes from custody through some secret dungeons nobody knew but him. Ridiculous.The monks in the movie invent some kind of phototaking camera a parachute a stethoscopelike monitoring bug and roller skating with hairspring shoes that automatically climb mountains.The makers of the movie suggest that the first Hungarian library was founded in the early 17. century. In reality there was a library in my homeland as early as the year 1000. Have they heard about the Corvinas?The audience is also told that in the 16. century 13 languages were spoken in Hungary which did not exist as a whole as one third was occupied by the Habsburg Empire one third by the Turkish Empire. I would say there had to be even more different languages in a chaos like that not just thirteen. People watching the movie are not told either that Hungary was torn to three pieces at that time and that a considerable population of Hungarians died in the 150 years of fighting against Turkish invaders.The main language spoken in the film was EnglishSlovakian with a few sentences in Hungarian German and Italian. The whole movie should have been filmed in Hungarian or better in Latin since those were the tongues the noblemen talked in. Thus the film is upside down since only some of the supporting actors have only a few sentences in Hungarian. The ones that should be in Slovakian. That's why one might conclude that Hungarians could say only things like fck you you btch the rotten dogs sht their pants oh my God etc.There is also a very lame performance of Jnos Szappanyos of Debreczen's poem Militaris congratulatio comitatus Bihariensis which by the way was dedicated to Istvn Bocskai not to Ndasdy.The distorted character of Gyrgy Thurz is really pathetic as he plays the role of the main villain responsible for nearly all the miseries of Erzsbet Bthory even for the death of her relative the distant Gbor Bthory Prince of Transylvania.In general Hungarian noblemen are depicted as stupid uneducated and aggressive. In actual fact the court of Ferenc Ndasdy was a splendid example of fine renaissance art. He even had a printinghouse in Srvr.I am a Hungarian historian I wrote my thesis from XVI. century and I feel a bit funny about how Slovaks make a derogatory film about Hungarian history with British actors. Tnde Lengyel the historian who helped the development of this film proved to be really professional when creating the background by costumes and scenery. It's a shame she could not alter the stupidity of the whole movie.".

The suspense is mounting and murders of innocent maids baths in blood and occasional turning of the vile noblewoman into a black cat are just around the corner. At first glance all we see is beautiful lady with an enormous hairdo Anna Friel  a truly nice performance! who is wildly rich but unhappy in an arranged marriage. No wonder that when the unloved husband sends her a young painter Hans Matheson with an order to paint a portrait of her faster than you pronounce in the clothes I cannot distinguish the curves of your body'' she finds herself engaged into an emotional relationship with him. Short takes shot with artistic craftsmanship introduce us to permanently new situations that wear out at the moment the take is over building up atmosphere rather than summing up into a coherent story. At a quick pace we recognize that the lady likes to ride her husband shouting ''hajra'' meaning ''let's go'' in Hungarian that she lost her baby after being raped by the husband when he appeared at home from the war against Turks that he regrets what he has done understanding that the war has made a beast from him that her hairdo is fake that the painter is Caravaggio that the greedy neighbor who wishes to steal three lakes from her Karel Roden likes to play chess that Caravaggio would wear a hat with burning candles when painting at night yes just like Forman's Goya and so forth. While this is going on every now and then there appears a remark or a situation that reminds us that the main character is THE Elizabeth Bathory. Finally we see her doing something which seems to confirm beyond all doubt her reputation  only to find during the next take that she was under the influence of some hallucinogenic mushroom and did not know about herself. It is like chess game with an opponent having all forces ready for attack but keeping to maneuver as if he was following some secret plan.  SPOILER  For me the decisive evidence that I got the heroine wrong came shortly after the mushroom incident with a certain finding  let me put it in this way in order to soften the spoiler  of two monks a sophisticated old man and a boy who were investigating the proceedings in the castle of Cachtice just like the couple in The Name of the Rose was investigating the proceedings in the abbey  but hey how much of the Shakespeare's stuff was really original?. It was as late as that when I finally realized what the director who is also the principal author of the script has been telling us from the beginning that countess Dracula was not Dracula at all. Many will charge the movie with a deliberate distortion of history but its creator does not take notice of the battle cry of enemy combat orders and like a knight of an old romance carries on with his brave campaign to clean up the name of a noble lady. So far so good. But then again why he confuses us for a better part of the movie making us think that the heroine is just as spoiled as the Guinness Book of World Records claims? When he postpones the revelation of the premise of the movie he is putting himself at risk that the movie will produce massive disappointment in the audiences and attacks on the box office to get back the entrance fee. The more knightly is his deed but anyway what is the possible purpose to play with the viewer like that? Because he plays chess with US not with the countess and what appeared to be mysterious maneuvers on his part was in fact a row of subsequent sacrifices before the surprising final combination. However the chess player who has lost the game can still enjoy the shear aesthetics of his defeat. The artist arranged the scene in such a realistic manner that the viewer is convinced it is meant to represent reality and after the mistake becomes clear an expiration of enchantment ensues. Like when Judith is just about to behead Holofernes but after Caravaggio waves his hand she puts down the knife and Holofernes stands up from the couch with a smile.".

This was after all the era of John Ruskin separate spheres and the notion of woman as civilizing influence. Thus Elisabeth Bathory was turned into a supernatural fiend whose story mainly served to warn women of the evils of female vanity.Apparently we have not come very far from the mentality of the nineteenth century for we still live in a culture that cannot or will not view women as anything other than wholesome pillars of moral rectitude. Thus Karla Homolka's depredations were whitewashed in a loathsome and factually corrupt straighttovideo movie. Aileen Wuornos is turned into some kind of culture hero. And gender feminists refer to the likes of Homolka and others as classic examples of female victims of male sadism. Now we have this pack of lies in which Bathory is victimized by power hungry men while she valiantly strives to protect her children. Yes the old standby folks when you want to make excuses for evil women just portray them as nurturing and selfsacrificing willingly shouldering the burden of undeserved ignominy for the sake of their children. The kind of characterization which has nauseated feminists and gelded Marxist males for generations but which they never fail to exploit when it suits their purposes.I'm a huge fan of the beautiful and talented Anna Friel. Her presence and performance are the only reasons I give this piece of dreck two stars. May everyone else involved with its production rot in hell.".

Props and carriages and towns are excellently done.What are a little odd for me are Elsebeths dreams. Even though I now recognize the coloration changes indicating her dreamstate it was sometimes hard to determine when she was dreaming and when not. This may have been intended as she had the same difficulty. The thing that did not belong at all in this movie was a very minor comic relief yes comic relief from the 2 monks who for some crazy reason had rollerskates key wound power shoes and other technology that had no bearing on this movie at all. While the film is Czech and possibly different whomever had the idea to do this did not belong.What was done nicely was the wrap up at the end of that Elsebeth was likely framed by the Hapsburgs. That to me is the most believable explanation of what she was accused of. To have killed 650 or even 50 maidens and bathed in their blood while everyone feared Gods wrath at every corner and everyone in the town would have know is a pretty ludicrous idea. It is more likely she was innocent and framed for her wealth and power. Worth watching for any history buff but be forewarned it is a long ride.".

The passionately love story with the painter Caravaggio is very catching. If I would have lived in the 16th century and I would have seen Anna Friel as the countess Bathory I had fallen in love with her for sure. The rest of the actors and the director did a good job.

It's true that Erzsbet Bthory had fought a lot against the Turks not personally of course but these scenes don't have anything to do with the plot. They could have made 1 grand battle scene with lots of men and with a better design. Sometimes less is more.English language is good sure the film can get to a larger audience this way but authenticity should have required Hungarian. I mean we are talking about a SlovakianCzech production here Hungary is not on the other end of the world and there are more than halfmillion Hungarians living in Slovakia. Funny thing is Hungarian language can be heard throughout the movie  usually when cussing or shouting  but it's pretty pointless just like the use of Slovak. Just to remain at historical facts nobility spoke either in Hungarian German or Latin peasants and servants spoke Slovakian in the upper parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. Staying at the dialogues they were awfully simple the scriptwriter must have been either very young or had some difficulties with English.Relating to the previous point the filmmakers completely left out Hungary of the creation of the movie and  therefore  the movie seemingly suffers from historical inaccuracy. I may sound a bit bitter here but you don't go on making a movie about Africa for example without actually going to Africa and without the advices of real Africans. Oh well maybe next time.There are scenes which are simply laughable the best one was when Hungarian soldiers are attacking and raping Turkish women !. Yep you heard it right Turks are invading the Kingdom of Hungary and they bring along their women into a war zone right.The movie is watchable but I was expecting a lotlot more since Erzsbet Bthory lived in the territory of modern day Slovakia back then it was the Kingdom of Hungary. A major disappointment for me.".

Of course the film never sounded like it was ever going to be remembered for its script but this is beyond bad.We're first introduced to the two American girls who pretty as they may be seem to lack any form of intelligence or general common sense. They are driving to a night club as you do when they take a wrong turn and end up getting a puncture. Now this is where things get bad. So the girls are stranded failing to know how to operate a jack and attach a spare wheel the girls decide to look for help. Cue a three minute pointless piece of film making where a randy German man gives his thoughts about the girls in German. Laughable honestly. So the man drives off and the girls decide the best thing to do is to go and look for help.. By walking through the woods and coming across a house in the middle of nowhere with a man that answers the door with the most evil face in the world who's first question is are you alone? Welcoming.See the film goes on with its rather pointless set ups like these which just make you think who would do that? I mean there is one moment in the film that really grabbed my attention the girls are tied to the patient beds and the doctor goes out to bury the truck driver in the garden. He then goes out and gets the Japanese man from somewhere. The doctor then tells them all his dastardly plan then goes off. Later he comes back to start the procedure by injecting them to put them to sleep. Now only at this moment does the one girl decide she can undo the one wrist with her teeth and get out. I understand you have to make the film but bloody hell thats just ridiculous I mean he'd buried a man and found a new man before the girls even tried to escape? They could have boarded a flight back to the US or even tried to find that night club if they'd have just stopped crying for however long they had been.So we come to the birth of the centipede and things go from bad to worse I'm afraid.

I'm only a student and still see some big mistakes. Obviously they hadn't even a nurse on the set.The odds that two random persons are compatible to each other are quite low that's one of the problems with organtransplant. How lucky is he that the two girls match! And since the third guy isn't he just go grab a random Japanese guy out of his backyard who apparently hasn't a clue what he's doing in Germanylet alone Europe. He doesn't speak neither English nor German nor any other language except for Japanese.Girl number 2 shows rejection signs at the end of the movie. Which shows that a the doctor hasn't worked sterile he scratches his forehead during the operation an error a regular surgeon would never do or bhe didn't gave immunosuppressing medication a real doctor would never oversee such a thing or c they didn't matched but as you can see prior to the operation he had them tested.About that test as far as I know it's not the kind of test you can run in your basement and I really doubt that you can make a lab do that from anonymous people for someone without a practitioners license anyway. As he is 'retired' most likely fired for his dogexperiment it' s very highly likely that he hasn't got his license anymore  no professional secrecy possible.By far the most hilarious error is when he has his stethoscope in his ears.. He has it in the wrong direction!!! A stethoscope should be worn so that the earcanal and the branches of the stethoscope are in the prolongation of each other. Like he is wearing it it makes a small angle. This is something anyone with paramedical knowledge would see right away. please feel free to search the internet for proper stethoscope wearing instructions if I didn't made myself clear on this pointIf I were a very sickminded exsurgeon I would have connected their bloodcircuit. Without it survival is impossible from the start. First you can't survive eating excrement from just one person second as the urinary tracts are not connected either the second and third subject would die from dehydration even before they'd die from hunger and third connecting the rectum with the mouth makes it possible for bacteria from the lower gastric tract f.e. E.Coli to infect the upper gastric tract of the second person resulting in diarrhea in the first place probably followed by generalized infection and death later on. There's a reason why the intestinal tract is segregated.And my last point is the following the second girl dies apparently from generalized infection. If that's the case the first girl would be evenly infected. You should also be aware that dying from generalized infection is quite a slow death involving very high fever and tissue necrosis which she doesn't shows symptoms of.Except from the medical point of view there are other illogic things the police's behavior towards the doctor the neighbors hearing screamsbut not another house in sight and the police shows up very late compared to when the screams might have been heard. And how the hell did the doctor managed to plant the scalpel in the first policeman's neck while unable to do anything else but crawling?Furthermore there is nothing innovating compared to other horror movies. See colleagues' reviews I think I made my point clear but if realism doesn't bother you you might like it. Although I really doubt it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well where to start? Sat down and watched this after being told you have to see this to believe it. What did they mean? It'll make you sick it'll make you turn your eyes away. I was very intrigued. I have been watching horror movies since my teens at the cinema and even earlier if I include the Hammer Horrors on late night TV.So I like to think I know a decent Horror when I see one. I am so used to the hype around these movies. I used to fall for the tag lines 'scariest movie ever' etc etc etc. More often than not deflated and let down at the failure of all the claims made in advertisements. Which means in recent years I have become picky about what horrors to watch. Did The Human Centipede live up to the hype. As far as I am concerned on many levels it did. I thought I was going to hate it. Once you get over the extremely twisted premise of an evil doctor attaching humans together in a very disgusting way. This is a really good little low budget Horror. There I said it. I liked this. There is nearly no gore most of the horror is built in the imagination in the tense build up and a genuine sympathy for the victims of the mad doctor. Oh.... and what a mad doctor he is scary sadistic and as mad as the maddest hatter! This movie achieves a certain sense of foreboding and dark oppressiveness that big budget horrors never manage. OK I agree the premise is totally bizarre but it is a horror movie and it makes a great change from the usual slasher movies and supernatural flicks. In a few years this will be regarded as a great example of tense thrilling and yes horrific filmmaking.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well where to start? Sat down and watched this after being told you have to see this to believe it. What did they mean? It'll make you sick it'll make you turn your eyes away. I was very intrigued. I have been watching horror movies since my teens at the cinema and even earlier if I include the Hammer Horrors on late night TV.So I like to think I know a decent Horror when I see one. I am so used to the hype around these movies. I used to fall for the tag lines 'scariest movie ever' etc etc etc. More often than not deflated and let down at the failure of all the claims made in advertisements. Which means in recent years I have become picky about what horrors to watch. Did The Human Centipede live up to the hype. As far as I am concerned on many levels it did. I thought I was going to hate it. Once you get over the extremely twisted premise of an evil doctor attaching humans together in a very disgusting way. This is a really good little low budget Horror. There I said it. I liked this. There is nearly no gore most of the horror is built in the imagination in the tense build up and a genuine sympathy for the victims of the mad doctor. Oh.... and what a mad doctor he is scary sadistic and as mad as the maddest hatter! This movie achieves a certain sense of foreboding and dark oppressiveness that big budget horrors never manage. OK I agree the premise is totally bizarre but it is a horror movie and it makes a great change from the usual slasher movies and supernatural flicks. In a few years this will be regarded as a great example of tense thrilling and yes horrific filmmaking.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what a pointless and redundant film.It would seem word of mouth has spread into the anus of the internet and shat out this crap film.Despite the hype the Human Centipede does nothing interesting with its premise or characters  its almost as if Six thinks the concept can do most of the leg work for him.And apparently those taken by the original concept require little else from a film  like working through the implications of its own premise or delivering an experience that can stand on its own feet. Take away the striking image of three people turned into a human centipede and you are left with an indistinct film with few thrills.The mad scientist trope barely transcends hackneyed clich and the film completely squanders a great opportunity for subtext what for example is the meaning of a male Asian as the head of the centipede andor what does two American women following him mean? The plot is threadbare and takes the path of least resistance  the pointless film leads from point A to point B. Despite the 'logical' linear approach of the 'narrative' the characters motivations generally defy logic and rational explanation.Unlike great horror movies this film literally has nothing to say about modern culture gender roles human fears or scientific hubris.Even worse the cheap thrills are standard fare. The only thing that can be said in its favor is that some of the images creep in the car the centipede itself are perversely funny.The film fails to suspend disbelief or encourages identification with its own protagonists either. Instead of say feeling sorry for the two female characters in the film you pity the two female actresses playing bare breasted women on all fours and eating crap in the form of Six's 'script'.Dieter was typically creepy as the mad scientist but he can do this stuff in his sleep. Anyone familiar with his work on Lexx knows how remarkable he can be  his Mantrid is amongst the great scifi villains. And the image of Mantrid's floating head on a jar remains much more incisive than anything on display here.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is very difficult to review a movie called The Human Centipede First Sequence. There is little chance one will be lured to a viewing under false pretences so if a movie delivers what you expect is it not then an undisputable success? Yes and no as the film is a struggle between concept execution and nausea but what is admirable in addition to its fearless boundary pushing is its restraint. Yes you read that correctly restraint. Contrary to so many of the torture porn films that try to punch up the shock value through sadism The Human Centipede has almost no blood and lets your imagination fill in the horrific blanks.If you know nothing about this movie allow me to enlighten you. The film revolves around a deranged surgeon who propels the old hallmark of a 'mad doctor' to delirious extremes. He kidnaps people and sews them together mouth to anus yes you also read that correctly. Through that procedure which involves removal of the teeth and stitching together the skin of the forward and rear victim the gastric system is thereby connected. This combined with slicing ligaments in the knees to prevent erect walking and you got yourself one human centipede.Likely your mind is already made up on if you want to see this movie you are either intrigued or repulsed likely both. What elevates The Human Centipede from its high concept is the tension the elements of pitch black humour the subtle skewering of horror conventions and finally the performance of the main villain. The good Doctor Heiter is played by German Dieter Laser or as I like to pronounce in a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression 'Deeder Lazer' and he is truly terrifying icy ruthless and completely unsympathetic towards his captives. He has no motives behind his motives. His drive to create this abomination stems from the death of his '3dog' which I'm sure you can fathom what that entails but his desire to attempt anything in this realm to being with is never explored.The Human Centipede is directed by Tom Six and the man knows how to terrify and disgust in unison. The movie does lose some of its momentum around the  mark but bursts back to life at the finale. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful and affecting in the entire movie and stayed with me far after the initial shock had faded. The slogan for this movie reads '100 medically accurate' and while I'm unsure of the validity of that statement it really stands as a moot point plausible or preposterous The Human Centipede does its job the best since the original Saw.Tom Six is already planning a sequel entitled The Human Centipede Full Sequence. The dark cloud that looms over this project will be the tendency of directors to try an oneup their originals usually through increased gore instead of expanding upon the elements that worked such as the tension and the allowed space for the viewers mind to go wild. Necessity of a followup aside this is one of the single most brazen and memorable works of horror in many years see it if you dare.Read my review of the sequel httpwww.imdb.comtitlett1530509reviews106".

If Tom Six by way of keeping this movie under two hours manages to lose some people's attention span or oversaturate the viewers with shock it's because he didn't make the invitation to his mindset alluring enough. But this movie is an invitation nonetheless and he would probably prefer we stay much longer.It's too easy to get lost in the kneejerk reaction of how this movie must eventually play out but I find myself moving past that and trying to put myself into their shoes all three pairs. I first say that there wasn't any hate on the dear doctor's part. Something incredibly wrong yes but there was no hate. He punished the centipede and disciplined thembut taking out the aspect of hate or mindless brutality or torture we would expect from someone twisted we as the viewers are left with not much to base our discomfort with this movie. Which ultimately adds very subtly a dangerously disturbing feeling Where does one channel the mental fallout while watching this movie?The doctor even takes on a jovial mode as he tries to motivate them to walk in unison definitely not someone who hates people like he states in the beginning. He approaches the segments with care enough to heal them and not leave them neglected a good owner. He even buried the previous attempt his sweet threedog and left a pretty expensive headstone! Like I said not hateful in the least.What I found myself thinking about is how the director's use of madness has a way of drowning out the things the centipede doesn't need so there is some clarity given to them. The madness reveals their basic needs. Bsegment will give up anything to not be put through that ordeal not said explicitly but other things suddenly not as valuable i.e. money. Csegment wants her mom. Asegment confesses his subpar life and wants to be human again. All noble things when done voluntarily. When done under madness of becoming the centipede I think the realization of what we really need just hits home for them to the fact that Asegment feels that the only way to left for him to feel human is to die.It disturbs me that I can't find any hate for this doctor. And it's scary to be invited to Tom Six's head wondering what this movie may have demanded of him to create. I say we can always decline the invite to delve deeper into that thought process but it would be wrong to label this movie as his gratuitous way to live out this weird fantasy. That maybe the doctor's agenda but not the director's. Definitely worth a second look.P.S. If you don't like my review watch it for the sake of seeing how this unravels. You know you want to!".

It's the type of film where you are practically forced to think stuff like what kind of sick and depraved human mind could possibly have come up with such a horror concept. The answer Dutch born writerdirector Tom Six. The Human Centipede starts out like approximately ten thousand other horror movies already did before. Two American girls traveling across Europe get lost with their rental car in a remote German backwoods area. It's the middle of the night and naturally their mobile phones don't detect any signals. Obviously you expect them to end up in a type of torture hostel or in the dungeon of a deranged inbred hillbilly family but no. They end up at the luxurious mansion of the highly respected medical surgeon Dr. Heiter. The good Dr. is retired but still very obsessively working on his lifelong ambition to create the very first unnatural human Siamese triplets! But simply attaching three people together isn't good enough however as he wants them to function as a centipede! Here's how this works in three simple steps 1 you capture three persons and remove their kneecaps so that they can't stand up anymore. 2 You attach the mouth of the second person to the arse of the first person and the mouth of the third person to the arse of the second person. 3 You connect the obligatory intestines and organs to each other so that persons two and three nourish on the excreta of person one. Does all that sound slightly disgusting inhuman and revolting? Well it is actually. Needless to say movies like The Human Centipede are only intended for a very select audience. How can you possibly legitimize your motivations for watching a movie that depicts three people agonizing and undergoing humiliation for no reason other than an irrational and implausible but apparently anatomically attainable medical experiment? I usually say that I'm constantly looking for new horror and cult movies that go far beyond expectancy patterns and commonly used themes. The Human Centipede definitely fits into that category what with its sickening footage and utterly despicable insinuations. The true star of the film is undoubtedly Dieter Lasser who gives a marvelously grotesque performance as the dedicated Dr. Heiter. I've seen quite a bit of mad scientist portrayals in my years as a horror fanatic but Lasser could easily be described as the ultimate stereotype for this role.

I can't just slap a 1010...710...110 on it because I simply don't know. It isn't a film...not in the sense of entertainment. I would almost describe it as a snuff film because its that graphic and horrifying in its idea and feels almost real. Its sick and twisted and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a form of simple entertainment. It would be horrible to spend money to see this. And yet a film connoisseur a horror buff I suppose it needs to be seen and it tells a story that is unlike anything ever shown on screen I am certain. There is a twisted awful and yet awfully amazing performance by the Doctor and you think it has the typical college girls on a lonely road breaks down crazy family andor person finds them but the obvious twist to this story is the sick idea of the human centipede that is where it all comes together so to speak. I've had friends and seen other reviewers call the film boring and that is perhaps it isn't exactly your typical horror film but I know I stayed horrified beginning to end and it leaves you feeling dirty that you even watched it.Prior to being sewn into place actresses Ashley C. Williams and Ashlynn Yennie play best friends driving across Germany. Their acting before meeting the doctor is nothing short of atrocious. Their lines are delivered like a middle schooler that can't read. Once you get into the meat and potatoes and they are turned to scream queens then their performance is slightly better. They manage to pull of scared and tortured better than tourists. Once their mouths are full of butt well then the hard part of acting is over really. Akihiro Kitamura is probably the best actor of the film. He does a great job beginning to end as the man who is tortured and eventually gives up. His screams and pleas for help and safety will get right through your skin. The highlight of the film for me is the absolutely awful and yet deliciously so Dr. Heiter played by Dieter Laser. He is right up there in my books as the silliest but perhaps brilliant serial killer. His twisted demented and absurd performance is memorable to say the least.The Human Centipede gains its following from its reputation of being twisted and I can promise you exactly that. You can't enjoy the film because it isn't entertaining and yet its the true definition of a water cooler film because everyone who has seen it will talk about it. It is incredibly grotesque and disturbing and a lot of the implied gore is thinking about how being in that position would feel. Throughout all of its incredibly morbid moments you will feel ashamed at laughing at some of the more ridiculous moments like Dr. Heiter trying to train his human centipede like a dog. One reviewer described that as stupid but it is ridiculously funny amidst the terrifying moments in the film. Writer and director Tom Six made this film with one goal in mind and that is to shock and that is what it accomplishes. I would never recommend anyone seeing this but if you have a morbid curiosity and a love for horror films than you will see it. However for me I can't say whether I liked it hated it or what my feelings are. I'm torn between feeling really awful about watching it and how unique the concept was. I simply can't put a grade to this. I will however make myself see the sequel...I just don't know what to think. ?10".

All I had heard were negative things and I was honestly preparing myself for a man that would explode into a poor quality cgi centipede that ate people or something. I had not watched a trailer beforehand or really read any synopsis or critic reviews. I was really expecting a terrible film which I could laugh at. After watching the film I was VERY surprised and immediately came online to check what others thought to now feel somewhat embarrassed to say I felt like this film had me pretty gripped on the edge of my seat feeling a lot of tension some slightly sadder feelings and generally pretty satisfied...I want to give this film an 8 out of 10 based on its production quality the acting and the atmosphere and tension created throughout the film.I don't normally enjoy horrorscifi films as much as I used to simply because I have grown tired of the cheap thrills the obsession with unrealistic cgi with high budgets and using the same old tricks to scare you.The types of horrorscifi type films I had really enjoyed were REC The Orphanage Alien The Thing The Evil Dead etc... now I'm not saying The Human Centipede is similar but I did feel like it created similar tension to that which I enjoyed in the other films.I also felt that the main character was played incredibly well and made the film feel more believable Ignoring the concept of stitching people together into a centipede but more so the way he would talk act and stare he was such a disturbing character I found myself feeling more terrified in ways. A disturbing person felt a bit more realistic than an alien popping out of my chest one day... not comparing the films in any way just stating why I was allowed to feel scared by a human.The film perhaps was somewhat formulaic regarding traditional narratives I guess of how scifihorror films were made in the 90s00s regarding deaths and perhaps the ending. Not to make it any less enjoyable.My only real criticism of the film was probably the core concept of stitching people into a centipede... I feel as though I didn't really learn quite enough about the doctor to understand what the incentive fully was. We know he's a retired surgeon who had dogs that he stitched into a centipede but that's about it... So I do find that concept a little odd... I would have liked to know if there was more of a reason for the doctor being the way he was with his ideas. There are obviously little bits and bobs here or there where I think 'but in real life police wouldn't do that' etc but I always try to let that go in a film.I also think the title of the film immediately gives it a bad stigma... As I said I was expecting to watch something more like Giant Cobra vs Komodo Dragon or Sharktopus or something... I think had the film kept the same actors and atmosphere but perhaps changed what the doctor was doing to people this film would have received a much better response. As I can understand to a point why people would be in a bit of an uproar about what you see but then again would the surgeon be as disturbing as a character if he hadn't done something as outrageous? Who knows... If you want to watch this film go into it open minded... I don't think it is AS bad as people are saying but maybe that's because I was expecting something horrendous? The operation looked very realistic as well and I really felt the actual production of the film was to a high standard. But if you want a horrorscifi film which creates suspense and tension and leaves you not having to worry about something jumping out at you every five seconds you might enjoy this.".

From here on the movie takes an incredibly slow pacing in order to fill a feature movie with one basic sick idea. Its all set in the house of the evil doctor who drugs his victims with roofies or a tranquilizer gun when hunting outside. The doctor who specialized in Siamese twin operations soon introduces his reverse Siamese twin operation to the unsuspecting victims with an incredibly ridiculous overhead presentation using some sketches that look like drawn by a child. At this point anyone must realize that either director Tom Six is an idiot or he has a strange kind of humor. Showing these sketches in a movie with a tagline 100 medically accurate is a joke by any means. The previous experiment with dogs that is presented with the doc sadly watching photos of his 3dog and having a gravestone engraved with My sweet 3dog in his backyard are a joke.And after the operation which is hardly shown you just see the 2 girls plus 1 guy in the front walking through the doctors house. The front guy is Japanese and talks Japanese throughout the movie which is stupid for a tourist in Germany... the girls are Americans the other actors are German and so they keep talking in all these languages with subtitles while the doc makes them sit by the pool or teaches them to fetch the morning paper.See... this is a joke a really bad one that seems to try to be artsy with the long use of crane shots and mixing several languages using no music etc. Bestpart is when the polices comes watching for the missing persons and the doctor decides to also drug them to add them to his experiment... WTF?This movie is ridiculous... the characters have no depth or motivation the acting is often mediocre and the horror is nonexistent except for the basic mindfk everybody hooks on to.I won't even go in the basic absurdity of it all that would leave the front guy with everyone behind him poisoned. Although director Tom Six seems rather serious in his interviews I hope for his own sake that this movie is the misguided comedy I take it for. Everything else would be a slow and idiotic horror movie a lousy drama or an incredibly childishexperimental movie with nonexistent soundtrack and entertainment value.".

	schema:headline " Terrible on a number of levels";
	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin...The plot of this movie is terribly overwrought having been done any number of times. Two attractive young women are alone and get captured by some crazy guy. He does bad things to them. This movie takes it a step beyond that.Many horror movies have the victims fight back against the bad guy typically to no avail. In this movie the bad guy is human and thus is vulnerable to any of the hundreds of ways to kill him that the victims had at any given time.The main character Lindsay escapes from her four point hospital restraints just before the evil doctor can sedate her. She does this in about ten seconds. Why she didn't think to do that during any of the previous eight hours or so is beyond me. It's not like she was in the hospital for a procedure. She knew that she was in a really bad situation but doesn't bother trying to escape until the last minute? When she does free herself she runs through the house bleeding a sobbing despite having an IV stand right next to her. It would have been a far more interesting film if she had bludgeoned the doctor right then and there.Later after the three victims are connected they finally fight back with the Japanese man stabbing the doctor in the knee with a scalpel.

Because obviously cutting his throat would have been way too smart.I'm not saying that the 'heroes' should always win but they should demonstrate at least the reasoning capacity of a chimp. For some reason though this movie's victims apparently lack basic intelligence even well before the really bad things start to happen and also appear to lack any kind of 'fight' instinct.For a complete list of things wrong with this film see every other review.".

	onyx:emotionText "Where to begin...The plot of this movie is terribly overwrought having been done any number of times. Two attractive young women are alone and get captured by some crazy guy. He does bad things to them. This movie takes it a step beyond that.Many horror movies have the victims fight back against the bad guy typically to no avail. In this movie the bad guy is human and thus is vulnerable to any of the hundreds of ways to kill him that the victims had at any given time.The main character Lindsay escapes from her four point hospital restraints just before the evil doctor can sedate her. She does this in about ten seconds. Why she didn't think to do that during any of the previous eight hours or so is beyond me. It's not like she was in the hospital for a procedure. She knew that she was in a really bad situation but doesn't bother trying to escape until the last minute? When she does free herself she runs through the house bleeding a sobbing despite having an IV stand right next to her. It would have been a far more interesting film if she had bludgeoned the doctor right then and there.Later after the three victims are connected they finally fight back with the Japanese man stabbing the doctor in the knee with a scalpel. He then takes a bite out of the doctor's neck. Because obviously cutting his throat would have been way too smart.I'm not saying that the 'heroes' should always win but they should demonstrate at least the reasoning capacity of a chimp.

I've seen porno movies with better acting and nothing about this movie is suspenseful or terrifying just shock value grotesque scenes in a ridiculous plot that never develops into anything interesting for even one minute.

Given that I was impressed someone would even make a movie like this I enjoyed the simplicity of the movie. With many low budget movies you expect to have some suspect acting and visuals but I didn't find either to be a problem. Instead I found the movie to be entertaining even given the gruesome story plot. Most people have said that they couldn't even get through the movie because of it's disturbing themes of the surgical aspect. My opinion the movie shows it's best aspects after the first 30 minutes. No spoilers but the last hour is truly where this movie goes bizarre but in a good way as I don't believe too many people saw that coming. This movie isn't a gore fest nor is a killer gone wild movie. It's a horror movie that is difficult to place.".

I had heard about it when it first came out and while it sounded interesting it really didn't strike me as my cup of tea. Several months later I found myself snowbound with my two best friends over winter break with all of us sick with the flu. To slow the insanity one of them proposed watching Human Centipede after hearing about it from his Dad that morning. Being exceptionally sick  blazed as hell my other friend and I decided it was a better option then moving downstairs. That was when things started to get weird.The film itself was definitely worth sitting through from start to finish. While I normally don't think much about the jokes that my friends and I make during films this movie in particular sticks out in my head for some of the odd remarks that you really could not use in any other situation Dude 50 says that she is going to be in the middle! among others. Tom Six did a good job of constructing the perfect twin horrorfilmstrawwomenthatyouhavetohate. The movie also did a great job of burning into my head what has to be the greatest one liner of all time FEED HER! All in all I would describe this as a okay movie that I personally would never want to see again. But it was fairly well done and I have to admit that I've never seen anything remotely like it before.I think it's worth pointing out that The Human Centipede does the same thing as Texas Chainsaw Massacre in that while people remember it as being a disgusting and violent film it's practically bloodless. Honestly if you can get past the fact that this is a movie about a mad scientist that sews people together mouthtoanus then you can watch it. The premise is the hardest thing you have to swallow.".

	schema:reviewBody "I decided to give in and watch The Human Centipede bluray this morning. I've been watching plenty of bad movies for fun lately the last ones I've seen were The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made Troll 2 and The Room. All very fun and entertaining bad movies but The Human Centipede was the opposite of fun and entertaining.I went in with no expectations and ended up just screaming at my TV for an hour and a half. I haven't seen so much stupidity in a horror movie since Hostel Rob Zombie's Halloween Martyrs Gutterballs and Return To Sleepaway Camp. It's rare for me to hate a movie only minutes into it but this gave me no choice. It starts with an old German man who looks like ButtHead with a little Beavis bone structure he's sitting in his car early in the morning and looking at pictures of what appears to be dogs sniffing each other butts. Then a truck stops behind his parked car the truck driver walks to a chain link fence in a very public area with several dozen cars passing by the second so he can go number 2. The German man takes a rifle out of his car tries to conceal it under his coat and nonchalantly walks behind the truck driver shoots him and we see the opening title. I'm not sure how there were no witness or anyone who heard the shot.The main plot is about two obnoxious American girls on vacation in Germany who want to attend a party. They leave their room and drive through the woods in the middle of nowhere when they suddenly get a flat tire. They have no idea how to change a tire so they start bickering and crying for minutes while an old pervert who speaks no English pulls up to harass them. Eventually they wander through the woods while screaming at each other and saying their names in every sentence because I guess that's how people talk. They do find a house so they knock and ButtHead answers the door and invites them in. He then gives them drugged water freaks out when one girl spills her glass demands she drinks more water and eventually he gets suspicious enough for the girls to worry but by then they're already drugged. They wake up in restraints only to find out that the doctor is going to kill the trucker because he isn't a tissue match. He leaves and comes back with a Japanese guy that is the very depth of this character. The only thing he ever does in the entire movie is screams in Japanese at the top of his lungs. When he has the three people he needs he shows a slide show of his evil mad scientist plan to create The Human Centipede. A medical experiment that makes absolutely no sense and has no practical application.For a while not much is really going on aside from Dr. ButtHead ranting and acting like an idiot and the three victims crying like babies that need a diaper change. On the day of surgery one girl tries to escape and it's one of the most pathetic escapes I have ever seen it's logic hurdle over logic hurdle like refusing to leave through the front door and steal the doctor's car eventually the doctor catches the girl and makes her the middle of he centipede. The surgery scene is incredibly boring. You see some teeth pulled off screen and there's a circular incision that is barely shown that is as gory as this movie ever gets. 1963's Blood Feast had a ton of gore and while looking laughably bad almost 50 years later it is much more gruesome than The Human Centipede. 46 minutes into the movie you see the actual Human Centipede which is three people with stitch effects on their faces and tons of bandages. The doctor parades them around the house tries to teach them tricks makes the front guy eat out of a dog dish screams at them a lot and the three of them do the usual routine of crying and the Japanese guy screaming in Japanese.There isn't any more plot I can reveal without spoiling the movie but it only gets stupider. By the end it just creates a void where any sense of logic or humanity should be. The movie is just very boring nothing much happens there is just barely enough violence for an R rating little nudity no real plot no characters or development and just a very dull movie. I think what could have saved this movie is just taking the idea and making it into more of a comedy like replace the German doctor with Tommy Wiseau or The Iron Sheik and replace one of the girls with someone like Paris Hilton. Just outright spoof your own movie and it could have some watchable content. There is just nothing in this movie that I can possibly recommend. It isn't the worst movie Manos The Hands Of Fate and Birdemic Shock and Terror were much worse and a lot more boring. The Human Centipede just goes nowhere and doesn't even make any attempt at being an interesting or original movie.".

In an age where cursing nudity and violence seem to occupy most films this is something special...a classic counting on its storyline acting and believable characters to hold our attention. The mystery that surrounds the tragedy in this movie cleverly ties together the people involved the incident itself and is not resolved until the end. The characters are unique introduced in brief anecdotes by which we come to learn about them. It makes one realize that we too have that same myriad of people we touch ourselves in our own lives. The music is beautifully orchestrated by Jerry Goldsmith. Glenn Ford's intense style is a sharp contrast to Rod Taylor's swashbuckling character. A very strong performance was given by Suzanne Pleshette as well. Her face of pure terror when she is on the second flight is fascinating and believable. My only regret is not being able to get a copy of the soundtrack which has one of the most beautiful trumpet solos I have ever heard. A movie worth watching anytime with anyone.".

Very few movies held my attention like that back then.Fate is the Hunter as other users have said is intelligent and well thought out. Only one other older disaster movie equals it for thrill and that is The Last Voyage the final minutes in particular.It should be released on DVD fully remastered picture and sound. For that matter it would probably attract viewers at the cinema if a remastered version was released.I don't think that a modern remake would have the same atmosphere. They would probably focus on nothing but the graphic violence of the deaths in the crash and miss out on the values such as friendship and loyalty.I give it 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sam McBane and Jack Savage have been associated for quite a long time. Their friendship started during the days both were pilots in the Army in WWII. Now at the start of the story they are working for the same commercial airline. As Jack is preparing for a flight to Seattle Sam the head of operations happens to pass by. Although friendly they are probably not as close anymore.As the flight prepares to take off Savage who seems to have a roving eye spots a new stewardess. He asks for a cup of coffee that Martha the other attendant brings to him but as he is about to grab it the hot liquid spills into some of the panel. The flight takes off and soon after they are in the air the right engine catches fire. They request to go back. They are finally cleared but unfortunately as they come for a crash landing the plane strikes a pier and everyone dies except Martha the stewardess who miraculously is spared.As the investigation proceeds we are taken in flashbacks to the days of WWII when Sam and Jack were serving together. They had a big scare when they were on a mission. Sam and the rest of the crew bail out because the plane is on a dangerous course of probably crashing into a mountain. When Sam and the men are rescued and returned to base they are aghast in finding Jack and his plane on the airfield.Fate Is the Hunter is a 1964 Twenty Century Fox feature we recently caught on a cable channel. Not having seen it in a while it took us by surprise the excellent condition of the print. Ralph Nelson its director worked extensively in television during most of his career. It is to his credit how he draws the viewer into the story involving us in ways we didn't expect. The film is based on a book by Ernest Gann.Glenn Ford a man that usually underplayed in most of his films makes an excellent Sam McBean. He is a decent man who wants to clear his buddy's name and at the same time spare his employer of bad publicity. Rod Taylor who is made to look older as Jack in the first scenes does also a good job of this fearless pilot. Susanne Pleshette appears as Martha the surviving stewardesses. Nancy Kwan is a scientist with a theory about why things happened on the plane. Wally Cox Mark Stevens Harold St. John Constance Towers and the wonderful Mary Wickes are seen in supporting roles. An uncredited Dorothy Malone is fun to watch as Jack's girlfriend who decides to throw a party at an inappropriate time.Milton Krasher's cinematography deserves a nod for what he was able to capture with the film that was basically shot inside the studio. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score serves the film well. Ralph Nelson deserves the credit for the way he handled his large cast.".

And Taylor was a roguish sort of guy who bent the rules considerably. But Ford knew Taylor as a man cool in combat and we see Taylor after the initial crash in all sides of his character in flashback.The film is based on an Ernest K.

Ford is a man with a disagreeable task and he's praying his faith in Taylor will not be in vain.The airline is more interested in covering itself in case of potential lawsuits than at getting at the truth. Pilot error is the easiest explanation all around and Taylor's past doesn't help any.There are a couple of noteworthy supporting performances first being Dorothy Malone who was not billed oddly enough as a party girl who Taylor was involved with and dumped. It's a chip off the performance Malone gave as Marilee Hadley in Written On The Wind. Also noteworthy is Wally Cox who was a fellow crewman on Taylor and Ford's ship in Korea who provides an insight into an incident in Korea that Ford does not remember fondly.What does cause the crash? It's something quite trivial but Taylor's posthumous reputation owes a debt of gratitude to Susanne Pleshette surviving the crash and to the black box recording even then standard on commercial flights. It was kind of quaint seeing the airline investigators playing the black box recording on those old fashioned reel to reel tapes.For aviation fans and fans of the principal players and many others.

The writing is dreadful painting comicbook characters with no depth or subtlety. Glenn Ford does his best to make his central character interesting but nearly all of the main characters in the film are middleaged men who spend most of their screen time shouting and snarling at each other. This is especially true of Rod Taylor's character who is absolutely ridiculous and as likable as a sticky doorknob.The basic premise of the story is silly too. While commercial air crash investigations have certainly become more systematic and sophisticated since the 1960's they were never such shallow personal journeys as this story would depict. One man's journey to vindicate an old war buddy...who he really didn't even like. Oh please.And what the heck is with that utterly irrelevant cameo by Jane Russell?! If you're on a mission to see every Glenn Ford film and you've missed this one then by all means sit in front of it once. But I really doubt you'll want to sit through it a second time. It's just too painful.".

It really appeals to younger mystery fans even though it is rated PG13 for violence. I would recommend any parent see this movie before they let their kids see it. Some of the violence is hallucinatory and therefore quite scary. I think the way it begins Holmes's and Watson's friendship is fun and creative. I think the script and characterizations are well done especially in light of more current movies which are just to draw viewers to the theater and have no substance. The casting was inspired and I don't see how they could have improved upon it. The cinematography was great and the special effects very good for the time of this movie. Some people might find Holmes's character a bit smug but that is accurate to the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

He was human respectful humble polite wise and treated Watson like a brother not like the combative relationship in Sherlock Holmes 2009 and 2010.This story took place at a school for boys called Brompton Academy.A dart with hallucinogenic drug made victims see scary things when hit by this dart.Things come alive that attack the victim. A cooked chicken statues of bats or bird and more. One victim jumps out a window one runs out of church and gets killed by a stage coach and one stabs himself thinking creatures are in his shirt harming him. The special affects in it were amazing. Holmes could not attend the funeral of one of the victims because of his expulsion from Brompton Academy.Watson's experience after being shot with the drug was funny. A grave opened up at the cemetery that had all kinds of pastries on shelves. The pastries started jumping off the shelfon to the ground  Watson talking to each other. They were all different sizes and shapes with big eyes and some pastries started shoving other pastries in to Watson mouth cherry cream and all. Really humorous.Earlier in the movie Watson finds a dart blowpipe which belongs to an Egyptian cult worshiping Osiris god of the underworld. This cult sacrifices live people in a hot substance. Sherlock finds this temple and stops the sacrifice and escapes. Later he realizes there is a cult operating in this city which is causing the deaths of men that knew each other.Sherlock was in love in this movie which at the end it said the writers did not know what young Sherlock would have been like and that they just respectably put some things in.This film was very violent and tense. It is about 145 minutes long.It was like one of the Indiana Jones movies with the cult members running for their life and the building falling down.This is one movie that did not disappoint me but scared the pastry out of me.".

Holmes falls in love with a beautiful youngster Sophie Ward  living with her uncle  a retired professor named Waxflatter Nigel Stock . Then  it happens several murders and Holmes helps Inspector Lestrade Roger AshtonGriffiths to resolve it . Later on  young Sherlock performing feats of derringdo in London  including a spectacular flight and dangerous duels . Although Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not write about the youthful years of Sherlock Holmes  as he established the initial meeting between Holmes and Watson as adults . This affectionate speculation on what might have happened has been made with respect and admiration  knowing references to Sherlock's later existence and in tribute to the author in his enduring Works .This stirring  fastpaced film is packed with noisy action  adventures  thrills  tension and results to be quite entertaining . It's a genuine ripping yarn with much suspense  intrigue and outstanding surprises . Nicholas Rowe is nice as obstinate and intelligent young Holmes as well as Alex Cox as timid and easy frightened John Watson . Some images are very creepy and eerie and developed in Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom style  for that reason is rated PG13 for violence and crude scenes . Spectacular special effects by Kit West and Pixar Animation Studios making 'the glass man sequence' and puppets by David Allen . Furthermore visual effects supervisor by Dennis Muren with some of the firsts  images made by means of computer generator . As this one is considered to be the first feature film to have a completely CGI computer graphics image character  the knight coming out of the stained glass window . And intervention by Industrial Light  Magic company run by George Lucas animated the scene  overseen by John Lasseter in a very early film credit for Pixar . As the Stained Glass Knight took Industrial Light  Magic artists 4 months to create . Atmospheric score fitting to action by Bruce Broughton and London symphonic Orchestra . Well written by Chris Columbus and lavishly produced by Steven Spielberg with his usual collaborators  Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy . The picture was well directed by Barry Levinson . Youth and little boys are likely to enjoy this fun film.".

The plot was a bit contrived with the identity of the evil cult leader becoming increasingly obvious at midfilm.

	schema:reviewBody "For film buffs there is only one reason to see Young Sherlock Holmes it has the first photo realistic CGI creature in film. A hallucinating priest sees a stained glass knight jump out of a church window and march towards him sword raised and ready to swing. The knight only has about ten seconds of screen time but he is a major step forward in visual effects. I am certain that films geeks will appreciate this. For those who are not film geeks Young Sherlock Holmes has some entertainment to offer but not enough to make it a good movie.The first 30 minutes of Young Sherlock Holmes are fine. It gives us a charming and pleasant introduction to a teenage Holmes and how he meets John Watson. We are also introduced to Elisabeth Holmes' love interest.

	onyx:emotionText "For film buffs there is only one reason to see Young Sherlock Holmes it has the first photo realistic CGI creature in film. A hallucinating priest sees a stained glass knight jump out of a church window and march towards him sword raised and ready to swing. The knight only has about ten seconds of screen time but he is a major step forward in visual effects. I am certain that films geeks will appreciate this. For those who are not film geeks Young Sherlock Holmes has some entertainment to offer but not enough to make it a good movie.The first 30 minutes of Young Sherlock Holmes are fine. It gives us a charming and pleasant introduction to a teenage Holmes and how he meets John Watson. We are also introduced to Elisabeth Holmes' love interest.

	schema:headline " A wonderful film for the most part until it moves into young Indiana Jones territory during the last 25 minutes";
	schema:reviewBody "It was a cold snowy day in early December. Lack of funds had forced my old school to close. I was being sent to a new one in the middle of term. I was accustomed to the opened relaxed expanse of the country and now I was in the heart of London at the height of the Victorian Era. The streets were teeming with every activity imaginable. I was very taken by what I saw. As I stepped from my carriage the sight of my new school filled me with fear and apprehension yet I was swept with a wave of curiosity. However nothing could prepare me for the extraordinary adventure that lay ahead or the extraordinary individual who would change my life. That's an old John Watson speaking in a narrative voiceover and moments later at the Brompton School common we're going to see young Watson played by Alan Cox at 15 meet Sherlock Holmes played by Nicholas Rowe at 19. Watson has had his trunk delivered and Holmes is scratching away horribly at a violin. Holmes stops and nearly smashed the thing in frustration. I should've mastered the damn thing by now he cries. How long have you been playing? Watson asks. Three days! The first threequarters of the movie is a wonderful Holmsian adventure full of deduction and growing friendship as we see young Holmes exercise his slightly arrogant intelligence to put an insufferably superior student named Dudley in his place assist an eccentric inventor find tentative Victorian love with the inventor's niece discover a pattern of assassination in the deaths of four elderly men deal with a lazy Lestrade and a friendly fencing master and establish a friendship with his young follower Watson. The highpoint is probably Holmes acceptance of a challenge from Dudley to locate where Dudley has hidden the school's fencing trophy...in no more than 60 minutes. The game is afoot as Holmes examines minute particles of...what? locates snowy footprints in the school quadrangle examines the school's kitchen...all with the clock ticking away and with the school's students racing after him with Watson in the lead. It's clever and exiting. As the older Watson says in recollection when Holmes finds the trophy with seconds to spare It was a wonderful heroic moment for Holmes. But little did he know that his amazing powers and talents would soon be put to a much greater test a test of terrifying and deadly proportions. And with that we're off into a case of murderous hallucinations with all sorts of scary special effects of a deadly Egyptian cult in the heart of London of young girls used for human sacrifices of a cauldron of revenge...and we realize that we've moved from a young Sherlock Holmes to a young Indiana Jones. From a loving and clever imagining of Holmes and Watson meeting at school and solving a vicious exotic series of killings we're up to our necks in the calculated hokum of a boy's own adventure courtesy of executive producer Steven Spielberg assisted by George Lucas' special effects studio. We even have an E.T. moment when young Holmes and Watson take off on a pedalpowered flying device to soar over London at night in pursuit of the villain. The first part of the movie is so good that it just about disguises the calculated playingwiththeaudience buildup to the conclusion. Nicholas Rowe tall and lean and Alan Cox round and quizzical are firstrate as young Holmes and young Watson. They've continued to act but never had better roles. Michael Hordern who gives us the narrative voice of the older Watson provides much of the heart of the movie. We can imagine an elderly Watson looking back at this first case with affection and appreciation. At the end of the movie Holmes is leaving Brompton School while Watson will graduate and go on to medical studies. Watson says goodbye to his friend and stands near as Holmes enters the horsedrawn carriage. We hear the older Watson tell us As I watched Holmes settle into his seat a sudden feeling came over me  that I would most certainly be seeing him again. So ended my first adventure with Mister Sherlock Holmes. As I watched his carriage disappear into the distance I realized that I had forgotten to thank him. He had taken a weak frightened boy and made him into a courageous strong man. My heart soared. I was filled with confidence. I was ready for whatever mystery or danger lay ahead. I was ready to take on the greatest and most exciting adventure of them all and I knew it was bound to involve Sherlock Holmes.".

	schema:reviewBody "A bland rendering of a Sherlock Holmes story... Picture this... We are in Victorian London in a time where everyone was always calling everyone else old chap and being told how dashed bally wonderful everything is. We begin by following the young Holmes on his way to a new school in London. There he meets the young Watson apparently bent on entering medical school I guess we know he never got there addicted to cream cakes and totally devoid of any acting skills. The actor who plays him is reminiscent of Harry Potter that is if Daniel Radcliffe was fatter mentally retarded and had the acting capabilities of a bag of flour.The plot thickens along with Watson as we meet Holmes' new schoolmaster Master Wraith. Wraith comes across as a decent sort keen to advise Holmes and give him a helping hand here and there. Though there's something about his good looks that suggests he must have some darker ulterior motive otherwise he'd be the hero of the story seeing as he's far more sophisticated and intelligent than that whelk HolmesSoon we also meet Professor Waxflatter mad inventor and wouldbe mentor to the young Holmes.Even though Professor Waxflatter is mad as a bicycle it seems not to run in the family. His niece Elizabeth not only is in total possession of her mental faculties and common sense but is as far as Holmes is concerned the tastiest thing since peaches and cream. The feeling turns out to be mutual amazing what some people will settle for isn't it? and a heart warming love story blooms that leaves you with a lump in your throat and a desperate need to find the nearest sick bucket.Meanwhile the evil Dudley Holmes' rival at school is doing his damndest to get Holmes expelled. Before long a series of deaths have occurred and Holmes is ready to camply leap into action. So he installs himself in Elizabeth's attic flat though we're all led to believe its in the interests of solving the murder sneaky little devil that Holmes and so the dynamic young Holmes and his bloated sidekick embark on their adventure armed only with the power to look at things through a magnifying glass and saying hmmn and otherwise severely limited powers of deduction.Before long we're led into a web of intrigue involving an ancient Egyptian cult that largely busies itself with doing unspeakable things to people and dressing up in silly clothing.At the heart of this mystery is the evil Aytah the leader of the cult who came to England as a boy with his grandfather. Before long the young Holmes has solved most of this puzzle with the air of one who has just discovered that the square peg wasn't meant to go in the round hole anyway.Soon we discover the identity of the mysterious Aytah yawn can you guess? as well as his fraternally wicked sister. Before you can say dastardly duo Aytah and co have spirited Elizabeth off for their evil purposes and its up to Batman and Robin to get her back after all Holmes hasn't had so much as a goodnight kiss from her yet.Holmes and Watson give chase in a bicycle powered airplane Orville Wright eat your heart out and the score shifts to Lassie Come Home mode with a sound that reeks of boisterous young adventure the Famous Five would be envious of. Sadly Holmes and Watson aren't killed in the crash landingBefore long the scene changes to an underground temple full of itinerant Londoners dressed in silly robes singing some sort of opera in some dubious attempt at the dead tongue of the Egyptians. Aytah comes down the stairs looking the belle of the ball in his dress and jewelry a silly mask is ceremoniously placed on his head to complete a look straight off the cover of Vogue.Predictably there's a Tom  Jerry style death trap for Elizabeth that gives the rusty wheels in Holmes' head just enough time to revolve and hatch a plan Jerry mouse would be proud of...Tell you what though if it were up to me I'd pick Watson for a sidekick too. He takes a thumping every five minutes in the film but is never knocked out for more than 10 seconds and never shows any signs of bruising. Not only that every villain that takes a swing at him is covered by a shower of rocks and rubble. Honestly its like he's got divine protection.On with the plot sigh... Aytah makes off with Elizabeth ostensibly I assume for the purpose of a bit of howsyourfather. Holmes filled with indignation at being beaten to the punch is after the devil in a flash. The last bit worth mentioning or not is the final battle between Aytah and Holmes. In a curious version of sword play that involves attempting to hit your enemy's sword instead of lopping his arm off the two battle for their lives with various crate throwing and other dirty tricks mixed in. The ending's nothing to write home about a good laugh by all accounts and a lesson in how not to act if you expect anyone to actually watch your film. To cut a long story short everyone doesn't live happily ever after but close enough.And there you go a pathetic end to a trash film. Spielberg really should have been shot for producing this one...".

Sadly Holmes and Watson aren't killed in the crash landingBefore long the scene changes to an underground temple full of itinerant Londoners dressed in silly robes singing some sort of opera in some dubious attempt at the dead tongue of the Egyptians. Aytah comes down the stairs looking the belle of the ball in his dress and jewelry a silly mask is ceremoniously placed on his head to complete a look straight off the cover of Vogue.Predictably there's a Tom  Jerry style death trap for Elizabeth that gives the rusty wheels in Holmes' head just enough time to revolve and hatch a plan Jerry mouse would be proud of...Tell you what though if it were up to me I'd pick Watson for a sidekick too. He takes a thumping every five minutes in the film but is never knocked out for more than 10 seconds and never shows any signs of bruising. Not only that every villain that takes a swing at him is covered by a shower of rocks and rubble. Honestly its like he's got divine protection.On with the plot sigh... Aytah makes off with Elizabeth ostensibly I assume for the purpose of a bit of howsyourfather. Holmes filled with indignation at being beaten to the punch is after the devil in a flash. The last bit worth mentioning or not is the final battle between Aytah and Holmes. In a curious version of sword play that involves attempting to hit your enemy's sword instead of lopping his arm off the two battle for their lives with various crate throwing and other dirty tricks mixed in. The ending's nothing to write home about a good laugh by all accounts and a lesson in how not to act if you expect anyone to actually watch your film. To cut a long story short everyone doesn't live happily ever after but close enough.And there you go a pathetic end to a trash film. Spielberg really should have been shot for producing this one...";

He has never made a truly good movie what has he been doing since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets?.

I don't blame Doyle followers for hating this movie it isn't for them. This film is for those of us who know nothing of Sherlock Holmes franchise but just love an fun movie.Young Sherlock Holmes is wellproduced across the board fun fast and perfectly cast. Some other posters here have slammed both Rowe Holmes and Cox Watson but I found them just fine. The flagrant 80's effects from the SpielbergLucas teams are a distraction and the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 1984 style plot is absolutely wrong but those are my only real complaints. Director Barry Levinson has of course go on to much greater things but this may be his most underrated film. Personally I would have enjoyed this film even more had the three leads been even younger say 1114 years old. But then there couldn't be a big sword duel between Holmes and Rathe.If your a fan of the Amblin Entertainment empire and don't know anything about Sherlock Holmes I think you'll enjoy this film. It's a great shame even tragedy Young Sherlock Holmes was a complete boxoffice bomb and that the DVD has no special features whatsoever!Final rating 710 An enjoyable entertaining movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I caught this movie on TV a few days ago so I may as well voice my opinion. I've enjoyed all the Lethal Weapon flicks and I hope one day to buy a boxed set of DVDs containing all four in the series.  Don't ask which one I think is best.  They're all lots of fun to watch.  Of course the original didn't have as much humor as its sequels.  Mel Gibson's character was a downtrodden loner who was established as a loose cannon.  But as the series continued he suddenly turned into Buddy Hackett cracking jokes left and right.  Needless to say Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make one of the best onscreen duos in the history of film.  Their characters of Riggs and Murtaugh are like polar opposites but that's the beauty of it.  That's the essence of the buddy cop genre.  The two partners are always at each other's throats yet they share a great bond and deliver much humor.  Richard Donner is a spectacular action film director and there are some breathtaking stunts.  The opening truck chase is extremely memorable. And each and every scene is buoyed by great comic relief.  Gibson says a great line when he arrests the fraudulent truck driver  You have the right to remain unconscious.  Whatever you say...ain't gonna be much.  That's a priceless line!  OK so the plot is meandering.  There are scenes that are very entertaining yet don't really move the story along.  But the whole movie is so funny and exciting that I just think...who gives a damn?  I'm having too much fun! Joe Pesci's character Leo Getz adds additional comic relief.  His bleached blond do is hilarious enough and his nebbish schtick makes it all the more humorous.  Rene Russo is also added to the cast to provide some good eye candy.  Just like the Bond girls there's always a sexy love interest in the Lethal Weapon movies.  In the second movie there was Patsy Kensit. And there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks he's getting too old for this st and is about to retire. He's suffering a severe middleage crisis and to add to his problems he ends up killing one of his son's friendswhich he did out of selfdefense. Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy actioncomedy he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscarwinning masterpiece.  Lethal Weapon 3 again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers firstclass entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric ClaptonSting song It's Gonna Be Me.  My score  8 out of 10".

Just like the Bond girls there's always a sexy love interest in the Lethal Weapon movies.  In the second movie there was Patsy Kensit. And there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks he's getting too old for this st and is about to retire. He's suffering a severe middleage crisis and to add to his problems he ends up killing one of his son's friendswhich he did out of selfdefense. Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy actioncomedy he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscarwinning masterpiece.  Lethal Weapon 3 again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers firstclass entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric ClaptonSting song It's Gonna Be Me.  My score  8 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great series! Actually I could stop right here because I have already said what needs to be said but just for people's enjoyment I'll elaborate a little.The acting is much like in the two previous films excellent. Somehow Mel Gibson and Danny Glover never seem to get tired of each other and it shows because their playful banter never seems to get tiring to the audience. Mel Gibson is a class actor and this time around he develops the character of Martin Riggs even further than he did in the second film. He is so good at portraying emotions that the audience genuinely feels with him. When he is angry you feel his anger and when he is sad you feel sad you get the picture. The fact that he is so versatile shows in the contrasts of the character. He is both great in actionsequences and in romantic sequences. As for Danny Glover he also does a great job in bringing his character further and he really does in this installment because you get to see the more negative sides of the character this time around. In the first two films he was the character who didn't evolve much but took pride in it. This time because retirement is rearing its ugly head we get to see what I must suppose was the facade stripped away and see Murtaugh in his raw pure form. Joe Pesci also returns this time for the comic relief and he is still funny. There is just something about the character of Leo Getz that is incredibly entertaining. However the best performance is perhaps done by Stuart Wilson an incredibly underrated actor who has sadly never really achieved a commercial breakthrough. He is the villain of this film and is perhaps the best villain of the series simply because he has more depth than any other villain in the series. He is also given considerably more screen time than many of the other villains so he really has a chance to shine. Rene Russo appears in this film as Riggs new romantic interest and she may not be the most gifted actress ever to be on film but her chemistry with Mel Gibson is undeniable and her onscreen presence is pretty amazing considering that she is a new entry to the character gallery.The story of the film is the weakest out of all the series yes even the fourth one and sometimes it kinda drags. Mainly however the story is still highly entertaining and funny. The best element of the script is the fact that villain is an excop this time around and that does that the heroes can hate the villain even more because he is aside from being a mean bastard a traitor almost a symbol of the backside of the medallion.The action of the film is just like in the two previous movies absolutely brilliant. The action is highly entertaining and well made and Mel Gibson is excellent as an action star as well as many other things.All in all a great entry to a great series. 710".

Rene Russo is a good addition to the cast though. This is a much watered down Lethal Weapon movie compared to the first two movies and for this Zoner Lethal Weapon 3 is the low point of the franchise for me. The lack of Shane Black is obvious. They up the comedy even more this time and it falls a bit flat for me. The humour in the first two was great this has a female security guard chasing Murtaugh around whilst Riggs is tricking him into kicking water coolers over. Riggs is an absolute jerk at times in this one!! Gone is the man overcome with grief looking for a reason to get through the day and is dangerously unpredictable as a result. Instead we get someone who eats raw onions and dog biscuits threatens Jaywalkers with his gun beats up movie directors knocks out handcuffed suspects and makes random guesses on what Wire to cut on a bomb!! And that's without mention his treatment of his best friend and partner Murtaugh.He constantly berates him about retiring despite it being the sensible option. Especially since he can't dress himself without accidentally setting off his gun. Riggs repeatedly put him in unnecessary danger. Surely Riggs should want his best friend safe at home with his family out of danger. But no he is incredibly selfish!! Joe Pesci who I loved in the last one is awful here. There is no reason for him to be here and he's just irritating. Does the movie director Riggs assaults remind anyone of Steven Spielberg?? Lethal Weapon 3 grossed 144 million to finish the 4th highest grossing movie of 1992.".

	schema:reviewBody "The most popular team of detectives in cinematic history is back again making the streets of Los Angeles safe and secure for the citizens at large in Lethal Weapon 3' directed by Richard Donner and once again starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  This time the action literally starts with a bang a big one when Riggs Gibson and Murtaugh Glover answer a call and suffice to say Riggs can't wait for the bomb squad to arrive.  It makes for a spectacular opening scene but it's just a warm up for what follows.  Some bad things are going down in the City of Angels perhaps not unusual for L.A. but someone is putting automatic weapons and armor piercing bullets called Cop Killers' as they can penetrate a bullet proof vest on the streets which is really bad news for police officers in general and especially for those in particular areas of the city.  Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case but it quickly escalates and because of certain untoward circumstances soon falls into the hands of Internal Affairs.  Which brings Officer Lorna Cole Rene Russo into the picture.  And sparks begin to fly. The first two installments of this series are hard to beat but as they say the third time's a charm and Donner must have had the shaman working with him on this one because he pulled off quite a feat making a third that ranks right up there with the first two.  He seems to have found the perfect balance with this one the main characters are in place and established Leo Getz Joe Pesci is back and the addition of Russo is the icing on the cake.  The story is good there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts and the humor has been toned down a notch which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. By now Gibson IS Riggs from the inside out still somewhat on the edge but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep which may sound like easy street for an actor but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time however is between Gibson and Russo who click from the beginning starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna putting some real style and spunk into her there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a nononsense I.A. investigator and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them in which they compare battle scars that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene and a good example of how well the script by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen was written. The supporting cast includes Darlene Love Trish Traci Wolfe Rianne Stuart Wilson Jack Travis Steve Kahan Capt. Murphy Damon Hines Nick Ebonie Smith Carrie and Gregory Millar Tyrone.  In the world of the Cinema it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original and when the third does it's a real triumph and Lethal Weapon 3' is just that a triumph.  It's a quality actiondrama that exemplifies why this series is so popular.  Simply put it's a good movie on it's own and part of a great series so don't stop now Lethal Weapon 4' is ready and waiting for you. I rate his one 1010.".

The story is good there's plenty of great action and some sensational stunts and the humor has been toned down a notch which increases the level of intensity of the drama.  In short Donner measures out all of the right elements to perfection and makes it all gel together for the complete package.  And what a package it is. By now Gibson IS Riggs from the inside out still somewhat on the edge but not quite as volatile.  And Glover could play Murtaugh in his sleep which may sound like easy street for an actor but it takes real professionals to maintain the credibility of characters they know so well it would be so easy to phone it in and let the details slip at this point and these two have what it takes.  Their chemistry remains intact and they've put polish on an act that was already shining.  The real chemistry this time however is between Gibson and Russo who click from the beginning starting with their first scene together.  Russo sparkles as Lorna putting some real style and spunk into her there's just enough edginess to her to make her believable as a nononsense I.A. investigator and it makes her the perfect match for Gibson's Riggs.  There's a terrific scene between them in which they compare battle scars that fits their characters so well and so credibly underscores the development of their relationship.  it's a memorable scene and a good example of how well the script by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen was written. The supporting cast includes Darlene Love Trish Traci Wolfe Rianne Stuart Wilson Jack Travis Steve Kahan Capt. Murphy Damon Hines Nick Ebonie Smith Carrie and Gregory Millar Tyrone.  In the world of the Cinema it's a rare thing when a sequel matches up to the original and when the third does it's a real triumph and Lethal Weapon 3' is just that a triumph.  It's a quality actiondrama that exemplifies why this series is so popular.  Simply put it's a good movie on it's own and part of a great series so don't stop now Lethal Weapon 4' is ready and waiting for you. I rate his one 1010.";

After witnessing a murder at the hands of a bogus security team Riggs sets off in hot pursuit with Murtagh not far behind in the 'real' security vehicle. Riggs and Murtagh contain the situation following a pursuit and some fisticuffs and arrest the driver Billy Phelps Mark Pellegrino. When they examine his weapon it turns out that it is a special type of gun that is able to pierce 'armour'. However before Riggs and Murtagh manage to question Phelps a man comes into the police station and shoots Phelps and calmly walks away. Riggs Murtagh and internal affairs officer Lorna Cole Russo discover that Phelps has been shot and promptly examine the CCTV footage where Cole identifies the killer as 'Jack Travis'  a former police officer who is into arms in a big way. Riggs Murtagh and Cole find that they must all work together to try and find out why Travis has murdered Phelps and how the 2 of them are linked For me the main problem with this Lethal Weapon entry is that there is very little in the way of a plot. The plot is basically Travis steals lots of arms and uses them against the police and that's pretty much it. We learn very little about Travis's motivations and we get no background information about him. Why did he get involved with arms? Why did he have a vendetta against the police? Who knows? Second we come to Leo Getz  OKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOK sorry I couldn't resist. I thought it was quite refreshing when he was introduced in the second film and found him to be tolerable in that film. Getz character also had more relevance to the plot in LW2. I found his character beyond irritating in this film and what exactly was the point of him being in this film? Oh yeah he's an Estate Agent. Really? I like Joe Pesci and I've enjoyed every other film that he's been in but I really couldn't stand him in LW3  as I mentioned he was tolerable in the second film but I felt he was a bit OTT here.There were other absurd scenes as well like where Cole and Riggs are both showing each other scars from where they've been shot and injured in various places. Why? Not only was it pointless but it was also unfunny.At least LW3 still had its funny moments and the chemistry is still strong between Riggs and Murtagh. As far as entertainment goes this is good. But if you are the sort of person who enjoys a film with a well thought out and coherent plot then this may come as a disappointment. I gave it 510 purely for its entertainment value.".

Sure there's plenty of action but it's not as fierce of bruising or just downright vicious as in the first two films. When there are fight scenes they seem a bit more corny than before. This is a more lighthearted entry into the series and though you could say without seeing the film that soft is not what Lethal Weapon is about just remember how tiring it would have been seeing a repeat of the second and first film.Martin Riggs Mel Gibson and Roger Murtaugh Danny Glover are back.

She kicks butt pays no attention to rules and is a smart...bottom.Also returning is Joe Pesci to the role of Leo Getz. His head full of bleached hair and sporting a nice car the retired thief is now in real estate trying to sell Murtaugh's home to interested folk. One of the best scenes is when Getz is taking a couple through Murtaugh's home and mentions all the different accidents they've had over the year including the car smashing through the wall and accidental bomb damage upstairs. He later says it's illegal to withhold information. And this is coming from the guy who in Lethal 2 admitted to laundering drug money.Lethal Weapon 3 is full of fun good intentions and more fun. For fans of the first two films this is a great relief  it's not nearly as bad as you're expecting it to be. However there are more than a handful of flaws here. The plot is not nearly as realistic nor intriguing as the first two the action is a bit too dumbed down at times and overall the film seems more like a bigbudget extravaganza as compared to the smartness of the first two. Still you really can't go wrong with Lethal Weapon 3 because if you enjoyed the first two you're going to eat this up.45 stars.John Ulmer".

And don't even get me started on Michael Kamen's rubbish score. The saxophone thing totally overbears on every scene and becomes highly distracting.

The DolbyDTS 5.1 soundtrack is loud and forceful but hardly dynamic. There are no interesting features not that I care. The R1 DVD comes in a horrid snapper case but the R2 is a sturdy keepcase.".

	schema:headline " The magic is still here but still a somewhat weaker movie compared to the other Lethal Weapon movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though this is in my opinion the weakest out of the Lethal Weapon series that of course doesn't mean that this movie isn't fun and entertaining to watch.It suffers from the same minor flaws as the previous 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The story is incredibly simple standard action material. It's totally uninteresting and also told in a totally uninteresting way. Also the villain is yet again heavily underused. But it's true that none of the Lethal Weapon movies have ever relied on its story. Instead the movie heavily relies on its two main character Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. And when you have two such characters like Riggs and Murtaugh who have such an amazing chemistry together you just don't need much else to make a good and entertaining movie.Unfortunately the movie does nowhere live up to its fantastic and memorable beginning. Everything that happens after the opening sequence isn't really that interesting or memorable. The movie doesn't always have the right pace and the way the story is presented make it seem even less interesting than it is on paper.The movie is filled with some great characters next besides to the two main leads. Joe Pesci returns as Leo Getz and Rene Russo joins the team as a woman who knows how to take care of herself. The villain is this time played by the always great Stuart Wilson. It however is unfortunate that all of these characters are given too little screen time especially Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. All of the Lethal Weapon movies always had great villains that were also at the same time always heavily underused. Same goes for Wilson in this particular case who's talent is practically wasted.But luckily the movie is still of course a perfectly entertaining one. This is absolutely thanks to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover who still have the magic chemistry together after already 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The two of them provide some great and hilarious moments together that alone is reason enough why this movie is a good and enjoyable one to watch.Maybe not as good but certainly just as entertaining as all of the other Lethal Weapon movies.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Even though this is in my opinion the weakest out of the Lethal Weapon series that of course doesn't mean that this movie isn't fun and entertaining to watch.It suffers from the same minor flaws as the previous 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The story is incredibly simple standard action material. It's totally uninteresting and also told in a totally uninteresting way. Also the villain is yet again heavily underused. But it's true that none of the Lethal Weapon movies have ever relied on its story. Instead the movie heavily relies on its two main character Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. And when you have two such characters like Riggs and Murtaugh who have such an amazing chemistry together you just don't need much else to make a good and entertaining movie.Unfortunately the movie does nowhere live up to its fantastic and memorable beginning. Everything that happens after the opening sequence isn't really that interesting or memorable. The movie doesn't always have the right pace and the way the story is presented make it seem even less interesting than it is on paper.The movie is filled with some great characters next besides to the two main leads. Joe Pesci returns as Leo Getz and Rene Russo joins the team as a woman who knows how to take care of herself. The villain is this time played by the always great Stuart Wilson. It however is unfortunate that all of these characters are given too little screen time especially Joe Pesci and Stuart Wilson. All of the Lethal Weapon movies always had great villains that were also at the same time always heavily underused. Same goes for Wilson in this particular case who's talent is practically wasted.But luckily the movie is still of course a perfectly entertaining one. This is absolutely thanks to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover who still have the magic chemistry together after already 2 Lethal Weapon movies. The two of them provide some great and hilarious moments together that alone is reason enough why this movie is a good and enjoyable one to watch.Maybe not as good but certainly just as entertaining as all of the other Lethal Weapon movies.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

While LW2 was a largely empty film run on the ageold formula of guns explosions profanity and griping banter LW3 tries to improve by throwing in some emotional contexts and mild urban commentary to add depth.  It doesn't work...Everything possible in this movie is referential whether the car chases the Black urban gangsta stereotypes the white villain stereotypes as before in the series the shootouts stolen mostly from Die Hard 2 which for that matter were inspired by John Woo and the car chases that are more in resemblance to The Blues Brothers than The French Connection.Richard Donner is a very stagnant visual director considering he used the same director of photography as McTiernan did on Die Hard.  I am beginning to wonder now whether or not Joel Silver started seriously mucking things up for the series rather than Donner selfdestructing.  Many similarities can be drawn from the opening scene alone involving a bomb and Jan De Bont's directorial debut Speed.  I can see how this was his last turn as DoP but Black Rain remains his best work IMHO.  I can see in the anticlimatic motorcycle freeway chase how many similar camera styles were used by Frankenheimer in his later years.  This is not a movie about itself it's a movie about other movies.  Mad Max 2 Jaws Dirty Harry A Better Tomorrow Die Hard Raiders of the Lost Ark Beverly Hills Cop and a lot more.This movie and Terminator 2 receive judgment for trying to make an early90s look on LA life in an action film.  Neither one is great watching both try to have elaborate appearances that are hollow...unfinished housing developments.  Notice how here Donner tries making himself look like the politicallycorrect wiseguy with his notsosubtle hints against animal cruelty and smoking yet this is almost as sexist as the second film.  80s movies are in search of money 90s movies want money and PC agendas. Greed is good but it begets stupidity.Overall the sequels in this franchise stink.  I can't say I recommend them anymore than the waves of summer action movies we've had in the last few years.  Interesting how the series goes from Christmas time in the original to any ol' time of year in the sequels.  Die Hard had the same problems. So much for the holidays... 2 out of 5 stars.".

Although it's not as good as the first two Lethal Weapon 3 is still a wonderful sequel.Lethal Weapon 3 sees RiggsMel Gibsonand MurtaughDanny Gloverback once again now having to deal with Jack TraversStuart Wilsona former L.A.P.D cop turned arms dealer. Now with the help Leo GetzJoe Pesciand Internal Affairs cop Sgt. Lorna ColeRene RussoRiggs and Murtaugh look to take down Jack Travers at all costs.Lethal Weapon 3 is fantastic Action film that I always liked since seeing it in 199293 especially after loving the first two Lethal Weapons. I can see why some people wouldn't like this one as much as the first two because the first two Lethal Weapon's set the bar so high for Action how do you top those two and where do you go with the franchise. The story for Lethal Weapon 3 Isn't groundbreaking or original by any stretch of the imagination because LW3 follows the same formula of the first two filmsthe hilarious Adventures of Riggs and Murtuaghlots of Actiona memorable villain and lots of explosions and thrills to satisfy the viewer. With some franchises or film series there is a formula that works and when something works you just don't change it. The film has a great barrel of laughs and humor which is first shown in the beginning of the film which pretty starts off with a big giant bang. It's a great opening that will have you laughing your head off. The characters and the terrific offbeat personalities of RiggsMurtaughLeo and Lorna Cole brings laughs and hilarious dialog just like the second one. While LW3 is a funny film it is also a very emotional film especially with the examination about guns and gang violence and how gang violence or the possession of guns can lead to death. LW3 is also an examination of the great characters of Riggs and Murtaugh and how Murtaugh wants to retire and how it affects Riggs and the relationship he has with Murtaugh while Murtaugh is getting older and wants to retire. This film shows viewers that Riggs and Murtaugh's partnership and relationship is more complex than we thought. What I also love about the film is the addition of the character Lorna Cole as Riggs' love interest because in many respects Lorna is the female version of Riggs like Riggs she loves The Three StoogesAction and Lorna could be slightly insane like Riggs and that is one of the reasons this film as flawed as it is works because of the chemistry between these two characters and that both characters are pretty much on an even keel when compared to each other. This movie like the other LW films moves at a fast pace and it never slows down once the Action starts and once the Action starts there's nonstop thrills and excitement. The LW films have always been known for great villains and Jack Travis is a great villain because this time instead of being a villain from another country or from the armyTravis is a former cop who is now an arms dealer selling guns and armor piercing bullets that can and will kill cops in a heartbeat and in some ways that make Jack Travers dangerous to not only Riggs and Murtaugh but other cops as well even though he's not as intimidating as the villains in LW12 or 4. The Action scenes in this film are great and intense and make the film more suspenseful and insane with great shootoutsexplosions and fires all around giving the film a powerful rush. The final 2030 minutes like the other LW films are great and Action filled and also look at the film and look for the scene after the credits the scene will have you roaring in laughter.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh bringing the same intensitylaughs and chemistry as in the first two. Joe Pesci is fantastic and hilarious once again as fast talking Leo Getz. Rene Russo is greattough and sexy as Sgt. Lorna ColeRiggs' love interest. Stuart Wilson does a wonderful job as Jack Travisthe villain of the film. Steve KahanCapt. MurphyMary Ellen TrainerStephanie WoodsPsychachirstDarlene LoveTrish MurtaughTraci WolfeRianne MurtaughDamon HinesNick MurtaughEbonie SmithCarrie MurtaughGregory MillerTyroneand Jason MeshoverLorgYoung Copgiver go performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellentwith Donner always moving the camera and using great angles while also doing well in the Action scenes. Great direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is effective and intense and goes well with the film. Another great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also great songs by Sting with Eric ClaptonIt's Probably MeElton John and Eric ClaptonRunaway Trainand Boyz II MenIt's So Hard To Say Goodbye. Great songs.In final wordif you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon franchiseI highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 3a Actionpackedfunny and entertaining sequel that's not as good as the first two but you watch again and again with the rest of the series.

	schema:reviewBody "For a while this was my favorite Lethal Weapon movie then I began to realize it was'ent as good as I thought it was.  The plot is nonexistent which is something I'm not too big on but it still had a lot of good action.  Hell I practically did'nt know what the plot was until about the third time I watched it.  There are some decent dialogue scene's but not enough is focused on the bad guy's.  And why was Joe Pesci in this one hes completely useless to the entire plot.  But beside's all that the action scene's are the best part of this movie.  The freeway chase is cool and the ending gunfight is superb.  The first and second were a lot better than this one but still is you wanna watch a movie that you dont have to focus an inch on plot and just action see this one. 3.55".

	schema:reviewBody "JUST A KISSRocky and Good Will Hunting are the best of examples of what happens when outofwork actors write.In these situations they can write themselves work. And with some talent some and a little luck these unemployable actors are never unemployed again.Nervous nebbish actor Patrick Breen wrote this experimental OffOff broadway play Just A Kiss about how one single event can completely can change not just the lives of the kissers and their significant others but people outside their little circles.A whole chain reaction. One kiss. Between two people who shouldn't be kissing. And then hell breaks loose. Not just the kissers and their significant others. But people outside the circle as well.A promising idea even though we have seen it before. One person and one desicion. That's all it takes.Oddball character actor Fisher Stevens is a friend and collaborator of Breen's and makes his directorial debut with this experimental film and the oftendubbed character actor does some experimental character direction here with this one.Perhaps the film is trying to be too many things at once.Maybe the real problem with Just A Kiss is it takes too many targets. Social commentary on love life and relationships especially in NYC. A black comedy. An experiment. A drama. A dramedy perhaps? And if that's not enough the movie tries too hard to be hip and stylish and groundbreaking with it's technique.JAK which could probably be best described as an Antiromantic comedy. What bothers me the most is that it's not a succesful one. But boy it sure could have been.Dag named after a former U.N. secreatry who's a real dog is a commercial director who's dating Halley a woman who saved his life and living with her.He's unfaithful quite frequently and seems to be prone to having flings with some of Manhattan's more mentally ill chicks. It's a shame Dag can't be faithful to Halley because she's the sanest woman he can come across.Maybe it could have had it been... less ambitious? That's not the right attitude. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Should we HATE everybody for trying?His friend Peter a commercial actor who also wrote this film is having relationship trouble with his mentally unbalanced ballerina girlfriend who has a steady habit of cheating on him with everybody she also has a married man named Andre Taye Diggs who comes over to sleep with her regularly and HE winds up having sex with Halley and bcomes her boyfriend. Peter has a quick one with Colleen Andre's wife.And... people start dropping and dying pretty quickly. Couples couple up with other people and the body count rises as people kill themselves or each other.But now the problems with the movie A lot has been made about the film's use of rotoscoping. An animation technique that was a favorite and perhaps partially invented of Xrated adult animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. His adult cartoons often blended animation with liveaction. This movie does the same.Except with a liveaction cast who only occassionally animate and do things that are glossed with cartoon frosting.Why does this movie employ rotomation? Perhaps because the characters are cartoon characters themselves. They're so overplayed in a big broad slapstick sort of way. Imagine Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny sitting around doing Neil LaBute or Todd Solondz material. It can be cute. For a few seconds. Maybe it's a metephor. Maybe it's supposed to mean this movie is more of a metephor than commentary. Or maybe it's just supposed to be stylish and hip.But it just doesn't work here pure and simple.That is not to say ALL the rotoscoping in the movie is a bad idea. The intro in the title sequence is pretty great. But it just makes the rest of the badness so much more clear.We hear Dag telling a story where he and Peter are in the back of a cab and speeding through NYC. We see rotomation at work outside illuminating the alreadylit Manhattan afterhours club scene. Inside everything is hopping... and litterally glowing. So are a lot of the people. A woman with a slavic accent screams at a man in a Porsche and makes death threats.Dag moves towards her as the Porsche drives away. Onlookers think it's a bad idea. Who cares? She's vunerable.They have passionante animal sex complete with rotomation highlighting visuals. The morning after they wake up. She turns out to not have an accent. She's American. She sobs I'm engaged! Dag just decides they should just forget last night get her things and show her out the door.Oh she's crazy. Right before she takes that step out she smiles and says in a NEW accent She does this kind of s all the time. And we see her eye turn a frightening color.  She's got multiplecrazy. This is a nice touch. Good little montage there Steve.But unfortunatly this isn't a movie where they're satisfied with the little touches.I love how diabolical the soundtrack is. This music is truly inspired. And kind of fitting for this movie I guess. The thing how the movie is that it's so promising it plays out like a notebook of theories and ideas by a firstyear philsophy major.The cast is great and than more able to play these characters. But the movie is directed like it's farce and slapstick when it's supposed to be serious. It moves at the pace and is styled like an MTV music videowhich is all wrong for this material.One bright spark is Marisa Tomei. Ever since My Cousin Vinny she's been typecast into playing that one role. The sexy sassy and quicktempered girlfriend who's kind of the whole pointofsanity for her hairtrigger ontheedge boyfriend.She got the Oscar for the role. Ever since she has never been allowed to play another role. But in this movie she has been granted the opportunity.She plays a mentally unstable and potentially homicidal waitress. She makes small talk with Dag plays his confidant. She reads fortunes in rings left by cold beer bottles. She reads his. He needs a onenight stand to help him to forget. She throws herself at him. Leave your number. He does. This only makes things worse in a way I can't quite reveal here.There's one potentially funny Seinfeldian moment as Peter makes a cellular call on a plane right before landing. The radio transmission interfears with the control tower. The plane breaks in half and passengers die. Now that really made me laugh.The tourist class business and coach all die horribly whereas the first class skitter across the runway and land safely close to the gates. No here is an inspired bit. With a director able to juggle multiple tones a little better this could've been a success.But the actual final product plays out like an exercise or a list or experimentation of different cinematic styles. Which actually I guess it is. Steven has always been a character actor and now he's a character director. Let's hop his next character is at least somewhat better.Lets also hope their next collaboration is better. Hell it'll be easy to top this one. Just A Kiss... just doesn't work.Better luck next time guys.".

This is a nice touch. Good little montage there Steve.But unfortunatly this isn't a movie where they're satisfied with the little touches.I love how diabolical the soundtrack is. This music is truly inspired. And kind of fitting for this movie I guess. The thing how the movie is that it's so promising it plays out like a notebook of theories and ideas by a firstyear philsophy major.The cast is great and than more able to play these characters. But the movie is directed like it's farce and slapstick when it's supposed to be serious. It moves at the pace and is styled like an MTV music videowhich is all wrong for this material.One bright spark is Marisa Tomei. Ever since My Cousin Vinny she's been typecast into playing that one role. The sexy sassy and quicktempered girlfriend who's kind of the whole pointofsanity for her hairtrigger ontheedge boyfriend.She got the Oscar for the role. Ever since she has never been allowed to play another role. But in this movie she has been granted the opportunity.She plays a mentally unstable and potentially homicidal waitress. She makes small talk with Dag plays his confidant. She reads fortunes in rings left by cold beer bottles. She reads his. He needs a onenight stand to help him to forget. She throws herself at him. Leave your number. He does. This only makes things worse in a way I can't quite reveal here.There's one potentially funny Seinfeldian moment as Peter makes a cellular call on a plane right before landing. The radio transmission interfears with the control tower. The plane breaks in half and passengers die. Now that really made me laugh.The tourist class business and coach all die horribly whereas the first class skitter across the runway and land safely close to the gates. No here is an inspired bit. With a director able to juggle multiple tones a little better this could've been a success.But the actual final product plays out like an exercise or a list or experimentation of different cinematic styles. Which actually I guess it is. Steven has always been a character actor and now he's a character director. Let's hop his next character is at least somewhat better.Lets also hope their next collaboration is better. Hell it'll be easy to top this one. Just A Kiss... just doesn't work.Better luck next time guys.";

	schema:headline " A kiss is not just a kiss in this wonderfully funny black comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "I just had the pleasure of seeing Just a Kiss at my sneak preview symposium. It was the first film of the semester and it was a great start.It's rare that I see a film that is so original and brilliant. The story is fresh all the actors are perfectly cast and it had my full attention from the very first scene. Patrick Breen has written a story about a group of people who's lives are interconnected and we see the stories unfold from 4 or 5 perspectives. Not an easy feat to accomplish and it's done so well in this film. Patrick Breen is also one of the leads in this film. When he's on screen it's great fun to see what his next move will be how he'll move his eyebrow or cock his head  his performance is right on target and totally charming. Marisa Tomei gives another unforgettable portrayal of a woman who isn't what she appears to be. She also looks as if she's having the time of her life as Paula the waitress at the bowling alley.The film also makes use of the rotoscope  a way of animating a live performance which was used in Waking Life. It's used to much more effectively in this film to highlight and focus in on certain elements and even to soften certain harsh images. The movie would not have been as much fun without this element  it would have been much flatter and I don't think the humor would shine the way it does. Without the vivid use of the rotoscope the movie would have taken a darker tone.Fisher Stevens directorial debut is an auspicious one and hopefully the start of an enduring new career. I have a feeling Just a Kiss may become a hit just like Big Fat Greek Wedding. It had a small budget and was shot in 21 days but comes across as polished as a big budget studio film but with a much a much better storyline and final result. This movie proves that a having a big budget is not what makes a good film which audiences already know but the studios don't  it helps to have an intelligent screenplay and characters we care about and are interesting to follow from start to finish.I hope Just a Kiss becomes a huge hit...so spread the word. You're friends will thank you.".

It was the first film of the semester and it was a great start.It's rare that I see a film that is so original and brilliant. The story is fresh all the actors are perfectly cast and it had my full attention from the very first scene. Patrick Breen has written a story about a group of people who's lives are interconnected and we see the stories unfold from 4 or 5 perspectives. Not an easy feat to accomplish and it's done so well in this film. Patrick Breen is also one of the leads in this film. When he's on screen it's great fun to see what his next move will be how he'll move his eyebrow or cock his head  his performance is right on target and totally charming. Marisa Tomei gives another unforgettable portrayal of a woman who isn't what she appears to be. She also looks as if she's having the time of her life as Paula the waitress at the bowling alley.The film also makes use of the rotoscope  a way of animating a live performance which was used in Waking Life. It's used to much more effectively in this film to highlight and focus in on certain elements and even to soften certain harsh images. The movie would not have been as much fun without this element  it would have been much flatter and I don't think the humor would shine the way it does. Without the vivid use of the rotoscope the movie would have taken a darker tone.Fisher Stevens directorial debut is an auspicious one and hopefully the start of an enduring new career. I have a feeling Just a Kiss may become a hit just like Big Fat Greek Wedding. It had a small budget and was shot in 21 days but comes across as polished as a big budget studio film but with a much a much better storyline and final result. This movie proves that a having a big budget is not what makes a good film which audiences already know but the studios don't  it helps to have an intelligent screenplay and characters we care about and are interesting to follow from start to finish.I hope Just a Kiss becomes a huge hit...so spread the word. You're friends will thank you.";

The acting is topnotch all the way. Gere manages to make us care about a type of person that few like. O'Quinn is somewhat underused as he is a magnificent actor but apart from that everyone gets a good chance to perform well and they all live up to it. I would have to say that I now have a completely newfound respect for Norton... and I had a great deal of respect for him before even knowing of this movie. The plot is wellwritten and has good layers to it especially for a movie of two hoursrunning time does put quite a limitation on the level of detail and intricacy of the plot. The pacing is really good the movie never moves neither too fast nor too slowly. This is the second film I've seen that was directed by Gregory Hoblit... and the second that I've really really likedboth have received 8's by yours truly and very deservedly so so I will most definitely keep an eye out for any future works by the man. I haven't read the book of the same title that this is based on so I can't comment on how accurate and true to the tone this film is. I urge anyone intending to watch this to steer clear of any spoilers on it because the plot is too good to ruin. I won't detail it here I'll just say that the film has many courtroom scenes and deals with a very violent crimeand it's not the only occurrence in the film of a violent nature. For that same reason since it is depicted graphically in the filmbut not too much... there was nothing gratuitous about it I urge anyone who believes they may not be able to handle seeing such to consider if they should watch it or not. There is also quite a bit of language as well as a brief scene of sexual nature so if such bother you you may want to watch a censored version if you are interested in seeing it. I recommend this very warmly to any fan of courtroom dramas and thrillers. If you enjoy an engaging and involving thriller with surprises this is the movie for you. 810".

Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette another step in what will hopefully someday be film's love affair with her.

Which Norton to his credit certainly has in his career.But as to Gere he plays Martin Vail a top criminal defense attorney who will let everyone know it if they haven't figured it out. It's a tricky part because a guy this arrogant has to maintain some kind of surface likability or else you'd never believe he'd ever win a case in front of a jury. As for movie viewers they must have a rooting interest for him as well. But Gere's definitely a guy who they make lawyer jokes about.A young altar boy has murdered the archbishop of Chicago a mush mouth kid with a Kentucky twang played by Edward Norton. He's part of a choir of street kids that the Chicago archdiocese shows off on many an occasion. It was a particularly brutal murder multiple stabbings and the carving of a cryptic message in the chest of the deceased.Gere makes no bones about it he's wanting this case because of the headlines it will bring him.

That might have been the reason that Cuba Gooding beat out Norton for Best Supporting Actor with his much lighter role in Jerry Maguire.One in this film you will notice are Laura Linney as the Assistant District Attorney who Gere was once involved with and is getting a lot of pressure to bring in a guilty verdict for understandable political reasons. I also liked Alfre Woodard as the very patient judge at Norton's trial and Frances McDormand as the psychiatrist who examines Norton.If you think you've figured out what's behind Primal Fear rest assured you haven't from this description.

	schema:headline " Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut.";
	schema:reviewBody "Primal Fear directed by Gregory Hoblit written by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman is based on the book by William Diehl. Primal Fear is one of the few examples of a psychological thriller with young new talent shinning in a film with a great script and excellent direction. Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut.When Arch Bishop Rushmen is murdered in his office a young parishioner Aaron Stampler is found running from the scene covered in blood. The police follow him to a train yard where he is eventually arrested. When Stampler expertly played by Edward Norton is captured by the police he is obviously terrified unexpectedly meek and can't make eye contact. Stampler's prominent stutter and introverted personality make his guilt difficult to digest.Richard Gere's character the smarmy defense attorney Richard Vail sees the capture on the local news and decides to represent Stampler probono for the publicity. He leaves his cover page interview to get to Stampler's cell before any other defense attorney does. The first half of the movie plays like a thrilling murder trial drama. District Attorney Janet Venable played by Laura Linney tirelessly and doggedly pursues Stampler. Evidence is covertly and excitingly collected. Light is shined on different aspects of the case by both the DA and the defense attorney.Vail tracks down another alter boy who tells him the sins of the Arch Diocese and that he taped them. Vail gets the video and it rocks the case from a simple church slaying to a complicated case of blame the victim. This is only one of the first masterfully written plot turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat and unable to truly grasp the situation fully. Vail orders a psychological evolution for Stampler. The interview brings to surface a Stampler's mental illness. When Stampler's mental illness I won't ruin it for you is revealed to his psychologist it is horrifying and rocks the viewer with an unexpected jolt. His guilt or innocence is no longer easy to figure out and isn't a case of black or white. The rest of the courtroom drama rests on your perception of the guilt or innocence of Aaron Stampler. Courtroom drama isn't the only drama. Interrelated to the case there is a subplot about rich business men murder church corruption and mobsters. Yeah it could go downhill fast and sounds cheeseball but it works. The subplot gives Vail motivation for passionately defending his client.Richard Gere flawlessly plays the grandiloquent Vail. Vail must believe disbelieve question and wonder about Stampler's guilt. Even so Gere's acting never misses the mark. He gives new meaning to smarmy and surprise. Even so his acting is far outshined by Edward Norton's disturbing performance.Edward Norton's character ranges from pitiful to downright scary. The challenge of Norton's character is portraying a man who might be guilty but making it so hard to conceive that your mind can't get around it. Portraying a person with the mental illness I'm still not going to tell you Stampler has is extremely difficult to do with out turning the part into a poltergeistic mess but Norton leaves you with your mouth hanging open unable to speak. It is no wonder that Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for this role.Gregory Hoblit's direction is worthy of applause. The fragile nature of all the relationships is a thread he had to walk like a tightrope. Each actor's performance would have devastated the film if it were over or underacted. Still Hoblit was able to get passion and coldness at the exact level the character the relationships and the film required. It was as if he wanted his direction to cook the perfect omelet. Too long in the pan and it's rubber too short and it's soupy just right and it's breakfast. This film is an exceptional work of cinematic art. Every character is multidimensional perfectly written and wonderfully acted. I could watch this movie over and over again and it doesn't lose a thing.".

Primal Fear is one of the few examples of a psychological thriller with young new talent shinning in a film with a great script and excellent direction. Edward Norton could not have picked a better film in which to debut.When Arch Bishop Rushmen is murdered in his office a young parishioner Aaron Stampler is found running from the scene covered in blood. The police follow him to a train yard where he is eventually arrested. When Stampler expertly played by Edward Norton is captured by the police he is obviously terrified unexpectedly meek and can't make eye contact. Stampler's prominent stutter and introverted personality make his guilt difficult to digest.Richard Gere's character the smarmy defense attorney Richard Vail sees the capture on the local news and decides to represent Stampler probono for the publicity. He leaves his cover page interview to get to Stampler's cell before any other defense attorney does. The first half of the movie plays like a thrilling murder trial drama. District Attorney Janet Venable played by Laura Linney tirelessly and doggedly pursues Stampler. Evidence is covertly and excitingly collected. Light is shined on different aspects of the case by both the DA and the defense attorney.Vail tracks down another alter boy who tells him the sins of the Arch Diocese and that he taped them. Vail gets the video and it rocks the case from a simple church slaying to a complicated case of blame the victim. This is only one of the first masterfully written plot turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat and unable to truly grasp the situation fully. Vail orders a psychological evolution for Stampler. The interview brings to surface a Stampler's mental illness. When Stampler's mental illness I won't ruin it for you is revealed to his psychologist it is horrifying and rocks the viewer with an unexpected jolt. His guilt or innocence is no longer easy to figure out and isn't a case of black or white. The rest of the courtroom drama rests on your perception of the guilt or innocence of Aaron Stampler. Courtroom drama isn't the only drama. Interrelated to the case there is a subplot about rich business men murder church corruption and mobsters. Yeah it could go downhill fast and sounds cheeseball but it works. The subplot gives Vail motivation for passionately defending his client.Richard Gere flawlessly plays the grandiloquent Vail. Vail must believe disbelieve question and wonder about Stampler's guilt. Even so Gere's acting never misses the mark. He gives new meaning to smarmy and surprise. Even so his acting is far outshined by Edward Norton's disturbing performance.Edward Norton's character ranges from pitiful to downright scary. The challenge of Norton's character is portraying a man who might be guilty but making it so hard to conceive that your mind can't get around it. Portraying a person with the mental illness I'm still not going to tell you Stampler has is extremely difficult to do with out turning the part into a poltergeistic mess but Norton leaves you with your mouth hanging open unable to speak. It is no wonder that Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for this role.Gregory Hoblit's direction is worthy of applause. The fragile nature of all the relationships is a thread he had to walk like a tightrope. Each actor's performance would have devastated the film if it were over or underacted. Still Hoblit was able to get passion and coldness at the exact level the character the relationships and the film required. It was as if he wanted his direction to cook the perfect omelet. Too long in the pan and it's rubber too short and it's soupy just right and it's breakfast. This film is an exceptional work of cinematic art. Every character is multidimensional perfectly written and wonderfully acted. I could watch this movie over and over again and it doesn't lose a thing.";

Gere does his usual good job delivering a solid performance elevated by terrific chemistry with his leading lady even providing the movie with a stunning endingbut Primal Fear has become Edward Norton's starmaker and an instant classic for it.It's now the stuff of Hollywood legend how Norton was so impressive during his reading for the part of AaronRoy Stampler that Tinseltown fell all over itself offering the unknown its meatiest parts even before Fear was in the can. He's had a golden career since being allowed to direct his 6th film Keeping the Faith2000 and his fast rise in Hollywood has seemingly impelled Ed in private to question if this is all there is. But Norton doesn't carry the acting load all by himselfthat's spread out evenly among the topnotch cast assembled by Deborah Aquila and Jane Shannon.

It's packed to the brim with backstory for every character thanks to its previous incarnation as a William Diehl novel. The gutsy Ann BidermanSteve Shagan screenplay combined with Hoblit's intelligent direction allows the human relationships to be complex and to have lots of history often with each other.At just over 2hrs Fear is a riveting education in the routine abduction of our legal system by the rich and powerful. They usually turn out to be the city fathers. John ShaughnessyMahoney the State Attorney knows he is the pivot of considerable financial skullduggery amidst the intimate secrets of all the usual players when he claims that this city doesn't burn because I won't permit it.This subplot recalls the notion of menschkeit from Ken Lipper's similarlyintentioned City Hall1996.

Her toughminded presence in the enemy camp offers Vale one last opportunity not to underestimate her. When he doesn't it's the best compliment he could've paid her relieving much of his earlier guilt.We discover Shaughnessy's surprising personal stake in the Stampler case way late into the last quarter as Vale FINALLY introduces it in court.

	schema:headline " Norton's Explosive Debut";
	schema:reviewBody "I understand that we all have different tastes when it comes to movies and that we all see greatness in a variety of ways. I will be the first to admit that I was totally lost when watching the Matrix and possess absolutely no desire to sit through the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. I am not trying to take anything away from those movies because I also understand that a large percent of the movie viewing population see the Matrix and LOTR trilogies as masterpieces.That being said it is beyond me why Primal Fear never made it to more people's best or greatest lists. It has received positive ratings on this website but overall the movie enjoyed very quiet success. This movie is spectacular from start to finish. The ending is a doozy and Edward Norton's performance is Oscar worthy. Not only did his performance blind side me who the hell is this guy? but it was also a sign of great things to come from Edward Norton. He is one of our greatest actors.The plot an altar boy is accused of murdering a priest who as it turns out was molesting him seems even more relevant 10 years later than it did in 1996. That is the basic plot but there are so many subplots and side stories about political corruption and cover ups that make for one incredibly satisfying story.The performances are top notch all the way down the cast. Richard Gere Laura Linney John Mahoney Steven Bauer and even Terry O' Quinn turn in stellar performances. The movie takes place in Chicago and I believe it perfectly captures what I consider to be the Chicago mood or attitude I live in a western suburb of Chicago.Of course the movie is about more than an altar boy who may or may not have committed murder and political corruption. The movie's central character Martin Vail Gere is a defense attorney who because of his high profile cases enjoys a minor celebrity status. His name is always in the newspapers and his face is always on the TV news. He can't get enough of this attention either. Martin is a great defense attorney but he's definitely too arrogant for his own good. When a reporter asks When do you realize you have them? When do you realize you've won? Vail responds without giving it much thought The minute I accept the case. I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in the theaters. A lot of movies promise a truly shocking ending and that THIS movie will keep you guessing until the very end. The trailers for Primal Fear said none of that. Sitting in the theater there was no expectation on my part for a twist ending. Perhaps that is why during its initial viewing it was more shocking to me than even the twist in The Sixth Sense. With The Sixth Sense you KNEW there was something to figure so for two hours that is exactly what you did. You tried to figure it out. Primal Fear's ending totally sucker punched me. The twist isn't revealed until the final minute or two of the movie so up until the minute it is revealed the viewer honestly trusts everything they have just seen. There are no hints that what you are being told may not be true. It's a masterpiece. Hitchcock would have loved it and it's Edward Norton's performance that really makes it work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Primal Fear will always be on of the best movies I have ever seen. I remember the first time I saw it I remember each and every subsequent time and each time it's equally as incredible. As thrillers go this is the be all and end all!! Drop dead powerful performances a moving story captivating courtroom drama and scenes and an ending that makes The Sixth Sense look predictable. In this review I WILL NOT reveal the ending in any way shape or form because if you have not yet seen this movie I would never deprive anyone of the incredible shock that this film delivers. Richard Gere is one of my favorite actors always has been. He has a screen presence rivaled by very few and his performance in Primal Fear is no exception. Martin Vail will always be one of his best performances. Vail is conceited hopelessly stuck on his own ego. He believes himself to be unparalleled in the world of law and he can't wait to sink his teeth into the media story of the century. A young man and alter boy has been arrested following a brutal murder of a beloved arch bishop. Perplexing thing is this boy is the most soft spoken stuttering quiet innocent boy Vail has ever seen and he immediately sees fame attached to this case. Without a doubt Gere's character goes through the greatest transformation in this film as he quickly discovers the difference between truth and lies defense and offense and that not everything is black and white.Primal Fear is the story on many levels of people who wear masks different sides of themselves to different people. Each character wears a different mask throughout the film. Vail wears the mask of being pompous and confident but in fact is scared fragile and emotional. The defendant Aaron wears the mask of being the innocent scared little boy but has the evil alter personality that protects him. Laura Linney's character Janet Venable also wears the mask of being a confident strong lawyer while in fact feeling her world is falling apart and of course the victim himself Bishop Rushman who to the city was a beloved man who helped many but in fact performed horrible perverted things on his children behind closed doors. Laura Linney is quite good as the rather shaken prosecutor who is really fighting for her job in trying to vindicate Aaron while taking on her former love Vail in the courtroom. She has something to prove and a huge chip on her shoulder and makes for some intense debates in the courtroom between Gere and Linney. Frances McDormand is also very good as Aaron's psychiatrist Dr. Arrington she's very believable and handles the role with great intelligence. All these amazing performances in this film and they still don't even come fathoms close to touching that of then newcomer Mr. Edward Norton in his Academy Award and hugely deserved nominated role as Aaron Stampler and his protective brash angry violent alter personality Roy. Norton is so believable as Stampler and to watch his scary transformation to Roy his performance draws you in exactly like he's doing for the main characters in the film. You're feeling everything that Martin Vail is feeling as you watch this movie. Every single person's performance in this film is so brilliant that it adds into one amazing film. Other notable smaller performances are Maura Tierney Alfre Woodard John Mahoney and the great Andre Braugher. None of these performances should be ignored.Director Gregory Hoblit at the heart makes a courtroom drama with lots of behind the scenes investigation that puts the action and thrill into the film. But that doesn't stop when it hits the courtroom. The drama and fire ignites in the courtroom with the battle back and forth further facts new evidence a story unfolding before us about this Bishop and his brutal murder. From beginning to end this is one entertainment at it's absolute best. In my opinion I state this as one of the greatest films ever period!! It's absolutely one of my top ten for certain. It's just powerful moving well acted and thrilling. It's exactly what you want a film to be...it's what movies are all about. Everyone must see this brilliant movie!! 1010".

Frances McDormand is also very good as Aaron's psychiatrist Dr. Arrington she's very believable and handles the role with great intelligence. All these amazing performances in this film and they still don't even come fathoms close to touching that of then newcomer Mr. Edward Norton in his Academy Award and hugely deserved nominated role as Aaron Stampler and his protective brash angry violent alter personality Roy. Norton is so believable as Stampler and to watch his scary transformation to Roy his performance draws you in exactly like he's doing for the main characters in the film. You're feeling everything that Martin Vail is feeling as you watch this movie. Every single person's performance in this film is so brilliant that it adds into one amazing film. Other notable smaller performances are Maura Tierney Alfre Woodard John Mahoney and the great Andre Braugher. None of these performances should be ignored.Director Gregory Hoblit at the heart makes a courtroom drama with lots of behind the scenes investigation that puts the action and thrill into the film. But that doesn't stop when it hits the courtroom. The drama and fire ignites in the courtroom with the battle back and forth further facts new evidence a story unfolding before us about this Bishop and his brutal murder. From beginning to end this is one entertainment at it's absolute best. In my opinion I state this as one of the greatest films ever period!! It's absolutely one of my top ten for certain. It's just powerful moving well acted and thrilling. It's exactly what you want a film to be...it's what movies are all about. Everyone must see this brilliant movie!! 1010";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERT I was surprised looking at the IMDb top 250 movies that Primal Fear isn't among them while the more elaborately made and overrated thriller The Usual Subjects is listed as 17 among the all time best in motion picture history. Both movies have narratives that build up to a shocking and surprising ending but the movie Primal Fear's ending fits right in with the story that it's presenting and doesn't take anything away from it. While at the same time when you see the movie again for any clues for the surprise ending as hard as you try you can't find them because the ending was in the true sense of the word a total surprise.Primal Fear is really one of those movies that has a good story that builds up the suspense level with acting and directing and delivers a shocking ending. The film climax not only stuns the audience but makes total sense and doesn't take away anything from the story that you saw up to that point when it hits you. Where as The Usual Suspects surprise ending seems totally contrived and completely negates the story that you were seeing up to the part that you were hit by it that the movie plot that you were watching becomes utterly senseless.Marty Vail Richard Gere is one of Chicago's top defense attorneys who likes to take on highprofile cases for a hefty fee or ProBono as long as it gets him publicity and embellishes his already envious reputation. Marty also believes that everybody no matter how repulsive their crime which there accused of deserves to be defended to the utmost of his ability. One morning in a bar watching the TV Vail sees a live news report of the police chasing down a young man who is reported to have murdered a very powerful and popular man from the Catholic Church Archbishop Richard Rushman Stanley Anderson. Smelling publicity in defending that person if he's not killed by the police or ends up killing himself Vail uses his connections to get on the case defending him. At the jailhouse talking to the young man Aaron Stampler Edward Norton he finds out that he's a 19 yearold altar boy at the church that the Archbishop was in charge of. Stampler tells him that he blacked out lost time as he puts it when he came into the Archbishops office when he heard that there was someone else there. Stampler blacked out but when he woke up from his unconscious state he found himself covered with blood and the Archbishop was dead! Seeing that he just panicked and ran. The state wants the death penalty for Stampler and assigned to prosecute the case Janet Venable Laura Linney who once had an affair with Marty Vail and is very surprised that Vail is handling the case for Stampler's defense. Before he's to go on trial when Stampler is examined by a defense paid psychiatrist Dr. Molly Arrington Frances McDormand. It's then discovered that he has a split personality and is not in control of himself when his other self takes over his mind and he becomes Roy a completely different and violent person! Marty Vail later also finds this out the hard and brutal way about Stampler's condition by being banged around by Roy. It's determined by Dr. Arrington that Sampler is a very sick person and should get help in a mental hospital not in a prison but since the trial is already on Vail can't change the plea from not guilty to innocent by reason of insanity. Vail later finds out that Stampler was sexually abused by the Archbishop by tracking down a video tape with the Archbishop having Stampler and other altar boys and girls engage in sexual activities while he watched. The tape would not only be very embarrassing to the church but to a lot of high powerful people in the city and state government if it were released.Vail sends a copy of the tape to the prosecutor Miss. Venable so it would force her to use it at the trial. At the trial State Prosecutor Venable has the tape playedto the total shock of those in the courtroom to show that Stampler had cause and reason to murder the Archbishop. Just as Vail expected by releasing the tape to Venable the case starts to backfire against her. It's then when Vail puts Aaron Stampler on the stand to be crossexamined by Miss. Venable who aggressive and belligerently questions him on the archbishops murder he goes completely berserk. Roy takes over Aaron's mind and attacks Miss. Venable and almost ends up breaking her neck. Everybody decides the Judge as well as the prosecution that Stampler is insane and not responsible for his actions and drops the murder case against him. I's agreed that he needs to be in a mental hospital and not in a state prison but the story is not over for the movies shocking and surprising ending is just about to happen. One of the best crimecourt dramas ever made with outstanding performances by of course Edward Norton Richard Gere Laura Linney and everyone else involved with the acting in the movie. Don't miss seeing it you won't be disappointed you'll be rewarded with one of the best crimecourt dramas and surprise ending movies of all time.".

It's really well written well acted and also has an exceptionally good ending.

Things seem to change however when Vail discovers that not only had the Archbishop been involved in some dubious land deals in which a number of powerful people had lost a great deal of money but also he had subsequently received numerous death threats.Janet Venable Laura Linney who happens to be Vail's exlover is assigned by the D.A. to prosecute the case and is instructed to press hard for the death penalty. The D.A.'s own actions are then called into question by Vail when it comes to light that he had been one of the people who'd lost money in the shady land deals.When Vail finds out that the Archbishop had also sexually abused the alter boys and that Aaron had been one of his victims he's initially uncertain what to do with the information because making it generally available would give his client a strong motive for the crime and the lack of an apparent motive was the only real weakness in the prosecution's case.Vail's dealings with Aaron and the information he discovers about the activities of the Archbishop and the D.A. lead him to believe in his client's innocence and the means by which he proceeds to defend Aaron against the prosecution's accusations turns out to be highly unorthodox and extremely fascinating to watch.Primal Fear has many moments of suspense and humour and also features a talented cast who provide some fine performances. Richard Gere's role enables him to display more subtlety than he's generally required to show and Edward Norton's Oscar nominated screen debut is utterly sensational. This movie stands out so strongly against others of its type that it and Norton's amazing contribution are both truly unforgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll always think of this movie as the one which introduced us to the acting talents of Edward Norton. In other words this movie made him a star as the clich goes.But Richard Gere should be credited too with another fine acting performance. For quite awhile there Gere acted in one good movie after another and I believe this was one of his best efforts. Sometimes his pretty boy image masked the fact that he has been a pretty darned good actor in a number of film.Not only is the acting superb in here  by everyone not just Norton  but the story is very involving too. I remember being riveted to the screen while seeing this in the theater. Some of the scenes are quite shocking particularly when we discover the real Aaron Stampler Norton. If you wait awhile at least five years and see it again it's still shocking even if you vaguely remember a few things.The bad side of this  to me not to most people is the overuse of the Lord's name in vain in here mostly by Gere who is ridiculous in this role in that regard and the obvious antiCatholic bias in here. Once again on film we discover that a priest turns out to not only be a sexual deviant but also the cause of Aaron's murderous mindset. I also didn't find Laura Linney's character Janet Venable to be entertaining just annoying. There's something about Linney's smug looks that really turn me off. I have found that unlikeable characteristic in some of her other films as well.Overall if language or Catholicbashing doesn't bother you this is a super film. Even if it does it's a pretty intense crime movie and certainly entertaining.".

Now I'm not supposed to ever watch this movie again an actor friend was thisclose to getting the role that made Ed Norton a star which is why AMERICAN HISTORY X and FIGHT CLUB are also banned from discussion.  But PRIMAL FEAR was on TV the other night and I wanted to see it without bias.I still don't really like it.  Norton of course is magnificent but the movie is plagued with flaws.  The murder was unnecessarily graphic did we really need to see blood spurting from severed fingers? and the second act was slow muddled and when all was said and done rife with red herrings nothing bored me more than the talk about fluctuating real estate prices which ultimately didn't factor in the plot's resolution.  And then there's that final revelation which raised several unanswered questions.Ok if Aaron was faking it the whole time then how long had he been affecting that stutter?  The whole time he was an altar boy?  If that's true then he was planning the murder before he even met the archbishop  which means he would at that time have no reason to murder him.  However if he created that speech pattern after the murder surely there would be plenty of people who'd know he was lying.Other problems.  Was there no effort at all to locate the missing girlfriend?  What happened to Alex after he divulged the existence of the incriminating videotape?  And wasn't that abnormally large bandage on his ear a tooobvious way for Gere to spot him?  And couldn't that perfunctory chase sequence have been eliminated?  We know they would have caught him so he could supply crucial information if he had gotten away what would have been the reason for the scene?Still more.  Speaking of that videotape why would the bishop record every sexual encounter on a single tape only to tape over the previous meeting to record the latest one?  Wasn't it awfully convenient that he was killed before he could erase the important evidence?  Did he tape others too or just the three relevant to the plot?  Also wouldn't the judge have been required to order a complete psychiatric evaluation for Aaron before having him committed?  Even though Aaron claimed to not have remembered his assault on the Linney character couldn't he have easily heard about it from a guard or someone?  Of course he didn't  we'd have no surprise ending if he did. And what's the probability that this kid could have duped all those intelligent educated professionals so successfully?If you can answer these questions for me I'd love to hear from you.  And while I'm nitpicking there's something else in the movie that annoyed me  Laura Linney's smoking.  It was terribly obvious that Linney is a nonsmoker. Every time she lit up she would awkwardly hold the stick near her face while never taking a drag the scene in the bar after she receives the videotape is the prime example. Sure she'd occasionally put it between her lips but the camera would always cut away before she inhaled and the one time I saw her breathe out there clearly was no smoke being exhaled. Why have her character smoke?  As a smoker I cannot tell you how distracting this is.  Whenever I notice this in movies I am momentarily taken out of the story and instead am watching a documentary of an actress unconvincingly holding a lit cigarette.  Another example that comes to mind is Ashley Judd in DOUBLE JEOPARDY. Add all this to the stuff there we've all seen before in courtroom dramas  surprise testimony murmurs from the peanut gallery that cause the judge to pound hisher gavel a personal relationship between the prosecution and defense attorneys a lessthanhonorable John Mahoney anyone else remember SUSPECT?  and I now know why I don't like PRIMAL FEAR.  It's the type of movie that needs about fifteen minutes trimmed from it that chase scene can be the first to go while requiring a couple of additional scenes to clarify plot points.  But while I mentioned DOUBLE JEOPARDY here I am in no way comparing the two PRIMAL FEAR is twice as good as DOUBLE JEOPARDY  a 410 instead of 210.".

	schema:reviewBody "When an altar boy Aaron Stampler is accused of murdering a priest the mediafriendly arrogant lawyer Martin Vail takes the case and the headlines.  However he discovers that the boy is not all he seems and that there may have been a third person in the room when the priest was murdered. However his plea is fixed and he must work the case to turn things back to his advantage.Years ago the UK did a day where the Government subsidised cinemas to offer all tickets for 1.  On that day I had nothing I wanted to see but I thought like thousands other that a saving of 3 at the time was too good to miss so I went to see this film despite my caution when it comes to courtroom thrillers.  The plot here is so very full of holes that it is a wonder that the whole film doesn't fall into itself however it just about manages to succeed by being quite clever and significantly different from the usual courtroom stuff although it does still have the same faults as the rest of the genre.The film is a lot darker than many courtroom thrillers first of all Vail is not a sympathetic character  he is arrogant and conceited and the film never really offers him redemption at any point.  Likewise the climax of the film is not the usual genre twist  or rather it is but not in the usual way.  The film's main weakness however is that it is at least 20 minutes too long.  The revelations about Roy happen but then are forgotten for about 10 minutes and then raised again before being put aside again.  I really can't even understand why the film feels so padded at points in the middle when really that was when the Roy thing kicks in and the film should have stepped up a gear in a flash.  That it doesn't is a problem but not an insurmountable one as it does slowly get faster towards a downbeat conclusion that is enjoyably different from the usual Perry Mason style twist although it is a twist.I'm by no means a Richard Gere fan but he does a very good job here.  He never wants to be a good guy here and he plays it well.  However the film is driven by a great performance from Norton marking himself out as one to watch in coming years.  His dual roles are great and the film would have failed if he hadn't been able to carry it off.  The support cast is surprisingly deep with people who were either wellknown at the time or became famous later.  When a cast includes Mahoney McDormand Woodard Linney Seda and Braugher then it is worth a look  although some of them have very small roles there are no weak links.  However it is a credit to Norton that he stands shoulder to shoulder with all of them and is the one that sticks in the mind long after it finishes.Overall this is an enjoyable courtroom thriller that only struggles in the middle with an inability to really just let rip.  It's ironic but I enjoyed it because it was less showy and so on when compared to others of the genre but it could have benefited from knowing when to let go sooner.  However the cast is top notch and the unlikely plot is held together by a low key Gere and a fantastic central performances from Norton.".

	schema:reviewBody "First there are two versions of this film one which was shown in 1970 and is 76 minutes long in sepia and another which was produced in Germany for European audiences in 1971 and was 28 minutes long in black and white. If possible it is better to see the 76 minute version the 28 minute is a chopped up just the highlights version that is not very true to terayama's original intentions. Unfortunately the 28 minute version is much more widely available outside Japan and is what most people have seen.Second The film is not pornographic in the least bit. Terayama was not interested in pornography which he saw as a tool of state oppression but in creating a vision of erotic utopia. So it has naked children raping adults BIG deal. The film was made in answer to Nazi Holocaust camps the atomic bomb the rape of Nanking the Vietnam war etc. Terayama had lived through the firebombs that destroyed his town leaving charred bodies of women and children littered about him when he was but 9 years old. A few naked children especially in 1970 is no big deal so grow up. If you can't handle it then I guess yes keep your eyes closed to the worlds horror and don't watch the film.Third It is not a feel good film and is primarily about revolution and failed utopian dreams. It is a rejection of any metanarrative progression by which I mean there is no promise implied or given. No promise of good or god or justice as terayama sought to express a vanished thought Not that the film couldn't be better but it got my back up to see the other review where they dismiss it so easily and without thought.cheers".

It is obvious it's not Terayama's intention the nude scenes aren't so much erotic than somehow grotesque and touching. The children appear helpless and clumsy with their power. I saw something of a fable about this vanity the children unable to understand why they should even HAVE the power yet wanting it... I didn't know there was a long version of the movie so i imagined Terayama chose an elliptic poetic surrealist way of expressing things. He uses images for the power that is inherent to their nature and not as mere substitute to words. Now i would like to see it in its full length to be sure about all this. Nevertheless another of his movies the 1977 20 min. long Film de l'ombre Movie of the shadow ? definitely demonstrates that his cinematographic language may well be nondirect and poetic. I definitely recommend it to those who like poetry in the cinema somewhat difficult to stumble upon though. Cheers Boyan".

I didn't know there was a long version of the movie so i imagined Terayama chose an elliptic poetic surrealist way of expressing things. He uses images for the power that is inherent to their nature and not as mere substitute to words. Now i would like to see it in its full length to be sure about all this. Nevertheless another of his movies the 1977 20 min. long Film de l'ombre Movie of the shadow ? definitely demonstrates that his cinematographic language may well be nondirect and poetic. I definitely recommend it to those who like poetry in the cinema somewhat difficult to stumble upon though. Cheers Boyan";

Their plan spirals out of control and they are soon lost in a web of sexual deviation and violence.At least that's what I'd like to think it was about.OKAY NOW forget what you've seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000 this is quite simply the worst movie I have ever seen. If you have ever wondered what it would look like if you took a bunch of random video clips of absolutely ANYTHING put them together in an editing program and pressed a button called Create Movie you would get something along the lines of Emperor Tomato Ketchup.I do not mean to say that this movie is not interesting by all means it absolutely is. I mean if you consider the dancing old woman in the field who has about 20 minutes of uninterrupted screen time from a single camera shot the naked children stuffed into closets a midget decapitating a chicken two men playing RockPaperScissors and physically injuring the loser in various ways over the course of another 20 minutes and the disgusting abundance of child pornography it is quite possibly the most interesting video I've seen in a while. But bear in mind that interesting and good are not synonymous. On many levels the directors actors and all involved regardless of whatever sociopolitical significance this movie attempted to create should be physically abused for making this movie.If you have the patience enjoy it in whatever way enjoy applies to anything involved in the viewing of this bizarre film though I recommend making use of your DVDs scan rate to watch this in AT LEAST 8x speed for maximum enjoyment. If not then you're probably better off that way.Note For the record there are two versions only blackandwhite which is under 30 minutes another just under 60 in poorquality sepia tone. They are both equally bad though it's best to watch them backtoback starting with the BW one.Interesting quirk though my friend's West Coast Video account got revoked shortly afterward for returning this and another video late in addition to renting this movie which was marked Over 21 only on the cover despite how one of the clerks recommended it. Unfortunately the Who cares if you're 21? Child pornography's illegal for everyone! argument didn't work.".

The filmmakers are usually kind enough to do that for us. This is obviously not the case in Europe however for in the German film Big Girls Don't Cry the adolescents we meet are anything but morally and ethically clearcut.The two best friends Steffi and Kati seem like fairly typical middle class teens  somewhat mischievous obsessed with boys and faintly rebellious against the authority figures of the adult world. They also drink party and experiment with drugs  nothing too radical for teens anywhere in the world today. However one night Steffi inadvertently discovers that her father is having an affair. At this point all hell breaks loose as Steffi decides to take her anger and revenge out on the innocent daughter of her father's mistress an aspiring singer named Tessa. Steffi sends Tessa to a potentially dangerous local pornographer leading her to believe that he is actually a record producer searching for new talent. This single action leads to a series of cascading events that winds up in some way or other adversely affecting most of the people in Steffi's life.Steffi and Kati are both fully realized and complex characters who refuse to be pigeonholed at any given point in the movie. Steffi begins her crusade of vengeance convinced that she is acting strictly out of righteous anger especially since in her mind at least her actions are as much a way of protecting her mother's honor as her own. And if innocent victims have to be sacrificed along the way well so be it. What Steffi doesn't realize until it's too late is that we can't always control how the human dramas we set in motion will ultimately act themselves out. Kati who is far more rebellious and far more promiscuous than Steffi finds herself torn between her loyalty as a friend and doing what she knows is right. It is Kati the less selfassured one who ultimately becomes the moral beacon that Steffi will be forced to follow if she hopes to survive in the world.Anna Maria Muhe as Kati and Karoline Herfurth as Steffi give brilliant wellrounded performances as does the rest of the talented cast. The acting writing and directing are so good and true in fact that the movie is able to override the occasional implausibility or touch of melodrama that wanders into the storyline.I just wish American movies about teenagers were this thoughtprovoking interesting and impressive.".

	schema:headline " Powerful Drama About Reaching Adulthood";
	schema:reviewBody "Kati Anna Maria Mhe and Steffi Karoline Herfurth are best friends since their childhood. They spend most of their time together in school and in their leisure time. Kati has a quite hysterical mother while the parents of Steffi seems to be in permanent love. When Steffi finds her father Hans Stefan Kurt with his lover in a nightclub her world turns upsidedown. Steffi plots an evil revenge against Tessa Josefine Domes the daughter of Hans' lover. Her plan brings serious and tragic consequences to her family her friends and herself. Groe Mdchen Weinen Nicht is a powerful drama about reaching adulthood. The story begins like a common teen movie but later it shifts in a very intense dramatic and credible drama. The story does not spare any character showing the consequences of the maleficent action of Steffi not only to her but to her friends and parents teaching a lesson without being moralist specially to the target viewers  the teenagers. The soundtrack is also magnificent and I feel sorrow when I see only 287 votes in IMDb since this movie deserves to be discovered by fans of a drama about contemporary teenagers. This is the first movie I have watched with Anna Maria Mhe who is amazingly beautiful and her supportive character is very nice. Yesterday I saw another movie Mdchen Mdchen of the gorgeous and sexy German actress called Karoline Herfurth and I truly believe she will become very famous worldwide in a near future. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Meninas No Choram Girls Do not Cry".

	schema:reviewBody "Germany's answer to 'Thirteen' poses many questions about teenage life. Amongst them the strength of friendship and loyalty the longing for acceptance and stability and the desire to 'beat' rather than 'be beaten'. Where Groe Mdchen weinen nicht is poles apart from it's teenangst predocessors is in the acting charecters particularly it's secondary players and use of narrative.Kati and Steffi the film's lead charecters aren't burdened with mass dysfuctionality or traumas they are just two typical teens driven only by their ongoing friendship. Things change however when Steffi witnesses her father with another woman. What becomes petty revenge envelopes into tragedy beyond Steffi's comprehension and the loyal Kati having to decide whether she wants to play a part in it all. With Steffi in denial and Kati in guilt and the film's intergral 'revenge' story resolved almost halfway in the remainder of the film and it's real heart is devoted to the complexities of teenemotion. Steffi's cold controlling aloofness hides her painful insecurities and Kati's delicate need for love becomes secondary to her sense of right and wrong.Maria Von Helland consciously mentions the girls sexlifes even potential druguse but treats it matteroffactly. She turns a seemingly complex tale into an entertaining strikingly simple one of teenage friendship. In her two leads Anna Maria Mulhe and Karoline Herfurth we have two remarkably gifted actreses able to convey more with looks and well judged dialoge then scene stealing quirky performances. Josefine Domes and Jennifer Ulrich fare well also conveying alot over limited screentime as this is after all primarily about Steffi and Kati. Because of this male and adult charecters suffer a little but not in an obvious way and adding complex male personalities into the mix may just have leant the film's delicate balence towards moralising.Both unique and not particularly European the film's soundtrack consists of English sung pop this is aguably every bit as strong as teen friendship classics like 'Stand By Me' and 'The Breakfast Club' more so for it's lack of sensationialism.Incredibly watchable instantly appreciated this is a film to seek out as well made gems like this on such a welltrod subject can only become few and far between....".

Although I'm a fan of German movies in general I have to say this one was special for sure. Especially the outstanding performance of youngster Anna Maria Mhe adds delight to the film. The only minor flaw about the flick in general is that it should have been some 1215 minutes longer instead of pacing up through the last moments. Other than that it meets my criteria of perfection.

	schema:reviewBody "I first discovered Big Girls Don't Cry at a very unlikely place a grocery store. There was a bin of movies that was gone the next time I went there. Reading the back of it the story sounded very interesting. Since then I have become very interested in seeing it. I watched it and all I can say is WOW! This is not a movie made specifically for girls or only for Germans any guy or American can watch this and be enthralled by it. I managed to find Big Girls Don't Cry on the net in German with no subtitles. Luckily I was able to decipher most of the movie and get the gist of most things that happened. The movie is about Kati and Steffi who have been best friends their whole lives. They share secrets peak in on boys smoke cigarettes and do other mature things out of their reach. They mean no harm they just want to have fun. Not really funny to watch but it is still nice and relatable. The first little bit reminds me of some of the things my friends and I would do. When Steffi sees her father with another woman she plots revenge starting with the woman's innocent daughter Tessa. Kati has parental problems of her own and she is torn between loyalty to her best friend and knowing that Steffi is spiralling out of control. I like that this movie did not hold anything back. The directors wanted to make a teen movie that can pack a punch and it succeeds. They don't try to make it suitable for everyone because that would be totally unrealistic. There's sex drugs rape violence smoking the majority of which involve teenagers. Each of these really do happen to scarred youth and is shown in very realistic and familiar ways. One of the main themes this has is loyalty. After seeing how much of a train wreck Steffi is becoming Kati wonders how much she really means to her. Steffi's father cheats and she goes overboard while Kati's parents are always engaged in heated arguments and she is still holding it all together. That brings me to the next theme which is the impact that parents have on their children. Steffi's parents don't abuse drugs but one unfaithful act leads her to become a delinquent. Kati has horrible parents and she is trying her best not to become what they are. Every teen has been through these stages at one time or another. Anna Maria Muhe and Karoline Herfurth do fantastic portrayals in this dynamic comingofage story. Muhe does look familiar but I don't know anything else she's been in. This movie may have been back in 2002 but I still hope that both actresses become world famous. Their characters are so real and deep. Some scenes are very intense that can make you cry. The whole movie will leave a lasting impact on you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm currently studying with an exchange guy. He's from Germany and is learning many different languages. A very smart boy and fun to be with and although he speaks to us in our language it would be interesting to listen to him speaking German. Watching this film I realized how that would be. Besides the German language itself he would probably speak the same way the expressions and special words because this film's characters live in the teenage world. The piece is very brave and I don't know what the reception was at its country in its time but director Maria Von Heland is trying to declare These things happenAnd they happen to teenagers.In this very real reality kids go to school and have best friends hang out with boyfriends form rock bands carry on a sexual life and so on. Von Heland's screenplay covers all of these aspects three dimensionally because it expands them with a lot of knowledge. Best friends are what Kati newcomer at the time Anna Maria Muhe and Steffi Karoline Herfurth. The first has just ended a relationship and the last has a boyfriend named Carlos David Winter who is in a rock band. The sexual life of teenage girls isn't something understood it comes by the person each one is. The movie deals with this letting us know that Steffi and Carlos have known each other for a long time but they still haven't made love.On the other side Kati is always looking for chances going out late meeting older guys and carrying condoms inside her jeans. All this we learn when we are taken inside her house where a ruined family clearly lives. In one scene while Kati's family is having dinner Von Heland shows with a still camera the faces of each of the members and it becomes obvious it's a tense and dysfunctional life. We later experience a fatherdaughter talk about some discoveries and Kati and her younger sister praying to God while we listen to their parents' screams. They say God I know you're very busy and all that but please make our parents divorce soon. There's another strong scene near the ending where Kati prays by herself.Strong is about everything in this movie. Steffi also has his family issues we find out. We know the character and we believe she'd resolve them maturely but when Tessa Josefine Domes comes into the picture and Steffi resolves we realize that Kati is probably more mature than her and therefore how contradictory life is. Steffi has her motives for what she does with Tessa and everything she does later so does Kati when she tells her mom This is who I amLook at me!. So does Tessa's mom when she acts and Kati's mom when she gets mad and Kati's father when he advices her and everybody else. One notable thing about the feature is that is difficult to take sides you understand everyone.Another very remarkable detail is the use of music all of it in English representing each moment of the story with lyrics and songs according to the music people of the movie characters' age listen. Everything that happens to the two friends is something that could occur to any friendship any day. Because when two people are friends since little it is something given in my case with my ever best friend Matas and when they fight they always make up it is the tough bond that unites them. But the truth is that sometimes there are some much stronger things that test that bond and that is the time to find out if the feelings are real. What Kati and Steffi live is way too strong for their age but it is up to them to work it out while is up to the movie to show us how powerful friendship truly is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree 100  with the previous poster that this IS a masterpiece. So underrated it's a crime! Wow! I am seriously shocked how low rated this amazing film is! This is one of the best films i've seen. Just like the tacky shallow big money makers in the music eg Lady Gaga and Rhianna and all that vile rap all the shallow tacky flashy films get the highest ratings no matter what the content script acting etc. Says a lot about humans and current society.I'm not going to say much about the content ill leave you to watch it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. This film is about friendship and how deep it can run. It's also about broken families and the effects it can have on children and how they get taken advantage off by predators who sense there vulnerabilities. I love the friendship theme the story plays out how deep friendships can run ad also how they start to disintegrate slowly when you're hurting but take it out on the people closet to you.. I'm sure this will touch a chord with most of us. I'm a guy from Leeds UK and this film is in German. But i totally felt it and it made me cry.The acting was that believable and genuine.A beautiful lush soundtrack accompanies this film.".

This is one of the best films i've seen. Just like the tacky shallow big money makers in the music eg Lady Gaga and Rhianna and all that vile rap all the shallow tacky flashy films get the highest ratings no matter what the content script acting etc. Says a lot about humans and current society.I'm not going to say much about the content ill leave you to watch it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. This film is about friendship and how deep it can run.

	schema:reviewBody "Groe Mdchen weinen nicht or Big Girls Don't Cry is a German movie from 2002 so this one has its 15th anniversary this year. The writer and director is Maria von Heland and this is probably her second most known work today after Hector and the Search for Happiness. They sure took some risks with this film here as the lead actress is Anna Maria Mhe daughter of Ulrich and when this film came out both her parents were actually still alive. Her colead is Karoline Herfurth who was already known back then at least here in Germany. Jennifer Ulrich plays a supporting part in here and for her it was also the first onscreen performance. In terms of the older cast members the likes of Kurt Petri Harder Schmeide Brandt or Laser in a very memorable onescene performance may also be famous to German film buffs.The possibly biggest supporting performance comes from Josefine Domes and I am a bit surprised to see she never acted in a film before or after this one so yeah many rookies in here for sure.As for the story this is the tale of two teenage girls who have been best friends since a very young age but crucial changes in both their lives put a huge question mark to their connection. I would not really call this a comingofage movie though. I think it is a downright drama maybe even a thriller or crime movie with some of the stuff happening during these slightly under 1.5 hours. On a positive note no matter if you like brunettes blondes or whatever it's highly unlikely you will not be attracted to either Herfurth or Mhe and for me it is definitely the former. Back to the movie itself I think it is wellacted by everybody involved and the script is also fairly good. Maybe towards the end it goes a bit over the top as it includes the following subjects several cases of cheating murder suicide rape cocaine abuse and others too. Actually the film becomes more and more drastic the longer it goes. Early on especially in the first half it is more like a revenge film that has to do with hurt feelings but nothing too serious. This changes quickly. I think the cheating scene involving Herfurth's character is really something that is extremely telling because her character became the person that she despised the most earlier in the film. No surprise this also caused a major reaction to the character.Eventually this film does not really have any truly great moments but it is still a pretty interesting and tense and dramatic watch from start to finish. I already said that the acting was good and I certainly liked how this movie turned out overall. The music very early on and very late is also pretty good and works well together with the film's message on friendship and especially these old photographs. It's also interesting how the one girl from the two who is relatively wellbehaved is the one who gets in trouble much more with her parents compared to the other one where the parents have almost given up on her. The film is also really interesting in the ways how it depicts the parents not just the main characters' but also the parents of Tessa and Yvonne. There are many interesting details to this movie for sure and these are as much a reason why it is a success as the two central characters and their fates. I definitely recommend seeing this one certainly one of the better German films from the first years of the new millennium.".

This movie generally avoids either of these extremes. Muhe didn't do much after this but I'm surprised Herfurth didn't do more she does have a small part In Brian DePalma's 2013 movie Passion. She is really good here as a vindictive mean girl who manages to be almost downright evil without ever being entirely unsympathetic She's also definitely not hard to look at even here when she was only about 18. This is a little more racy than most American teen movies but no one is going to confuse it with the infamous exploitative German schoolgirlreports either although some aspects of the plot seem to be right out of one.I guess if you're going to watch a teen movie in the first place this is a pretty recommendable one".

The colors costumes and interior settings are grandiose to the extreme. The time period is during the Congress of Vienna 18141815 and the garb of the Counts and Countess' is award material. And how many motion pictures showcase ballet? Well this one does in two exquisite sequences. Do you like ballroom dancing? No doubt your appetite will be appeased here.

And among the actors long time veteran Hans Moser1st film 1918 appears here as Romy's grandfather. And even at this late stage a year shy of 80 his acting talents had not diminished. And last but not least the great Marcel Marceau makes a brief but noteworthy appearance with an imitation of Napoleon. For dog enthusiasts an English bulldog has two short scenes early on. There is a good transition scene to start off the movie as we watch a man outside showcasing to the crowd the effectiveness of his telescope in viewing the royalty inside. And as we get that view scene 2 takes place in its entirety from the inside. For most transition scenes the dissolve is used. The film does have a touch of Cinderella as Romy's employment deals with lady's garments a momentary scene shows her at work but as such admittance to the grand ball is denied her. Luckily her grandfather is going to be there as a musician so she filches his drumsticks and dons male attire in order to make an unnoticed entrance.

The story is thin the poor Cinderalla for a change is wooed by four persons of varied power.

	schema:headline " Sleazy film that seems strangely innocent today";
	schema:reviewBody "After a prologue in which one schulmadchen basically a German high school girlis caught having sex concerned parents teachers and other students get together for a meeting and this movie turns into a mostly fake documentary with a lot of talking heads and sexual scenes ranging from innocuous nudity to softcore groping being acted out as illustration. Obviously this movie uses the old exploitation trick of pretending to morally condemn or express liberal social concern over the same lurid subject that the movie itself is cheerfully exploiting. I'm sure when this movie was showing in a German theaters there were a lot more dirty old men in raincoats than concerned parents in the audienceand any concerned parents that WERE there probably would have been welladvised to wear raincoats as well. I'm also sure that the makers of this if interviewed today would freely admit that the moralizing was just a lot of phonybaloney to ameliorate the obviously very stupid censors.This movie seems pretty sordid on paper but I actually found it strangely innocent compared to today. We STILL have this faux moralisticsecretly lecherous mentality today. Much of our current entertainment media for instance seems focused on following around underage or just very immature young girls morally clucking at their misdeeds while salivating over every sordid detail. And the more legitimate the medium and the more serious and shrill the moralizing the more disgusting the hypocrisy. Moreover Britney Spears Lindsay Lohan Paris Hilton etc. are presumably real people. The actresses in this movie are obviously not real schulmadchen unless there was something strange in the German water back then I'd guess most of these actresses had long since put their own school uniforms on mothballs.

	onyx:emotionText "After a prologue in which one schulmadchen basically a German high school girlis caught having sex concerned parents teachers and other students get together for a meeting and this movie turns into a mostly fake documentary with a lot of talking heads and sexual scenes ranging from innocuous nudity to softcore groping being acted out as illustration. Obviously this movie uses the old exploitation trick of pretending to morally condemn or express liberal social concern over the same lurid subject that the movie itself is cheerfully exploiting. I'm sure when this movie was showing in a German theaters there were a lot more dirty old men in raincoats than concerned parents in the audienceand any concerned parents that WERE there probably would have been welladvised to wear raincoats as well. I'm also sure that the makers of this if interviewed today would freely admit that the moralizing was just a lot of phonybaloney to ameliorate the obviously very stupid censors.This movie seems pretty sordid on paper but I actually found it strangely innocent compared to today. We STILL have this faux moralisticsecretly lecherous mentality today. Much of our current entertainment media for instance seems focused on following around underage or just very immature young girls morally clucking at their misdeeds while salivating over every sordid detail. And the more legitimate the medium and the more serious and shrill the moralizing the more disgusting the hypocrisy. Moreover Britney Spears Lindsay Lohan Paris Hilton etc. are presumably real people. The actresses in this movie are obviously not real schulmadchen unless there was something strange in the German water back then I'd guess most of these actresses had long since put their own school uniforms on mothballs. They not only don't look underage but they don't act like real women of any agethey're fantasy figures like a twentyfiveyearold stripper with fake breasts dressed in a Catholic school uniform.Don't get me wrong I'm not saying its necessarily healthy for the media to exploit even fantasy teens like with this film or the Porkiesstyle teen sex comedies of my own adolescence but given how much we let REAL teenagers be exploited today. . . well I just wouldn't worry about it too much.";

Most of the examples seem to have been exaggerated to create a more scandalous atmosphere and the dialogues are an art form for itself. There's not much tension or anything that keeps you looking and I can tell that you don't miss anything important if you just skip parts of it.The reason why I still grant this one a rather decent rating is that I generally like the message. Sexuality is a topic where you just have to accept that some things change and while you can discuss each of this developments critically it can help to be less scandalizing and more open minded when it comes to the concerns of the next generation. Unfortunately I can't really decide whether this is really a message the movie wanted to carry on or if the focus was more on showing nude bodies. I'd guess on the second one..".

Schulmdchenreport Schoolgirl report was not the first one of them but the most successful one. It had 7 million viewers when it came out which is often the number the most successful movies have in a year. Schulmdchenreport spawned of 12 sequels and dozens more of copies. For me it delves in the sobaditsgood area. Every movie of this kind has its own perks here its his fake authenticity and morality. All school girl movies were produced by Wolf Hartwig written by Gnther Heller and most of them were directed by Ernst Hofbauer. These three may have been some of the most cynical hacks in the movie world thats why I give it three stars. Schulmdchenreport starts off as most of the sequels pretending to be a documentary about what school girls want sexually. The main plot borrows from 12 angry men On a field trip school girl renate sneaks away from the group to do it with the bus driver. She gets caught naked and the headmaster parents and teacher gather together to decide if she has to be kicked from the school. All talk against her but dad an psychologist Mr. Bernauer steps in... and the smut begins. Bernauer who is supposed to be a 1970ies liberal but looks up to his huge pornstache exactly like that kind of dad who would vanish at night to go the porn cinema tries to persuade the parents to keep Renate at the school by telling them various sex stories... Now various little episodes with school girls doing it come up intermingled by supposedly real street interviews. The interviewer is unintentionally hilarious when he asks women in a harsh and strict voice if they masturbate and the likes. The documentary approach was surely partly done by the producers to avoid censorship and they were kind of a successful in this. But it also added to the cinematic treachery they pulled of  in a successful way to appeal to many target groups. By pretending it to be real stories and to understand what young women want they surely got some hippie free love advocates in. But they also catered simultaneously to the middleaged men of the type who usually look sex movies in cinemas. Nearly all school girls here are depicted as horny and insatiable man traps. Visually the movies were kind of harmless showing only full female nudity. The hilarity today ensues from the bullsht the producers wanted to tell us for real about the backstories of the sex scenes. Many of them are crass and disturbing. It starts off with the first story where a 15yearold girl sleeps with her stepdad and lets us know in her commentary that she seduced him with 12. The common theme is that nearly all of the schoolgirls hook up with older or much older men like that is what hey do. In the crassest episode this is even adressed verbally. Here a school girl who is a virgin has an older boyfriend who tries to blackmail her emotionally into having sex with him  she still refuses. Fine so far isn't it? But this is Schulmdchenreport. Her friend turns up and tells her a long story which begins with an attempted rape with the dubious statement I don't think a man can ever rape a woman if she does not want it a little. Later she is focused by some lesbians and does it unenthusiastic with them so a lesbo scene could be shoehorned in. Normal sex want work also so she gives her girlfriend the advice to do it with older men like she does now. And the virgin goes back to their demanding boyfriend and does it with him. So far so camp. The main plot ends totally in this wake Renate can stay at the school and it ends with a kind of disturbing shot where the daddys bring their daughters home holding hands.".

Unluckily for her she gets caught and it is discussed if she will be expelled. I found it interesting that not once there was talk about the bus driver possibly taking advantage of her. Inbetween there are more stories about fairly controversial topics such as one man having sex with several girls pregnancy first time sex and even rape. I guess the fact that there were really no taboos in here is a major reason why it became such a famous film and why they made so many sequels afterward. Friedrich von Thun is easily the most famous cast member here he went on to have a long career that lasts until today. There is one major problem with this film though As progressive as the message it gives may be the way we get to this message is not convincing. Here I am talking about the script and to a lesser extent the acting. Both areas needed to be a lot better in order to let me recommend this. As a consequence I believe this is really like so many other softcore porn movies only worth watching if you're horny. Otherwise I give it a thumbs down. By the way there are several version out there. The one I saw is probably the shortest at only 77 minutes.".

This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Welles did a superb job of capturing an uneasy nightmarish feeling. The camera angles and perspectives are perfect. The Trial basically consists of scene after scene of surreal settings. We get to see endless rows of people working on typewriters the inside of a crate while hundreds of eyes peer through the cracks a labyrinth of tall bookshelves stacked with old law books and tons of other dark surrealism that is amazing to look at.As far as plot goes Anthony Perkins is trapped in a corrupt judicial system accused of an unspecified crime. He does a great job of making his character a paranoid wreck and you can't help but feel paranoid yourself while watching the movie. Sometimes there is a spacious atmosphere and other times it is extremely claustrophobic. And it is all perfectly done in black and white. I highly recommend watching this if only to look at the awesome sets. You will think you are in a nightmare yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably Welles' most complete masterpiece since CITIZEN KANE. Not that it's better than AMBERSONS or TOUCH OF EVIL but there's a wholeness a freedom from interference a focusing of vision that's complete.  It's also a relief to be able for onceto enjoy a Welles performance from this period rather than laughing with him at its crass silliness.  Akim Tamiroff is as ever extraordinary while Anthony Perkins captures the mixture of nervousness and arrogance central to Welles' K.THE TRIAL is also a textbook lesson in how to film a classic text.  While cinema thrives on the secondrate transcending and enriching banality it tends to founder when it appropriates the Great Works due in part to the incompatibility of forms but mostly because of pointless reverence.  Why bother being completely faithful to say Howard's End when we can read the book.  Surely the only reasons to film a classic are to amake it adaptable to film form bmake it relevant to our age or cmake it relevant to the director's sensibility.Welles on one level is certainly faithful to Kafka's vision.  We get a nightmare depiction of bureaucracy gone mad of the increasing unidentifiable totalitarianism of modern life of the persecution of the individual of the impossibility of rebellion and alternatives.  The sense of labyrinth and nightmare and a desolate world abandoned by God is chillingly evoked in the film's astonishing visual framework the hallucinatory setpieces the disorientating comedy the bewildering logic. The knowledge that K.'s workplace was filmed in a disused railway station only adds to the film's complexity  this is a society cut off from other people ideas civilisations one where there is no coming or going no escape.And yet Welles subverts all this.  By removing Kafka's ambiguity he makes the work more ambiguous.  Unlike the book Welles draws attention to the fact that this is a nightmare.  K. begins the film getting dressed and ends it stripping the reverse process of going to sleep i.e. to move plausibly back from the dream world to reality K. has to return to the state that led to dream unclothed in bed.The suggestion that his adventures are a dream draws attention to the film's main theme  the dangers of solipsism.  K. is a paranoid  because he sees the world only from his point of view he feels that everyone is out to get him.  His selfishness is subtly hinted at throughout the film by his stated profession not to get involved with anything to avoid problems to avoid others' problems to keep himself to himself and get on.  Of course this means that noone will help him as he finds out throughout the film.  And if everybody is indifferent to their neighbour than no wonder people are burned in death camps.  Wasn't that the excuse of 'ordinary' Germans after the war?  'We knew nothing about it'.That's why wellfed K. with his privileged job is greeted by a gaunt group of camp victims.  Welles has to remould The Trial in the knowledge of the Final Solution.  This is accomplished by parodying K.'s us vs. them outlookk with a complex doubling pattern  private scenes bursting into mass activity Dreyeresque austerity alternating with Wellesian baroque a dynamic jazz score merging into Albinoni's tragic apocalyptic funereal Adagio.Both readings aren't exclusive they play off each other.  Creating an appropriately Kafkaesque spiral of terror the climactic scene  a classic Wellesian standoff between K. and the Advocate seemingly on his side but really a playful collaborator completes the dissolution of the individual. They are shown to be indistinguishable mere shadows of men.  I do not say that we fail to sympathise with K.  his light IS harrowing but though his closing laugh can be interpreted as an admission of the Absurdity of the universe it's a world made in his image.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the times Welles moved his cast and crew to Paris to complete The Trial the largescale project conceived and filmed in Yugoslavia was having to be whittled down fairly drastically because not for the first or last time in Welles' career the money had run out.  The Paris scenes are shot entirely inside the then magnificently derelict Gare d'Orsay and one wonders if the film's simple nofrills prologue was forced on Welles by dint of poverty.  Monochrome drawings are flipped upwards in a process which Welles calls pinscreen.  The director narrates the fable of a man who seeks entry through the Door of Justice but never reaches his goal.  This conundrum of guards and portals harks back to ancient times and provides a neat distillation of the story to come.    For the entirety of the long scene in K's bedroom and throughout the major part of the film Welles positions the camera slightly below waist height.  This 'wrong' spatial relationship creates in the viewer a vague sense of unease a visual disorientation which compounds K's emotional loss of bearings.  Welles plays clever tricks with the proportions of the rooms their lines being slightly out of kilter and the ceilings very much in view.  Typically Welles is deliberately and flamboyantly breaking a cardinal rule of cinematography  'keep the ceiling out of shot'.  Interiors seem open and spacious if we can't see the ceiling and Welles is after the converse effect driving home the point that K inhabits an airless joyless place and his surroundings are imbued with inchoate hostility.    German expressionism had gripped Welles' imagination back in the 1930's and virtually all of his films show its abiding influence.  The columns of the opera house represent social regimentation and K offends against social conformity by awkwardly pushing his way out of the theatre an irregular irritant polluting the symmetry of the seating.  When K gets caught in the exodus of workers from the office he is both literally and metaphorically swimming against the tide.  His microscopic ineffectuality against the ponderous stateliness of the courtroom doors drives home the expressionist point  he is a puny Jonah entering the cavernous bowels of The State.    To be in chains is sometimes safer than being free and it could be said that Welles' genius flourished best when shackled by a dearth of resources.  Lacking the money for costumes during the shooting of Othello Welles turned adversity to artistic advantage filming the murder scene in a turkish bath not only obviating the need for clothing but also making a succinct point about Iago's motives being 'stripped bare'.  The Trial affords another example of Welles' remarkable fecundity.  Zitorelli's studio is built of cheap slats and lit from outside creating a powerful cinematic image of The State's placeman clinging precariously to his wretched privileges  all filmed at practically no expense.  The skewed empty picture frames are silent comments on the distorted and barren perspective of Zitorelli the human race's Benedict Arnold.    K is a Freudian picaro journeying in despair through the intestines of a nightmare system of justice an apparatus ironically designed to ensure that justice is stifled.  The shades of Buchenwald are introduced by Welles. Defendants wait with meathooks above their heads and in other parts of this unfathomable 'system' nameless naked unfortunates stand in quiet misery their numbers hanging from their necks.  Leni and The Wife are grotesque distortions of Dante's Beatrice malformed guides with no sense of direction and no transcendent vision.  Welles himself plays Hassler the advocate the bully who has no thought of his client's welfare but seeks only to perpetuate the cruel gavotte of litigation.  The confusion's impenetrable a point reinforced by shooting characters through interminable patterns of beams and girders whose shifting geometry engulfs the insignificant humans.    In his 1985 biography of Welles Charles Higham declared The Trial a failure concluding that it was muffled dull unexciting on every level. Perhaps more tellingly he criticised Welles for adopting a grandiose approach whereas Kafka's work cries out for spareness and understatement. Higham is excellent but the film is not in my humble opinion a failure. It evokes with emotional power a dreamspace of despair and in so doing renders a great service to Kafka's oeuvre.".

	schema:headline " The Logic of a Nightmare";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of The Trial is the story of displacement. The protagonist in the film Josef K played by Anthony Perkins is seemingly from another world. His morality conduct and philosophy contrast so sharply from the nightmare around him that one wonders if he was transported to another universe while sleeping.  As a result Josef K has no survival skills in his environment and his adherence to a personal morale code that is totally alien to the world he lives in consummates his destruction.Josef K literally awakes in the first scene to a nightmare that he cannot understand because his own sense of justice refuses to let him understand it. This is Josef K's downfall. There are survivors in the world painted by this film grim survivors to be sure but survivors none the less. Josef K is not one of them.Josef K in the context that surrounds him in this film is dysfunctional. He has neither the character nor the experience to survive in his world. He seems oblivious to the lunacy of his environment and strives for something so completely alien that one wonders where and how he even conceived of his morale code given the world he lives in.This of course leads to terrific drama and an odd tension for the viewer throughout the entire film. That tension springs from the dichotomy of the film Josef K's idealism vs. the cruel reality all around him. Perhaps more specifically the tension arises from Josef K's struggle for logic and reason in a world gone haywire with paranoia and corruption.One of the minor but important strengths of this film is the encapsulation of its theme within the 2minute anecdote that starts the picture. This prologue uses stark drawings on a wheel to transition from scene to scene and is both a riddle and a parable. It is accompanied by a sinister cello and a deep cold narration by Orson Welles. The anecdote in the prologue is a tale of a man who 'seeks admittance to the law'. The riddle that is laid before him ends in death and with the realization that the man wasted his life seeking a universal truth to a very personal question.Much later in the film the character of the Advocate tries to retell the chilling prologue to Josef K. Josef however dismisses the fairytale immediately. Refusing to hear its lesson and how it applies to his predicament. The advocate rightly notes from the prologue 'it has been observed that the man came to the law of his own free will'. What I believe Orson Welles is telling us in this scene is he personally believes Josef K's character to be guilty. Josef is not guilty of a crime to be sure but he is guilty in his conscience. Josef's wretched selfrighteousness and guiltcomplex is ugly even within the context of all the injustice corruption and abuse that surround him.Josef is weak stubborn and oblivious and I believe Orson tells us subtly that perhaps he deserves to die. What is also left unsaid by the Advocate is the man in the prologue willingly submitted himself to the lunacy that became his death. The man felt it better to live chained to an ideal that to roam free in an unjust world. If there is a crime Josef K is guilty of then that is likely it.I have never read the novel but I believe Josef K is a much more tragic figure in Kafka's eyes. In the eyes of Orson Welles  it's apparent to me that Orson Welles considers Josef K to be neither tragic nor overly heroic.While it may contrast strikingly with Kafka's intention I think Welles tries to illustrate somewhat that Josef K is not a complete victim. While Josef's surroundings are nightmarish beyond belief Josef never adapts to them. He never learns how to survive or worse refuses to learn how to survive. He judges his world but he hardly ever truly interacts with it and he immediately becomes distracted whenever he feels someone has transgressed his moral view of things.While the actions of Josef K are noble and we sympathize with his plight you feel little remorse for his eventual death because Josef quite simply just does not belong. Like the creature at the end of metamorphosis an innocent thing is perhaps best left to die because it is alien to its environment.Like all good work that interpretation of mine is open to a lot of debate. Which is another great feature of this film it provokes a reaction and that reaction can help you understand more about yourself and your current surroundings.I think this is strong work. Orson Welles finds ways to delight your eyes on screen. Some of the performances like Romy Schneider's performance as the mistress of the Advocate are seductive and chilling.It is interesting that women in this film are perverted contorted and shallow. The perversion of society in Josef K's world is so pervasive that his own 16yearold cousin cannot even visit him without suspicion from his coworkers. Even sex and passion in this world is twisted into secrecy innuendo and fear. The only true female survivors in this film are women who willingly cast themselves as supplicants to men of power and intrigue. While this message may affront those who are sensitive it adds another element to the nightmare that makes this film so strong.The film has a similar parallel to the Bicycle Thief in my opinion. The protagonist is sympathetic but is surrounded by injustice and cruelty that shreds his very existence. In both films no amount of effort on the protagonist's behalf will solve his dilemma. Both characters struggle to come to terms with their tragic plight. Like Antonio Josef K's quest is futile and his only salvation is acceptance. Unlike Antonio however Josef K never truly transforms he will not sink to the same level as the world around him. This is why we feel so sorry for Antonio at the end of the Bicycle Thief but see the Trial's ending as more inevitable than tragic.It is sometimes hard to feel sorry for a martyr who wears his thorny crown so smugly. This is where the protagonist of Josef and Antonio Bicycle Thief depart. Josef willingly becomes a selfrighteous martyr while Antonio chooses life even at the expense of his dignity.The logic of this film is the logic of a dream and a nightmare. The Trial is a moral nightmare  a world where the only options for survival are lies hypocrisy and servitude. A sacrifice Josef K refuses to make and so his door closes forever.".

Watching it for the first time it's safe to say I hated it.  There were scenes that held me so close to the edge of madness it was all I could do not to fly screaming out of the theater.

	schema:reviewBody "Franz Kafka was a citizen of the moribund AustroHungarian Empire a dead culture in which mere administration had replaced government.  Aware that its civilisation was decaying the Austrian ruling class of Kafka's day could summon up no vitality or creativity and devoted itself to suppressing 'The Revolution'.  A state with thirteen languages and twice that number of separatist movements spent all its time trying to retard its own centrifugal forces.  AustriaHungary in these final decades was a honeyless hive in which minor officials and secret policemen busied themselves striving feverishly to preserve the unpreservable.  Kafka's dark novels capture the ugly mood of a dying political system whose instincts were authoritarian and whose inefficiency sapped all hope of reform.In 1962 Welles was struggling through his locust years.  Having long since alienated himself from Hollywood's money he was living a vagabond life in Europe flitting back and forth across the continent to scrape funds together plan stage productions which hardly ever came to fruition and sleepwalk through a dozen cameo roles in other people's films.  The critical and financial catastrophe of 'Chimes' was hanging over him like a pall and he had far too many distractions  squabbles with his Irish partners tax bills in London and potentially ruinous law suits to stave off.  With all this to contend with he was still sporadically shooting portions of Don Quixote in Spain a stuttering project that was by now in its sixth year of filming.  Welles was desperately short of money and as his biographer Higham puts it he could manage almost anything except austerity.A harmless inconsequential clerk wakes up one morning to find himself accused of something he never discovers what.  Secret policemen enter his bedroom and subject him to a frightening interrogation in which every answer provokes a new line of questioning.  This is psychological torture the mind's innate sense of justice constantly probing for some higher referencepoint some appeal to fairness when in fact none exists.  Josef K returns repeatedly to the obvious question But what have I done?  But there are no rules of justice here no recourse to an autonomous code of law.  You have the unmitigated gall to pretend you don't know?A cry of anguish from the individual who finds himself overwhelmed by soulless bureaucracy The Trial is a deeply personal statement by Welles and as Higham puts it a symbol if there ever was one of his own career. Welles had been the enfant terrible whose erratic genius had alienated the big Hollywood studios.  Cut off from the big money he was to spend the subsequent forty years globetrotting aimlessly picking up work as best he could.Autobiographical elements of Kafka's own life contained in The Trial are given prominence in the film.  AustriaHungary launched World War One in the same year that Kafka began work on the novel.  Ironically the limited war against Bosnia intended to restore Austria's international credibility turned into a conflagration bigger and more horrific than anything previously experienced on earth and set in train the global violence which was to characterise the twentieth century.  It also destroyed AustriaHungary.  Welles closes this story of 1914 with an image of nuclear catastrophe stressing the oneness of the century's horror.  Kafka was bullied by his father and reference is made in the course of the film to K's sense of filial guilt.  The office is depressing and demeaning echoing Kafka's own experiences as a clerk in a bloated bureaucracy.The State is remorseless and pitiless grinding down and perverting even the strongest of human bonds those of familial and sexual love.  K is forced to reject his little cousin Irmie Maydra Shore who has to remain 'outside'.  Later an allegation of sexual impropriety concerning Irmie arises.  Any magnanimity towards another is interpreted by the authorities as a denunciation.  The torture scenes involving the secret policemen are the most disturbing part of the film both because K realises how his own protests have borne poisoinous fruit and because of the grinning obsequiousness of the victims.  The State turns its problems into spineless curs who acquiesce in their own degradation.Not only does K find himself becoming an accuser he even assumes the role of interrogator questioning Bloch and the Defendants.  Anyone who is not a keyholder within the pitiless apparatus of The State cannot help but take on its deadly pallor.  Keys are important.  Leni the Court Guard and Zitorelli are empowered through possessing keys.  They are a corrupt priesthood in this cult of political disease.Kafka's experiences with women were deeply ambivalent.  He had many intense relationships in his life none of which proved satisfactory.  His book treats women as both temptresses and objects of loathing.  Welles follows this line the women being desirable guidefigures and also deformed monstrosities.  The trunkcarrier Lena and the hunchback girl all have bodily malformations.Welles shot most of the film in Zagreb capturing strikingly the two clashing styles of architecture of MittelEuropa overblown ugly Habsburg baroque and drab communist functionalism.  It is as if the Prague of Mozart cannot help but decay into the Prague of Krushchev.  Ostensibly free is the best K can hope for and 'ostensibly individual' is our optimum condition as the shadows of the Stalinist apartment blocks crowd in on us.".

Once this one entered my mind though the contest was over.The lifetime masterpiece of a master of filmmaking The Trial is Orson Welles's finest film even surpassing Touch of Evil.  Somber brooding sometimes even claustrophobic The Trial is a surrealistic safari through the worlds of law employment and interpersonal relationships.The melancholy strains of the artistically deployed Adagio by Albinoni underscore the mood of the film shot mostly at twilight or indoors by night in a tangle of nightmarish sets that extend to infinity. Even scenes shot in broad daylight seem cold and devoid of nourishment in this cosmos of interminable infinitesimal complexity which utterly lacks a heart.Anthony Perkins Joseph K. is mass of contradictions at once sympathetic boyish paranoid angry declamatory and most of all surpassingly frustrated by the futility of attempting to deal with a society that both demands mechanistic perfection of him and at the same time exhibits a persistent apathy toward his continued existence as well as a bureaucratic attempt to destroy it.He seems inadvertently to hurt everyone with whom he comes in contact ostensibly the cause of people getting thrown out of their dwellings schools jobs marriages and other situations all due to his benign actions which in any sane world would be completely unconnected with the tragedies they somehow appear to create.  But in the KafkaWelles society they just lead to blame and further accusations.  In his helplessness his innocence and his utter bafflement Perkins is thoroughly disarming.Welles is positively diabolical as The Advocate who like everyone else connected with the Court is not of any assistance or support to the accused.  Rather he seems to exist only to hurl vague accusations at Joseph K.  which the poor man is somehow expected to understand beforehand and even think are justified  and to exact payment for same.Romy Schneider is outstanding as The Advocate's cookhousekeepernursemaidconcubine the only person in the story who shows Joseph K. any genuine affection odd though the form it takes may be.  Other unforgettable and universally strange characters populate this odyssey into oblivion such as the clubfooted landlady doggedly dragging a trunk along an empty railroad track into the fading twilight while politely trying to refrain from telling Joseph K. how lowly she regards him.The movie is fairly divergent from the book which it inspired me to read. For example the movie comes to a conclusion while the unfinished book does not.  In most ways though I find the movie more memorable haunting and downright disturbing.  Its skillfully crafted mesh of images and symbols which resonate at a level deeper than the conscious will find themselves recurring to the viewer unbidden for years to come.".

Both this and 8 12. Too many similarities for this to be accidental including some stylistic touches the painter. Both are films about filmmaking.Welles uses actors in a then unusual way. It had long been the practice to take actors of ordinary skill and fit them to characters that more or less match their personality. But that practice simply took advantage of what the actor could do and was as much a matter of the actor exploiting the system as anything else. Welles here exploits Perkins an actor who hasn't a clue about what is going on and so never finds the character. Clearly Welles wanted the effect of utter disorientation and knew Perkins could not consciously produce it. Others have since used this technique the Coens come to mind sometimes with celebrities who will be really ticked when they emerge from their fogs.A final interesting element the framing. Welles is a master of mixing and conflating narrative methods. 'Kane' surely holds the record. Here he is constrained by the preexisting text it is important that there be few narrative threads Perkins' confusion and denial the 'state's version and the whole thing may be a dream or paranoid vision. Welles for instance cannot imply that the whole thing is one of the painter's paintings for instance something he would have included in a flash if he could. So he extends his narrative layers offscreen by explicitly referencing it as a play he is doing as a book a 'dirty' book and most creatively as an illustrated parable. He frames the film with drawings that are halfway between book illustrations and theatrical set designs. And he narrates them in a manner halfway between a drama and a reading. Very very clever use of framing to increase the narrative layers by reference beyond what you see.Ted's Evaluation 3 of 4  Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoiler The film starts with Wells telling a story with animation. The story is a fable about a man waiting at the door to the law' which could be a symbol of the door to judgment or even heaven and God. The law should be accessible to every man the man says. But accessibility is not a simple matter in this movie at any point in time.The Trial' is about a man who one day is awoken and told that he has been found guilty of a crime and will eventually go to trial. He is permitted to carry on with his normal functions but absolutely nothing is revealed to him about the nature of his crimes and why he is being charged. His character K does his best to investigate into why he is being charged and he seeks the counsel of Advocate Albert Hassler who is played by Orson Wells himself in the movie. He battles the system but no matter what he does K is unable to find out anything concerning his crime and more and more his situation becomes hopeless.K's crimes are never revealed and neither is the motivation of why he is being pursued or the knowledge of what will happen to him. This makes the film very difficult to understand on a first viewing.  There is a series of encounters and scenes that never make his situation any clearer to him.Wells is definitely creative.  He took a piece of German literature by Kafka and made it into an American cinema.  The entire movie is very surrealistic in a way.  K.'s character seems flat because he does not change much over his series of distressing encounters. There is occasional anger and mistrust of the world but more real responses to his awful and accumulating experiences aren't there. In the end it was out of curiosity rather than sympathy that I cared at all what happens to his character. Its two hour length seemed longer because it is chopped up into multiple episodes which often seem to be there to illustrate yet another point without really moving the story ahead. Another thing is that you can never really tell how time works in the movie.  After what seems like days in the movie a woman named Hilda who worked for the lawyer talks about the speech he made last night after he got arrested yesterday.  So that causes the audience to realize that everything has happened in one day so far when it actually seemed much longer.The film's greatest achievement overall is that it pulls us into a story that is just like a nightmare and this is the best film of its kind that I have ever seen.  There is a nightmarish sense of frustration throughout the movie. Although Joseph K. seems to get close at times he's never able to get any answers that make sense. He's never able to face his accusers or even find out what crime he is charged with. Basically K gets two choices. He can buy into the game and accept blame or he can refuse to go along with the game and defy the system. Regardless of his choice he can't win. That is another reason the whole movie is like a nightmare because K can never get out.  K is always shown as very insignificant throughout the movie. For example the mountain of typewriters at the office and the huge doors of the courts show his size doesn't matter.Perkins did give a good performance in the film in my opinion.  He is the glue of every scene and you wait to see his reaction to all the torment he goes through now that he is one of the accused. He seems to always have this nervous guilt as though he knows somewhere in the depths of his soul that he is guilty of something but the actual crime makes no difference the important thing is always his guilt. Something I found interesting in the movie is that all the women of the movie are sex objects. Wells implies that whatever it is that K is guilty of has to do at least part with sex especially because every scene with a woman turns sexual at some point.  It's almost as if the women are a part of his trial since all of them literally throw themselves at him at one point or another.Anyways I thought this was a good film even though the end is very strange to me with him wandering in and out of buildings when those buildings were never connected in the movie before.  At the very end K lets two men carry him away and it's almost as if he's given up and is just ready to accept whatever fate is coming to him.  He definitely doesn't leave undefeated.".

The cinematography is stunning full of visual metaphor and gorgeous composition it's an unyielding show of moviemaking expertise. Welles plays up the bleak no tomorrow nature of the exterior scenes the structured chaos of the workplace and the hedonistic excess exhibited by the various stages of the trial itself each to great effect. The story though feels too flighty and nebulous for my taste. It should come as no surprise being a translation of a Kafka novel that the entire picture often feels surreal and confusing. It continuously floats and sputters just beyond the grasp of understanding like a moth delicately avoiding a set of flailing hands. The premise may have been established nicely during the slightly more straightforward opening scenes but as the duration grows it becomes too ambitiously ambiguous for its own good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't enjoy Orson Welles' version of Kafka's novel as much as I wanted to. There are several reason for this.I don't think Welles managed to translate the specific atmosphere of Kafka's novel onto the silver screen. Kafka's story is extremely surrealistic but its whole beauty lies in the thin line between real life and dreamlike sequences. Kafka in his novel makes sure that the transitions are very smooth and that a reader cannot truly realize where this line is drawn. Welles on the other hand tries to recreate this by simply jumping from one chapter to another. The atmosphere that Welles creates is not anywhere close to the one that exists in the novel. The transitions between locations relationships between characters and Joseph K.'s own interests are poorly interpreted and the final result is not surrealistic  it's just confusing.I was disappointed to find out that Welles decided to replace 1920s Prague Kafka's town with 1960s socialistic Zagreb. Herr K. is translated into Mister K. which just doesn't sound right. There's also a scene in the movie in which a computer is mentioned and displayed. Yes all this has bureaucracy written all over it but it's just too far away from Kafka. It's like that theory that if Shakespeare were alive in the 20th century he'd be writing soapoperas. Yes perhaps the spirit is preserved but I'd still prefer to see The Trial placed into its proper time.My other objections go to film editing and the screenplay. Welles had decided to simply jump from one important scene to the other disregarding any transitions and the important time line. By just watching the movie it's very hard to figure out that K.'s trial lasts for exactly a year and begins and ends on his birthday. Welles makes it look like the trial lasts 34 days. This just doesn't make sense especially in the scene in which K. dismisses his lawyer after what only seems like one visit which apparently took place only a few days before. Also I didn't like the immediate transitions from the paintor scene into the cathedral scene which immediately lead to K.'s final battle with the law. This is all supposed to last several months not 15 minutes.I appreciated Orson Welles rewriting some of the scenes from the novel and adding his own material. The opening scene of the arrest is very well done with Welles adding some funny and satirical dialogues between K. and the police. However I was rather disappointed to find the priest scene seriously cut with the lawyer appearing in the church out of nowhere and delivering some conclusions. The priest scene is one of the most important scenes in the novel it is crucial to leave it in its original form.The cinematography is very well done although I wish Welles had used more shots of old downtown Zagreb for his film. I was expecting to see something in the manner of Carol Reed's Third Man shot in Vienna but Welles insisted more on socialistic new buildings of Zagreb than on the beautiful and certainly reminiscent of Prague old buildings of downtown Zagreb.I also sincerely recommend the 1993 version of The Trial with Kyle MacLachlan and Anthony Hopkins. MacLachlan does a much better job as Joseph K. than Anthony Perkins and that movie follows the story more closely than this one. Both films are absolutely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact that Welles is best remembered for the film ranked first by the AFI among the films of the Twentieth Century Citizen Kane Welles considered The Trial his finest work.  In my mind it is the most beautifully photographed film ever made in black and white and its sense of composition is that of an artist.  The settings are dark and mysterious and a sense that humanity has been shunted to the margins of a dark industrial order is beautifully conveyed.I'm told that younger people who did not grow up with black and white TV or with black and white movies automatically tune out pieces that are not in color.  That is a shame as there are films that are better made in black and white and expressions of time and mood that cannot be made as well in color.  Welles never really got the chance to make the transition to color that Kubrick made as well as any American director.  Perhaps he would have found expressive use of color as well as Kubrick did but certainly neither this film nor Citizen Kane could be made in color.The brilliance of its artistry aside the film will not appeal to everyone because of the deliberate opaqueness of the plot and because of its lack of optimism.  I like Kafka's story and I like the movie very well but it is more art than diversionary entertainment and some might prefer a good action flick or a romantic comedy.".

As well in particularly with the Trial there is a sense of obviously paranoia words spoken unintentionally but taken seriously and many situations locations and minor characters that are of a dreamlike state. Orson Welles with Kafka's story does everything for effect creating and maintaining an atmosphere that he honed after years of filmnoirs. The misenscene is always with a purpose to get the viewer into the tension and ongoing confusion which is with the lead Mr. Joseph K played by Anthony Perkins and the end result of Welles' directorial stamp on the work is that of something like a psychological horror film. With the long takes the usage of darkness and lights the indoor and outdoor locations and deep focus the look of the film it could be argued tops the story in some parts. K is just a worker an assistant of sorts in some kind of futuristic or past or present the time and place is left vague and it doesn't hurt the film city. As he is under arrest he tries to fight his case as he's never been told why he was arrested. The people he meets the law aren't much help as they act logically but only logically in the dreamlike state. As Perkins' K needs legal assistance his uncle Max introduces him to the Advocate Welles himself who is a subtle frightening presence with a control over his clients. As K wonders what he'll do the story starts to spiral into running from children going from one place seamlessly into another until he is blended into this world of the abstract.The acting is what would separate The Trial from being a weird experimental though to a degree the technical side of the film is a little experimental landscape. Perkins creates a performance that gets us to believe in him to find him as being a sympathetic and for at least a few of us in movieviewing land empathetic persona. All of his little flubs and little moments of nervousness add to the believability. And in truth we've all been in this sort of situation K's been in or at least known someone like this not knowing what it is as the charge but feeling a subliminal guilt without reason. Perkins captures all of the emotions and finds that line where he doesn't go into nervous black comedy and his plight becomes more tragic as we get sucked into this nightmare society. There are also memorable sidebar performances by Jeanne Moreau Madeline Robinson Max Haufler Akim Tamiroff who also made an impression in his bit in Alphaville and William Chappell. Welles by the way dubs in many of the voices and in a sense this is like his greatest visual translation of something he might have done though it's moot as of now on the radio. In fact the use of sound is practically as impressive as the visual style.And what style there is in The Trial. This is the kind of film to be watched in its digital transfer on widescreen DVD or projected in a theater. There is a consistently darkened tone to most scenes especially in the last hour or so for example in K's running in the sewer and then light rushes in as something of a Welles' trademark. It could be said that Welles' not Perkins is the true star of the film by being the almost overwhelming presence he is in every frame. Due credit is as well to Edmund Richard amazingly his first film and he would go on to work on Bunuel's 70's surreal efforts but it is arguable that Welles' was at a peak as a director. The best thing that can be said about The Trial is that for today's audiences those who won't understand the path the story takes in the first viewing will surely be intrigued enough by the editing style the faces the photography and the ideas that do come through. Two sequences alone the first part of K in the trial room with the audience present and a visit to a painter surrounded by little girls can be counted as some of Welles' finest work.There's an underlying existential theme K's on and off time with his sense of free will his sense of isolation and the Advocate's last dialog with K proves this that works alongside with the surreal nature of the picture. By the end of the film which ends on a note that will baffle some anger others perhaps by it not following the book and bring on a catharsis that can barely be explained it's at least clear the effect Welles' and his lead have put on is a pure unique crossbreed of Kafka's tale of maddening persecution. And it does as with Welles' more famous works like Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane demands to be seen two three ten more times. A".

Indeed it's in English but it's a very international production by an international crew French German Italian and American crew original title le Proces and a fantastic international cast seductively beautiful women and embarrassing authoritysensitive men.7.7 IMDb and still undervalued...  I hoped this would not be some sort of endless courtroom thriller.  It's not.  It is what you make of it it can be a haunting nightmare or moral terror or unexpected romance.  You could be entertained by the cinematography Edmond Richard alone.  It's probably the only crimefilm in which no crime is ever committed except moral ones. This instantly became my favorite film of Welles.  He made no compromises here every aspect of this film enhances the other.  This is said to be his only film that didn't get spiced n' sliced by commercial villains.I'd like to compare 'the Trial' with 'Catch22'.  Two of my 10 alltime favorite films.  Could the advocate have reincarnated into Catch22's 1970 general Dreedle Welles himself  ?  Could Joseph K have reincarnated into Catch22's chaplain Tappman Anthony Perkins or even Yossarian? Some of the sophistry is frightening comparable.  Is it a coincidence that Joseph Heller's novel Catch22 was first published in 1962?  Another one of my favorites is Brazil 1985 Gilliam.  There you have it the little man's struggle against the totalitarian system seems to be the common factor. Joseph K seems to live in a totally separate world is he the dissident or are all the others?  The similarities of 'Joseph K' and Franz Joseph Kafka are obvious.This is the best bw cinematography I've ever seen I'm just wondering how much Welles had to do with that ... but then again who doesn't wonder about that with any of Welles' films?  Surrealistic and tense but then again so is most of Kafka's 18831924 work.  Richard and Welles would make 'Chimes at midnight' two years later also with Jeanne Moreau.Please take a close look at the mirror scene with Romy Schneider 55 min and the claustrophobic chasing scene 106 min.  This is the brilliant and haunting photography that stays with you forever.  If you're looking for comparable cinematography cameraangles composition contrast desolate architexture lighting and perspective see 'a Touch of evil' 1958 'the Third man' 1949 and 'Citizen Kane' 1941.  BTW Albinoni's tragic adagio was among other films also used in Gallipoli 1981 Peter Weir.Why o why can't we vote 11 ".

The similarities of 'Joseph K' and Franz Joseph Kafka are obvious.This is the best bw cinematography I've ever seen I'm just wondering how much Welles had to do with that ... but then again who doesn't wonder about that with any of Welles' films?  Surrealistic and tense but then again so is most of Kafka's 18831924 work.  Richard and Welles would make 'Chimes at midnight' two years later also with Jeanne Moreau.Please take a close look at the mirror scene with Romy Schneider 55 min and the claustrophobic chasing scene 106 min.  This is the brilliant and haunting photography that stays with you forever.  If you're looking for comparable cinematography cameraangles composition contrast desolate architexture lighting and perspective see 'a Touch of evil' 1958 'the Third man' 1949 and 'Citizen Kane' 1941.  BTW Albinoni's tragic adagio was among other films also used in Gallipoli 1981 Peter Weir.Why o why can't we vote 11 ";

Vincent once says to Marie I've got a clown in my head who craps between the synapses you just have to eat something and everything will be fine. However a very funny road movie starts when Marie manages to steal the key of the tattered car belonging to Dr Rose the director of the institution and they drive away heading to Italy. Of course Vincent's dad and the director want to bring them back and follow them in Vincent's father's posh car a shiny black BMW with a lot of oomph.You can see the two young men struggling with their illnesses and Alexander even seems to be able to forget about his anxieties. Vincent explains that he can feel his tics coming but he cannot prevent them. Can you decide not to sneeze? When under pressure he is in the grip of his tics and shouts obscenities. The three young people become friends and when Vincent's father and the director find them rather soon they sneak into the BMW and continue their trip.All along they get into funny situations because they cannot pay at the petrol station or because Vincent flips out or when you see how Dr Rose and Vincent's father as different as they can be have to put their heads together  and that just makes you laugh but the film is also thoughtprovoking when Vincent Alex and Marie talk about their problems and touching when Vincent's dad tells Dr Rose about Vincent's childhood.If you expect a sugarcoated happy ending with Marie and Vincent or Dr Rose and Vincent's dad falling in love all cheerful and without mental problems merrily reunited you will be disappointed. However Vincent's father has not only geographically travelled to find his lost son he indeed comes mentally closer to him and no longer considers him to be a loser.If you want to see a film that makes you laugh without your having to stop thinking go and watch it.

	schema:reviewBody "Vincent will Meer or Vincent Wants to Sea is a German 90minute movie from 5 years ago and let me start by saying that I quite like the English title as well. This film won Best Picture at the 2011 German Film awards plus Best Lead Actor. I thought Florian David Fitz who was also nominated for the screenplay played the part well. Not sure if the win was justified but the nomination certainly was deserved. However I am a bit baffled by the nominations of the two older actors in the supporting category. Ferch resembled Fitz physically so that the fatherson story made sense was solid and at least had a couple decent fatherson talk moments but nothing great while MllerElmau was entirely forgettable in my opinion. So you already see that I did not like the scenes between these two very much but I guess they had to include them to keep the film at 1.5 hours at least.The scenes with Fitz Herfurth and Allmayer were certainly superior. Some funny moments some sad moments and decent drama that carries the film from start to finish. Sometimes the illness of Fitz' character did not feel entirely authentic but only included for the story in terms of when it appeared and when it did not appear and not the other way around but mostly it was fine. Herfurth is reliable as usual too and Allmayer did what he could with what he was given. I am not too sure if I liked the ending. I certainly liked that they did not go 100 for a happy ending that would have felt forced with what happens to Herfurth's character but something was missing to really win me over here in terms of the ending.I saw this one the first time briefly after it was released I think and I remember liking it more back then than on this rewatch today but it was still a decent watch in my opinion. There are some good moments some notsogood but overall the positive outweighs the negative and I recommend it. The music could have been a bit more impactful I think but Huettner's experience behind the camera shows. If you can look past the unrealistic scenes like the trio still sticking together after one of the guys beats the crap out of another then you will have a good time watching this one. Thumbs up.".

Just to take a car ride and they all do.They get detour their car breaks down and they end up at an abandon old gas station while it rains. Peter and Fritz and Robert decide to by or rent the abandon gas station and fix it up .They make it a success that a oil company called U.M.O.  I think finds out about it. President of the company Consul Kossmann played by Willy Fritz who's girl friend Irene played by Claude Farrel who.s an stock holder of the company and sculptress get's Dr Calmus the director  played by Osckar Sima to take's a look at this and by them out. Kossman get's his daughter Gaby played by Germaine Dumar to spy on the place who works as a secretary of the U.M.O. as well. She spy's on all three men each time they give her a gas attendant doll. But all of a sudden she's falling in love with them. they all think that she's just working at that company and not the president's daughter. Oscar Sima show's up later on to offer them a deal but peter and fritz turn it down. but Robert had agreed with it. But peter wants to keep the gas station. She's dreaming about ll threewhen Kossman shows up in the room and notices the three dolls and hears her mentioning all the three men in her sleep.The next day She tell Irene about this. So Irene decides to invite all three men to this night club to as her and Kossman and Gaby show up to test which man is in love with Gaby. Earlier she shows the report to her father and DR Calmus stating not to buy the station since she's sympathetic with them. But Dr Calmus decides to buy them out. Before that peter and Robert thumb ride to the night club where they suppose to meet Gaby.Peter get's a ride but Robert ends up going back home and taking the mini car to the club. Fritz has to stay and attend the gas station until some truck driver tells him about a new road being open and all the property being bought to make this road. He immediately goes back home to tell them about this bought they all gone. So he goes to the night club to. none knew where each one was going.At the club Peter and Robert surprise each other. Then they notice that Kossman Irene Gaby at another table . They go up and introduce themselves. Then Fritz shows up and he's surprised that the two are up their he introduces him to them.So The three don't know that Kossman is her father. A story is made up that she is engaged to Dr Calmus to see how they would react to prove who really loves Gaby. All of them show no sign so they leave and she's disappointed in tears. The next day the assistant to DR. Calmus goes to the gas station with papers of take over. This angers the three men . After that Irene shows up to try to tell them what happen. They are angry with her and they show her the take over papers she's angry to because Kossmann had no intention to take over so she call up Kossman about this . Kossman then calls DR Calmus about this too and tells him to forget this.Later Kossmann and Gaby show up with champaign to try to explain what was going on . Once it's reveal to the men that Gaby was his daughter this outrages Fritz more then ever cause he's in love with her then the other. The music numbers are excellent. The party scene leads to a dance number as peter and Fritz's and Robert are playing a boogietune on three pianos on a truck. Wait a minute  Bepop was popular by that time and that year bill Hailey and the comments would squash jazz with rock n roll. Well a dance number with the truck divers and some private school girls and a teachers. A light song and dance number Between Peter and Gaby around the gas station. A dream sequence dance as Robert is taking a nap in a hammock. in which he's servicing women riding scooter with gas . another dream sequence in which Gaby is dancing with all three men. The night club scene a German version of the Modernaires singing trio The Cornell trio singing two numbers this is an excellent musical and worth owning for fans of classic musical if you got a multi regional player in the U.S A.".

	schema:reviewBody "Together with that documentary which talks about how much the British suffered during WWI losing a generation of young men this newsreel and the indifference it brought from the American government and business interests makes more sense.The documentary talks about how Hitler did take Germany from the starvation that the rest of the world was suffering during the Great Depression and in five short years every worker has a job and hunger is gone. But at what cost? Wages are kept low so that industry has money to churn out as many arms as needed food prices are kept high as the Nazis need farmers to be able to produce large amounts of food for the troops every farmer must grow what he is told to grow and no worker is allowed to strike. The German newspapers are full of stories of people freezing starving and rebelling in the streets in the U.S. and some of these stories may have been true in the depths of the Great Depression as the U.S. only could go as far as our democracy would let us and even then Roosevelt was labeled a Communist for what he did do.The short talks about how visitors will be surprised at how cheerful and relaxed the German people are but then the narrator credits that not only to the recovery of the economy but to the Nazi propaganda machine and the group think that the Third Reich encouraged and actually exercised in German youth who were taught much about acting together but whose school lessons kept critical thought to a minimum.Precisely because Germany was so prosperous the American captains of industry did not want to upset the apple cart  Hitler could have cut them off from trading in their economy with just a word. And because there had been so much seemingly pointless loss in WWI politicians were afraid to once again point to Germany as the boogeyman. Note the large number of anti war films made from 1925 until up to 1939 including the ironically named Idiot's Delight from that latter year for examples of that.I'd recommend this one. It is probably the best explanation you are going to get of life in Hitler's Germany before war actually broke out.".
