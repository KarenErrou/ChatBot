The film takes its name from a small neighborhood cinema in Vienna that shows old classic and not so classic films from the Ufa era to a motley assortment of senior citizens who can remember the days when the German film studio die Ufa was a match for Hollywood in every way.Although BELLARIA is technically a German documentary made in Austria by a SwissGerman director Douglas Wolfsperger has managed to create an atmosphere that has more of the feel of a charming tale than a documentary. His truly unique film offers us a glimpse into the lives of an eccentric group of aging Austrians parts of Austrian history and the city of Vienna itself.Wolfsperger opens the film with scenes of the aged moviegoers getting ready to go to the Bellaria which has become a vital social gathering place for these widows and widowers living otherwise lonely lives with memories of vibrant more active times. Herr Mosch the projectionist is himself one of these lonely folks who enjoy returning to the days of their prime via shimmering blackandwhite images on the Bellaria's screen. He has access to a treasure trove of cans of old Ufa prints that he brings to life each week.When the Bellaria regulars gather for the 400 p.m. show to see unvergessene Filme und unvergessene Stars the lobby turns into an old folks home as they sit around having refreshments prior to the screening. When the theater falls into darkness and the screen lights up we share their experience of being transported to another place and time  not just on the screen but in their own lives. While it is interesting to enter the blackandwhite Ufa world of the 1930s and '40s we also share in the lost dreams and daily struggles of the audience. All of these people in their 80s and 90s live in the past some in quite interesting pasts. One says I live in the past. I have no future. But they all know that only the flickering images of their beloved movie stars are truly immortal.All of the characters who visit the Bellaria are interesting but some particularly the Tenbuss twins stand out. The Tenbuss sisters have come all the way from Munich to attend a special appearance at the Bellaria by one of the few old Ufa actors Karl Schnbck who are still alive. They live to collect autographs and photos of such stars. And to pester them. Watching them in action is both amusing and painful at the same time.In the end Wolfsperger leaves his subjects with their proud dignity even after revealing their foibles prejudices and weaknesses. As you laugh cry and wince it is hard not to take these oldsters into your heart. You'll leave the theater just as they do  feeling a little better about life on planet earth.".

Tiger Shark picks up three survivors from a British hospital ship that was torpedoed two days earlier the discovery that one of the survivors is a German leads to violence and then really weird things start happening all the while a German cruiser is chasing the sub down.  Is a ghost trying to destroy the sub and its crew or are they just imagining things through convenient coincidences? Below was written by Lucas Sussman Darren Aronofsky and the film's director David N. Twohy Aronofsky is the smart filmmaker behind the arthouse hit Requiem for a Dream and Twohy has consistently specialized in sophisticated B pictures like The Arrival and Pitch Black.  Below offers up an intricate storyline that keeps both the characters and the audience guessingwhen they and we aren't jumping out of our skins in terror. Twohy's direction is an example of economic brilliancethe flick charges forward piling on the twists and scares methodically but never gratuitouslythankfully this is a horror flick that's more about mood than about goreindeed it's less in tune with modern splatterfests than it is an homage to the cerebral Val Lewton thrillers of the 1940s like The Seventh Victim or Isle of the Dead.And what mood this movie creates!  Ian Wilson's cinematography is vibrant and chilling and the magnificent special effects never overwhelm the storyexcept for a final hauntingly beautiful shot that will linger in your memory for quite awhile.An added bonus is the cast of smart players  Bruce Greenwood as the sub commander trying to hold his crew and himself together Matt Davis as the wetbehindtheears officer not really accepted by the crew Olivia Williams as an English nurse who is both suspect and suspicious and Holt McCallaney as a gruff officer. It appears that Below is being dumped by its studio Dimension with little advertising or fanfare a shame really since it's one of the most sophisticated and highest quality pictures I've seen in quite awhile.

It's a very similar movie in theme to the disappointing 'The Bunker' apart from the obvious difference of being set on a submarine of course. But unlike 'The Bunker' this movie has interesting characters that ayou can tell apart and b actually care about their fate. The script direction and acting are all superior and it's very effective in conveying the tense atmosphere of a sub in WW2 despite not being made on a megabudget. I like David Twohy's debut 'Pitch Black' and I like 'Below' even more. It's not only a very well made suspense movie but also a good war one. I hope Twohy fulfills his promise in projects to come.".

While it does contain some jump scenes in it and some spooky goings on one is left with a feeling of was it just cabin fever? As said visually this movie looked nice. It somewhat captured the cramped life on a sub and the tense moments they go through. However some liberties were taken on the set design to provide more room. The class of sub they are on are not nearly as comfy as this would make one think.Bruce Greenwood gives what I though was a very good performance. The movie can even stand up to a little bit of rewatch as well.".

They all turn in good performances but the lead Bruce Greenwood is a bit weak and reminds me of a poorman's Rod Serling throughout the film. If he had shown a bit more emotion or enthusiasm this film may well have ranked among the better thrillerhorror movies of the year.The movie concerns a US sub during World War 2 the U.S.S. Tigershark that is ordered to go pick up some survivors of a torpedoed hospital ship. Upon their arrival there are only three survivors left. A woman and two men. If you know anything about naval lore women on submarines is bad luck and upon the taking on of the survivors strange things start occurring on the sub.This film is directed by David Twohy the same guy who directed Pitch Black. The directing is quite similar and makes for a fairly effective ghost story. Theclaustrophobic nature of a submarine works rather well but is largely underused here. The strongest aspect of this film is that when it is over you can honestly argue that there was an actual ghost or that everything that transpired  was only in the minds of the people involved. This is a very impressive feat to be able to effectively pull off in this kind of film. The special effects are subtle and brief but effective at conveying what they are there to convey. There is also an alleged 'twist ending' that will become unfortunately obvious to any fan of the genre within the first twenty minutes.No nudity. No drugs. Very little harsh language. A little bit of onscreen violence. A few charred or bloody corpses are shown to 'enhance the mood' as it were. I believe the film was rated R but it should have been PG. There is very little in this film beyond the subject matter to justify anything stronger than a PG13. Lots of frights and more than a few 'cheap jolts'.As I write this review Below is already being phased out of theatres. I would encourage fans of psychological horror to catch this one on the big screen rather than wait for DVD if they want to see it. It's a lot more effective as a 'fright film' in a darkened theatre than it will be on a television screen.If you like psychological horror then try  catch this one before it leaves the theatres. It is a solid effort but by no means a classic. It's very much shows theinternationalinfluence in the horror genre though and shows many similarities to The Ring and even moreso to The Devil's Backbone.If you are a casual horror fan you may still enjoy this one quite a bit. Those that don't like scary movies need not enter. At it's heart Below is simply a tale of revenge from beyond the grave... or its it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Thrilling film about mysterious events happen into a submarine and carried out by a supernatural force  being compellingly directed by nice filmmaker David Twohy . This fantastic movie packs thrills  chills  violence  horror  suspense with creepy and ghastly underwater scenarios . As six hundred feet beneath the surface terror runs deep . The submarine U.S.S. Tiger Shark commanded by officer Brice Bruce Greenwood along with crew Dexter Fletcher Nick Chinlund  Scott Foley  Jason Flemyng Christopher Fairbank  Sebastian Knapp.. prowls on what should be a routine rescue mission  as they save a little group from a shipwreck  among them appears a woman Olivia Williams . But then strange happenings occur on the WW II submarine  as crew suffer runaway fear  astonishing deeds  sensory delusions and scary happenings . As a song was supposed to be mysteriously playing on the record player the song results to be 'Benny Goodman''s Sing Sing Sing  With a Swing and a vengeful ghost haunting the crew . There shows up an evil that lurks just below the surface of the ocean and deep inside the human psyche causing panic  mental deceptions and terror . This is a terrorthriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat  though some moments turns out to be confusing and slowmoving . Exciting film packs intrigue  intense scenes  grisly killings and amazing suspense . This is a creepy flick in which U571 meets Poltergeist. The starstudded cast is well headed by Bruce Greenwood  Olivia Williams  Matthew Davis and excellent plethora of secondaries as Holt McCallany  Dexter Fletcher  Nick Chinlund  Andrew Howard and Scott Foley . Some filming for this movie took place on an actual WW2 submarine . The USS Silversides which is available for tours located in Muskegon Michigan was towed out into the middle of Lake Michigan where scenes with Bruce Greenwood were filmed . The rest of the sets and models used in this movie were all based on the look and layout of the Silversides . Appropriate and suspenseful musical score by Graeme Revell .

This fantastic movie packs thrills  chills  violence  horror  suspense with creepy and ghastly underwater scenarios . As six hundred feet beneath the surface terror runs deep . The submarine U.S.S. Tiger Shark commanded by officer Brice Bruce Greenwood along with crew Dexter Fletcher Nick Chinlund  Scott Foley  Jason Flemyng Christopher Fairbank  Sebastian Knapp.. prowls on what should be a routine rescue mission  as they save a little group from a shipwreck  among them appears a woman Olivia Williams . But then strange happenings occur on the WW II submarine  as crew suffer runaway fear  astonishing deeds  sensory delusions and scary happenings . As a song was supposed to be mysteriously playing on the record player the song results to be 'Benny Goodman''s Sing Sing Sing  With a Swing and a vengeful ghost haunting the crew . There shows up an evil that lurks just below the surface of the ocean and deep inside the human psyche causing panic  mental deceptions and terror . This is a terrorthriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat  though some moments turns out to be confusing and slowmoving . Exciting film packs intrigue  intense scenes  grisly killings and amazing suspense . This is a creepy flick in which U571 meets Poltergeist. The starstudded cast is well headed by Bruce Greenwood  Olivia Williams  Matthew Davis and excellent plethora of secondaries as Holt McCallany  Dexter Fletcher  Nick Chinlund  Andrew Howard and Scott Foley . Some filming for this movie took place on an actual WW2 submarine . The USS Silversides which is available for tours located in Muskegon Michigan was towed out into the middle of Lake Michigan where scenes with Bruce Greenwood were filmed . The rest of the sets and models used in this movie were all based on the look and layout of the Silversides . Appropriate and suspenseful musical score by Graeme Revell . Atmospheric and colorful cinematography by Ian Wilson . The motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy  though Darren Aronofsky who cowrote the screenplay was originally going to direct the film in 1999 but instead made Requiem for a dream 2000. David is an expert writer and director of splendid SciFi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable Timescape and subsequently made The arrival with Charlie Sheen .

The cinematography by Ian Wilson was excellent and was combined well with the CGI work the underwater sub looked so real the abovewater sub being done in the 007 tank at Pinewood.  Along with Ian Wilson for cinematography I personally would also nominate it for a BAFTA of which I am a member in both Sound and Editing categories if it was submitted the latter being particularly slick.  We about 50 of us including many BSC members leapt out of our seats at certain points.  You were really there suffering with the crew. It is only tragic that because the bosses would prefer to change it into a horror movie that it will never be released in the UK so sadly Brits will never see one of the great British films although the Union flag shown in the end shot should have been a Red Ensign but then nothing is perfect!".

Coming a few months after Harrison Ford submarine thriller K19 The Widowmaker sank without grace Below was barely given a release or publicity junket to give it a chance. Which considering that 40 million was given to produce it comes off as mighty strange. More so when one looks at the credentials on offer. A cast featuring fine character actors from Britain  America directed by the man who was hot from the popular Pitch Black and a certain Darren Aronofsky involved in the writing. OK so admittedly a haunted submarine premise on the surface doesn't sound too demanding on the cerebral front but this is much more than an underwater spooker.Below gets all the key ingredients right for such a genre production. It's intensively tight in claustrophobic atmosphere creepy in narrative adroit with the kill dispatches and crucially pays off with the big reveal. It also has some great underwater sequences to sample as the cast do justice to the smart script. True it's a little derivative of similar themed film's like The Keep The Bunker et all but what it lacks in freshness it more than makes up for in slick story telling. Also of note is that Twohy and his cowriters are aware enough to know that their story has to be a bit more than just another Rod Serlingesque tale. At the hour mark the characters even bring this into play with a wonderful discussion that richly subverts our expectations of where we are going with this movie.With its metallic blue tints Ian Wilson on cinematography aiding the feel of submarine life we the audience are thrust into the confines of sub life as well. This really is a film that asks us to turn off the lights switch the phone off and invest your very being into the story. Be part of this crew and the rewards are there to be had for the ghostly movie seeker. Cast wise Greenwood is classy as usual and Williams refuses to let her character be the token it could have been. In support it's always good to see Chinlund  Flemyng performing while Galifianakis delivers the goods in the colourful part.With visual smarts and a knowing sense of dread Twohy's film is on the money. It may not be breaking new ground in the genre it sits in but it's certainly one of the better told and produced of said genre stories. 7.510".

Next to Das Boot Below has about the best feel of any movie for that dank miserable life. The approach is admittedly slicker more cinematic where Das Boot is grittier more akin to documentary. But both films are many fathoms better than the nearest runners up like Run Silent Run Deep.The characters are well chosen. No one seems uniformly admirable or wholeheartedly evil. These are people with plenty of faults but all the more likable for that. There are no 'heroes' in this boat just a lot of scared people trying to do the 'right' thing.

The submarine definitely IS haunted... but is it haunted only by the conscience of its crewmen or by 'real' ghosts? Twohy keeps you guessing. If you don't like that sort of tension you'll certainly find Below hard to take. Personally I tend to hate it... but here for once I found it strangely compelling maybe because I felt that Twohy was with me all the way not simply taunting me but himself embracing that same uncertainty.Below probably drew a fair bit of criticism by frustrating moviegoers' expectations. It's not Friday the 13th underwater nor Saving Private Ryan underwater nor even Pitch Black underwater. While the advance billing may have suggested otherwise Below is a far more delicate and subtle film than any of those. It's a genrebuster for sure but if you give it a chance it actually does work on every level as adventure as whodunit as war story and as ghost story.And in the end not really a spoiler it achieves something quite remarkable it leaves the naturalvssupernatural question perfectly ambiguous balanced on the same knife'sedge as it was at the start. And thereby suggests that maybe a ghost that's 'real' in your mind is plenty 'real' enough.".

The camera angles don't show a character standing in one corner of the screen and a large portion of the background filling the rest up which implies that something shocking is going to happen to that background. Instead the angles center themselves on the characters in question and usually are very unpredictable in scenes where something frightening is going to happen. They also give a better sense of claustraphobia with their tight views as opposed to a view that shows a large part of the sub.

I did like THE KEEP mainly due to the art house flourishes  One of the things people detested about Michael Mann's adaptation  but have so far missed out on seeing THE BUNKER and DEATHWATCH . I guess the appeal to film makers is that it's easy to kick start a story of having a bunch of soldiers turn up at a deserted locale where they find a demonic force trying to kill them one by one which isn't a million miles away from the plot of say PREDATOR or DOG SOLDIERS . But when you stop to consider the horrors of war do we need supernatural elements to horrify an audience ? BELOW is somewhat different from the films mentioned above because it does somewhat lack a sense of time and space . The American submarine where the story is set could easily have been set on a spaceship in the future and to be honest the movie does feel very similar to EVENT HORIZON . There's little gore involved from director David Twohey which is a both a good and bad thing since he doesn't use the gimmick of explict violence to shock the audience but makes the film a bit too talky for its own goodBELOW can probably be summed up in thus  If you liked EVENT HORIZON you will like BELOW . If you thought DAS BOOT was terrifying without any supernatural elements you probably won't like BELOW".

So I came back to edit and it is to say that this story is rhyme understated. Film is your bedtime story come to life. Film is an eclectic medium taking from all the arts except perhaps the tactile and who knows how long before we will be able to feel the story physically by literally touching it.Below is rather poetic in the sense that it presents a normal war story in the context of what war signifies its meaning and affect on us yet places the characters in a situation that does not involve war as much as it does the simple unknowns of life. The demon the ghost here might very well be the enemy in this case the Germans yet the art is in using this as a metaphor for our process of dealing with felt generalized fear. Of each other of chaos of death of the devil of God of candy slugs spiders? Up to you. Still I think it is always what we think of as our demise death.But physical isn't currently the question. This film has elements of Hitchcock in that it provides an invitation to look into the mirror that reflects back our emotional life and asks each of us to make our own decisions. And because of the supernaturalparanormal elements it touches on what I perceive as something spiritual. Bottom line it involves us in the character and experiences of the players.War ghosts a presence an intimation sensitivity a sense. We do have a problem with death many of us. This story is about dying in a can that is what they tell us about all these things death how to do this or that like live one's life failed relationships wanting to do more than you think you are doing or survival outside or rather no matter what your situation whether you're sinking or floating or on solid earth you will be asked at some point and like the characters in this story to make a simple yes or no decision as to how much you appreciate life. It involves that leap of faith that we some of us hope to make amidst a bit of doubt and sadness and some appreciation of life.Very well filmed quite well acted an intriguing and expansive story. It is a bit dark but that's what leads us to the light.Think about how much you judge.Greg Pittsburgh Pennsylvania home btw of the first nickelodeon theater".

Then I saw the cover picture bearing a review stating U571 meets Poltergeist and realized that wouldn't be too original...It's WWII and the US Sub is lively and excited due to 3 survivors picked up for a shipwreck one of whom is a female British doctor. Some of the crew is thrilled and edgy about seeing a woman for the first time in weeks maybe months. Others are aware of sea folklore and believe a woman on a boat is bad luck.The story was absolutely brilliant in my opinion the thrill and suspense were of the highest level and the twist was surprising and well presented. The acting was persuasive and honest and during the entire film I found myself at the edge of my seat fearing for the lives of the Sub's crew as mechanical problems stacked up.And then they had to destroy what might have been a great film by forcibly bluntly and stupidly shoving a ghost into it. I mean... why? Honestly why? In order for DVD libraries to be able to tag this film as horror? What was so important about that?! This could have been an excellent warpsychological thriller film with an excellent story a surprising twist and good acting. Adding the whole ghost part was like taking that kids' puzzle with the shapes putting the square peg in the triangle hole and hammering it till the entire thing broke. That simply ruined the film for me and I'm sure I'm not the only one.In summary  an excellent war thriller. Forcing it into the horror genre ruined it. I'd still recommend it if you could be forgiving. I wouldn't blame you if you weren't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Below is a film of two halves. On the one hand it's a very well directed movie with some brilliant horror sequences camera angles and a claustrophobic atmosphere that will make many horror fans foam at the mouth. However on the other hand it's just another lame ghost story that unfortunately lacks both the invention and the intrigue that it needs to make it a complete horror package. The story is predictable and basically follows the same path that a hundred ghost stories before it have followed  i.e. man is killed and comes back to haunt those who wronged him. There is an element of originality in the way that the film climaxes ambiguously but the originality is strewn from it due to the fact that these sorts of twists have become very predictable of late. Cheers M Night Shyamalan.The story takes place on a World War Two submarine. After finding survivors from another less fortunate ship the captain of our ship decides to let them board. We begin a voyage of discovery as certain events transpire and the crew begin to believe that their submarine is haunted. This is a film that needs to be followed in order to fully understand the story and so people that are tired or just fancy seeing something easy should find something else to watch. The fact that the story is rather difficult to follow hampers the film in the end however as when we discover the mystery behind what's been going on it's a disappointment to say the least. Below also suffers from a rather turgid script which is riddled with clichs and dull oneliners to deliver the action. The characters are neither believable nor interesting which doesn't do the film any favours either. It's saving grace is as mentioned the directing. David Twohy directs out attention through numerous angles all of which help to instill the idea that we're on a submarine in the viewer's mind. The special effects are somewhat hokey but numerous scenes impress most notably the part where our hero's find themselves in the middle of a bunch of Manta Rays.If you're a film fan that likes your ghost films to have an interesting story try The Devil's Backbone instead. If you like technical prowess you could do a lot worse.".

I really don't find this to be a weakness at all. There is no denial that a lot of bad things happened on that boat and that a lot of it seemed to be tied to some very supernatural elements. However it was never really 100 confirmed that it was all the doing of a vengeful spirit or spirits. There were several points in the movie where one or two of the more rational characters claimed that they were simply the victims of mechanical problems an understandable result of a nasty run in with a few dozen depth charges and drag hooks breathing too much ozone and CO2 stress and large amounts of guilt. In fact I believe the last line of the movie is the most ambiguous bringing everything back into question before it fades to black.All that aside this is a great movie from start to finish. It's highly atmospheric very well paced and the actingdirecting is impeccable. This one should be in the library of anyone who enjoys a really nicely done suspensethrillerhorror flick.".

Museum curator Faussier JeanFrancois Balmer brings in a noted Egyptologist Glenda Spencer to examine the findings and she announces that the mummy inside the coffin was actually the evil spirit Belphegor. Lisa who lives across the street from the museum follows her runaway cat into the museum after closing time where she is accidentally given a shock that sends the stray spirit into her body. Soon Lisa is disguising herself as Belphegor and making off with the rare Egyptian treasures on display at the museum convinced that they are rightfully hers.

A comparison between the Karloff Mummy and The Mummy Returns 2000 comes to my mind. In fact Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series. But then scripting is terrible speed there is none and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes The first scene in the tomb looks plain stupid with cats clearly being thrown when theyre supposed to jump landing with their backfeet first. Belphegore moves around like a statue on wheels neither impressive nor scary and the psychological drama that unfolded in the old tv series when the heroine had to learn that shes a villain is completely neglected. This movie is so WASTED wasted money wasted actors wasted blueprint that it hurts. Its a belowpar Mummyrip off thats only good for some laughs but has nothing at all to do with the Greco classic She has a small role in this movie too  on the graveyard.".

The special effects with the mummy's ghost looked like they didn't even belong in the film as though someone put them in during postproduction to spice them up because the actors barely react to them.The plot just kind of meanders which is the opposite of real storytelling. I guess this was based on a French TV series where they had to distill it down to a twohour movie.The plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the Louvre which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times. So THAT'S how people keep stealing the Mona Lisa! The boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960's version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon.So I'm not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not. He kills two guards during the course of the movie but he just wants to get to the afterlife.".

Now young director  who undoubtedly grew up with the show  JeanPaul Salom who would go on to make the equally nostalgic ARSENE LUPIN with Continental matine idol du jour Romain Duris has turned this pivotal childhood experience into an expensive and undeniably goodlooking multiplex blockbuster. The elaborate CGI alone must have eaten up a considerable chunk of the budget.Erstwhile centerpiece Grco even does a brief walkon for those in the know during an atmospheric cemetery scene where she makes fleeting eye contact with replacement Sophie Marceau a talented thespian best known to US audiences for her purely decorative turn in Mel Gibson's supremely silly BRAVEHEART. Though obviously aimed at family audiences this fairly oldfashioned adventure yarn will please moms and dads rather than their offspring who have become accustomed to far more gruesome sights than the extremely mild horrors on display here.For the uninitiated this intentionally naive mix of scares and chuckles should prove something of a disconcerting experience. For example in spite of its 1935 Egypt prologue complete with a tomb desecration whose perpetrators wind up swiftly dispatched the movie draws less inspiration from old Universal or Hammer mummy chillers than from a long line of possession flicks ranging from the modest WITCHBOARD series to the landmark EXORCIST with Marceau as beleaguered heroine Lisa unwilling vessel to the embalmed one's vengeful spirit doing a PG version of Linda Blair's finest hour for the film's grand finale. More importantly for a pervert like myself she also bares her shapely butt and right boob on separate occasions just so you won't forget this is a French film after all ! Diminutive heartthrob Frdric Diefenthal who rose to prominence playing the clumsy policeman hero of the wildly popular TAXI movies with Samy Naceri also registers strongly as her frequently beaten up romantic foil. Dependable old timer Michel Serrault forever swishy Alban from the original LA CAGE AUX FOLLES gets all the best lines as a retired cop turned security expert and even a halfway decent farcical romance with bumbling Egyptologist Julie Christie the latter handling her French dialog in disarming Laurel  Hardy fashion.Once viewers can get past the fact that this movie's not intended to scare the living daylights out of them  though the image of the diabolical Belphgor in full ceremonial burial dress hovering through the museum corridors has an eerie Jean Rollin poetry to it  they can fully enjoy this handsomely mounted horror comedy for its ingratiating performances amiably ludicrous set pieces and stunningly shot Paris settings with all tourist traps present and accounted for. A genuinely haunting score by then fledgling composer Bruno Coulais who of course went on to write the music for the immensely successful LES CHORISTES provides the icing on the cake.".

The writing is not that great nor is most of the writing in films like this one in terms of hooking you into the story. It was very predictable in terms of what was to happen next. So that definitely knocks a few points from a higher vote I personally like to wonder what happens and have a guess at what could unfold. Sophie Marceau plays Lisa a really dull nervousanxious commonly seen before type of character who of course gets caught up in some drama as the movie drags on to the predictable finish. This is nothing like a french cinema movie much more like a Hollywood film. I am a big fan of foreign cinema and Sophie Marceau and felt this film was a very average done before kind of deal. The fact it had lots of action is one plus because I liked that the action was the only thing that kept me going in this completely ordinary done before film. I give it an ordinary 5 out of 10 if you are going to rent foreign rent La Fidelite also starring Sophie Marceau".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel by Arthur Bernde from 1927. Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphgor has been a popular subject before for movies and miniseries. The first movie got released way back in 1927 simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernde was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphgor is one of his best known creations.Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one. Nothing wrong with playing in French quality movies since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules.Problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects to make the movie good and scary. Well horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though with some exceptions here and there. It's not like the special effects are bad in this one. Especially for an European movie it is simply good but its just misplaced since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect. It would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch no doubt about that really. The movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach. At times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie. This is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level. You can say that the movie is even a bit boring. It all also definitely gets worse toward the ending. After a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead.The editing seems totally off. It uses too fast cuts without much style while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good modern style. Also the timeline is just plain messed up at times as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order.The musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn't even sounds to fit the movie as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting. I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer. The musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects.The movie is filled with many characters which you however just couldn't care less about. It also just seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever fall for a man such as Frdric Diefenthal. The movie also features Julie Christie which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie.A horrible watch.310httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Amongst other artifacts they decide to bring back the sarcophagus and the mummy to the Louvre museum in Paris. During the boat trip to Marseilles however all but one crew member strangely dies including Pierre Desfontaines himself. 65 years later during a restoration of the Louvre museum in Paris the mummy is found in a forgotten storage room. The museum curator Bertrand Faussier JeanFranois Balmer brings in Egyptologist Glenda Spencer Julie Christie to examine the artifacts and trying to establish who the mummy really where and its name.Lisa Sophie Marceau is an ordinary girl living across the street from the museum together with her grandma Genevive Patachou.

	schema:reviewBody "In opposite to most reviewers I'm not familiar with the 1965 bw TV series but review this movie as a separate piece of art. Admittedly Belphegor' is not a perfect movie as there are a couple of logical problems within the story. Nevertheless it's crafted entertainment. The love interest between Lisa Sophie Marceau beautiful as ever and Martin Frederic Diefenthal an eccentric old investigator Michel Serrault a museum director J.F. Balmer who ignores experts as often as he can I've faced this kind of boss in real life believe me and of course a dark phantom on the loose provide 90 minutes of good fun. And if you suffer from arachnophobia like I do you'll be happy to hear that this is the first movie about archaeologists since Raiders of the Lost SpArk' that doesn't employ creepy crawling insects for cheap thrills. Instead it has a few new ideas. I loved the scene where Lisa explains to a bunch of kids what the Egyptian Book of the Dead is aboutgets confused because she doesn't know where she got the knowledge fromand then gets angry about one boy who painted the story the wrong way around in his notebook. It's the little human touches that matter. Voted 710.".

Admittedly Belphegor' is not a perfect movie as there are a couple of logical problems within the story. Nevertheless it's crafted entertainment. The love interest between Lisa Sophie Marceau beautiful as ever and Martin Frederic Diefenthal an eccentric old investigator Michel Serrault a museum director J.F. Balmer who ignores experts as often as he can I've faced this kind of boss in real life believe me and of course a dark phantom on the loose provide 90 minutes of good fun. And if you suffer from arachnophobia like I do you'll be happy to hear that this is the first movie about archaeologists since Raiders of the Lost SpArk' that doesn't employ creepy crawling insects for cheap thrills. Instead it has a few new ideas. I loved the scene where Lisa explains to a bunch of kids what the Egyptian Book of the Dead is aboutgets confused because she doesn't know where she got the knowledge fromand then gets angry about one boy who painted the story the wrong way around in his notebook. It's the little human touches that matter. Voted 710.";

	schema:headline " Neither good nor bad... sadly just average";
	schema:reviewBody "To many people in France the name Belphgor represents one of the best and most famous novels in the horror fiction genre. Written by Arthur Bernde Belphgor was an intriguing story mix of horror suspense and mystery where a detective attempted to unveil the mystery behind a ghostly presence that haunted the Louvre Museum. Bernde was a man fascinated by cinema so many of his novels were devised to be adapted to screen as soon as possible. Naturally Belphgor became a silent film in 1927 however the story reached cult status in 1965 when Bernde's novel became the basis for one of the most popular French TV series of the 60s. To many people in France Belphgor is truly a revered tale of horror and mystery but sadly this new incarnation of Bernde's novel ends up as an average entry in French cinema.Belphgor  Le Fantme Du Louvre begins as an old collection of Egyptian artifacts is found in the vaults of the Museum during the works of restoration. Strangely the artifacts are not cataloged so they start to be checked by the Museum's team of Egyptologists. As the main Mummy of the discovery is checked its spirit awakes and escapes through the museum's electrical system becoming a haunting presence in the Museum. At the same time Lisa Sophie Marceau a woman who lives across the street enters accidentally inside the Museum as the restoration work makes a hole in her basement. Soon she finds herself possessed by the free spirit of Belphgor who now will use her body for his own evil purposes.The movie was written by a very talented team of writers Danile Thompson Jrme Tonnerre and director JeanPaul Salom himself however the final result is really disappointing considering the talents of those involved in it. Belphgor  Le Fantme Du Louvre moves seriously away from Bernde's novel with the inclusion of a heavier focus in the supernatural elements and a considerable lack in the mystery and suspense of the story basically the elements that made the TV series popular. It's not difficult to understand why the French fans got angry as the film has little to no resemblance to the story's earlier incarnations and seems to had used Bernde's novel only as a blueprint for a typical blockbuster action film.Director JeanPaul Salom confirms this intention by making this movie an actionadventure film with an obvious Hollywood style. Salom makes the bold decision of attempting what director Stephen Sommers did with The Mummy transforming a classic horror film into an action film but sadly he fails leaving Belphgor unfocused and almost without a trace of its original incarnation. Despite this huge problem Salom shows an effective and technically good direction and at times his use of the camera and the work with his actors really make the film work. His followup to Belphgor a new version of the adventures of Maurice Leblanc's character Arsne Lupin is a better demonstration of Salom's talents as an action film director.The film's saving grace is definitely the talented cast of the movie as the group of actors really try to do their best job despite the script's many problems making the film at least enjoyable. The beautiful Sophie Marceau leads the cast as Lisa still delivering a good performance as always. Frderic Diefenthal is her love interest Martin a young man decided to save Lisa from Belphgor's possession. Diefenthal is effective and makes a good counterpart to Marceau but the real treasures are Julie Christie and Michel Serrault who in their supporting roles steal every scene they are in and prove their great talent for the subtle comedy their two characters domain. It's a joy to see the two experienced actors giving their best despite the film's obvious problems.As written above the script is the movie's biggest problem not because it deviates from the source novel that's hardly a sin but because the approach the story takes seem unfocused and without direction almost as if the writers weren't sure if to make the movie a mystery film or an actionadventure one. Clearly the purpose was to modernize an old favorite by making it attractive to the younger crowd but it seems that in the process the writers lost the essence of Bernde's novel delivering a void soulless product. Hoever this is not to say that the film is awful the problem is that it just doesn't attempt to be something better ending with just an average adventure film missing the enormous potential of the story.While this is not exactly an example of the best Modern French dark fantasy films Pitof's Vidocq or Salom's own Arsne Lupin are better it's by no means a bad movie. However I would only recommend it to die hard fans of the genre or to fans of the actors involved as this is simply another mediocre and typical entry in the actionadventure genre. 510".

The special effects aren't bad but it's nothing spectacular as I was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until I realized that those kind of scenes were in The Mummy and this is Belhpegor.

It is an entertaining and funny Pasta Western with the attractive actors Gemma and Eastman forming an odd as well as fun couple. Lightingly paced and with a really disconcerting storyline that results to be absurd at times but frenetic fights and gunplay sequences make up for it . This release has some cool and hilarious moments  however the Terence Hill and Bud Spencer movies are much better.

In Ben And Charlie George Eastman who created the story outline for the screenplay becomes his companion. Right at the beginning Charlie Eastman swears never to run any criminal business with Ben Gemma again  who is just out of prison and likely to be back inside soon! But of course it doesn't take long until they get back together and make more or less usually less successful attempts at anything from gambling to bank robbery. Ben And Charlie is much better than most comedies released at the time because it doesn't get too silly and maintains a certain character development including even a couple of tragic moments.".

	schema:headline " Highly Recommended Italian Western";
	schema:reviewBody "People always gawk at me with incredulity when I tell them how much I enjoy European made westerns specifically Italian spaghetti westerns. They ask how can you make a western in Italy of all places and I tell them that I can do it even one better Most of them were actually filmed in SPAIN and on soundstages back in Rome. They are 100 fake in terms of what most people might call authenticity and are more like playing cowboys when you were a kid. All they needed was to find the right looking locations Almeria Spain does quite nicely rustle up some horses plenty of horses in Europe dig up the costumes  weaponry ever hear of a props department? and find the writers producers and directors with enough vision to cobble together an interesting little story  frame it properly and there you go. Just like playing cowboy out back in the sandlot except it's grownups and they film it.With that out of the way BEN  CHARLIE is a marvelous example of the later period of spaghetti westerns that came after the idiom had been established as a form unto itself. By 1972 the Italians had proved without a doubt they could make fine sweeping westerns on the same level of effectiveness as the John Ford and Howard Hawks classics see ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST for more information. So they were freed up as it were to sort of muck around trying to find new ways to make the form work and one of the tangents they used was the comedyslapstick approach best epitomized by the Trinity films with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. While the variant may not have caught on as strongly here in the new world TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME was the highest grossing spaghetti western in Europe so naturally other Italian writers producers and directors decided to have their own go at making more light hearted efforts.BEN  CHARLIE is particularly effective because it eschews some of the more shall we say absurdist approach for a bit of grimness here  there and boasts an impressive collection of talent both in front of and behind the camera. Genre favorite Giuliano Gemma  best known for his Ringo spaghettis  and seven foot tall George Eastman  best known as a cult horror movie star  are absolutely wonderful as the titular characters. Instead of sneering laconic gunslingers these two are a pair of confidence hucksters traveling the old west doing their best to avoid an honest day's work. Gemma is the brains of the duo a shyster galore who can turn nearly any mundane opportunity into a chance to scam a few dollars out of somebody. And Eastman is the brawn of the two a big hulking sinister looking pistolero who unwittingly finds himself on the lam with Gemma with the always delightfully evil Aldo Sanbrell hot on their trail ... Eastman may be more associated with horror but one of the movie's most laugh inducing segments finds him bonedry thirsty and penniless leaning against a bar while mugs of fresh foaming beer are passed back  forth. Doesn't sound like much? Watch Eastman's face. He is an overlooked genius of comic timing.The supporting cast is also made up of heavyweight names from Italian gene cinema good old Franco Fantasia the deliriously sexy Marisa Mell Luciano Catenacci Max Lawrence to all you Mario Bava fans Nello Pazzafini Roberto Camardiel Cris Huerta Luis Induni the ever reliable George Rigaud and my hero Giacomo RossiStuart. I wish I could suggest an AmericanizedHollywood cast of analagous nature ... The names  faces will be instantly familiar to anyone who's seen more than two or three of these things. The whole affair is directed with restrained artfulness by genre veteran Michele Lupo who had cut his teeth with spaghetti master Sergio Leone in the sword  sandal Peplum genre with a gifted young cameraman named Aristide Massaccesi better known to horror  Euro sleaze fans as Joe D'amato provides the goingson with a certain visual flair that is quite intriguing. The film was also masterfully written by George Eastman himself along with heavyweight name Sergio Donati who also had worked with Leone on both FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and yes ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.Leone's influence is directly homaged in a scene lifted from THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY where the filthy flat broke Gemma pays a visit to a gun dealer and connives the guy into loading a pistol for him and looking carefully down the barrel to make sure he could see the bullet. You can make up the rest of the scene I am sure which is a device seen as recently as THE TERMINATOR Gemma even flips over the CLOSED sign on his way out the door directly referencing Eli Wallach's message for one character in particular to keep his mouth shut. The film is filled with such moments and as Uncle Roger Ebert himself has pointed out westerns pass or fail based on the strengths of their individual moments rather than necessarily relying on a specific story. The scene may be somewhat derivative but then again ALL westerns are somewhat derivative once you get down to it with horses six shooters saloon brawls gorgeous damsels quick draw duels. It is the approach that differentiates one example from the other and the approach here is amusing witty involving and downright entertaining.810 Available on DVD from Wild East Productions and both a musthave addition to the library of any devotee as well as a great addition to the collection of the novice. And downright entertaining to prove diverting to any fan of movies regardless of what kind they are.".

Plus it doesn't go overboard with the slapstick and throws in a bit a serious action and tragedy into the mix too. We first meet Charlie Eastman who created the story too when he's hanging around outside of a jail for days on end. He's waiting on Ben Gemma and seemingly is happy to see him when Ben gets out only to take him out into the desert for a punch up. Looks like Ben and Charlie are two conmen and Ben's last con got him landed in jail with them both losing everything. You'll also notice here that Gemma's real life skills as a trapeze artist come in handy during fake fights and that Joe D'Amato's camera films everything like it's a high budget arthouse film.Charlie then tells Ben to head in the opposite direction from him and keep walking but don't you know the two of the keep bumping into each other while trying to pull various scams including both of them cheating during a game of cards which of course leads to a bar fight. Things get more serious when Ben runs into his exfianc that he run away from. She's a high class prostitute that makes plenty of money and Ben tries to put a face on why he's dressed in rags. Realising that he'll never win her back with petty crime he sets his mind of a big heist and somehow manages to drag Charlie down with him too. What makes this film better than most of the comedies is that Gemma and Eastman look like they are genuinely having the time of their lives and it shines through in their characters. Eastman's face when he's standing at the bar penniless while beer and whiskey fly back and forth is priceless. Giacomo RossiStuart's role could have been bigger but in the end this is one of the few comedy westerns I'd recommend.".

	schema:headline " A film biography that's complex like its subject";
	schema:reviewBody "Haynes' adventurous biopic of Bob Dylan which uses six actors of both sexes and several races ranging in ages from 11 to 50 is both exhausting and fun to watch. It's also hard to describe. But let's start with those six and the characters or facets they portray. Arthur Ben Whishaw is the Dylan who incarnated Rimbaud and serves as a kind of narrator whom we see smoking and giving ironic answers to some kind of inquisition sporadically throughout the film. Woody the wonderful young Marcus Carl Franklin an amazing a singer and actor is a precocious railhopper with a guitar labeled like the real Woody's THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS and tall tales that start with his claim that he's Woody Guthrie. Woody's scenes show him rescued by a black family and a white family and performing with country black musicals. He represents the early shapeshifting Dylan in search of an identity and telling a lot of lies along the way.Jack Christian Bale is the Dylan who became a hit in Greenwich Village and went into the South and sang The Ballad of Hattie Carroll and other protest folk songsthe highprofile political Dylan who spearheaded a movement and became famous with his brilliant early LP's. But Jack doesn't want to be typecast and betrays his adoring public and his lover and folksinging champion Alice Julianne Moore a Joan Baez standin seen in later interviews. Jack disappears and his place is taken by Robbie Heath Ledger a young actor in New York who becomes famous for starring in a 1965 film depicting the vanished Jack. Robbie meets Claire Charlotte Gainsbourg in a Village coffee shop and falls in love and a turbulent tenyear marriage follows winding up painfully at the time of the Vietnam War's end.If Jack represents the castoff early style and Robbie represents Dylan's family life Jude Cate Blanchett is Dylan the artist quintessentially as seen in the midtolate Sixties when he toured England an event notably chronicled by two LeacockPennebaker documentariesand shocked his audiences some of whose members felt betrayed and shouted Judas! when he shifted from solo guitar and harmonica to more personal songs with loud rock accompaniment. Jude's segments are partly borrowed from Pennebaker but largely consist of gorgeous black and white scenes deliberately and churlishly Haynes' word imitative of Fellini's 8 .Jude's new style is admired by Allen Ginsberg David Cross and underground groupie Coco Rivington Michelle Williams and he becomes internationally famous. But he continues to be misunderstood by the protest music old guard and conventional journalists like the British TV host Mr. Jones Bruce Greenwoodwho's incorporated into a music video for Highway 61 Revisited's Ballad of a Thin Man . . .something is happening here And you don't know what it is do you Mister Jones. . .Jude and Arthur articulate the early Dylan's challenging ironic stance to the public but Jude is exhausted on tour and his nihilism leads him to an existential crisis.He's reborn symbolically in Pastor John Christian Bale again who's moved to Stockton twenty years later and become a bornagain preacher singing his own gospel songs. Finally the last version of Dylan appears in Billy Richard Gere in full retreat from the worldtill threats to destroy his town of Riddle cause him to enter public life again. This sequence evokes a Sixties historical western in which Pat Garrett Bruce Greenwood is a character.This is only the barest outline of the twoandaquarterhour film in which various Dylan's are woven in and out. Maybe the reason why I found Woody's sequences delightful and Billy's colorful but wearying has to do with the latter's coming two hours later. But Gere and his sequences evoke Dylan less well and are puzzling to interpret. Blanchett's in contrast are of course the most conventionally straightforward. She's the only one who successfully mimics the physical appearance and the speaking voice of the artist unless Whishaw does a better job with the voice. But Blanchett's mimicry is intentionally undercut and the biopic conventionality of films like Ray avoided by having Jude be played by a womanwhich was planned by Haynes in his screenplay before he even chose his actor.The method Haynes has chosen avoids clich. This is still a biopic but it's a sophisticated one and the fractured portrait is well justified by the nature of its subject. Dylan has always been a shapeshifter some of his permutations were left out such as the period of the orthodox Jew and JDL supporter. But it's intelligent to see Dylan the man the husband the artist the political being and the religious being as completely separate entities because no simple biopic sequence can really dramatize the complexity of such an artist and such a protean existence. Haynes' film makes you think about biography itself as well as giving imaginative shape to aspects of Bob Dylan no nonfiction account can really provide.Maybe it's the daringly experimental methodology that led Dylan himself approached through his eldest son Jesseto grant Haynes both the musical rights and the biographical rights. Haynes has chosen a multifaceted and original way of using Dylan's songs. Only Franklin actually performs them with his own voice. Otherwise the soundtrack mixes original Dylan recordings with existing covers new ones by people as widely various as Ritche Havens Iggy Pop John Doe and Sonic Youth and other music including appropriately for the 8  esquire sequences Nino Rota. There is a voiceover narration by Kris Kristofferson. Haynes worked on the screenplay for years and then collaborated with Oren Moverman.Not for mainstream audiences or be prime Oscar bait but a challenging fun watch. Shown in the press screenings of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center 2007. Haynes was present fort a QA afterward with J. Hoberman of the Village Voice which revealed that the director is an intelligent and articulate man and who knows his Dylan.".

	schema:reviewBody "'I'm Not There' Todd Haynes 2007The biopicture can be a difficult kind of picture to picture. Even more so when you have no intention of divulging the name of your subject. And dare I say it yet further still when you insist on casting at least six people to play the lead role. This is the charm behind 'I'm Not There'  Todd Haynes' tribute to the life and times of Bob Dylan that recently lit up the Festival di Venezia. Biographic cinema is a frightening beast some films are stuffed full of information while others attempt to exactly mimic their respective studies. There are however very few that play with their quarry flitting from fact to fiction so quickly that in the end we know not what to believe. In reality the life of Robert Dylan was exactly this mess of lies grandeur childishness arrogance and genius. One of almost unbelievable occurrences that when whispered about long enough become carefully set in stone. Todd Haynes understands this fact and so goes after it with a stance of almost awed respect yet as an onlooker  crafting a mockumentary that is so rich in character and love and attention to detail that we can't help but be drawn in. I've heard early reviews stating that 'I'm Not There' will make the Dylanites gush and the normal folk sleep. The fact is this couldn't be further from the truth  being a person that is indifferent to the music appears only to heighten the enjoyment.Somewhere during the last five years writerdirector Haynes came upon the slightly trampled idea of conducting a Bob Dylan biography movie. Nothing original in itself though with one idea to make it slightly different from what the likes of Scorsese had attempted a few years back. He would use multiple actors for 'I'm Not There' six in fact  to portray the iconic figure. And what an inspired decision it is. The unrecognisable and slender form of Cate Blanchett steals the show melting into her eyerubbing nosetwitching lipconscious take that is only too quick to lash those in proximity with a witful tongue. Almost as idiosyncratic is Ben Whishaw's sarcasmlaced drawling poet Dylan. Who prompts guffaws when tiresomely declaring his name as RIMBAUD to an arresting police officer. The eccentric duo are displayed primarily in overexposed black and white and complementing this in Technicolor are the equally impressive Christian Bale and Heath Ledger. Whom fall upon the unwashed shaded rocker Dylan with equally strong performances. To complete the musical sextuplets are Richard Gere and the delightful Marcus Carl Franklin these two are the talltale Dylans. A jaded western cowboy and a bluessinging black child respectively both adding another more fictional dimension to the character. They are almost opposite ends of the Dylanspectrum and are introduced at the opening and closing of the film to further embolden this point. Franklin in particular impresses tugging at the humor strings again with his dry recollections of a life on the musical road.The host of supporting actorsactresses in 'I'm Not There' do well to further the films themes. With Charlotte Gainsbourg and Julianne Moore taking up the posts of drama and documentary accordingly. Each plays one of the two most important women in Dylan's life with Gainsbourg Sara Lownds cooking up a memorable onscreen chemistry  or lack thereof  with Ledger's character. She is instantly attractive across a smoky diner yet this attraction soon wanes as romance stagnates. Neverending tours take their toll and the once exciteful scooterriding relationship crumbles. Moore's character Joan Baez is more reflective playing her whole part as if interviewed enthusiastically many years on. My only problem is with the later segments of 'I'm Not There'. Particularly those featuring the bearded and bespectacled Richard Gere. Many know the story of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and this part is essential when regarding the plot. My qualm is that it feels almost tacked on as an afterthought trotting outside the clear themed borders that the film has laid out so meticulously. This only adds to the ballooning length of the film and so did begin to drag during these Wildwestern plot points. That said this hardly takes away from an experience that is both visceral and enlightening. Comedic and pensive. Wild and tender. A life in all possible senses of the word.910".

	schema:headline " Amazing! Dylan's not there";
	schema:reviewBody "This film amazed me. One reason it worked for me is because it's drenched in Dylan's music. I wasn't expecting that. Most of the time it's Dylan's voice when 'Blind Willie McTell' or 'Moonshiner' or 'Idiot Wind' the slow acoustic version suddenly erupt on the sound track to huge emotional effect. Other times instrumental teasers from 'Man In The Long Black Coat' or 'Nashville Skyline Rag' are planted in the mix like fragments of dreams you can't quite focus on. All the prerelease publicity had revolved around Cate Blanchett is girl Dylan! and Marcus Carl Franklin is African American boy Dylan! but the film itself unfolds like a kaleidoscopic dream where the pieces never quite meet. A bit like me and all my friends scratching our heads in the 1960s and 1970s and earnestly wondering how John Wesley Harding related to Blonde On Blonde or how Slow Train Coming related to Blood On the Tracks. Well they don't. In Chronicles Volume One Dylan dwells on the moment when he stumbled across Rimbaud's declaration Je est un autre which translates into English I is someone else. Dylan writes When I read those words the bells went off. It made perfect sense. I wish someone would have mentioned it to me earlier. That insight has sustained Dylan thru all his multiple personalities finger pointing folkie rock  roll rebel Nashville good ol' boy Oh me oh my love that country pie tormented lover Born Again Christian. When he performed on his first album aged 21 he was trying to summon up the voice of a 60 year old blues singer. That insight sustains this movie because Haynes and his team have been able to match a visual style to each image of Dylan's life. From the burnt out black  white textures of 'Fellini's 8' which seem to lock Blanchett inside an amphetaminefuelled bubble of superstardom to the mellow colour photography of 'McCabe and Mrs Miller' which frames Richard Gere. I was surprised by the long Gere sequence. He seems like a recluse in the backwoods but all these strange characters and circus animals roll past capturing the mood of those bizarre Basement Tape songs 'Please Mrs. Henry' 'Open The Door Homer'. It seems to be set in a realm that Greil Marcus called 'The Old Weird America'. And there's a visionary flash where Gere peers into the landscape and has a glimpse of Vietnam. It made perfect sense to me. There's a moment in the Sing Out! interview with Dylan in 1968 when Dylan was secluded in Woodstock when Happy Traum asked Dylan Why don't you speak out against the Vietnam War? and Dylan replied That really doesn't exist. It's not for or against the war. I'm speaking of a certain painter and he's all for the war. He's ready to go over there himself. And I can comprehend him. People just have their own views. Anyway how do you know that I'm not as you say for the war? When Charlotte Gainsbourg who seems to be playing a composite of Suze Rotolo and Sara Dylan suddenly drops the divorce settlement into Heath Ledger's lap the film cuts to newsreel shots of Henry Kissinger and Lo Duc Tho signing the Vietnam ceasefire accords in Paris. This film isn't a biopic this film works in a free association surreal way like Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again or Highlands works. It's true to the spirit of one of Dylan's greatest songs a song which goes places where no words can go a song which gives this film its title Now when I keep believing I was born to love her But she knows that the kingdom waits so high above her And I run but I race but it's not too fast or slow But I don't deceive her. I'm not there I'm gone...".

Cate Blanchett really nails the role except that her voice obviously can't hit the same bass as the real Bob Dylan. She does however look creepily like Dylan in many instances and really gets the mannerisms right. Christian Bale is another standout. It should be mentioned that all of the performances are really topnotch nobody falls short. The music was fantastic too obviously. My one complaint would be that the film goes on a bit longer than it probably needs to but not enough to affect my overall score. I floated out of the theater after seeing this one. It is definitely essential for all Dylan fans. Many of the people I saw the film with were not very familiar with Dylan's life or music but they said they enjoyed it as well. See it the day it comes out!".

Blanchett plays an incarnation of Dylan that would be right around the time of Don't Look Back.Although I think Todd Haynes is mostly successful here I fear that this will be a film that will really interest people who already know about Bob Dylan and that it will sort of fly over the heads of everyone else.

Inevitably I'm Not There ended up running about a half an hour too long something that could have been easily ignored except for how ultimately exhausting the movie is.

One particular point about Bob Dylan that should be noted and that this movie places emphasis on is his desire to evade classification.

Oh dear and I have to say I'm glad I was there  even if Bob Dylan wasn't.The muchpublicised overly rehashed concept driving the film is this Dylan is portrayed by six actors of different races ages and genders none of whom are named Dylan but represent aspects of his personality and life story. Every arthouse buff will squeal at this delightfully offkilter concept well except that it's been done before  but never used so cleverly I'll admit. But the cleverness of the concept only remains clever if it is executed well. This is where most people have a problem with the film.Most of what you may have read in reviews is correct. The film is challenging borderline plotless unless you are generally acquainted with Dylan's life and seems muddled again only if you don't have a general knowledge of his life. For anyone who can't grasp the basic each actor represents a stage etc. concept this film will be lost on them completely... because it gets even more complicated! The film is so layered with hidden injokes and snippets of real quotes from songs and interviews with Dylan used as dialogue and story lines within story lines. A great example is Heath Ledger's character Ledger an actor plays an actor playing Jack Rollins in a biopic who is the representation of folksingerDylan a stage. An actor in a biopic playing an actor in a biopic about a singer representing Bob Dylan played by an actor in a biopic. The selfparody is just hilarious in this film.To add to these 'layers' each actor's stage that they represent is filmed in a distinctive cinematic style for example the Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn representing Bob Dylan sequence is shot in lush black and white. Haynes relishes this opportunity to show off and he does. The film is stylistically stimulating even if it does drag sometimes for ignoramuses like me who know literally nothing about Bob Dylan.For those questioning the film's intentions as a biopic I should think it was really obvious! The opening credits give a huge clue as the main title comes up in stages I He I'm he I'm her Not her Not here I'm not there.The film is like a dream you come out of it with this vague exact details in the film are scarce and vivid impression of Dylan's personality without learning anything. The title is certainly relevant  Haynes' actually conceals Dylan in this film! This biopic is conventional in the way it still presents a chronological life story if you arrange it all together and remember the actors represent one person but it is different in the way it doesn't try to make a real person into a character for a film. This is really the only way to represent someone  by not.This film is composed of stories and individual representations and metaphors that describe a person's life their attitudes at points in time and aspects of their personality but gives us nothing. Absolutely nothing.So if you're ready to put the level of effort and concentration required to appreciate and maybe like the film go for it. But I was not prepared for this film and I wish I'd read a biography before I saw it. That said not knowing anything did help in a way as after we had several questions about events in the film and their basis in reality. After all the trailer had told us that stories were exaggerated fictionalised imagined and true. It inspired me enough to look him up on Wikipedia I know such dedication!.The performances are all generally good. Blanchett Bale and Franklin impressed me the most. Blanchett only falls short because of her voice but she has the accent correct and she can't change her voice that much! She became more believable as the film progressed. Charlotte Gainsbourg is also quietly moving in her role as the neglected wife of Ledger's character.My final opinion is that the film is well executed but only once you've had time to ruminate on it research Dylan and hear the director's thoughts on his own work. I read a great deal of reviews as well that helped me to understand not that I didn't like the film initially I liked it after I saw it anyway. Appreciation builds the more I learn about the film and the intricate connections between it and it's unsubject.That said should a film be this much hard work just to like? Not for some people but for others the effort is worth it. It does eventually pay off but it's exhausting.".

For the unenlightened Mr. Dylan was famous long ago for playing electric violins on desolation row. The film by writerdirector Todd Haynes is excellent but inaccessible. And strangely if you know anything about the subject you're going to learn approximately nothing knew. To help navigate there were four main Dylans FIRST and famedmostly Dylan was a Rock Star. This period is played out by Cate Blanchett as Jude Quinn. This character sports a fictitious name but like much of the movie comes not from McCartney's Jude but obviously from Dylan's oeuvre  the Christian Jude and Quinn the Eskimo. This Dylan has the clearest Beginning and End points of any. He was born when startling his folk audience by going electric guitar and dies in a motorcycle accident at the peak of his fame.SECOND most famous and highly influential Dylan was the Folk Singer replaced by the above. Here it's Christian Bale as Jack Rollins. This Dylan was quite popular on his own but was much covered by other folk artists and rock bands. During this time Dylan was more like a very big cult and his songs were more widely heard when other people made hit records from them. The songs were more Political protest during this time getting vague later with exceptions like Hurricane.THIRD time around for Dylan was his Cowboy persona essayed herein by Richard Gere and named Billy the Kid after the outlaw antihero Dylan playacted. This was the Dylan emerging after the motorcycle accident. Dylan left a bunch of unreleased tracks known as The Basement Tapes and reinvented himself as a more countrified mellow rocker listen to Lay Lady Lay. Here the stages of Dylan's art become more blurred as he no longer commanded the attention he did earlier.FOURTH biggest change after a long run without defining boundaries was the Born Again or Christian Dylan. This startled some people but as the film points out it shouldn't have been unexpected. In fact the FameDrugsJesus continuum is very common among music stars as anyone watching MTV's 1990s biographies could plainly see. For this film Mr. Bale uniquely plays two Dylan incarnations revising his earlier Folk Singer character Jack Rollins to become Pastor John. BUT that's not all. There are three less public parts of the quadraphonic Dylan covered by Mr. Haynes FIRST is Dylan's mysterious boyhood masquerade as Woody Guthrie played by Marcus Carl Franklin. He is the kid on the train sporting the FascistKillingGuitarintheWest. Of course Woody Guthrie was a real person and he had a tremendous influence on Dylan. While cute and well done this section is not revelatory which could be why the film project had the real Bob Dylan's blessing. The real Dylan who appears briefly near the end did not appreciate biographers peeking into his personal history.SECOND is Dylan The Poet named Arthur Rimbaud and played by Ben Whishaw. Like the above but more of a conglomerate the character is a real French poet named Arthur Rimbaud who influenced Dylan and many other rock stars. The Dylans are presented in sort of an overlapping chronological order  which may not make sense to the uninitiated  but this one is used more like a muse for the others accentuating Dylan's reputation as a true Tarantula of a Poet even without the music.THIRD and perhaps most esoteric is Dylan The Actor played by Heath Ledger as Robbie Clark. Dylan did do some movies. Mortals do not forgive. Even an epic focusing in his relationship with a certain sadeyed of the lowlands. Rather than show Dylan acting in a movie this Actor section perversely shows the more camerashy Dylan. It seems highly fictitious but you've got to appreciate Dylan telling what looks like Patti Smith chicks can never be poets. ! And I Want You is a terrific vignette. In sum I'm Not There is an excellent film for obvious believers with minus zero insight into its subject. Bobby Zimmerman could hardly disapprove. By the way the fact that the vinyl Stuck Inside of Mobile with the was amusingly continued in the Blonde on Blonde gatefold jacket as Memphis Blues Again is no excuse to edit the song. And changing the lyric Here is your 'throat' back thanks for the loan... to Here is your 'mouth' back thanks for the loan... really sucks. Moreover it's sacrilege.

Perhaps even Bob himself dreaming about the course of his life. The more you do know about what's out there about Bob the more you'll be able to make the connections with the scenes in this beautiful montage about the poet songwriter and musician genius of the last 60 plus years. This is a great film about a very complicated artist who could never be pinned down as representing any one ideology or persona although he seemed to imply many. I suppose Dylan will always be the great enigma and this film only helps to perpetuate it which is part of what makes it so successful but as we all now know there's no success like failure and failure's no success at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Todd Haynes' I'm Not There is a genuinely visionary work of art ostensibly a biopic of Bob Dylan Haynes has actually made seven different short movies each with its own precise cinematic language which have then been carefully interwoven to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. I won't bother rehashing the film's central conceit and plot which have been extensively commented on elsewhere. I will say that the misguided reviewers who praise the Cate Blanchett portion of the movie above the others wonderful though her performance is are missing Haynes' point entirely. Each of the different segments of I'm Not There inform and comment on each other in ways that are sometimes direct and sometimes oblique but there is ALWAYS a logic to the overall structure. For someone to say that they would have preferred a movie entirely about Blanchett as Dylan is tantamount to saying that they would have preferred a more traditional Dylan biopic in the manner of Ray or Walk the Line. This traditional biopic formula is precisely what Haynes is trying to explode and the Richard Gere segment of the film the most critically maligned portion of the movie by far is where he succeeds in his strategy the most!Despite what many critics have written it is not Christian Bale as the bornagain Dylan who portrays the oldest incarnation of the Dylan character. It's Richard Gere as Billy the Kid. What Haynes seems to be saying is that Billy the Kid should have been gunned down in his youth by Patt Garrett but has miraculously lived to grow old  just as Dylan should have died in a motorcycle accident in 1966 yet is still on tour today at age 66. Viewed in this light each of the younger versions of Dylan can be seen as the memories of Gere's Dylanasaging outlaw. While it is true that Gere's segment also has ties to the Basement Tapesera Dylan the fact that Billy is also supposed to represent Dylan in the 21st century is crucial. Without this understanding the interaction between Billy the Kid and Woody Guthrie the completion of a circle of life makes no sense. No wonder critics are flummoxed at the Gere portion of the movie! This is the kind of film that makes you grateful to be living in the present when a genuinely daring and extremely talented filmmaker like Haynes can use the resources of Hollywood and bend them to his will to create something that is at once experimental radical challenging funny moving and yes finally liberating. I'm Not There leaves the rest of contemporary American cinema in the dust.".

The cast is heterogeneous and solid but I think critics are overrating Cate Blanchett for the sheer fact that she's playing a man which makes things more challenging for her indeed when she's not really better than most of the cast a good performance for sure but I was much more impressed by Christian Bale and the young revelation Marcus Carl Franklin. Julianne Moore Charlotte Gainsbourg and Michelle Williams play some important women from Dylan's life and the always underrated Bruce Greenwood has a small but interesting part. All in all this isn't a film that will enjoy big commercial success and it's probably too artsy although not in a bad way to get the Academy's top prize even though Blanchett's performance and maybe Haynes's magnificent directingwriting will probably be remembered but it's a real gem for those who want to see something really exciting and original. As for myself I'm thankful to Haynes and his audacious faithful producer Christine Vachon this woman rocks and in a perfect world she'd have all the money that a certain Jerry Bruckheimer possesses who always dare to blow us away  something rare these days.

By abstracting from a conventional biopic the film captures the essence of Dylan. The different actors that play Dylan chronicle the metamorphosis of an icon. With an astounding ensemble the performances are flawless. Cate Blanchett in particular is uncanny as Dylan at the peak of his stardom in all likelihood securing a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Technically the editing is seamless and Haynes is successfully able to integrate a multitude of styles. In emulating Dylan the film itself is structured much like a poem. Haynes strings together fact and fiction the real and surreal and the self and society into a magnificent fabric that illustrates the identity of one of the greatest American icons.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm Not There 2007So startling in its invention so beautiful and stunning the photography and acting and so appropriate for its subject Bob Dylan why does it not quite hold water?Don't get me wrong I love the movie the music and Cate Blanchett equally. It has an extraordinary logic to its many many parts as well making not only a fanciful downright surreal patchwork of a movie but a reasonable commentary on the true life Dylan. I could and will watch it again.If you don't know much about Bob Dylan or don't like his music I have to say the odds are against you here. If there ever was a movie filled with references many of them highly symbolic and distant veiled even this is it. Even if you like Dylan you might find it hard to follow so you need to enjoy just sitting back and going for the ride. I'm not sure getting stoned first would help in this case because it's so disorienting at times.Advice for the uninitiated? Read a quick bio of Dylan Wikipedia might work and get a sense of at least these core moments 1 he visited Woody Guthrie on his death bed and was playing folk songs in a traditional vein 2 he modernized when he moved to the Village still keeping the folk sound with edgy new lyrics and this is when he met Joan Baez 3 he shocked everyone when he went electric at a folk festival actually at Newport 4 he was in a near fatal motorcycle accident in 1966 5 he took on a cowboy persona for his 1967 album John Wesley Harding. That should help with some orientation for the different characters and scenes.For those who are right for the film including no doubt the director Todd Haynes who got Dylan's approval for the project ahead of time this will be a memorable experience.".

The movie makes use of 'cut scene' transitions and effects of the same quality and caliber as those that come bundled with a mediocre digital camera to help compound its stink.

You really have to chafe at what passes for cinematic art and dream of the next film the one that will do for us what 8 12 did then.

The lack of gore and cheap scares is a good thing as it allows you to focus on the story and characters.Most of the acting was OK but the lead actress was more wooden than an ironing board. I've seriously never seen such expressionless acting in my life. Even situations that would make the average person scream their head off didn't seem to phase this girl at all. I know she was messed up in the head due to the trauma so who knows how she would react to things but the acting was so bad I found it offensive. It was like she begrudged being there at all. The story wasn't so bad it was quite sad in the end but I won't be recommending this to anyone nor will I be watching anything else with this horrendous actress in it.".

Plagued by visions and a sense that her sister was buried alive she begins to search for clues as to what happened seven years before.This one came out of left field for me. I have vague notions about hearing about the film but I never really remember seeing or hearing anything about it. I'm pretty sure that helped my enjoyment of the film since I had no preconceived notions for it.Looking like TV movie with interiors that remind one more of a set than of a real place this film over comes its limitations and occasional WTF moment to play out almost as if its an extended Tales from the Darkside or other similar horror anthology show. Odd shifts in perspective some genuine creepy but not too in your face imagery and willingness to go sans blood and guts except as required make this pretty much a throw back to the old days of horror when less is more. Its not perfect but even with its flaws and the following of a well worn path at times this still manages to be a solid little thriller of the B variety.Worth a rental with a bag of popcorn and a soda.Though don't buy this just yet its a bare bones release that they want almost 30 dollars list for too much for too little".

I liked how the heroine actually investigates quite a bit throughout the movie instead of just getting the conclusions laid out for her in front of her eyes. Additionally the film doesn't use too many flashy cheap shock moments and successfully tries to depend more on the mystery itself. And contrary to the clich the heroine doesn't behave exceptionally stupid all the time.On the downside you won't have many surprises coming in the story if you've seen at least a few mystery thrillers. The ending actually managed to satisfy me a feat rarely achieved by that genre of movies.If you like mystery thrillers and always thought that those loud noisy in your face shock moments are overused you should try this movie.".

Director Dagen Merrill does his best to bring the frights but he's heavy handed in execution while the cheapness of the production unfortunately stands out a mile.

Such films have propped up the Hollywood film industry since the 1970s and BENEATH proves to be a familiar and depressingly poor addiction to that genre.

Nora Zehetner BRICK makes a game effort as the heroine but she can't do much with the alltoofamiliar material. The worst part of the film is the flashy direction which is so clichd as to be unbelievable all sudden jump cuts during the socalled 'scare sequences' flashes of people writhing in beds and the like.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS An honest life ends in a peaceful death Proverb.Beneath is a horror flick released straight to video and marks the directorial debut of Dagen Merrill cowritten with Kevin Burke who also wrote 2003's Tahiti an indie drama that earned some critical praise.Christy Wescot Nora Zehetner Brick is a 20yearold premed student who cannot fully live her own life since her older sister Vanessa Carly Pope Sandra Goes to Whistler was killed in a car accident six years earlier in which Christy was driving. Give me the wheel! Christy! could have been the last words she remembers from her sister who was also a young mother and the wife of John Locke Matthew Settle a local doctor in the town of Edgemont.The sudden death of family caretaker Joseph Don S. Davis prompts a phone call from John to Christy informing her that the funeral services will be held next Saturday. This phone call releases the latent anxiety Christy has been suppressing for the past six years. So when Christy jumps aboard a bus she's already been fired from her job and is in need of antidepressants for a diagnosed borderline personality disorder spurred by her guilt over her sister's injuries. Why did you go away? her niece Amy Jessica Amlee asks her. Christy sardonically replies I went to prep school University of South California. Now Christy's niece lives in the Locke family home with dad and her grandma the ominous Mrs. Locke Gabrielle Rose whom her cute redhaired granddaughter calls a weirdo and she is indeed since she disappears from the dinner table and prefers to eat alone in her place. Amy is convinced a dark mysterious thing killed good ol' Joseph and that Grandma is mean and secretive. Nora Zehetner maintains a mesmerizing tension from the very beginning. When she contemplates her arrival home to the small town from which she's been disconnected for a long time but has never severed her ties to she does an aweinspiring job of conveying Christy's conflicting emotions. And this is one of the main reasons the film succeeds because its plot devices rely basically on our empathy for the lead character. There are moments that as a viewer we can notice the story would dry up if Christy couldn't find a new clue a new clear thought an accusatory gaze from some of the townspeople who have become strangers to her. She finds it difficult to reconnect with a junior high school friend Debbie Houston Nicola Anderson and the townsfolk try to make her move on. Christy must not only hide the pain of her lonely existence and the hallucinations that plague her she also has to face the humiliation of condescending treatment from the neighbours nurses and cops around her though one of them Jeff Burdan Warren Christie is pretty kind to her his cop pal Randy Patrick Gilmore makes a cruel remark before being introduced to Christy.Christy investigates some circumstances that occurred during the six months of rehabilitation that Vanessa received in Locke's home immediately after the accident a losing battle against a certain death. Christy finds out this rehabilitation took place in a room beneath Locke's house where Vanessa was attended by a nurse named Claire Wells Eliza Norbury whom supposedly left town and moved to Portland Maine. Christy also investigates the details about Vanessa's burial as well as her medical files which are now in private access for John Locke all the while succumbing to near psychotic states when she suffers random seizures that lead her to draw darkly artistic portraits of people and threatening symbols. The laidback manner of the townspeople grate on Christy's nerves as they stubbornly deny her suspicions regarding her sister's death. Christy is constantly perceived as an unstable meddling girl which fits these simpleminded locals struggling in a postmining economy ruled by Locke's dynasty.But as another character says to Christy at the beginning of the story Death is always hardest on the living. And this obsession with her sister's death makes the heroine's lunatic mind spin frantically like a profaned coffin. It lives in my walls. I hear it crying. I take pictures 'cause I can't draw Amy says.Passageways designed for escaping the mines locked entrances insectsplagued basements will confuse us as much as they confuse Christy in her confused mental state the film is soaked with the romantic timeless beauty of Nora Zehetner whose performance as an isolated young woman with a precipitous imagination elicits our innate sympathy and conquers our hearts in the end. Zehetner's Poelike heroine maybe is a paraphrenic without love life but she's the last voice standing against the apathy and lack of conscience that the town represents. Christy awakens our sedated morals defending her right to unmask her tortured soul a beautiful vulnerable but never weak Miss Lonely in the land of guilt. httpjakeweird.blogspot.com200708beneath.html".

Davis prompts a phone call from John to Christy informing her that the funeral services will be held next Saturday. This phone call releases the latent anxiety Christy has been suppressing for the past six years. So when Christy jumps aboard a bus she's already been fired from her job and is in need of antidepressants for a diagnosed borderline personality disorder spurred by her guilt over her sister's injuries. Why did you go away? her niece Amy Jessica Amlee asks her. Christy sardonically replies I went to prep school University of South California. Now Christy's niece lives in the Locke family home with dad and her grandma the ominous Mrs. Locke Gabrielle Rose whom her cute redhaired granddaughter calls a weirdo and she is indeed since she disappears from the dinner table and prefers to eat alone in her place. Amy is convinced a dark mysterious thing killed good ol' Joseph and that Grandma is mean and secretive. Nora Zehetner maintains a mesmerizing tension from the very beginning. When she contemplates her arrival home to the small town from which she's been disconnected for a long time but has never severed her ties to she does an aweinspiring job of conveying Christy's conflicting emotions. And this is one of the main reasons the film succeeds because its plot devices rely basically on our empathy for the lead character. There are moments that as a viewer we can notice the story would dry up if Christy couldn't find a new clue a new clear thought an accusatory gaze from some of the townspeople who have become strangers to her. She finds it difficult to reconnect with a junior high school friend Debbie Houston Nicola Anderson and the townsfolk try to make her move on. Christy must not only hide the pain of her lonely existence and the hallucinations that plague her she also has to face the humiliation of condescending treatment from the neighbours nurses and cops around her though one of them Jeff Burdan Warren Christie is pretty kind to her his cop pal Randy Patrick Gilmore makes a cruel remark before being introduced to Christy.Christy investigates some circumstances that occurred during the six months of rehabilitation that Vanessa received in Locke's home immediately after the accident a losing battle against a certain death. Christy finds out this rehabilitation took place in a room beneath Locke's house where Vanessa was attended by a nurse named Claire Wells Eliza Norbury whom supposedly left town and moved to Portland Maine. Christy also investigates the details about Vanessa's burial as well as her medical files which are now in private access for John Locke all the while succumbing to near psychotic states when she suffers random seizures that lead her to draw darkly artistic portraits of people and threatening symbols. The laidback manner of the townspeople grate on Christy's nerves as they stubbornly deny her suspicions regarding her sister's death. Christy is constantly perceived as an unstable meddling girl which fits these simpleminded locals struggling in a postmining economy ruled by Locke's dynasty.But as another character says to Christy at the beginning of the story Death is always hardest on the living. And this obsession with her sister's death makes the heroine's lunatic mind spin frantically like a profaned coffin. It lives in my walls. I hear it crying. I take pictures 'cause I can't draw Amy says.Passageways designed for escaping the mines locked entrances insectsplagued basements will confuse us as much as they confuse Christy in her confused mental state the film is soaked with the romantic timeless beauty of Nora Zehetner whose performance as an isolated young woman with a precipitous imagination elicits our innate sympathy and conquers our hearts in the end. Zehetner's Poelike heroine maybe is a paraphrenic without love life but she's the last voice standing against the apathy and lack of conscience that the town represents. Christy awakens our sedated morals defending her right to unmask her tortured soul a beautiful vulnerable but never weak Miss Lonely in the land of guilt. httpjakeweird.blogspot.com200708beneath.html";

It should have been a simple haunted house movie. Christy could stay with the Lockes and forced to stay to save Amy. That's what I assumed it was going for when she has her hallucinations in the house. Then she gets friends has cops and flashbacks to the hospital. It's trying to be a shocking story and it does have a great twist. The big Vanessa twist is completely predictable and tiresome as the reveal gets stretched out. The Amy twist is the much better one.

The acting was great and quite believable.The storyline was also good. You have a woman who goes home to the location of a horrible car accident that has traumatized her in order to make sense of life. They did a good job letting the audience get to know the main character as well as other main characters. The flaw in the storyline is there is no explanation for her supernatural ability to see what her sister has seen. I wish they would've explained that in more detail.This movie did not trigger a lot of emotion for me but it was entertaining nonetheless.

	schema:reviewBody "Well... after reading the last comment in here about saying the best movie 2007 so far... i felt disappointed on how the low critic appeal the IMDb reviewers have. This movie is not even far from being better than anything.I will say the plot was a little weak. The story about this girl searching for a truth about what happened to her sister its the typical story at its most. The plot from the beginning was leading to something good but later it started to being a little misplaced. It don't have any form the plot. The thing here is this story has something very special but if you read it like it were on a book would be a great book. But this kind of weird plot with no sense of direction during and at the most end does not work right for being a film.First when you have a good idea do it. This was a good idea but this were the thing that do not work for this film. The plot leads the mystery and a not so common way to approach the lead character. That was cool about this movie. Then they come the why this person is like this. Very well told that part but then the plot starts to spread all over. It was good to keep mystery but they do not lead to a very hard spot. They try it to make you thing some weird things during the mystery that keeps you very near the screen but then you start to know what will happened next. And to try to confuse you they use the black outs thing. And then you finally reach to understand all and then... SURPRISE! the plot leads to a very spread thing with no sense at all for what the movie try the characters to go on. But this not matter that point its a good thing about the plot.Then the characters. They were well told and for my amaze well acted but of course they look like all of them were a little amateur yet. The lead character does a good act but she as an actor does not looked very convinced about her paper. But all the rest of the actors seemed to be with their papers. That was a bad point for her as an actor but she make a good work because she manage to stand in front of the other actors.Then the sound well placed and gives you some jumps in the seat once in a wile. But what amaze me was the quality of the SOUNDTRACK the music has some reminiscence from soundtracks from games like SILENT HILL and could make a very good environment to place you in the movie but to be honest that was the best part of it. The locations were very good but the director did not manage to make them look well.The worst was the director common shots. Camera boring and did not manage to make a good story a GREAT one. Instead he make it mediocre. He try it to make you being scared for nothing and could make the lights and filters coordinate to make a very scary place for the locations... and in the way you know the characters its not the way that the plot wants. The director could not connect himself with the story and could not make it in a way this movie could be better.I hope my English is well enough to tell a good critic about this nice movie and i give it a 510 because everyone put a good effort in the making of this but the director couldn't make it work to be a very good movie.".

Only towards the end does Beneath manage to create some tension but it's too little too late. The ending was an interesting mess making me wonder if they were unsure how to round it all off.Ultimately Beneath isn't likely to scare horror fans though a younger crowd may find it satisfying. The film is well made for being a straighttoDVD release and everyone involved seem to have contributed the best they could. It looks alright and it kept my attention throughout.

Willie Stark is honest and brave. He's also a knownothing hick whose schoolteacher wife has given him what little education he has. Stark loses the race for treasurer but later makes his way through law school becoming an idealistic attorney who fights for what is good. Someone in the governor's employ remembers Stark when the governor needs a patsy to run against him and split the vote of his rival.

She was a great actress one of the most intense females I've ever seen on film. I'm sorry she didn't achieve stardom and make more movies than she did. She certainly had the talent. In fact she won an Academy Award for this performance.John Ireland also does very well here as another person helping Willie.

There's a scene in which Mercedes McCambridge enters the hotel room in which John Ireland has been cooped up for four days in a depressed state. Whew lots of smoke she says. And lots of whiskey. The scene is almost perfectly staged with Ireland crumpled on the bed in the foreground and reaching for his liquor out of the frame while McCambridge busies herself emptying ash trays in the background and staring at her face in the mirror. Smallpox she says. She's not nearly as attractive as Crawford's new girl friend JoAnne Dru nee Joanne Letitia LaCock a name that could have come straight out of Andy Warhol's Factory.

He was never Hollwyoodhandsome with those squished up eyes that deep hole between them and that protruding nose beneath.But the honors really should go to Mercedes McCambridge. Robert Rossen the director allows her a few seconds here and there to be unique. When Ireland slaps her face hard she doesn't cry.

And that little speech about smallpox as she compares her face in the mirror to the glamorized portrait of Joanne Dru.I won't go on I don't think. If you haven't seen this you really ought to.

But when I saw the remake I was kinda scared to see this version due to the fact that maybe I was just not into the story but it turned out to not only be a good film but a great one that had no need to be a remake almost 60 years later.Willie Stark is a crooked lawyer who decides to run for senator swearing up and down the people that he is just like them and making crazy promises he gets elected and finds that it's harder than he realized to keep those promises. Things start to fall apart more and more when his son gets into some serious trouble causing bad press the people are not satisfied with his duties and his marriage begins to fall apart as well eventually leading up to a horrific ending to his term when he is threatened with impeachment.All the King's Men the original is a great movie that I would recommend for the classic lovers. The remake trust me it isn't worth watching but in some sick way I am grateful for it because I would have never had the opportunity to see this film. We have terrific performances and a great story that anyone could get into not to mention the Oscar praise it got was well deserved.

	schema:reviewBody "While I admit that CITIZEN KANE portrays the corruption of power better than any motion picture ever made let's also be fair because any Hollywood movie will suffer when compared with it.  A more appropriate comparison would be the recent docudrama of Huey Long KINGFISH.  While John Goodman is excellent as Long and the movie worthwhile it reveals just how good a film ALL THE KING'S MEN is.Of course Robert Rossen's picture has a drab look.  It should. It suggests the drab appearance of most U.S. states anyone who has visited Kansas will know why Dorothy and L. Frank Baum wanted to go over the rainbow and the use of common townsfolk rather than Hollywood extras adds to this look as do the drab locations check out something like the Marlon Brando movie THE CHASE a movie that should have a drab look but instead looks like a glossy Hollywood backlot.  Thank God Columbia a studio that loved locations because it had no back lot financed this movie!  I wouldn't call this film realistic but I've read the pulitzer prize winning novel and I wouldn't call it realistic either.  Every page brims with beautifully poetic language which the movie often incorporates and which Rossen makes sound more like natural conversation than it really is. Compared to the book the film I think reveals its real weaknesses it does simplify moral issues and also reduces some of the characters to the level of melodrama Willie Stark in the novel resembles more someone like Andy Griffith's character in A FACE IN THE CROWD a charming good ole boy you want to love but who will knife you in the back the next minute. Broderick Crawford with his Bronx accent hardly suggests either a hayseed or as he calls himself a hick but he has a bullying power that I think is brilliant for the role.  Personally I'm glad neither Spencer Tracy nor John Wayne both of whom Rossen wanted got the part.And I think this movie holds up very well even in our postWatergate era of cynical politics  like the novel it shows how the populist leader can easily be a tyrant.  This message is not in CITIZEN KANE the lofty Kane was never one of the people he just wanted to be one of the people. Considering how much Hollywood in the era of Harry Truman embraced the populist sentiment with the films of John Ford and Frank Capra considering that dictators like a Hitler and a Stalin like to present themselves as one of the people and enjoyed popular support considering how much Americans love politicians who are charming rather than substantial I'd say Rossen's film hasn't dated at all.".

	schema:headline " Classic Film But Not The Real Life of Huey Long";
	schema:reviewBody "Broderick Crawford always said that the greatest thing about winning the Oscar and the acclaim that goes with it for his performance of Willie Stark was that it broadened his casting potential. For a dozen years or so he played nothing but dumb henchmen and sidekicks to various star. He was quoted as saying he was not the world's greatest wit but he hated always playing half a one. Though he eventually returned back to the ranks of featured performers the Oscar for Best Actor in 1949 assured him better roles the rest of his life. Of course Crawford's Oscar was not the only one that the film got. It was also the Best Picture of 1949 and in her screen debut Mercedes McCambridge got the Best Supporting Actress nod. McCambridge was maybe the toughest woman ever portrayed on film so far a hard nosed political operative who's carrying an empress size torch for Crawford who can't see her in that way at all.As I said before All the King's Men though suggested by the life of Huey Long is not that life at all. Willie Stark is his own unique character. For one thing the unnamed state that All the King's Men took place in is not necessarily the American south. If it were you might see a black face or two in the film. Huey Long in his rise to power in Louisiana used economic populism in his rise to power. He did not like the race issue felt it was not the future for the south. In that he was far seeing but if he had to Long could race bait with the best.Do you remember in Streetcar Named Desire Tennessee Williams has Stanley Kowalski reference Huey Long by telling Stella and Blanche in no uncertain terms like Huey Long says he's king in his own castle. Streetcar is set in New Orleans and Williams well knew the power of the Long name in Louisiana. Secondly Stark's family consists of his wife adopted son and father who lives with them. Or rather lives on the old homestead as Stark decides that plain Jane Anne Seymour ain't quite what he needs for a first lady of the state. Although Huey Long was not a model husband to Rose McConnell Long he never would have thought of divorcing her and leaving her with their three children for a nanosecond. Long's family also consisted of a lot of brothers eight in fact. Huey's brother Earl was three times Governor of Louisiana and his life story is told in the film Blaze with Paul Newman and Lolita Davidovitch. Huey's son Russell unlike being a crippled football hero as John Derek is here was elected at the age of 30 to the United States Senate in 1948 after World War II service with admittedly not any qualifications other than his name. But that name in Louisiana is to this day mighty potent and Russell Long had a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate for over 40 years. In fact when Huey was assassinated in 1935 and Rose McConnell Long received a temporary appointment to fill his seat the Long family established a unique record of father mother and child to serve in the U.S. Senate. And a bunch of Long brothers and other relatives held various elective posts in Louisiana for generations.Like Long however Stark is a self made man with an all consuming passion to get ahead in life. He was born in the most humble of circumstances to a piney woods sharecropper family and lifted himself up to be Governor of his state with national ambitions. And like Long Stark establishes a political machine in his state that bordered on fascism.Which is why the novel by Robert Penn Warren sold so well in 1947. Maybe it took a war with fascism to educate the American public as to exactly what Huey Long might have represented in the Thirties. Didn't matter in Louisiana though because Earl Long was elected in 1948 to one of his terms as governor as was Russell to the Senate.All the King's Men entertains us with a fascination for the characters created by Warren and brought to the screen so vividly by Director Robert Rossen. The whole film is narrated and seen through the eyes of John Ireland who as a reporter discovered Stark running for local office in his backwoods county. Ireland was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor in what was probably his career role but lost to Dean Jagger for Twelve O'Clock High.At the time he was married to Joanne Dru who is also in the film and she was grateful to not be doing another western. She plays Ireland's love who later falls for Stark. As Henry Kissinger said about his romantic success power is the ultimate aphrodisiac and I think Rossen was trying to prove it here. She got her career role here as did her brother Sheppard Strudwick who alone sees Stark for what he is.It will be interesting to see if the new version of All the King's Men measures up to this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "Broderick Crawford always said that the greatest thing about winning the Oscar and the acclaim that goes with it for his performance of Willie Stark was that it broadened his casting potential. For a dozen years or so he played nothing but dumb henchmen and sidekicks to various star. He was quoted as saying he was not the world's greatest wit but he hated always playing half a one. Though he eventually returned back to the ranks of featured performers the Oscar for Best Actor in 1949 assured him better roles the rest of his life. Of course Crawford's Oscar was not the only one that the film got. It was also the Best Picture of 1949 and in her screen debut Mercedes McCambridge got the Best Supporting Actress nod. McCambridge was maybe the toughest woman ever portrayed on film so far a hard nosed political operative who's carrying an empress size torch for Crawford who can't see her in that way at all.As I said before All the King's Men though suggested by the life of Huey Long is not that life at all. Willie Stark is his own unique character. For one thing the unnamed state that All the King's Men took place in is not necessarily the American south. If it were you might see a black face or two in the film. Huey Long in his rise to power in Louisiana used economic populism in his rise to power.

	schema:reviewBody "All the King's Men was a gutsy film in its day and wonder of wonders it still plays this way after all these years. It's probably with the exception of Beat the Devil the most ragged film to ever achieve classic status. Directed by Robert Rossen adapted from a novel by Robert Penn Warren and strikingly photographed in cinema verite style by Burnett Guffey it tells the story of the rise and fall of a Huey Longlike politician who starts out as a good guy if a bit of a bully and winds up a very bad guy and even more of a bully as he takes political control of his state.There are dozens of things wrong with the movie. It feels rushed as if edited down from a much longer film. The editing creates an uncomfortable jarring effect that makes it difficult at times not only to watch the movie but to follow it. It has some dreadful acting among many of its major players while several of the smaller roles are quite well cast with interesting faces which creates a tantalizing effect as if the good stuff the interesting inside dope stuff that we really want to know about is too hot for the movie to handle so we have to settle for a glance a gesture a heavy overcoat and draw our conclusions accordingly. There's a cheap look to the film not only in scenes where things are supposed to look shabby like ramshackle farmhouses but in the mansions of the rich and the governor's office. Nor is there much specificity in the movie. In the novel the state was clearly Southern while in the movie it could just as well be California or Illinois. And the frenetic pace of the film seems tied to the staccato delivery of Broderick Crawford in the leading role as if Crawford himself had produced directed and written the movie to fit his personal idiosyncrasies like a glove.As luck would have it these 'wrong' things make All the King's Men work better than a smoother fancier more refined approach could ever have done. Its newsreel intensity makes it feel real. The bad performances by relatively unknown actors likewise gives their characters the effect of being actual people who after all don't always behave or speak as they ought to. In the unattractive sets we see things that look like life rather than movie life as rich men's homes are not always pleasing to behold and state capitals and court houses often have a rundown look. Brod Crawford plays his role as a grade B heavy with perhaps a scintilla more charm and his bullnecked King Of Alcatraz style of acting suits his character well and if one finds Crawford too typically a Hollywood bad guy I recommend the documentary film Point Of Order in which Sen. Joe McCarthy with no dramatic training whatsoever could well be Crawford's soulmate or at the very least his brother.Why do these elements work so well in All the King's Men and not in other movies where a mess is just a mess? I think the political nature of the film made it controversial from the getgo. It probably was severely edited to take out 'offensive' material i.e. anything that might appear to reflect badly on an actual person. The quick driving pace gives the film at times the sensibility of a tabloid certainly not Rossen's intent but luckily this let'sripthelidoffofeverything feeling that the movie just naturally has suggests perhaps an even deeper problem at the core of its story than just one crazy man's ambitions gone wild and as a result the film is in many places suggestive and seems profound when what lies behind this impression is perhaps a deliberate vagueness on the part of Rosson  Co. which in turn forces the viewer to try to sort things out for himself using the movie as a series of signposts and what results is a more profound experience than the film itself the film one plays in one's mind.".

Turning point is the cemetery scene when one of the attendees seeks divine forgiveness for not having voted for Willie.The turning moment was not unlike Michael Corelone saying I'm with you Pop when the Godfather was in the hospital. Michael did not mean physical proximity but that he then bought into the business.In both cases the storyline is a reminder about Power and Corruption.Like most movies made from books there were some changes that did detract from the story no where in the movie do we learn that the Judge is Jack Burden's father  yet that is so important.

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed this film for the first time this past week. It was one of only a few Best Picture Oscar winners over the past fifty or sixty years that I had not previously seen. I have found most but not all of these films to be absorbing andor entertaining with the majority deserving of the awards they received. I included this specific film in a personal test that I conducted recently. I initially viewed the current version of this film which features an impressive cast headed up by Sean Penn Jude Law Kate Winslet and Anthony Hopkins. Then I rented this 1949 award winner to compare both versions.I am aware that when you first see a film or program that you find to be an excellent presentation and then you view a newer version of the same entity the normal tendency is to find the new version not up to the standards of the original due to the unfairly high expectations. For the test conducted I switched viewing order of the two versions. I anticipated finding the newer version more rewarding due to the more than half century difference in the two presentations and the fact that Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins have each artistically created several roles which I have found to be top of the line performances. It did not work out that way in this case. I found the 1949 version withstood the test of time and in my opinion was the superior production. This had to do with several factors the primary one being that the screen play of the older version seemed to be better paced and the presentation flowed more evenly. I believe this version more closely followed the novel and the depiction of the central character Willie Stark. The novel loosely based this character on real life Louisiana politician Huey Long. I concluded that the newer version tried to capture more of Longs' character along with his political successes and failures. In doing so it lost some of the novels flow and impact.Both versions have excellent casts and the performances given by both Sean Penn and Broderick Crawford Oscar winning as Willie Stark are first rate. I consider this version to be a top 25 all time political drama and gave it an 8 out of 10 IMDb rating but I would recommend both versions for fans of semibiographical political dramas.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain subjects that films in general and Hollywood in particular never handled very welland chief among them are politics. But even some fifty years after it first hit theatre screens ALL THE KING'S MEN still has plenty of power. Filmed in a noir style and based on the famous novel which was in turn based loosely on the rise and fall of Louisiana's Huey P. Long the film offers the story of Willie Stark a smalltown lawyer who is nominated for governor by a political party seeking to defeat their opponent by dividing the rural vote. When Willie gets wise to the plot he turns on his false benefactors and rockets to political powerbut once in power the honest smalltownjoe becomes even more corrupt than those who sought to manipulate him for their own gain.Broderick Crawford justly earned an Oscar for his performance as Willie Stark whose ego and thirst for power grows to horrific proportionsand whose corruption gradually taints even the most honorable people around him. The supporting cast of John Ireland Joanne Dru Anne Seymour and Walter Burke to name but a few is also quite good. But the real knockout here is actress Mercedes McCambridge as Willie Stark's hardedged assistant and sometimes lover it is an astonishing performance which in spite of its supporting status remains locked in mind long after the film ends a role for which McCambridge won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.The script doesn't really do full justice to Warren's novel the film is a bit slow to start and the story itself feels a bit dry in the tellingbut the performances and numerous memorable scenes carry it through to tremendous effect. ALL THE KING'S MEN is so explicit in its portrait of how corrupt politicians manipulate the public that it should be required viewing for every one of voting age. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Long the film offers the story of Willie Stark a smalltown lawyer who is nominated for governor by a political party seeking to defeat their opponent by dividing the rural vote. When Willie gets wise to the plot he turns on his false benefactors and rockets to political powerbut once in power the honest smalltownjoe becomes even more corrupt than those who sought to manipulate him for their own gain.Broderick Crawford justly earned an Oscar for his performance as Willie Stark whose ego and thirst for power grows to horrific proportionsand whose corruption gradually taints even the most honorable people around him. The supporting cast of John Ireland Joanne Dru Anne Seymour and Walter Burke to name but a few is also quite good. But the real knockout here is actress Mercedes McCambridge as Willie Stark's hardedged assistant and sometimes lover it is an astonishing performance which in spite of its supporting status remains locked in mind long after the film ends a role for which McCambridge won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.The script doesn't really do full justice to Warren's novel the film is a bit slow to start and the story itself feels a bit dry in the tellingbut the performances and numerous memorable scenes carry it through to tremendous effect. ALL THE KING'S MEN is so explicit in its portrait of how corrupt politicians manipulate the public that it should be required viewing for every one of voting age. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

Clinton selling pardons to raise money for his presidential library  and his long line of cheap floosies. Pick another politician one you don't like same story.However this movie has another message stated by the corrupt politician himself out of evil comes good. That truth is the only thing that makes Democracy work. Even while Broderick Crawford's character was corrupt Nixonian corruption  selling out to protect his own power he still kept his promises roads schools hospitals. He strong armed and blackmailed but he got them built.Yeah Democracy is ugly but no uglier than the human clay it is made out of. As Churchill said 'Democracy is the worst form of all governments  except for everything else.' Sadly 50 years from now someone could again watch this picture and still see their own society mirrored in its images. Thankfully it will still be a great film with solid performances across the board fast pacing and good writing. There's no wasted motion in this picture.Hopefully 50 years from now good will still come out of evil. However there is one other truth if there is too much evilno good will come out of it. Let's hope there's never too much of it here in America......".

	schema:headline " Poor Man's Citizen Kane...";
	schema:reviewBody "For any movie buff the simple thought of putting All the King's Men on the same level than Citizen Kane is a blasphemy but I'm not afraid to say it once you see both movies you realize how much they have in common and how sometimes the humblest All the King's Men slightly beats Orson Welles' masterpiece in its portrayal of power's corruptive effect. So the title might sound derogatory but it's not meant that way.Citizen Kane was about a man with guts and vision who got so alienated by his obsession to be the voice of people that he ultimately lost his touch with people and ended up miserably with no connection whatsoever with his cherished past. He was misunderstood but he had it coming. All the King's Men is a character study chronicling the same psychological process but rhyming this time with success it's about a Southern politician named Willie Stark who never forgot where he came from and never lost his touch which made him even more dangerous.The story is adapted from a Pulitzerprize winning novel of the same title written by Robert Penn Warren and based on the rise and fall of the legendary populist politician Huey Long. The ascension of Willie Stark played by a mesmerizing Broderick Crawford is a fictionalization of Long's life and one of the most powerful political movies ever made for the simple reason that it hasn't lost any of its relevance as long as politics exist there will be men like Stark. Yesterday France was shaken by the victory of French Populist Party in the European elections politicians acted surprised while they could have seen it coming. Basically the winners spoke the people's language.It's as simple as that you've got to put yourself in people's shoes and it's not any politician who can accomplish it. Some see their vocations as something that elevated them above the crowd they're not leaders but prophets allowing people to embrace their own visions but men like Willie Stark are within the crowd not above it. The pivotal moment occurs when after failing attempts to seduce people by talking about fiscal measures and other noninspirational stuff good old honest Willie Stark understands he was the puppet of his own detractors gets drunk tears up his paper and enraged by his own anger gives one of these great roaring speeches tailormade for the big screen.And the film directed by Robert Rossen features the kind of editing the genre requires crowd closeups big headlines and an unforgettable gallery of flawed characters starting with the protagonist himself Willie Stark who starts out as a nice and honest fellow struggling to raise his voice a man of the people and undeniably for the people a man revered by the journalist played by John Ireland but whose rise to power's collateral damage will be a decline of honesty. Power would plant the seeds of a cynical mind. All the King's Men starts like a Capra film but ends in a filmnoir mood. After World War II world turned out to be more disillusioned and cynical for Mr Smith figures and it's only voices like Willie Stark's that can be heard.Indeed good old Ma Joad said 'we're the people' but in 1949 only Stark could make this statement audible embodying in his huge body and largerthanlife personal those Grapes of Wrath. And once Stark realized he had a natural charisma and capability to move the crowds it's like Forrest Gump's braces breaking the repressed ego finally implodes to the face of the political scene and from respect the eyes and hearts are fueled with admiration and fear starring with his titular inner circle Mercedes McCambridge plays a sort of Jean Hagenlike character going from antagonist to main counselor she delivers her first and greatest rightfully Oscarwinning performance as a little woman with the toughest heart venting her lack of seducing appeal in her infatuation with Stark.The rest of the cast includes Joanne Dru as Ireland's girlfriend she's literally blown away by Stark's appeal and although her performance might be the one aspect of the film I disliked God how many times she had to turn her head theatrically! the twist in her character in all the meanings of the words was quite gutsy and politically incorrect for its time. And there's Broderick Crawford as Stark in the role of a lifetime earning him the Oscar for Best Actor. My other favorite performance from him is in Fellini's Il Bidone and it's quite ironic and befitting that he played a swindler in the film while Rossen would also direct another classic and favorite of mine The Hustler after all isn't a politician a kind of hustler with power as the payoff?But I'm still puzzled with Stark's character this is how fascinating he is did he turn into a bad guy or was he prone to corruption from the very beginning it's hard to tell but some of his insightful thoughts say a lot about his vision of politics good comes from evil but who defines evil? retorts one of the film's reasonable minds. Stark doesn't care as long as he builds roads schools hospitals as long as he puts his state on the maps and allow people to stop seeing themselves as hicks he'll believe in anything he says and does. Tyranny? Dictatorship? Well we live in a Macchiavellian world where ends justify the means but as the narrative progresses we're in the eye of the tornado and can't see if power is an end or a mean for Stark.And maybe this is the power of All the King's Men Best Picture winner in 1950 a powerful film about power  even more because it has the kind of straightforward appeal as if it deliberately embraced the simplicity of the very people targeted by Stark... hence my title as the poor man's Citizen Kane.".

	schema:reviewBody "Willie Stark seems like a man of the people. He is that is if those people suit his agenda. When first seen he is running for County Treasurer having discovered graft that causes a tragedy at an elementary school. When you're discovered to be right about corruption that caused the deaths of innocent children you are sure to be labeled a hero. He decides to run for governor. But his opponents are ruthless. Then so is Stark. When the next election comes up Stark is a shoein and he turns the state around with improvements that win him much popularity. How does he succeed? A little blackmail a bit of bribery and LOTS of bullying. That's how. What seemed to be for the good of the people now becomes a lot clearer to the people around him as well as his enemies. Those who oppose him are destroyed financially emotionally brutally. There's rumors of murder even a suicide. Someone has gotten too big for his britches! That's what this Oscar Winning film is all aboutevil motives behind good intentions and that leads to Dante's Inferno of course. But before that happens a lot of people have to suffer and the people around Governor Stark don't see what their support of him is more destructive than they could possibly imagine. This is only my second viewing of this alltime classic and my image of Broderick Crawford was as the outwardly bullying Harry Brock in 1950's Born Yesterday made right after this won him a deserving Oscar. The difference between Willie and Harry is that you know right from the beginning who Harry Brock is. Controlling powerhungry uncouth to quote Judy Holliday in that movie and downright brutish. But as Willie he's a seemingly devoted husband and father underneath it all cheating on his wife and pushing his son onto greatness more than his son cares to be pushed. Willie Stark is the greatest liar politics has ever seen...on screen that is. But as they say you can only fool some of the people some of the time and it all comes out in the end.John Ireland is excellent as the reporter who leaves his job at the newspaper during Crawford's first run for governor to work for him. He will regret that decision for the remainder of his days as he sees the moral laws he will have to break. Joanne Dru is the sweet daughter of a judge opposed to Stark but for some reason she gets involved with him even though she was in love with Ireland. The most unforgettable performance next to Crawford's is Oscar Winning Mercedes McCambridge as a cold and calculating secretary to Crawford that is equally as ruthless as her boss. She's also envious a fact she attributes to the small pox which left her face hard while Willie's longsuffering wife Anne Seymour has aged gracefully with a conscience and Dru is naturally beautiful. Among the smaller roles is Paul Ford in a dramatic part rare in his repertoire.Political dramas have dominated Hollywood history ever since cameras started turning and the story of corruption desperation for power over democracy and the destruction of one's own soul in order to get that power is a timeless theme that is as old as time itself. Perhaps people in office should be made to watch films like All the King's Men State of the Union Advise and Consent and The Best Man once a year simply to remind them of what their duties really are and to stop serving only those who give them the highest campaign contributions. The film's ending may be a drastic move in order to squelch political abuse but it is a metaphor for what will happen to one's soul if they continue to follow the same paths as fictional politicians such as Willie Stark.".

As he progresses thru the political ranks he loses sight of the very things that he first stood for with him and all those associated with him getting muddier by the day.Adapted by Robert Rossen director and screenplay from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Robert Penn Warren All The King's Men is the story about the rise and fall of a rotten politician. Almost certainly based on Louisiana Governor Huey Pierce Long it's a towering piece of work that is as politically cynical as it is ego centrically human. Not merely just another film about when good guys go bad this picture serves notice to the many things that drives politics on for better or worse. The role of the press is under scrutiny for example and just how come simple things such as rallies can be staged by some conniving aide sitting at the back? All roads in this gritty piece are paved with suspicious looking stones the very foundations of which have been murkily formed.It's a testament to Rossen and his excellent cast that All The King's Men is still as potent today as it obviously was back at the tail end of the 40s. Every once in a while a similarly themed film will come our way but few if any can boast the hard hitting realism that seams throughout Rossen's film. Helped by location shooting at run down Stockton in California and boosted by a powerhouse performance from Broderick Crawford as Stark this film most definitely is a hallmark in the political genre. Nominated for seven Academy Awards it won three in the main categories Best Actor Crawford Best Picture rightly and Best Supporting Actress Mercedes McCambridge with an incredible debut performance. Excellent. 910".

The story shows how a populist leader can morph into a dictator. The film is humorless cynical and very very talky.With his New York accent Crawford is not at all convincing as a political hero for backwoods hick Americans. And who would vote for someone so lacking in charisma and charm? But then none of the characters in this bleak film are sympathetic. Everything about it is spiritless cheerless pungent and mocking.The story spans a long period of time. That's okay but it makes for shallow characterizations of secondary characters. The film's plotting has a jerky discordant quality consistent with a film that has been extensively edited.Acting is average and not at all inspiring. John Ireland is so lifeless he seems to be sleepwalking through his role.The BW cinematography is not bad. But there's nothing special in the visuals which are largely overridden by a script that is dialogue driven.The film's only strength is the story's theme voters are gullible and easily manipulated. That in the sixty years since this film was made is a message that would seem to be timeless.".

He had a cast of unknowns led by Broderick Crawford who prior to that was usually playing big blustery heavies on the screen.  But Crawford sensing this could be his watershed part  threw himself into the character of Willie Starkbased on real life Huey Long.What emerged was a full dimensional portrait of what began as an honest politician who rose up from itenerance and poverty to become a currupt political leader elected governor of his state and had it not been for an assassin's bullet could have run for president.Crawford makes Stark's transition from country hick to Machine boss believable.  He shines in a scene where he learns he is being used to split the hick vote and instead of speaking the party line he gives an emotional rallyng cry.  the rally gave Stark his stepping stone into the big arena.Similarly the role of Willie Stark gave Crawford his jump to stardom.  He richly deserved the best actor Oscar he won.  While he was the focal point of the filmand an Oscar winner as well he was supported by Mercedes McCambridge herself an unknown who also won an Academy Award for best supporting Actress.  Her interpertation of Sadie Burke the hard boiled assistant is right on the mark.  John Ireland who never got credit for being as good an actor as he was made a good Jack Burden a man trying to escape from his wealth but never succeeding.  Ireland was nominated for an Oscar as well.  Finally Joanne Dru married to Ireland at the time  was Ann Stanton the antithesis of Sadie and one of the many illicit flings in Stark's life.While the success of All The King's Men was a major surprise what has become even more amazing is the fact that a half a century later the story and plot is still topical.One has to wonder if the 1970s political thriller All The President's Men owes more than just it's titular resemblance to this film.  In fact it is just a more sophisticated retelling of the story of a longtime incurable disease called Politics.".

In my opinion that award should have gone to William Wyler's masterpiece THE HEIRESS a film whose reputation increased over the years while ATKM's has diminished.But putting personal preferences aside ALL THE KING'S MEN is a riveting drama peppered with some fine performances including JOHN IRELAND who serves as onlooker and narrator of the tale and MERCEDES McCAMBRIDGE as the cynical Sadie who won a Best Actress Supporting Role Oscar for her work.Stories of political corruption are nothing newsuch material having been handled previously in stories like STATE OF THE UNION and bios like Wilson and Tennessee Johnson but never with such searing intensity. It begins with an awareness that Willy Stark is a man who wants the truth to be told in a world of dirty politics. John Ireland is the crusading reporter who is on his side in the belief that the man seeking office is an honest man. Ireland also takes time out for a brief romance with JOANNE DRU while the saga of Willie gets put aside for a brief time but Dru later becomes Stark's mistress.Willie evolves from a green campaigner to a man who starts making deals and learns the rules of the game. After a couple of failed campaigns he becomes a winner and presents himself as the champion of the people.But as times goes and montage after montage shows us Willie's progress as a champion of the mob we hear John Ireland's narration saying His little black book was a record of sin and corruption. In other words there's nothing subtle about this tale. It's laid out in pretty direct terms for the viewers to deal with with no particular insight into the power of corruption.Technically speaking there are problems with the editing. Scenes are cut abruptly short with quick fadeouts as though someone censored parts of the story and motivations of the quirky McCambridge character are not clearly spelled out at all nor is the romantic relationship with Joanne Dru. Both are glossed over by the script and only hinted at. As a matter of fact none of the supporting rolesincluding SHEPPERD STRUDWICK as the man who never trusted Willie from the beginning are really fleshed out in the script. His involvement in the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise.Summing up Intriguing drama with some technical deficiencies including some choppy editing but it probably got the award because of its social significance at a time when Hollywood was intent on producing such serious almost documentary films. As for Broderick Crawford I've liked him much better in other films.".

It's always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that's exactly what happened! I've always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say and while there wasn't a lot of ROFL moments there were quite a few LOL's throughout the movie! To me it's one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells but enough so that you don't walk out of there thinking you'd wasted your time and intellect!  it's one of those movies that i'll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!".

	schema:headline " A very funny comedy with slightly skewed morals";
	schema:reviewBody "It's always nice to see a comedy that doesn't meander around the same stupid gags insulting my intelligence time and time again. I was very happy to see a different kind of teen comedy that was much more sophisticated than the films it branches from and even parodies in many creative ways. Easy A is about a typical high school girl named Olive Emma Stone. Olive has never been popular and has never really been noticed by anyone and I don't see why considering Emma Stone is absolutely beautiful but that's beside the point. Anyway Olive without thinking things through starts a little white lie about losing her virginity. This lie spreads to the rumor mill and spreads throughout the whole school ridiculously fast which is one of the bigger themes of this movie that focuses on a lot of the necessary flaws of high school one of the most incessantly emotional periods of our lives. Obviously the rumor quickly gets out of hand and Olive's reputation as the school slut grows. Instead of backing down here Olive exploits the rumor mill for her own social and financial gain as guys pay her to pretend to have sex with her. The themes and criticisms of high school life in this film are valid but thankfully they aren't overbearing and the entire movie becomes a laugh out loud blast.First off the dialouge of Easy A is surprisingly great for a film set around these kinds of teenage archetypes. It is much more intelligent sophisticated than the typical pandering you hear coming out of the mouths of teenagers. It adds a whole new level of respect to the film that keeps it very lively and fresh. But the dialouge isn't cocky thankfully and I never got the sense the writer was trying boast his wide vocabulary. He went a totally different route and used it to the advantage of more characterization. Olive is much smarter than her peers and her language reflects that. There are plenty of other characters in the film that obviously don't come close to her sophisticated insight into the world and are the true bimbos and airheads. Their dialouge is much more typical of a teenager and it reflects a very distinct level of characterization that had hilarious results. Needless to say I felt much smarter watching this film than some of the other crap I've subjected myself to in recent years.Easy A also has a great variety of characters. Olive is already a very fun character who leads the story perfectly keeping it interesting all the way through. But then there are other characters like Amanda Bynes as Marianne the Christian nut job of the school. It's obvious to see where a person who boasts about premarital sex versus a religious zealot is leading and these two characters are hilarious to watch interact with all their snappy and quick witted dialouge. The male roles are arguably the weakest of the film but its not as big of a deal when the whole story primarily focuses on the social interactions between high school girls. Gossip is obviously a huge part of the story. But apart from the younger cast the older cast also fall into some hilarious roles. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci play Olive's parents and there isn't a moment with these two on screen that you aren't laughing your head off. This duo plays off each other so well and it makes for some of the most hysterical scenes of the whole film. Then there are other great adults in the film like Thomas Haden Church as the fast talking and sarcastic English teacher who you can't help but love. Malcolm McDowell even cameos as the school's principal and has a couple of short but funny scenes. Overall you couldn't ask for a more fitting and entertaining cast.Overall Easy A doesn't provide anything groundbreaking or revolutionary to the comedy genre but it is certainly a breath of fresh air that keeps my hopes alive for the comedy genre in this age where there are so many god awful comedies being released. Easy A isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The story sort of becomes a mess towards the end and it seems to be going off on a lot of random tangents. And then it is all resolved rather simplistically for how all over the place it was. I also have to say that the moral compass of all these characters especially Olive is pretty out of wack. Some of the decisions are a little strange and seem ridiculous at times but I guess it only reflects the naivety of a teenager and how much we still have to learn. But overall you can't complain too much when you are delivered an overall satisfying and hilarious experience.".

Initially mortified Olive parades around the school as a slut wearing an 'A' on her clothing but soon she ends up in trouble.Described as the best teen comedy since Mean Girls this is a must see because quite simply it is. The comedy variety of clever performances physical humour and beautiful word play make a combination of knockabout comedy a treat for anyone over 15 years of age that will entertain you for a glorious hour and a half.Emma Stone in her first major leading role excels as a typical but not yet typical teenager going through life's friendship and educational battles and thankfully with a difference. Olive narrates via an internet blog about how everything came about and her life and school reputation changed. Through some original narrative design and comic brightness audiences are easily engaged into the world of its heroine.Stone's performance is indescribably funny. From singing alone in her bedroom to strutting around in revealing clothing and making us laugh at the same time has made her a star for the future. One scene where she pretends to have it on in a bedroom is very funny and whilst marketed as a comedy the inevitable drama sequences show Stone as a rock.Stone steals the film but thanks to the experience of Stanley Tucci and Thomas Haden Church we have an array of comic genius. Tucci has never been funnier.The plot boasts some great twists and turns whilst marketing some great songs on its soundtrack. The way it separates itself from the normal comedy by diversifying itself through visual aids such as the live web blog or plot differentiations makes it one out watch over and over again.A couple of drawbacks include the fact Lisa Kudrow cannot shake the Phoebe tag and the ending is slightly predictable.These minor things aside this is a knockabout comedy with a great lead performance that is certainly worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Through much of the beginning of Easy A you have to find all the '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V. Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern banter and social media references. Then somewhere near the halfway point comes the admission. Olive played by upandcomer Emma Stone confesses she wants her life to have a Sixteen Candles or Breakfast Club or Say Anything moment. Ah and suddenly this is homage territory  much better. Like the rest of this hip fun and surprisingly touching comedy any time Easy A wanders down the path of clich a killer line or great scene nullifies it. It all begins and ends with Stone who can do a little bit of everything which ought to ensure her a long career. She can do typical teen comedy lead autopilotearn our sympathy she can command the improvisationlike tangential dry humor that has defined the comedies of the last five or so years and she can be the sensitive fragile Molly Ringwald type. Nothing feels forced or unnatural in her performance. She seems to be having fun and milking to goofy nature of Royal's script.More importantly the reason Easy A is so good is because it never stops being about Olive's story. A high school nobody Olive lets her best friend Alyson Michalka pressure her into lying about losing her virginity. The simple lie gets overheard by the superChristian Miss Everybody Amanda Bynes and suddenly everyone sees Olive differently or sees her period. After deciding to embrace the attention as school slut the story reaches here a bit Olive then starts to pretend to have sex with guys in need of a reputation boost which consequently sullies her own.The only real problem with Easy A is that there's no good reason to believe Stone was this unattractive nobody given her actual attractiveness and the friends she has  and we're supposed to believe that suddenly everyone is interested in her because she lost her virginity. Gluck tries to spin this into a positive by making it almost comical how everyone is staring at her or waiting in a perfect line for her to come down the hall but it's the one scratch in this gem  take it or leave it. The script and humor and situations that arise eventually more than make up for this road bump.Gluck's filmmaking is hip and common of modern comedy while the writing is clever and spontaneous. For no logical reason a scene when Olive's gay friend Brandon the one she helps first comes over Stone and Patricia Clarkson who plays her mother do this quick exchange of pretending they're in the Old South and a boy has come over and asked for her. Though completely random and a bit forced they actually work well at making the characters seem more organic which is the challenge of most comedies especially those made today.Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as the parents are the comic relief. When was the last time parents in a teen comedy were genuine comic relief? They walk a fine line between wacko and genuinely caring and loving parents but it totally works. Two more originally funny parents haven't existed on film before. Characters such as the aforementioned best friend Rhiannon and Bynes' are more bythebook as far as being teen comedy stencils but like every other small flaw with the film they're covered up by all the multidimesional and more interesting ones. Worthy of mention are school faculty members played by Thomas Haden Church Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm MacDowell.Most intriguing of all is how the film actually succeeds at finding moments of genuine drama. A few wellthoughtout and creative plot twists introduce an intelligence seemingly foreign to these kinds of comedies. The key once again comes from staying focused on Olive's story. The film is structured as a retelling with narration from Olive so it's told in a reflective manner which ultimately keeps it from veering off course. It's about Olive wrestling with this lie and her feelings about how she wants to be perceived along with her understandable pity for the boys who request her services. High school's rough and reputation seems to be everything. Some elements of the highschool experience in Easy A might be way off but that's dead on.Although it lacks the intangible innocence of the numerous '80s comedies it references Easy A has a unique and lively spirit of its own and is the best teen comedy at least featuring a female finally! in years. More importantly it shows that the modern teenage sense of humor and good storytelling don't have to be mutually exclusive.Steven C".

Thomas Haden Church is funny as the only teacher we really meet and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are well cast as the understanding and 60's hippy mentality parents. The crowd I saw it with laughed frequently and there are a lot of I've been there or I've seen that moments that you can relate to from your own high school. The writing is a little bit above the age  that is to say you'd be surprised to hear the advanced dialog coming from today's teenagers but this movie worked for me and those with me. Makes for a fun night at the movies. Scheduled for release Sept 17 2010.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to Emma Stone's Olive A is for Awesome. Easy A is the funny smart movie of the year. Director Will Gluck's fresh mashing of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter in this Twitter Age is whimsical genuine and hysterical. Emma Stone is absolutely amazing. Writer Bert V. Royal's screenplay brilliantly captures the angst and social perils of kids of this Facebook generation. Royal completes his story with touching narrative arcs and twists and a valiant hero in Emma Stone. Easy A is reminiscent of Juno in its clever and biting dialog. Where in Juno no one in real life actually speaks with those razorlike smarts Easy A is witty and sharp in natural speak.Stone's Olive is a smart ass but never over the top. She is the straight man selfaware of the social no win she finds herself imprisoned. During the staged fake tryst Olive Stone locks herself with Brandon exasperated funny Dan Byrd in a friend's bedroom. Brandon is gay and tormented everyday at school for just being. Olive reluctantly agrees to this public staging to recreate his reputation anew. When Olive removes her thong as part of the theatrics Brandon freaks. Olive says Do you think I have a gnome down there? Brandon defends that she is not his type. Duh. Olive surmises could it be I have a V not a P. Gluck and Royal orchestrate hysterically. Stone has natural impeccable timing. Easy A had won me over at this juncture.Olive is a smart and decent high school student in Ojai CA. She is never in trouble in fact nearly invisible. Olive gets caught in a lie to avoid going on a camping trip with her BFF Rhiannon charmingly spacey Aly Michalka and her disturbing New Age parents. Olive tells Rhi that she had a one night stand with a college freshman over the weekendreally she was comically alone at home. School Christian Crusade Leader Marianne gloriously bitchy Amanda Bynes overhears Olive's restroom confession. Literally at the speed of light Tweets and texts broadcast Olive's promiscuity. Later Marianne tells Olive she will be judged by a higher power. Olive responds Did I just get saved? Easy A opens with Olive's webcast which is genius. She confesses There are 2 sides to every story. This is my sidethe right one. Olive's good intentions to resuscitate social outcasts by fake rocking their worlds soon make her a pariah. She is getting Auto Zone gift cards to have faux sex with boys seeking credibility. Olive's favorite teacher Mr. Griffith disguised aloof Thomas Hayden Church becomes concerned when she transforms and wears bus tiers emblazoned with the scarlet letter A. She is reading The Scarlet Letter in English class. Also worried is Griffith's Guidance Counselor wife wacky Lisa Kudrows. Olive's parents note the red flags. Her Mom wonderfully loopy Patricia Clarkson remarks that she looks like a stripper albeit high end according to her Dad hysterically wise Stanley Tucci.However on a transactional date Olive realizes that someone crossed the whore line. Fortunately Lobster Todd rescues her. Todd gentle and strong Penn Badgley says he dismisses the rumors about Olive. He always remembers the beautiful 7th grader who was kind to him. Olive too has always been in love Todd since then. This is the distinguishing charm of Easy A. Although Olive is in the adolescent abyss the people that know her soul like Todd and her parents have faith in her. In a hilarious dinner scene Olive requests that her parents dismiss the rumors of Chlamydiaapparently no big deal. Even her Dad tells her vehemently and comically I would take a bullet for you. Her Mom understands completely. While gazing at the stars she tells her daughter that when she too was young she slept with a lot of peoplemostly guys.Easy A poignantly captures and reminds us of the painful teen angst of fitting in and just being allowed to be. When overweight dweeb Evan sympathetic Jameson Moss begs Olive to say that she had sex with him she asks him why? Brandon says Just look at me. You can see the heartbreak in Stone's visage. While Olive is confronted by picketers Todd tells her Screw all these people Olive! Ultimately Easy A gets an A for its story about having the courage to take a stand doing what is right despite what people think. Emma Stone is our hero on this journey. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit. She wins us over whether she is singing Pocket Full of Sunshine in the shower or seeing the suffering in her eyes when she realizes that she shattered the life of someone dear. Easy A is one of the best movies of the year. It's the kind of movie that is dismissed by the Academy when it shouldn't. Perhaps one day.".

While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics family life parenting religious zealotry rumormongering and the public education system.Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life ... told through the eyes of the smart invisible girl. Just a brief overview will be offered here so as not to take away from the multiple layers.Emma Stone Zombieland The House Bunny delivers a starmaking performance as Olive. Forced into a fauxconfession by her best friend Olive experiences the efficiencies of digital gossip spreading as word leaks regarding the apparent loss of her V card. Even though this one is based in Ojai California it's nice to know that high school promiscuity is still met with a certain stigma. Here that stigma is compared to Hawthorne's expert novel The Scarlet Letter.This sets into action a series of unforeseen events. The school's religious nuts led by Amanda Bynes take Olive's situation as a personal affront and spend a great deal of effort trying to punish her for her sins. At the same time the geeks and dweebs view Olive as their savior and proceed to take advantage of the opportunity.While she is presented as a very sharpwitted wellgrounded teenager Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. All of this is balanced out by her extraordinary relationship with her freespirited yet wise parents played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci.I can't possibly do justice to the script or the numerous topics broached but I will say that it's a welcome new approach to teen movies. The usual schlock sex is replaced by sharp quips and real pressures. Do note that the dialogue is filled with much harsh language that wouldn't be welcome in an environment other than a high school campus. Further support work is offered by Penn Badgley as the good guy Thomas Haden Church as a new world cool teacher Malcolm McDowell as an old school principal and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor in a role that gives me permission to feel the disgust I usually feel when she is on screen.Don't be scared off thinking this is another lousy teen flick. It is instead an insightful comedy that plays well for adults and teens. While you may not agree with all of the social observations I believe you will agree the film is presented in a most entertaining and insightful manner.".

	schema:headline " Okay but ultimately souless";
	schema:reviewBody "Saw Easy A tonight. It's pretty average. It's a film that had multiple references to classic 80's Brat Pack flicks and so that raises it above the standard teen movies. Older audiences will get the 80s references more than the younger ones. There's quite a few laughs to be had and some snappy dialogue. The basic idea of the film is good a reworking of The Scarlett Letter which the film unashamedly references and possibly overreferences.However the main problems are ultimately fundamental flaws in the script. Olive the smoking hot Emma Stone is too cool. She's too self assured and too smart. It doesn't have the authenticity of teen life unlike Mean Girls which had it in spades. Olive wasn't the cynical outsider the role called for she was the confident adult narrator. Films that portray the hero coming out stronger at the end work for a reason but the character was the same throughout.The end of the film is a love story and fixes everything in only a few scenes but it's tacked on and felt contrived. The core of the film is the 'Scarlett Letter' concept and it's a clever concept but it kind of got muddled anywhere outside that. Olive's character didn't really suffer any great despair at least the drew any empathy so the ending where she miraculously found love in about 5 minutes was more a marriage of convenience than one of passion.Overall it was a strong film. Very confident witty and wellpaced. At the end though it was just souless. No real losses or triumphs no character development. Olive was just as smart and selfconfident at the beginning as she was at the end. The audience didn't cheer Olive through the rough times because there weren't any that felt rough. We didn't really care that she hooked up with a decent guy at the end as that subplot was woefully malnourished and not given any real development time.Commercially? Okay. Artistically? Disappointing. It could have been the next Clueless or Mean Girls but kind of wasted it's potential.Worth seeing if there'e not much else on and definitely worth seeing for Emma Stone in tiny blue shorts.".

At first I thought Olive was quite clever but she doesn't seem to understand the repercussions of her actions.

I will attempt to elaborate 1 Aryan High. This did not look like a public school...more like a junior private college for jocks models and cheerleaders. I recommend the next time Hollywood makes a highschool movie with a contemporary setting they actually GO IN one. The kids in this school did not look OR ACT like kids in any contemporary public school I've ever seen. The plot may have been more successful in a 1950's setting. Promiscuity is not a major concern in today's public highschools. And they weren't in the 80's which is when I went. Either you were having sex or wanting to or thinking about it. No one was decried for having done it or talking about it or for that matter bragging about it. Even girls. Granted the girls were more discreet. On the contrary though in today's schools you might just get more cred by claiming to be a virgin...especially if attractive like the main protagonist in this story. 2 Somewhat related to the last topic...if making a highschool movie...make it with kids that at least look like they're in high school. It's ironic and hypocritical that a minor plotpoint in this movie is a student that's 21 years old and sleeps with a teacher when ALL the students look like they're in their early 20's. It's about time the ticketbuying public make an issue out of this. I think it's humorous when watching noir movies today like Grease and the actors all look as old as the teachers. I guess today's moviemakers aren't worried about the future snickerfactor that might hinder a potential classic otherwise they'd put more thought into it. I understand the pool of young acting talent is limited...but they are out there. Bust your butt and find 'em. It'll pay off in the long run...and you may just find the next hot star. Oh and your movie budget might just be more palatable.3 They hypocritical Christian. If you're going to portray a hypocritical Christian why not go and meet one? Make the character realistic and believable. I know they're a caricature but the girl in this movie was portrayed WAY over the top. Really. It kept me from rating this movie higher. I mean if I was to make a movie with a German I WOULDN'T give him a swastika arm band and a Hitler mustache...too clich. Put a little effort into make your characters at least a little realistic.I know I know...this is an exceptionally harsh review. I did like the movie and felt bad I couldn't enjoy it more. I thought the message being comfortable in your own skin was positive...but done way better with movies like Napoleon Dynamite. A little thought could've made this movie a much more enjoyable experience.".

It's extremely Witty Clever sharp  Out of the Box which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role she is witty charming funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy  incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet  such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great she was so blunt and outspoken loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci  Patricia Clarkson Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny  mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010 leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!".

It had a great cast director and extremely well written script. The story follows Olive who tells a lie about something very personal and it spreads like wildfire through the school. She loses her friends and decides she no longer cares what people think about her. The movie told through a webcam point of view and is accompanied by a soundtrack full of classic songs many of which were featured in John Hughes' movies.".

It's more about the main character strutting around in slutty clothing than anything else.

	schema:reviewBody "Being a teenage girl is no easy task believe me. In Jr. High I had a boyfriend and the first thing on young teenage minds is the curiosity if there is sex in the relationship fun rumors began to spread and it was one of the worst times in my life. Funny enough this isn't something that just started when I was a child or my older sister or my mother or my grandmother. Girl's reputations have always been fragile since the beginning of time even Shakespeare knew when he wrote Much Ado About Nothing. The Scarlet Letter challenged the double edged sword of how if a man sleeps with a woman he's a pimp a lady's man or just simply the Man. If a woman sleeps with a man she doesn't get as kind treatment we get the names slut whore or tramp. No matter how much you know it's the truth that you're not those names it hurts. But what if a girl actually took pride in those names and love the attention she got even if it was too rough to handle? Emma Stone proving that she's leading lady material handles herself extremely well in this terrific reimaging of The Scarlet Letter for teenagers that will prove to be more positive and every preadult lady should watch.Like most high school kids Olive Penderghast just wants to be popular. So much so that when her best friend Rhiannon asks Olive how her weekend went she decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motormouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice either Olive's English teacher Mr. Griffith is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl and his wife the school counselor is in full agreement. As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's popularity a muchneeded shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out.I think this is a very important film for girls because unfortunately this generation doesn't read as much as they should plus as much as I loved the book The Scarlet Letter it wouldn't appeal to everyone. We need a new update to grab someone's interest and I was really impressed with the way the cast and crew handled this film. Emma Stone has a lot of charisma such maturity for a young lady and she carried herself so well. She even provides comic relief to give the drama little break. Same with Amanda Bynes almost taking on the character played by Mandy Moore in Saved as the holier than thou bible thumper who feels that if you have sex before marriage your soul is damned. Even Lisa Kudrow did a great job as a high school counselor who puts Olive in a bad situation blaming Olive for her crime and you are just in shock and feel total sympathy for Olive when she realizes that her reputation is destroying her mentally. Easy A provides great education for both teens and adultsparents or soon to be parents on how hard it can be to be a teenage girl. I wish that I had a film like this when I was 13 because I would have felt a lot better knowing that a lot of girls go through the same thing where you feel so hated for doing something that you didn't do. Easy A is easily one of the year's best films and I'm very happy with the way it was handled very classy sexy and funny I would highly recommend it.810".

When he arrives at his aunt's estate he is as pure as a boy of his age can be and his relatives' libertine lifestyle comes as a surprise to him. Fortunately for him there is an abundance of attractive young women who are more than willing to help him make the transition from boyhood to manhood. After all it is the duty of those who know to teach those who know not. It amuses Benjamin that Comte de SaintGermain should throw over his mistress and go chasing after a younger woman Anne an orphan. Amid the wild revelry of a party Anne offers herself to Benjamin to complete his initiation in the ways of love  before she takes the count as her husband.";

As played by Pierre Clmenti an icon of European decadent  avant garde cinema here cast against type as an innocent he's an orphan going with his loyal tutor Camille Jacques Dufilho to live with his aunt the countess radiant superstar of the '40s Michle Morgan.His adventures with the aristocracy are limned in the familiar naughty but nice style that served French cinema so well most emblematically in many Fernandel comedies. Deville and his frequent collaborator screenwriter  future helmer Nina Companeez maintain a light and breezy approach that alas lacks the substance most film buffs want today.It's all tease as women of all ages having in common uncommon beauty can't keep their hands off Benjamin. The film was a major Paramount release debuting in NYC at the prestigious Paris Theatre and rated X a MIDNIGHT COWBOYtype X not porn for its sexual attitudes rather than any explicitness. The nudity common in Adult Cinema at the time is eschewed.Standout performances are by Michel Piccoli perfectly cast as the countess's lover who boasts about his other mistresses and is sympathetic due to the actor's skills more than the writing or context. With so many fancily costumed and strainingatbodice femmes in the cast Catherine Deneuve has no trouble standing out as Benjamin's ultimate love interest. Especially fun is her character's flightiness given always witty lines as an invariable liar who makes sport of her constantly contradictory statements.Clmenti is less successful in the central role at times fading into the shrubbery with such striking and bombastic costars pleasantly chewing up the scenery. Having already costarred opposite Deneuve in her triumphant BELLE DE JOUR he was better suited to decadent or even malevolent roles with the good fortune to be cast over and over again by the leading directors of the time Bertolucci Pasolini Bunuel Jancso Makavejev and Glauber Rocha reads like a film festival program of the late '60s.Other delights include an amusing wardrobe malfunction at a garden party scene where the countess's sortofloyal servant Anna Gael accidentally has a nipple popping out of her dress but calmly adjusts her bodice without missing a beat the take playing out and left in the final print very cute. Catherine Rouvel a stalwart of French eroticism is unfortunately lost in the shuffle as another servant girl.Piccoli sums up the tone with a great line in the Englishdubbed version at any rate to Benjamin What you call debauchery I call education. Lacking the depth of his alltime best role in Rivette's LA BELLE NOISEUESE BENJAMIN does stand as testament to Piccoli's place in history as one of cinema's essential thesps.I waited over 40 years to see BENJAMIN so was of course slightly disappointed by its lack of substance got my hopes up too much. The Hollywood majors relied heavily in the '60s on foreign imports both coproductions and pickups to fill out their release schedules but rights in these movies as well as residual interest have lapsed over the years. That's why a quality film like BENJAMIN has seen no American TV or video exposure since its initial release.Englishlanguage print I viewed via VSOM DVD ran 103 minutes contrary to the IMDb listing of a much shorter U.S. running time.".

There is little speaking in the film as the star of the film is Benji and he is lost in the wild and away from humans. There is maybe a minute or two of dialogue at most in the entire film. This film entirely focuses on Benji and some wild kittens that he takes care of in the wild and tries to keep from danger. It's a cute film but it also shows us the notsocute side of nature when some of the kittens end up in fatal situations. A touching film Benji the Hunted will be enjoyed by children and it sends a good and honest message to us about nature and survival.".

Some of the peril might be a little upsetting for small children or sensitive viewers but it simulated drama that was more compelling than the first two Benji movies. The first movie will always be a classic but this movie seemed to be more effective probably due to the setting and the plot.

But I wish I'd seen something like that when I was a kid and I don't care how different films are in the future  when I have children I will DEFINITELY sit them down to watch Benji the Hunted! The acting was frankly astonishing for a dog and I laughed out loud when the little dark kitten went up to the bear and tried to growl. How they got a small male dog to run up and down and even climb cliffs with cougar cubs in his mouth I will never know. In short a 20 year old and a 49 year old give this movie 4 big thumbs up and even Dad watched it all the way through although he'd never admit to liking it".

Never mind the two legged predators you would have to deal with. Then there is Mother Nature and the other elements of the forest to worry about. Then food  oh my goodness.

	schema:reviewBody "Benji the Hunted is a movie that will surely bring a warm joy to animal lovers. The biggest strength of the movie is the detailed portrayal of emotions by the animal starcast. It is nearly impossible to miss the perfection with which director Joe Camp captures even tiny details like the trembling legs of cougar kittens that followed Benji the innocence of their faces or even their spontaneous playful nature. The movie is not about Benji performing breathtaking complicated maneuvers to save the day rather how Benji faces the daytoday challenges of living in the wild with the added responsibility of four orphaned cougar kittens. The challenges of the wild are plentiful enough to keep your eyes hooked to the screen. Yet it's not a fastpaced thriller which would have cost the movie its credibility as a realistic one. The human actors in the movie have very limited role and the director wastes no time in bundling them out of limelight. Benji again emerges as a hero showing a big human heart and the message of peace and nonviolence is very effectively communicated in the movie. The background score is average yet does its job efficiently by not distracting the audience from the movie. It is a family movie suitable for all age groups and a recommended watch for all animal lovers.".

Benji of course dazzles with all his tricks but it's just as remarkable that they were able to get the cougar cubs to act the way they did as well as the wolf and other animals. It must have taken quite a few takes to get it all right since you can't exactly train a cougar cub to do what you want it to do. There are a few demented scenes that small children might find shocking like the cougar mother getting shot one of the cubs getting swept away by a hawk and the wolf being tricked into plunging to its death off a cliff. Since the film is absent of any plot other than Benji trying to get the poor cubs to another cougar so that she can adopt them some of the scenes drag on way too long like the ten minutes it takes Benji to carry the cubs up the mountain in his mouth but otherwise this is perfect fun for animal lovers and to keep the kids busy.".

The movie blunders in two ways. First there is really no edge for the most part to what we are seeing. Benji for the most part just wanders around in a quest that won't strike most viewers as being essential or lifethreatening. That leads to the second problem that being the movie is really boring. It just keeps repeating the same things over and over and soon it becomes tiring and endless. The movie is capped by a really weak and abrupt ending.

The monster Grendel is not a creature of mythic powers but one of flesh and blood  immense flesh and raging blood driven by a vengeance from being wronged while Beowulf a victorious soldier in his own right has become increasingly troubled by the heromyth rising up around his exploits. Beowulf's willingness to kill on behalf of Hrothgar wavers when it becomes clear that the King is more responsible for the troll's rampages than was first apparent. As a soldier Beowulf is unaccustomed to hesitating. His relationship with the mesmerizing witch Selma creates deeper confusion. Swinging his sword at a great stinking beast is no longer such a simple act. The story is set in barbarous Northern Europe where the reign...";

	schema:reviewBody "Breathtaking scenery strong performances and an unexpected message come together in Sturla Gunnarsson's Beowulf  Grendel. Forget the dusty inaccessible saga that may have been forced upon you in High School or as a College Freshman in English Lit! New life is breathed into Beowulf the oldest text of recorded English first set to sheepskin in 1000 A.D. after 500 years of survival through oral tradition. The acclaimed Canadian director of Rare Birds stays true to the bones of what undoubtedly started as a campfire story of a battle between Man and Monster without resorting to CGI or other special effects. Instead he relies on the talents of an impressive international cast and an intelligent screenplay against the backdrop of a stunningly primal Icelandic landscape upon which no human had set foot in 800 years. You won't need Cliffs Notes to understand this examination of who and what defines Otherness and how it is treated. The kneejerk fear factor response is as prevalent today as it was in the early Viking sliceoflife portrayed.Beowulf  Grendel owes as much to John Gardner's Grendel as it does to the Beowulf epic. The roles of Hero and Monster do not so much embody intrinsic Good and Evil as reflect qualities attributed to their assigned archetypes. How and why we assign those roles is at the heart of the firstever serious adaptation of the anonymous poem. The movie systematically leads us through a labyrinth of History Cultures the psychosocial reaction to Outsiders and the unfortunate results of those actions to the inescapable conclusion that we are not so different from one another. The ensuing Logic would then dictate that War is merely a lazy solution to a problem better addressed by examining our own psyches.Beowulf is portrayed with astonishing depth by the Scottish actor Gerard Butler who is accumulating an impressive array of credits from Attila the highestrated U.S. miniseries to Phantom of the Opera the lavish 2005 Musical to Dear Frankie the awardwinning independent Scottish film to name a few. As always he throws himself wholeheartedly thoughtfully and more important believably into the role of Hero which in lesscapable hands might be onedimensional. Even the screenwriter Andrew Berzins was both surprised and impressed by the levels to which Mr. Butler plumbed the character all in his facial expressions. Rising above his mastery of brooding good looks through tangled locks of hair he manages to have us look through his eyes rather than at his eyes  no mean feat for someone who is undeniably easy on the eyes! Beowulf emerges as the antithesis of the later Danish Prince Hamlet who is so introspective that he is paralyzed into inaction. In contrast Beowulf willingly accepts the yoke of the traditional Hero and initially and immediately acts without thinking. He recognizes his Destiny in this life and beyond stating I'll go where I'm sent! He does not however stop there. Delving into the reasons behind his mission he becomes a relentless if uneasy historical detective needing to unearth the cause of the trollmonster Grendel's savagery.The Hero's journey punctuated by predestined acts of violence is one in which we participate and evolve along with Beowulf with the assistance of the witch Selma appropriately ambiguously played by the popular Canadian actress Sarah Polley. Although she and Beowulf do pair off at one point theirs is not really a romantic connection. She serves as a sort of conduit between Beowulf and Grendel leveling the playing field between them.Grendel is splendidly brought to heartbreaking life by Iceland's biggest Star Ingvar Sigurdsson. Interestingly his 4yearold son makes a very credible acting debut as the young Grendel orphaned in no uncertain terms at the start of the movie and laying the foundation for the carnage to come. Harking more to Gardner's Grendel than the unremittingly bloodthirsty troll of the original poem Mr. Sigurdsson manages to express both the innocence and tragedy of Grendel with gusto exploring his unhuman characteristics without judgment. It is a tribute to his talent that rather than being horrified by a scene in which we see Grendel bowling with victims' severed heads we identify with the spirit of pure Joy breaking through a monster's lonely existence.Providing a context for the HeroMonster mythos is a superb cast of supporting characters. Stellan Skarsgard is the alcoholic Danish king Hrothgar not only unwilling to accept responsibility for the scourge of Grendel but not even wanting to consider why a fing troll does what a fing troll does. Eddie Marsden plays the foamingatthemouth crazed Irish Catholic priest Brendan heralding the advent of Christianity and the desire of a people to unburden themselves of any and all accountability for their actions. And Ronan Vibert embodies the equivalent of modern day mass media as the Bard Thorkel through whom the saga is transformed over Beowulf's objections into a revisionist history which does not bear close examination. As Martin Delaney notes as the young warrior Thorfinn what we are left with are tales of sht. The old Beowulf is not gone. The tone of the original oral tradition is maintained by Berzins' strict adherence to AngloSaxon and Norse root words and an ongoing thread of bawdy humor against a relentless musical score rife with tribal drums. The comic relief serves as in Shakespeare's tragedies to lighten and make palatable the raw impact of some harsh realities revealed. But a new Beowulf  Grendel rises from the ashes. This blood and guts epic with its undeniably spiritual undercurrent balances swordplay with word play and the audience is left to draw their own conclusions in the bloody aftermath. The tag line Heads will roll! refers not only to the bloodsoaked battle scenes but to the thought processes set in motion that will leave you reevaluating concepts of and motives behind Love Loyalty and War long after you leave the theater.".

As Martin Delaney notes as the young warrior Thorfinn what we are left with are tales of sht. The old Beowulf is not gone. The tone of the original oral tradition is maintained by Berzins' strict adherence to AngloSaxon and Norse root words and an ongoing thread of bawdy humor against a relentless musical score rife with tribal drums. The comic relief serves as in Shakespeare's tragedies to lighten and make palatable the raw impact of some harsh realities revealed. But a new Beowulf  Grendel rises from the ashes. This blood and guts epic with its undeniably spiritual undercurrent balances swordplay with word play and the audience is left to draw their own conclusions in the bloody aftermath. The tag line Heads will roll! refers not only to the bloodsoaked battle scenes but to the thought processes set in motion that will leave you reevaluating concepts of and motives behind Love Loyalty and War long after you leave the theater.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very updated version of the AngloSaxon poem Beowulf using contemporary English.This movie still has the mythical epic qualities of the poem that have inspired readers throughout the ages. In an excellent performance Gerard Butler effectively captures the conflicted hero Beowulf as he endures the slow erosion of his military code of conduct. Beowulf  Grendel is more than a story of blood and war. Themes of vengeance loyalty and mercy are powerfully entwined with the beginnings of Christianity in southwest Sweden in 500 AD. Another theme which is explored is human inability to tolerate that which is different. Gerard Butler is extremely effective as Beowulf but perhaps the best performance in the movie is that delivered by the tempestuous and weirdly beautiful land of Iceland. I think this movie is definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Lovely film";
	schema:reviewBody "The first clue that this film is a different take on the story is the title. Rather than simply depicting Beowulf's killing of a onenote Grendel as metaphor for good triumphing over evil it is the story of the intersection of two fully realized complex characters. This retelling wants us to rethink the simplistic concept of good and evil. The first step is to give us a Grendel we can understand and a Beowulf weary enough of war to try.Beowulf is a man used to that simplistic concept of war as good versus evil  he's cool and efficient at killing and when Hrothgar calls he's ready to put Grendel's head on a pole. But he's thrown off balance when Grendel won't engage. He becomes a sort of detective not the warrior of legend but the imperfect man behind it simply trying to get his bearings. With Butler's presence and nuanced performance Beowulf may not be the mythically embellished warrior but is nonetheless wholly compelling and on a human scale heroic.Skarsgard is amazing as King Hrothgar a man selfdestructing as he helplessly watches Grendel killing his people consumed with hiding the fact that the catalyst was his own reckless action. Words like walks on water come to mind when describing Skarsgard's work. His performance in Aberdeen is not to be missed.Grendel in an inspired performance by Ingvar Sigurosson is a physically frightening brute with the heart of a small boy who loves his father and hates the ones who killed him. And he's smart  smart enough to make buffoons out of Hrothgar and Beowulf at turns. Even without dialogue Sigurosson gives us that Grendel we can understand.Selma portrayed like the glassy calm surface of a deep river by Sarah Polley is the conscience of the piece. Her gaze is wide open  holding no illusion about the goodness of human nature  and rather discomfiting to Beowulf. She's delicate and powerful and as cool and efficient at surviving as Beowulf is at being a warrior. Beowulf goes to her for answers but not the ones he ends up getting.Andrew Rai Berzins' script is crisp and wry and short on exposition relying instead in great measure on the collaboration of the actors to tell the story and they deliver. Hrothgar tells us with one subtle look exactly what he thinks of the blathering apoplectic priest. Instead of writing a line of dialogue Berzins allows Hondscioh Tony Curran to speak to us silently his expression slowly reflecting the dread he sees on the faces of his mates as they realize he's just earned Grendel's wrath. And Grendel doesn't play around  much.This film is truly a team effort and this is the kind of team we root for. With Berzins' thoughtful and humorous script reflecting the real camaraderie of the talented cast and Gunnarsson's direction reflecting his obvious love both for the story and for Iceland we get a moving and beautiful film.Usually warrior epics end with the hero vanquishing his foe in some brave and spectacular way. For this team's Beowulf the real foe is thoughtless intolerance  something not even a hero can vanquish except within himself.".

	schema:headline " Review from 2005 TIFF";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Beowulf and Grendel is based on the Old English epic poem of the same name. It follows Beowulf a Geat who travels with his compatriots to Denmark and the realm of King Hrothgar Stellan Skarsgrd which is besieged by a great monster Grendel Ingvar Sigurdsson. Beowulf repeatedly tries to draw Grendel out to do battle but soon finds from the witch Selma Sarah Polley that there may be more the story than meets the eye.Historical purists will probably take issue with the portrayal of the story and with the dialogue. However judged on its own merits Beowulf and Grendel is a fine film. The film looks epic thanks to the onlocation filming in Iceland. Butler is suitably heroic and Sigurdsson does well with a role that has essentially no dialogue what with being a subhuman troll and all. Screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins makes use of slightly more contemporary language in the script but without any ill effect. Director Sturla Gunnarsson has made some interesting casting choices with Scots actors as the Geats who are actually from Sweden Nordic actors as the Danes and Canadian Sarah Polley as Selma. The cast acquits themselves well including Polley whose Canadian accent serves to show her character's isolation from the rest of the community.Director Sturla Gunnarsson screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins and actor Tony Curran did a QA after the film They took a lot liberty with the story especially as the poem has speeches that go on for pages. They decided to cut loose from it right away and instead portray the story that would become the poem. As Gunnarsson put it they tried to be true to the bones of the story. Since the poem dates back to a Norse oral tradition where poets would embellish stories with each telling Gunnarsson felt they could do some of the same.There were a number of problems during filming as they started shooting several months later than planned. At the time there were a lot of hurricanes in the Atlantic which results in very high winds. They lost four base camps and in a single day lost eight vehicles to the 150 kmh winds.The ship used by the Geats is actually the Islendingur a replica of a Viking ship from 870 AD originally built to commemorate the anniversary of Leif Ericson's voyage to North America. The boat leaked so four fire pumps were required to keep it afloat. However for long shots of the boat in an icebergfilled lagoon the pumps had to be shut off and footage gathered quickly.Grendel is supposed to have the strength of 30 men but at the same time he is not a god which it makes hard to portray him on screen. They didn't want to create a fantastical movie so they decided early on not to use any CG for Grendel.The horses used in the movie are Icelandic horses which have three gaits unique to the breed and uniquely suited to travel over the rocky terrain.The palette for the costumes if taken from the landscape.When casting Beowulf they wanted someone unambiguously masculine who could act and who could bring some complexity to the role. Gunnarsson had seen some of Gerard Butler's films. While they weren't his cup of tea he did find that Butler jumped off the screen.Gunnarsson and Polley have known one another for years. She loves Iceland and had asked to be cast in whatever he decided to film there next. Gunnarsson feels that Polley brings something to the moral conscience of the story.For Grendel Gunnarsson had consulted with creature makeup director Nick Dudman who has also worked on the Harry Potter films Dudman said that he could build prosthetics but it would really all come from the actor.Sigurdsson read the script and was drawn to Grendel without any prompting from Gunnarsson. While in a bookstore in Reykjavik an American tourist noticed that script and recommended John Gardner's book Grendel which tells the story from Grendel's perspective.They weren't originally allowed to cast Skarsgrd as he is not from the UK Iceland or Canada. On appeal to the UK authorities they eventually agreed that it would be all right for a Norseman to play another Norseman.They wanted the Geats to look like a gang of bikers not some sort of museum piece.On the use of humour in the script Berzins said that there is humour in everything and that he is frustrated by historical movies with no humour.Berzins said about the use of the fword in the movie that the fword is actually quite old but he does realize that some people are brought forward in time when they hear it. Skarsgrd was originally not a fan of its use but by the end he was using it liberally.Spoilers below They tried to stay close to the story but in the original none of the characters have much in the way of motivation Grendel just shows up and starts killing people. They felt that either he's simply evil or he has a reason which opens up all sorts of possibilities.They felt that this is a good time in history to explore the heromyth. Beowulf is essentially a story about a warrior that goes overseas to fight a righteous quest but soon finds himself embroiled in a tribal war.Tony Curran said that his favourite scene is the one where the young Grendel is holding his father's severed head. Berzins' favourite is the one where Tony's character destroys the skull he looks up and you can see doom descend on him. Gunnarsson's favourite is Skarsgrd's disintegration at the end.".

There were good performances by many of the cast Butler's conflicted hero Skarsgard's noblebutnotsonoble king  but Ingvar Sigurdsson owned it as Grendel. Was it the skill of the writer and director in making Grendel a vulnerable human? and victim drawing a sympathy vote from the audience? Was it Ingvar Sigurdsson's acting skills to express intense emotions and engage the audience despite virtually any words in the script and enough prosthetic makeup to impede facial expressions? All I know is that I connected with Grendel's pain. And isn't that the point? Another prominent character was the weather. It wasn't on the casting list but it showed up nonetheless and fought for top billing. It helped to draw you into the ruggedness of the times and the story but I also found it distracting. Perhaps it's my own distractibility but for whatever reason the scenery and weather engaged me more than the story a few times. The soundtrack was indeed beautiful but personally I don't think it fit. To me the campfiretomeadhall timeless folktale would have been better served by a more primitive collection of instruments rather than the majestic orchestra suited to an epic. But that's just my taste. My main criticism is that to me the film seemed choppy. I felt like I missed out on some important parts. I didn't take any washroom breaks did I? It may have been the editing. There are others who enjoyed the film much better at the second viewing so maybe it's all there in the movie beyond my distraction by the scenery and Gerard Butler's rugged good looks. Maybe the movie did its job after all I'm still chewing on it 2 weeks later. Who knows? I did however catch the humor in the film. Andrew Rai Berzins' sharp wit and humor came to the rescue and drew me back in when distractions prevailed. I'd really like to see it a second time now that my giddiness is over. I was anticipating this movie from the time filming began and what film can live up to a year's worth of my ruminations and expectations? Now don't ask me to rate the film with a number.

All of the lead actors especially Gerard Butler as Beowulf and Stellan Skarsgard as the King were superb in their roles and although I have never read the original epic poem I found that the story was very welltold and that the director and his cast definitely succeeded in delivering the manylayered messages of racial tolerance bravery and the real meaning of heroism. The Icelandic setting was absolutely breathtaking and I certainly agree that it became an additional character and an essential part of the story as well. Finally the bits of comedy which resulted from Beowulf's interactions with his band of warriors were a welcome and realistic addition to a story that could have easily taken itself too seriously and become bogged down in melodrama. I highly recommend this film to those who enjoy cinematic experiences which fall outside and well above the normal Hollywood cookiecutter action films. I am also looking forward to its wide release I hope here in North America in the next few months since one viewing of this weirdly wonderful film is definitely not enough!".

	schema:reviewBody "Having anticipated this movie for months I can only say that I am horrendously disappointed by the way this film was presented. The landscape and costuming was well done but that was about it. The dialogue was woefully unsuited to the type of story presented I was looking for dialogue written to the standards of Lord of the Rings what we got was more suited to a summer action movie. I cannot believe the amount of swearing in the movie while the Danes would have cursed they wouldn't have been dropping the fword constantly.I am disappointed in the character of Beowulf. As the film goes on the protagonist begins to question the morality of his role in the Grendel affair. From my understanding of the morals of the culture of the time Beowulf should have had no problems with killing Grendel. The monster had killed kinsman of his kinsman which brought Beowulf into the whole affair. Even if the deaths of these men was retribution for the killing of Grendel's father the hero was morally obliged to avenge Hrothgar's kin.The character of Selma is hopelessly contrived and unnecessary. The quiet acceptance of her own violation is extremely troubling as was her defense of Grendel. Her role was unnecessary in the movie there was already enough plot elements to cause Beowulf a quandary without her especially the way the king was walling apart. On a stylistic note it would have been nice if the actress could have made an effort to speak in a different accent... she was completely out of place among all the British and Scandinavian accents otherwise featured.This is capped by the very poor explanation of many characters especially Queen Wealhtheow King Hygelac and Grendel's Mother. Their existence is not explained nor even their names. This made the movie hard to follow especially when Grendel's Mother entered the picture. Several of my companions thought that she was Grendel and Selma's child's real mother! I am normally willing to give some leeway to adaptations but this movie was undeniably bad. The plot development was slow the characters were confusing and many of the elements Selma the Christians did nothing for the real plot. I regret having spent money to see it.".

The Icelandic landscape lent the perfect backdrop to this gripping story of a man Beowulf who is drawn into a terrible situation of revenge and retribution which turns out to be far more complicated than he had initially imagined. Butler is simply excellent in the role his mix of sheer masculinity and intelligence the perfect combination for the complex character he portrays. The only part I was not thrilled about was Sarah Polley who's Canadian accent really stood out amid the mix of Scottish English and Scandinavian accents. I thought her character while crucial to the plot was a little too modern in some respects and her inability or perhaps reluctance to attempt a modicum of an accent really stood out for me. Minor detail I know and in the big scheme of things not a big deal. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely!!! It's quite violent so be warned not for the faint of heart.".

Instead of being a synthesis it was an uneasy mix.Oh it was moderately entertaining to a modern man and woman the scenery was magnificent and the cinematography splendid  almost a given these days. The acting with one important exception was very good. I'm glad I saw that and not... what was the other one? Snow dogs in Peril? Oh 'Eight Below'. 'Beowulf and Grendel' was actually about something and not just 'based on actual events'  the usual witless excuse for a dull and meandering story.What was Beowulf about? Originally  think about this  the tellers and hearers of this tale lived the dullest and most dangerous existence possible. They were pioneers always on the jagged edge of starvation faced with endless toil and unremitting vigilance just to survive against an unremittingly hostile environment. They must have longed for a single villain an enemy they could strike at and defeat once and for all. Thus Grendel. Grendel is all their fear and drudgery rolled into one. And Beowulf. He is them all rolled into one their collective courage and strength.It might be possible to adapt this to modern ideals but it has to be reimagined which likely means changing time and place to let's say the recent oldwest the populace to sodbusters the Grendelmenace to an unbeatable blackhat gunslinger and the hero to the man in buckskin. You can't just graft modern attitudes onto ancient warriors and pretend you've done something new and significant.The addition of the witch Selma played by my countrywoman Sarah Polley is the worst of the modernist grafts. She plays the part almost without affect as if all her actions were the product of cool rational thought and didn't matter very much anyway. I picture the director ranting at her in Icelandic while a very polite translator murmurs more intense please. I hate to badmouth one of the more intelligent actresses of our time and one most loyal to her Canadian Roots but she really dropped the ball on this one and it affects the whole movie's credibility. If she'd been crazier dirtier more savage more a part of the threatening Other the role might have worked. Since she chose to preserve the proprieties of a modern girl don't flip out even when a troll is ravishing you  she sinks the whole enterprise.Final comment handsome amusing entertaining but highly flawed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't read anything before watching this. I was hoping that in the aftermath of Lord of the Rings Beowulf might also be a fairly good film. It looks good. The weather is great. Iceland is a joy to see. But that's about it. They really wasted a fine chance to bring us the dark ages in mythic form. And they really destroyed the meaning of the story.The worst parts are these Grendel is made into a sympathetic human figure who basically just speaks a different language. The real Grendel is a bloodthirsty carnivorous monster and is the inspiration for Tolkien's Gollum. He's much more like an animal than human. Thus a whole subplot about Grendel's hurt feelings makes the story into an oddly politically correct mess at its core.Selma... Who the hell is Selma? Just a trendy pretty witch girl. She represents the old magic. She is sensitive and pseudomysterious. Now I like Sarah Polley as an actress. But without some dialogue coaching here she sounds like a refugee from The Craft not someone from the past. And her and her son's hairstyles are likewise so much anachronistic tripe. And what was going on with her and Grendel? Brendan the Celtic Priest? Umm do you think Europe was really Christianized by buffoons like this? This was just a poorly written comment upon the Christian implications of the original story. Or rather one more chance to say that the wonderful pagan world was ruined by idiot Christians. If they were going to get all of the Christianity out of the narrator's version they should have just done that without the unclever potshot at Christianity.Beowulf. Not a bad actor but where did he get that What the F... lingo? Let's just blame the low grade imagination of the screenwriter.There are I suppose people who don't really care about the original poem. And people who will mistake this for some sort of treatment of the dark barbarian times. Don't be one of them. Educate yourself. Read the original.The sad thing is that it will be years before someone can attempt to remake Beowulf as it should be done. They wasted their chance.".

Grendel is depicted as the last of his race. A sad confused and ultimately wronged creature out for revenge but also capable of pathos and even shows signs of a sly sense of humour. The cinematography is absolutely astounding the use of natural light really adds another dimension to this film. I would have to say it is the most beautifully shot film of the last 20 years.As for the acting Gerard Butler gives another excellent performance as the world wiry Beowulf as dose Stellan Skarsgrd as the king trying to come to term with his past and conscious.

	schema:headline " Based on a legendary and mythical poem and filmed in marvelous landscapes from Iceland";
	schema:reviewBody "In a medieval land is set this bloodsoaked tale of a Norse warrior Gerard Butler's battle against the great and murderous troll Grendel Ingvar Egger . In a besieged land  Beowulf must battle against the hideous creature Grendel . As a flesheating creature called Grendel is killing off all those who live in the kingdom . That is until the arrival of Beowulf a mysterious mercenary who offers Hrothgar the kingdom's ruler help to hunt Grendel . Out of allegiance to the King Hrothgar Stellan Skarsgard  the much respected Lord of the Danes  Beowulf leads a troop of warriors across the sea to rid a village of the marauding monster. The monster Grendel is not a creature of mythic powers but one of flesh and blood  immense flesh and raging blood driven by a vengeance from being wronged while Beowulf a victorious soldier in his own right has become increasingly troubled by the heromyth rising up around his exploits carried out along with Hondscioh Tony Curran and his warriors . Beowulf's willingness to kill on behalf of Hrothgar wavers when it becomes clear that the King is more responsible for the troll's rampages than was first apparent. As a soldier Beowulf is unaccustomed to hesitating. His relationship with the mesmerizing whore  Selma Sarah Polley who has fallen in love with him and creates deeper confusion. Swinging his sword at a great stinking beast is no longer such a simple act. The story is set in barbarous Northern Europe where the reign of the manygods is giving way to one  the southern invader Christ  here represented by a Catholic priest Eddie Marsan . Beowulf not only does battle with Grendel he also fights Grendel's evil mother . Vengeance loyalty and mercy powerfully entwine in this spectacular Norse adventure.This European coproduction begins with a real sense of wonder and surprise and develops with continuous struggles and winding up a fight against the giant Grendel. The picture packs great loads of action  wonderful cinematography  abundant stunts  breathtaking combats and a little bit of gore and blood . Stunning battles scenes illuminate the fullblown adventure with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there and everywhere while other parts of body are slit open . Good performance from Gerard Butler as Beowulf  a man caught between sides in this great shift his simple code transforming  falling apart before his eyes and the strange witch well played by Sarah Polley. Both of whom play a story of blood and beer and sweat which strips away the mask of the heromyth leaving a raw and tangled tale .Beowulf was a poem written in England but is set in Scandinavia  commonly cited as one of the most important works of AngloSaxon literature .Beowulf is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. It has variously been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries. It is an epic poem told in historical perspective a story of epic events and of great people of a heroic past. Although its author is unknown its themes and subject matter are rooted in Germanic heroic poetry in AngloSaxon tradition recited and cultivated by Old English poets . The poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with Grendel and with a dragon . The main protagonist Beowulf a hero of the Geats comes to the aid of Hrothgar the king of the Danes whose great hall Heorot is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a sword which giants once used that Beowulf found in Grendel's mother's lair . Other films based on this epic poem are the following  Beowulf1999 by Graham Baker with Christopher Lambert and Rhona Mitra  The 13 warrior by John McTiernan with Antonio Banderas  Diane Venora  and Beowulf by Robert Zemeckis with Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins .".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of the reviews on Beowulf and Grendel are misleading  this film isn't very good. Its obviously made by arthousemoviepeople so the cinematography is good but everything else is lacking i.e. direction script and pacing. I was disappointed because the script takes a lot of liberties with the actual story so much so that only the character names locations and the ending partly are the same as the epic poem.There's so many problems with this movie that for the sake of efficiency I'm just going to list them1 The movie is too long. There's a lot of camera sweeps and landscape shots that add nothing to the story but plenty to the length of the film. I didn't want to watch a documentary on the Icelandic landscape I wanted to see a movie with characters and a story.2 The Sarah Polley subplot. Sarah Polley plays a witch who clues Beowulf as to why Grendel is attacking. But the witch subplot is forced and feels grafted onto the story. It should have been chopped because its unnecessary  it seems like they just wanted Sarah Polley in the movie so they wrote this whole subplot just for her. And it was pretty disgusting in the end... if you think about it it was really disgusting and I wonder just what the hell the filmmakers were thinking. They have some serious serious problems.3 None of the characters are likable. They grumble they scowl and they look despondent 90 of the time. There was no character development so there's no attachment as to what happens to them. Half the guys looked the same with long beards and scowls so you never knew who died.4 The changes to the story were poor. There's a reason the story of Beowulf is considered an epic that has been remembered for hundreds of years  its a great great story. Did the filmmakers really think that they slap a story together in a few months that would be better than an epic that has withstood the tests of time? If it ain't broke don't fix it you can't improve on a work of art such as Beowulf so why rewrite it? Its like repainting the Mona Lisa to add some zazz.So unless you like watching endless scenes of the Icelandic landscape and of bearded men indistinguishable from each other walking and riding through the Icelandic landscape while scowling skip this snoozefest you'll be glad you did.".

He's just a dumb brute. Beowulf is not all that heroic. He just happens to be pretty handy with a sword.The setting is very beautiful and the performers did an adequate job with a weak script so I don't blame any of them personally. This just isn't a good adaptation. It lacks an epic scope or even a feeling similar to that.

This just isn't a good adaptation. It lacks an epic scope or even a feeling similar to that. And there's very little to cause you to feel any connection to any of the characters.I would suggest that anyone interested in this movie read the poem instead.";

	schema:headline " Not that great";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit I was very disappointed with this movie. I love Beowulf but I felt this movie really didn't come close to portraying what the story is all about. First of all transitions from scene to scene were extremely choppy. I know the story well and yet I couldn't follow it during certain parts. My boyfriend who has never read Beowulf was often lost throughout the movie. He had to ask me what was going on who that character was etc... I found the characters were poorly established. With the exception of Grendel it was hard to figure out who was who. The clothes of the King and Queen were the only things that signified who they were. Unfortunately the wardrobe  Wealhtheow's jewelery seemed so out of place in Iceland among a population of 30 people and two houses.The most disappointing aspect for me was Hrothgar's character. He was made into a drunken pathetic fool who knew all along why Grendel was terrorizing the Danes but chose to keep it a secret. Ultimately Hrothgar serves to guide Beowulf throughout his life. He acts as Beowulf's moral aid and represents stability heroism and leadership. Why the screen writers or director felt the need to portray Hrothgar the way they did I do not know.While I really enjoyed Gerard Butler's performance I didn't see the true Beowulf coming through. The story of Beowulf prides itself in the hero's astonishing heroism and great warrior skill against the supernatural creatures he has to fight. In the movie Beowulf did not fight Grendel once. Even more irritating was how short and lacking the fight between Beowulf and Grendel's mother was. What I did like about Beowulf was the sincerity of his character. The way he saw through the Danes' hatred of Grendel and why Grendel is a monster was very characteristic of Beowulf.I also enjoyed Grendel's character. It was refreshing to find myself sympathizing with the monster after he cuts his arm off to free himself. The notion that Grendel is truly a genuine and harmless creature unless provoked was a nice touch. It definitely added some feeling to a movie otherwise lacking. I also enjoyed the actor playing Grendel. He did a great job! It was nice to see Sarah Polley on screen but I have to agree with one of the other posters her lines did seem rather contemporary. That and the odd swear word thrown in by Beowulf and Hrothgar. It really didn't fit and I think they could have conveyed just as much frustration and anger without cursing. Also Sarah Polley's lack of accent didn't really fit. Her scenes however were some of the few I enjoyed.Overall I was quite disappointed with the movie. I can't say I didn't enjoy myself because I love the story of Beowulf but I really expected something much better.".

I was in tears watching his final tribute to Grendel as he buried him in the black sand. His transformation and understanding as the film went on was breathtaking. Grendel was performed so perfectly that even without dialogue his vengeance and pain was heartbreaking and powerful. I was not as impressed by Sarah Polley as others might have been but the Geats were great and seemed to be a tight knit group surrounding their hero. Beowulf.

	schema:headline " Superior entertainment and as faithful to the poem as it could have been.";
	schema:reviewBody "Beowulf' is a theatrical release that went straighttovideo in the United States because of some complications involving distributing. It was picked up by Mirimax around the same time The 13th Warrior' the other recent interpretation of the classic poem went to theaters. Because that film was a flop both critically and financially Mirimax played it safe and skipped the theatrical release for this dumping it straight into a Blockbuster near you.Reactions from this version have varied. People have tended to either like it a lot or hate it with passion. There is good reason for this. Beowulf' is one of the great works of the English language and it has been studied by both literary scholars and adventure lovers for centuries. It inspired such classic fantasy works as the Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons and it has and will be reviewed by every English class that ever had does or will exist. Because of the difficulty to convert the original poem into a film a lot of changes have been made to the anger of a lot of literary purists. For one the location has been changed to a techno midievel future and the great Hall of Herot has been converted to a battleoutpost where technology has taken a step backwards. Only a few traces of a superior technology exists such as night vision and methanerun torches and everything else has been reduced to a typical sword and crossbow environment combined with outrageouslooking primal weapons. In other words we've got Mad Max meets Dragon Slayer. So now Hrothgar is the leader of the Outpost and he's got a beautiful daughter named Kyra who's got a deadly secret. Unferth has also had his name changed to Roland for no apparent reason. Some subplots have been added which discuss Hrothgar's relationship with Grendel and his mother and Kyra's relationship with Roland.The most dynamic change however is in the character of Beowulf himself. No longer is he a happygolucky adventurous fighter for good but a dark depressed man who is a little more than mortal. The son of a demon and a woman he wanders the earth looking for evil. The only way I can stop from becoming evil is if I fight evil' he says and thus is his explanation for coming to this outpost and fighting the evil darkness called Grendel an evil creature who is terrorizing the place every night by killing all of the guards. Beowulf sort of like an antiHercules has fast healing power and is decked out with all sorts of cool weaponry. He's got short bleached hair and he's dressed in Matrixstyle leather and he's a lot more dark and weary than the Beowulf of the epic poem.Such changes are making a lot of Beowulf fans enraged. I am a fan of the original Beowulf poem as well and have been studying it for years and I can say that the changes didn't bother me. I applaud them in fact in their effort to make the story more applicable to the high schoolcollege students who will be studying the ancient work. These changes don't improve the story but they don't take away from it either. Any student who might not be interested in studying the text might pick this up and like it and their interest in the original source will increase. The changes work mostly due to the fact that it film still keeps the whole of the story intact and it takes it very seriously. Purists need to realize that it would be nearly impossible to make a film about Beowulf' and keep it 100 true to the original poem. Changes HAVE to be made due to the complexity of the work and these changes work very nicely.The film as a whole plays like an extended episode of Xena Warrior Princess' with a  larger budget meaning it is dark and brooding when it needs to be and campy and actionpacked with its tongue stuck firmly in its cheek in other places. This style works. While The 13th Warrior' might have been superior to this visually this film far surpasses it in capturing the essence of what the poem was all about A battle with a supernatural foe. The original work was made to entertain and to fill the listener with a sense of wonder and this film does just that thanks to a good cast mostly and some wellshot action sequences that are both over the top and subdued depending which is necessary. The setting was also well thought out by the producers. While The 13th Warrior' used with open spaces this Beowulf' captures the clausterphobic feel of the poem with mostly interior shots of this run down outpost where most of the action takes place. The techno music also works giving a videogame feel to it in many spots which is fine because of the video game potential the whole story has besides if they had video games in 900 A.D. around when the poem was written they would have been about Beowulf!.The monsters also work. Grendel is a fishlike monster in the tradition of Predator with a mist surrounding him at all times. It's replicated straight from the poem and the Witchmother is also a powerhouse of special effects who is a combination of Grendel's Mother and the Fire Dragon from the poem whose scenes are missing due to plot restraints.Christopher Lambert is surprisingly good as Beowulf playing the part subtly and without overacting. Like in the book he is a man of few words just wanting to fight and get the job over with. Though the motives are different The Beowulf of the poem lives for the fight. This Beowulf simply wants to overcome the evil within in. While I don't think Lambert would work in a literal literary version of  Beowulf' he would have to be a large brawling person like Vin Deisel or Russell Crowe he does fine here as a hero torn between his lust for evil and his desire to fight it. He's got just the right tone and his eyes speak multitudes. His understanding of this kind of Beowulf is right on target and he holds the film together and plays the straight man when the fights get outrageously fun I've been waiting for you. Our evil has drawn us together. I'm like you. I'm one of the damned' he tells an attacking Grendel in the film's best scene action scene which takes place in the flooded cellar. . The rest of the cast is effective as well especially Gotz Otto as Roland Unferth who manages to evoke both sympathy and power in a satisfactory performance.All this said however there could have been a few changes made. The actress playing the Witchmother is horrible. While the character is complex and she's got some great and very important lines it is clear that she was cast in the role for her figure only They probably told her You just strut what you've got. We'll teach you how to act.'. Every line she says she ruins and it is only the rest of the excellent cast which manage to keep the scenes featuring her lessthanadequate.   The ending is also a disappointing as many of the characters simply copout and the resolution never has time to sink in after a spectacular final battle.Nevertheless this is an excellent version of the epic poem both fun and thoughtprovoking.

	onyx:emotionText "Beowulf' is a theatrical release that went straighttovideo in the United States because of some complications involving distributing. It was picked up by Mirimax around the same time The 13th Warrior' the other recent interpretation of the classic poem went to theaters. Because that film was a flop both critically and financially Mirimax played it safe and skipped the theatrical release for this dumping it straight into a Blockbuster near you.Reactions from this version have varied. People have tended to either like it a lot or hate it with passion. There is good reason for this. Beowulf' is one of the great works of the English language and it has been studied by both literary scholars and adventure lovers for centuries. It inspired such classic fantasy works as the Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons and it has and will be reviewed by every English class that ever had does or will exist. Because of the difficulty to convert the original poem into a film a lot of changes have been made to the anger of a lot of literary purists. For one the location has been changed to a techno midievel future and the great Hall of Herot has been converted to a battleoutpost where technology has taken a step backwards. Only a few traces of a superior technology exists such as night vision and methanerun torches and everything else has been reduced to a typical sword and crossbow environment combined with outrageouslooking primal weapons. In other words we've got Mad Max meets Dragon Slayer. So now Hrothgar is the leader of the Outpost and he's got a beautiful daughter named Kyra who's got a deadly secret. Unferth has also had his name changed to Roland for no apparent reason. Some subplots have been added which discuss Hrothgar's relationship with Grendel and his mother and Kyra's relationship with Roland.The most dynamic change however is in the character of Beowulf himself.

It's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and Lambert the one who comes to kill him. Lambert is good as he is in all his roles but the rest of the characters suck and the action isn't too good either. Plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film the special effects are also very bad the monster looks awful not scary but awful. Oh and another bad thing the music. The movie tries and manages to create the 6th century atmosphere. But all the action sequences are presented on rock music which is very very bad. I mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels  where that's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here that was a very bad idea.Vote 4 out of 10.".

Of course Christopher Lambert was his usual noninspired boring self but all the other actors were also stiff and boring. The monster was actually the most interesting character...

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was great. Seriously I know that it seems by the average rating that there must be something wrong with this flick but I tell you it was great. The production values were excellent considering the obvious budget constraints the imagination of the production crew really outshined their financial limitations. This movie has a sort of road warrior meets braveheart look to it and where less passionate crews might have trouble being consistent with the open ended possibilities that such an aesthetic might afford these guys really do a great job of creating a believable world that does not seem artificial in any way. The acting was seriously top notch all the players took the material with deadly seriousness and while lesser actors and actresses may have felt the material beneath them and turned in a tongue in cheek performance these guys all brought their A game which is more than can be said of most action movies with three times the budget. The fight choreography was very well done and although it had a bit of the Hong Kong WuShu inspired feel to it it didn't go overboard and the work done to edit the actors together with the stunt actors was well above par. The CGI although not quite at the level of a big budget Hollywood movie considering that this was made ten years ago was incredibly inventive especially Grendels mom and the creature design for Grendel was again very imaginative and well filmed. I've heard complaints about the soundtrack but although everyone's taste in music is different i felt it was consistent and appropriately conducive to my level of emmersion in this world. There are only two things that stop me from giving this movie a higher score. The first is a lack of chemistry between Beowolf and Kyra. Perhaps they could have spent a little more time on this relationship then again it may have detracted from the overall pace of the film but I must say it felt a little forced between them. The second is really no fault of the film it simply didn't have the budget given the subject matter nor the aspiration to be a completely life changing experience which is what it takes to get a ten out of me. Overall if you like your action movies to take themselves seriously and you're looking for something a little different I highly recommend you give this movie a view. On a side note i don't understand how the CGI Beowolf from a couple of years back could possibly get a higher average score than this except to say that a lot of people would rather conform to the perceived opinions of the masses instead of giving forth the little amount of effort that it takes to think for themselves. I've seen both and I have to tell you this movie was far and above the better film. And if you ask me Layla Roberts was way hotter than Angelena Jolie as Grendel's mom. If you're going to watch any Beowolf movie make it this one.".

Hey its no Citizen Kane thank god but I felt entertained pretty much all the way through with the possible exception of a few scenes. There were lots of action the stunts fighting sets and special effects were all done at a very high level. To me this was no B movie. The production and look of the film were first rate. Christopher Lambert probably isn't my first choice in leading men but he did his part well. The monsters looked cool and the babes were definitely juicy. I especially enjoyed the opening scenes when Beowulf rescued a girl from execution with lots of nifty fighting only to discover she had rather be dead than reenter the fortress where Grendel was hanging out. Was the movie true to the poem...who cares? One of the best things about the film was the fact that it wasn't exactly like anything else out there. I can appreciate that. The cast wasn't the greatest but I still enjoyed myself. I you are reading this and you like fantasy sword and sorcery or even Tolkein type stuff I recommend this to you. Pay no attention to the low rating all that tells me is that a lot of people seem to expect everything coming out of Hollywood to be art and that is the last thing Hollywood is about. It's about entertainment and thrills and Beowulf definitely delivers.".

There were lots of action the stunts fighting sets and special effects were all done at a very high level. To me this was no B movie. The production and look of the film were first rate. Christopher Lambert probably isn't my first choice in leading men but he did his part well. The monsters looked cool and the babes were definitely juicy. I especially enjoyed the opening scenes when Beowulf rescued a girl from execution with lots of nifty fighting only to discover she had rather be dead than reenter the fortress where Grendel was hanging out. Was the movie true to the poem...who cares? One of the best things about the film was the fact that it wasn't exactly like anything else out there. I can appreciate that. The cast wasn't the greatest but I still enjoyed myself. I you are reading this and you like fantasy sword and sorcery or even Tolkein type stuff I recommend this to you. Pay no attention to the low rating all that tells me is that a lot of people seem to expect everything coming out of Hollywood to be art and that is the last thing Hollywood is about. It's about entertainment and thrills and Beowulf definitely delivers.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nikos Kazantzakis' novels lend themselves to cinematic treatment. Jules Dassin made a great adaptation of He Who Must Die and Michael Cacoyannis was equally successful in bringing Alexis Zorbas to the screen. Watching this film for a second time puts into perspective a lot of things that escape many a viewer the first time around.Michael Cacoyannis changed the order of events in the book as well as Nikos who he transforms into Basil the Englishman. The changes are not without merit since all the elements contribute to blend well together in the finished product. The director was fortunate to find such collaborators as Mikis Theodorakis the genial composer of the music score and Walter Lassally who photographed the barren area where most of the action takes place. Viewing the film on cable recently shows Lassally's crisp black and white photography in mint condition.The film is totally dominated by Zorba who is a figure larger than life as he takes Basil under his wing from the start. Anthony Quinn was a perfect choice for playing the title character. Mr. Quinn had worked with other brilliant directors Federico Fellini being one of them. It's almost impossible to think of Mr. Quinn as being an American because the magnificent transformation he undergoes here to portray Zorba.Alan Bates who is seen as Basil the Englishman of Greek descent who is going to Crete to see the family's land and mine. By underplaying Basil Mr. Bates set the right tone in sharp contrast with Anthony Quinn's exuberance. Alan Bates in the end made perfect sense with the way he played Basil.Lila Kedrova is another surprise in the film. She is the tragic Madame Hortense who has lived in the island for quite a while. It's ironic that love always eluded her until she finds in Zorba a reason for keep on living. Irene Papas is equally intense as the widow who is haunted by all the men in town. She has little to say but just a look from her smolders the screen be it for the lust she felt for Basil or the hatred for the town male population.Michael Cacoyannis uses these men as a sort of Greek Chorus so important in Greek tragedies. The same could be said of the older women of the town who resent the arrivals of strangers. The Greek cast one sees is quite effective in the context of the movie.Alexis Zorbas or Zorba the Greek is a film that will stay with the viewer for quite a while because of what the director accomplished with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Zorba again today on TCM 40 years after first seeing it as a young teenager. I was again entranced by the characters and the cinematography. In fact I had forgotten that it was shot in black and white but imagined it had been shot in vibrant color! I also have read the novel and while there is of course more detail and perhaps more depth in it the movie is one of the best adaptations of a book I have ever seen. I feel I must take issue with some reviewers who watched this movie through the lenses of 2006 and evidently did not understand the world described in Zorba. First of all even though the movie was shot in 1964 it takes place in the 20's from the look of the cars etc. The people and events on the island of Crete thus are what we today might see as primitive but nevertheless that was how things worked at that time and in that place. To label him Zorba the Creep is cute but only shows that reviewer's lack of historical understanding and possibly her lack of travel. A woman's place was indeed ruled by men and tribal justice was swift and often cruel. Therefore the movie may have seemed depressing misogynistic and unpleasant to you. Zorba was not a perfect person he could be mean as well as kind. But he had also experienced a lot in life including going to war and the death of his young son and he had learned how to pick himself up and go on despite great hardships. Thus Zorba embodied an instinctive and lifeaffirming principle never before seen by the uptight Englishman and this was something that moved and changed him even if he also was not perfect and did not react as we would have expected him to act today. The movie does not glorify or justify what happens but simply presents the facts and lets us draw our own lessons from them. Moreover the comment Threadbare plot and tiresome stereotypes abound in this movie...The story is sluggishly paced and rather tedious without a single line of fresh original dialogue really shows this reviewer's total lack of knowledge of film history. Rather than being Quinn's usual schtick this was the origination of a character that he then went on to play perhaps overplay in many subsequent movies. The dialogue is so beautiful that it has been copied to the degree that these reviewers found it derivative rather than realizing this movie is the template for the others that followed!! Lastly the novel and the screenplay were written by Greeks and the director was Greek. Therefore I hardly think they were being condescending or laying on the local color too thickly. These scenes and events had deep significance for them and from the tenor of the majority of reviews it meant something to others as well. Maybe it's that there can be beauty in life even though there is also great injustice that some people can be tolerant to some degree that there are moments that call for something nonanalytical like dancing in order to express the mix and chaos of our emotions.... One of the greatest things in this movie as I watched it for the second time was the moments of silence the lack of music bombastically intruding on the love scene the many communications carried by a look and no words. WHAT A GEM!!".

Gregarious Zorba is an eyeopener to the visiting stranger . At a tiny village the writer meets an old spinster woman named Madame Hortense Lila Kedrova was a win an Academy Award though Simone Signoret was the original choice for this role and turned it down and she came to regret that decision and a beautiful widow a young Irene Papas . Sensitive and thoughtprovoking film plenty of drama  emotion  Greek social habits and wonderful performances .Interesting and flavorful screenplay by the same filmmaker from Nikos Kazantzakis' novel who also wrote The last temptation of Christ. Special mention to Anthony Quinn as an uncomplicated and jolly man  an earthy and humble peasant with a real lust for life  a character he has become identified with . However  in the earlier stages of filming the filmmaker and Anthony Quinn had frequent disagreements as the director felt that his leading actor was being too overthetop . Alan Bates as a sensible as well as intellectual writer is also very good and the young beauty Irene Papas is marvelous as a widow who originates a tragedy . Extraordinary Lila Kedrova as an aging and dying courtesan she ended up receiving an Academy Award for her role. The original Broadway production of Zorba opened at the Imperial Theater in New York on November 16 1968 ran for 305 performances and was nominated for the 1969 Tony Award for the Best Musical. Anthony Quinn and Lila Kedrova who starred together in this movie version appeared in the revival of Zorba in 19823 with Lila Kedrova winning the 1984 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical . Gorgeous  enjoyable cinematography in white and black by Walter Lassally that also won deservedly an Oscar. Rousing and immortal soundtrack by Mikis Theodorakis based on Greek traditional music  including breathtaking dances performed by Anthony Quinn. However  Anthony Quinn had a broken foot during filming and thus couldn't perform the dance on the beach as scripted which called for much leaping around  instead he did a slow shuffle . This brooding motion picture was stunningly directed by Michael Cacoyannis though the project was turned down by every major studio . Cacoyannis was an expert on adaptations based upon Classic Greek plays such as Iphigenea  Elektra and The Trojan women . Zorba rating  Better than average  worthwhile watching . Essential and indispensable seeing for Anthony Quinn fans .".

The story of the relationship between an existential hero and a tormented man resonates with insight and wisdom.And best of all this is one of the very few movies that knows EXACTLY when to end.

	schema:reviewBody "I have not read the book of Zorba which I may do in order to find out if the book has any messages and actually says anything more than the film does. I assume and hope that it does. I was very relieved on reading the last few of the previous reviews here to find that some other viewers found the film depressing misogynistic and unpleasant.I agree as another reviewer suggested that it's most likely the soundtrack which made this a popular film. Or at least I hope that it is. I did not think I had a very high opinion of human nature but my opinion will have to be lowered even further if it's true that huge numbers of people actually enjoyed a film in which the two female characters are reviled made fun of and either murdered or have to see their house being looted around them as they die.Female sexuality in this film is treated as a either a pathetic joke or a threat. Even though Zorba is kind to the older woman as she dies for the rest of the film he treats her like dirt. He humors her while she's awake and thus presumably able to give him sexual favors but when she falls asleep he calls her a dirty bh and mocks her. After the young widow is murdered Zorba asks Why do the young die? as if she had just died some natural death instead of being murdered by the entire village. When the Englishman says that his books talk about the suffering of men who ask questions like Zorba's Zorba answers I spit on their suffering. That it seems is what the whole film is doing  showing immense suffering and cruelty but then saying that the only thing to do in the face of that suffering is to dance  rather than trying to do something to stop the cruelty.The one character in the film who seems to have a sensible human reaction to the horror around them is the apparent village idiot who screams at the villagers murderers! Killers! Perhaps that is the point here that the supposedly sane people are hideous murderers and only the idiot can see how psychotic the rest of the world is.If that is the intended point it's an interesting one. But I can't tell if the filmmakers were actually trying to make that point or if they think it's all right to go through life despising everyone around you never trying to help anyone and dancing.".

The message it left me with was that if you want to enjoy yourself you have to spend a lot of time actively ignoring that your neighbors deserve to be exterminated.Great performances were not a fair tradeoff for making me feel that people basically suck.";

How could anyone celebrate the positives about this movie when its negative feature so overwhelmingly colours its narrative?

It is nice to see that he had finally managed to make the Englishman break his shyness in the end.

The closing scene was extraordinary The two men dancing with a great music from Mikis Theodorakis I was also snapping my fingers while they were dancing... Another thing to note is that this is the first movie I watched that is played in Greece and shows the village life of it. I have realized so many similarities between the village lifes in Turkey and Greece and it prompted me to learn more and more about the Greek people and their culture. It is so pity that to see that Turks and Greeks could have helped each other than creating problems in the past. I hope things change for good.

The most admirable thing about the film is its simplicity inherited from neorealism something almost impossible to see in today's cinema and probably by the characteristics of our individualistic generation. The paradox in Zorba is in its simplicity traits that gain a splendid dimension. Everything is so well done that even slips end up being irrelevant though they exist. The film's occasional mistakes may be characterized by the adaptive relationship of Nikos Kazantzakis's novel with the script and direction signed by Michael Cacoyannis.By fragmenting a moment of life between the meeting of the young Basil Alan Bates with Zorba Anthony Quinn through the relations of work companionship and ending with the farewell of these friends we have in this fragment of moments insertions in style of chronicles of the Life that do not always punctuate or construct relations besides by centralizing the film in relaunching between these two friends we lose and in total merit by the artistic and interpretative quality very interesting figures like the brilliant Madame Hortense Lila Kedrova the Widow Irene Papas and the crazy  silly city Sotiris Moustakas. In addition to all these characters add the inhabitants of the village of Crete where most of the history goes which oscillate between a great chorus of representation of the local inhabitants and at other moments this mass of the population obtains the prowess of being the Protagonists of Zorba influencing in the plots and determining situations.Perhaps the weakest point of the script in the nonrelationship in particular with the women's history of the film the widow and Madame both seem to be a resource to symbolize a specific love relationship in the life of the two friends but Are only one in front of the others that have already come and the others that will still come by the way the film provides few clues about the past and even fewer about the future of the characters Zorba and Basil which is not a bad thing if there is something That neorealism clearly points out is the coming and going of stories that cross us.A special highlight for the photography of Walter Lassally and the art direction of Vassilis Photopoulos both deservedly awarded the Oscars in their respective categories and which are striking to this day a true composition class and artistic feature the reflection of this is remarkable also Quality of the movie.One aside that is necessary here is for the quality in the work of all the actors indisputably excellent with special attention to the female performance and in great prominence Anthony Quinn an undoubtedly enviable actor. When we know a little about the story of this Mexican actor who was boxing fighter ... finally when we know a little more about his life and career our chin falls and we are even more admired for his work. Quinn performed in Zorba a rare feat for many other actors composing a timeless character which until today is referenced and revered. Without doubt a brilliant work by an equally brilliant actor.".

Young Englishman meets middle age Greek man in his way to Crete who unabashedly asks him for employment. Englishman Basil accepts and takes Zorba as a kind of personal assistant. 15 minutes have passed and you still have 2 hours and 6 minutes to go!They meet aging French lady whom Zorba romances. Next we are introduced to the beautiful and inaccessible young widow of the town every man in town desires her but she doesn't like anyone so the men despise her. Basil has a kind gesture to her. 1 hour and 15 minutes to go  Basil and Zorba get their hands to try to put an old mine property of Basil to work Zorba gives us a few one liners calls the French lady a dirty old cow incites Basil to go and chase the widow and spend less time with books Zorba goes to town spends money that it's not his own with a young chick. 45 minutes to go  Basil finally decides to aboard the widow they spent the night together young boy in love with her kills himself town men go mad they kill the widow while Basil does nothing but to call for Zorba and Zorba defends the widow but leaves her alone amidst all the men  next the French lady dies while the villagers loot her house. Next the mining project fails but what the heck sht happens in life right? Basil and Zorba eat lamb they know Basil will soon depart and they dance in a long shot primarily designed to hide the fact that these are doubles who are dancing and not Alan Bates and Anthony Quinn end of the story thanks God because it already clocked 141 minutes. I don't mind to disrespect those who really like the movie and have a deep emotional connection to it. As I mentioned my own mother belongs to this group though a suspect her liking of this movie is more related to fond memories of her youth than to actual appreciation of the movie. I love Anthony Quinn as an actor my favorite movie of all times right now is La Strada. But in this film I think he was a real ham especially on the early scenes. And the accent was awful to me I have to admit I have heard very few Greeks speaking English but the accent wasn't believable enough for me it was more Mexican than anything else and it came and go along the movie. Alan Bates was completely comatose. I mean his character has spent what should be a passionate night with this gorgeous womanshe is killed and he has no feelings at all? No sadness? If he does this actor has nothing to demonstrate it. Lila Kedrova was much betterbut after spending a morning hearing a real Frenchwoman navigate through English didn't do much to convince me about Kedrova being a French lady. I know the Director won an Oscar and the Academy should know better but for some reason I didn't like it it came as pretentious and cheating but it maybe that I'm just going through a Fellini's period where my standards are too high. I especially detested the scene where Zorba is dancing outside Basil's bungalow. The fast editing shots between legs and torso are nothing to me but a mean to disguise that those weren't Quinn's legs doing the dance. About the script I beg to differ but I didn't found anything enlightening about human condition but the sense that man are cruel very cruel no matter if they are educated English writers or ignorant Greek adventures in any case the life of a woman has zero value and life has to go on eating and dancing and looking for new experiences. But again it maybe that my expectation was to find something similar to La Strada where a human being suffering does have an impact on the conscience and emotional life of a brutish man. These were some of the most excruciating 141 of my movie watching experiences but they were worthy now I don't have to accept from anybody the argument that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. If you think so I totally respect you and more power to you. It just doesn't fit on my greatest movies list. Maybe I'll give it another try in some twenty years If God gives me life of course and if the movie is still preserved in some mean and I'll see if my opinion changed. Meanwhile this movie belongs to the category I'll see it again if you put a gun on my head and force me to.".

There is not one likeable character in the entire film.  Zorba is a jackass who fs up the lives of everyone he comes in contact with because of his selfish zest for life i.e. wasting other people's time and money while lying to them.  He's a man who has left his wife and family behind with no regret and works odd jobs including wrecking Basil's mine and depleting his money.  Basil thinks this is wonderful.  Why?  It's almost as if Basil has latent gay love for Zorba.  One of the 2 most disturbing moments in the film is when the widow Irene Pappas is murdered in broad daylight by a crowd which is angry that she has somehow driven an unrequited lover to suicide.  Basil does nothing even though the widow's his love interest interestingly though Basil did not previously sleep with the widow.  Zorba tries to protect the widow but she's still murdered her throat slit like a lamb to the slaughter.  INCREDIBLY Zorba and Basil go on about their business like this is some sort of acceptable crime.  WHAT THE HELL!!   The level of mysogyny is disturbing.Then when the French hotel woman dies the authordirector maligns the poor villagers and the people of Greece by making them look like vultures that steal her possessions before she's even croaked.  This isn't a celebration of life but a sad portrayal of common people as evil idiots.  I wish this story had never been made into a film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Cacoyannis was an extremely promising filmmaker prior to making Zorba the Greek. His films The Girl in Black Stella and especially A Matter of Dignity were remarkable for their intelligence and incisive portraits of modern Greek society. Even his most successful film prior to Zorba  his adaptation of Euripides' Elektra  was gripping even if it considerably foreshortened the classical tragedy. The success of those films persuaded Hollywood to beckon Cacoyannis away from Greece and Zorba the Greek was the result.The film is a star vehicle for Anthony Quinn which is not a bad thing if you're a Quinn fan. If you aren't there is always the splendid Alan Bates in the role of a milquetoast writer and the stunning Irene Papas as the village widow. But then there is the altogether awful performance of Lila Kedrova as a French cocotte far past her prime. It's not hard to believe that she won an Oscar for the performance. But the real problem with the film is Nikos Kazantzakis' terrible novel. Modern Greek literature has produced at least two worldclass poets  Cavafy and Ritsos. There have also been several lesser poets two of whom nevertheless won Nobel Prizes George Seferis and Odysseus Elytis. But Kazantzakis was not a part of this effluence of demotic Greek talent. He was a selftormenting Christian on the order of Kierkegaard whose mediocrity did not prevent him from writing an unreadable sequel to Homer's Odyssey.Zorba was aiming at a picaresque portrayal of Greek and Cretan types but fails to inspire much sympathy for them. In fact the villagers in the story which Cacoyannis follows closely are portrayed as vicious and spiteful committing such acts of heartless savagery that no explanation could possibly make sense of it. The film simply leaves the two incidents hanging and blithely proceeds with the story as if nothing had happened. These gaffes leave the film full of holes. And even the ridiculous final failure at the film's conclusion cannot excuse the cute and ultimately stupid little dance in which Quinn and Bates engage supposedly expressing some kind of acceptance of the absurdity of life. Can any honest viewer conceive of concluding this bitter and unedifying experience with a dance? A quick run back to the video store might be a happier resolution.".

Kazantzakis never did anything less than honest and his work exemplifies a constant struggle to always ascend always understand always climb a neverending mountainside.  Trying not to ruin either ending the book or the movie I will say that the film's more viewerfriendly ending deprives the story of Alexis Zorba of a very important feature and a very important points that Kazantzakis makes in the novel.Read the book and if you're so moved then go watch the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved Jud Suss both the film and the character.Loving this movie was disturbing. Jud Suss was commissioned and overseen by Joseph Goebbels Hitler's propaganda minister and Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War. The film was shown before Nazis began rounding up Jews. Jud Suss played a direct horrific role in the Holocaust. You can't talk about this film without that nightmare hovering over every word you say.I ended up writing a long essay entitled Loving Jud Suss. The essay is now linked from my homepage. I hope interested readers will have a look and share their thoughts. I'll try to convey the gist here.First this is a wellmade vintage costume melodrama slash swashbuckler. If you like Golden Age blackandwhite big budget studio adaptations of popular novels set in the eighteenth century chances are you could enjoy many aspects of this film palace intrigue fast pace romance period detail.I watched Jud Suss as if on split screens. The Nazis want the viewer to see an amoral crafty Jew who destroys the life of a German city Stuttgart by introducing ballet flirtation and parties by instituting a tax to improve the region's poor roads and by allowing Jews entry to the city. I resisted what the Nazis wanted me to see. I like ballet. I live in a state with toll roads good roads have to be paid for somehow. I don't think that allowing Jews or any minority out of their ghetto and into previously segregated neighborhoods is a bad thing.I could also see what the Nazis did not want me to see. I could see how the film lays bare the self pity sense of personal victimization and exaggerated view of the power of the other that is at the heart of racism and prejudice. The main German characters in Jud Suss are pathetic. Faber is a ninetypound weakling and insufferable bigot. He can't even consummate a kiss never mind a marriage with his beloved Dorothea. Dorothea is beautiful but simpleminded and insincere. She wants Suss but can't handle her own desire. Councilman Sturm Rader and Duke Karl Alexander are all obese shouting ineffectual old men. That Nazis held up blowhard Sturm and prissy bigot Faber as the heroes of the piece tells you how skewed  and how foreign to our modern sensibilities  was the Nazi value system.In seeing both what the Nazis wanted me to see and what they did not want me to see I could see the absurdity and ethical and intellectual bankruptcy of Nazi ideology. That exercise made this one of the most fascinating film watching experiences I've ever had.Ferdinand Marian as Joseph SussOppenheimer made this movie. He is on screen for almost the entire film even when he is not he is the super potent center of others' attention. Marian's is one of the most riveting charismatic performances I've ever seen. I could not take my eyes off him from his first scene to the last.Offscreen events add to the unforgettable quality of Marian's performance. The story is that Marian did not want to take this role and was so distraught when Goebbels forced him into it that he got drunk and destroyed his own apartment with an ax. Marian died in a car accident and the rumor is that he killed himself because of this role and its horrible history.All the principles involved in Jud Suss made some excuse or another to try to get out of it. Goebbels tightened the screws and forced them into it. They later claimed that they did everything they could to make Suss as sympathetic as possible under the circumstances.I read Ferdinand Marian's Jud Suss as an unforgettably sympathetic character. Even as I was watching the film even as I was seeing it on a split screen with the Nazi version on one side and my own interpretation on another I also saw the tumultuous surrounding events. I saw the real Joseph Suss Oppenheimer an historical figure who was tortured and executed in eighteenthcentury Stuttgart. His killers kept his body on display for six years. I saw Ferdinand Marian the actor forced to act in a film he wanted no part of. I saw Jud Suss the character in the movie a lone Jew surrounded by bigoted narrow primitive protoNazis who made his and their own lives a misery because they insisted that only Jews could be so perverse as to bring culture modernity and eroticism to a decent clean lifeless German city. My sympathy overflowed for Suss the character Marian the actor and the historical SussOppenheimer. A Nazi propaganda film achieved the feat of rendering the German characters in the film universally repulsive and the one Jewish character irresistibly sympathetic. That being the case it's all the more tragic that Marian ended his own life over this role.Scholars emphasize the charisma and appeal of Marian's depiction. In fact the director Veit Harlan reported that Marian received baskets of love letters. It is more than a bit weird that one of the sexiest overtly Jewish characters in the history of cinema is a character in a Nazi propaganda film.".

	schema:headline " Anything but a Beloved Children's Author";
	schema:reviewBody "From his opening scene of ringed fingers running greedily over gems and jewels to his pathetic cries for salvation at his hanging the historically accurate portrayal of Court Jew Suss Oppenheimer is a brilliant work of filmpropaganda and an eyeopening understanding of the Nazi perspective. Except for the slobbery and entranced German Duke  caught under Oppenheimer's spell  Germans come across as a clean clean shaven proud culturally profound and subjugated people oppressed by Oppenheimer's avaricious rule and his grant of Jews into Wrttemberg. The classic elements of predator and prey people versus government and occasionally at the expense of art good against evil are employed to paint a masterpiece of propaganda layering Oppenheimer and the Jewish people with every conceivable ingredient of wickedness. The film shows little patience though not without artfulness with portraying Oppenheimer as a devious Jew giving up even his despicable values shaving his beard for his gluttonous ambitions. Through a short dialogue with a fellow Jew it is clear that Oppenheimer is a clever character adept with human manipulation and ready with some soothing and sly words for a quick fix in a tricky situation. He thus wins over the Duke by giving him what the Estate could not. From the soft young flesh of the Wrttemberg women to absolute power Oppenheimer is always ready to provide the Duke all his evil desires. It is interesting to note that the film depicted the Duke as a skuzzy individual from the beginning and did not show what could have been the gradual degenerative effect of Oppenheimer on him. This might have been done to maintain a sense of realism and integrity of the film's art or .How can we ever defeat the Jew? He is so much cleverer than us.He is not cleverer only more cunning.This exchange between two German citizens living under Oppenheimer's oppressive rule reveals a common fear and sentiment shared by most Germans at the time. The Jews were thought to be anything but an unintelligent race rather it was their cunning and desire to fulfill their Lord's will and rule the world in secret as the hunchbacked rabbi told Oppenheimer is what truly frightened the Germans. Levi Oppenheimer's right hand man at times even annoys Oppenheimer with his hyperJewish mores. His beady eyes beard side curls black dress and scratchy voice make him a freakish and chilling character waiting to foil the fight of the Estate's citizens with his Talmudic logic and biting wit. Memorable images include Levi eyes wide open violently rubbing his inkstained hands together while plotting the downfall of those against Oppenheimer and Levi and Oppenheimer eavesdropping on a conversation behind a wall surrounded by rats and insects. Beyond the murky physical images hanging over the Jews Jude Suss brings a compelling psychological aspect into play being careful to inform German viewers of Jew's parasitical nature natural propensity towards evil and metropolitan sophistication the near nihilistic forgoing of values from days gone by.In most of the scenes filled with German characters booming symphonies filter through the images filling them with grandeur. Contrasting this is Oppenheimer's introduction a smart but stale dialogue between two conspirators without any music at all. Music also plays an important role with the unison between Faber and Dorthea two young lovers growing up while Oppenheimer is in power. Their love duets evoke nostalgia and even an innocence of long ago or life before the Jew. This is a direct mirror of Volkist philosophy and the absence of pretty music in Jew occupied scenes is a powerful ignition to the subconscious.Jude Suss climaxes to Faber's torture Dorthea's rape and drowning the death of the Duke arrest of Oppenheimer and his hanging. The last moments of film are enwrapped in a slow snow fall focusing in on Faber's sorrow as a representation of the Jewish consequence. Although Oppenheimer is hanged and the Jews are forced to leave Wrttemberg the director manages to inject the nagging question of what if into his audience. What if Oppenheimer was never let into Wrttemberg to begin with? What if the Estate had acted faster and seized control of Oppenheimer's power before it was too late? What if the Germans of 1940 longing for a land of language culture and time before the imprisoning JudeoChristian ideology annihilated the Jewish race and lived the life they dreamed of?".

The classic elements of predator and prey people versus government and occasionally at the expense of art good against evil are employed to paint a masterpiece of propaganda layering Oppenheimer and the Jewish people with every conceivable ingredient of wickedness. The film shows little patience though not without artfulness with portraying Oppenheimer as a devious Jew giving up even his despicable values shaving his beard for his gluttonous ambitions. Through a short dialogue with a fellow Jew it is clear that Oppenheimer is a clever character adept with human manipulation and ready with some soothing and sly words for a quick fix in a tricky situation. He thus wins over the Duke by giving him what the Estate could not. From the soft young flesh of the Wrttemberg women to absolute power Oppenheimer is always ready to provide the Duke all his evil desires. It is interesting to note that the film depicted the Duke as a skuzzy individual from the beginning and did not show what could have been the gradual degenerative effect of Oppenheimer on him. This might have been done to maintain a sense of realism and integrity of the film's art or .How can we ever defeat the Jew? He is so much cleverer than us.He is not cleverer only more cunning.This exchange between two German citizens living under Oppenheimer's oppressive rule reveals a common fear and sentiment shared by most Germans at the time. The Jews were thought to be anything but an unintelligent race rather it was their cunning and desire to fulfill their Lord's will and rule the world in secret as the hunchbacked rabbi told Oppenheimer is what truly frightened the Germans. Levi Oppenheimer's right hand man at times even annoys Oppenheimer with his hyperJewish mores. His beady eyes beard side curls black dress and scratchy voice make him a freakish and chilling character waiting to foil the fight of the Estate's citizens with his Talmudic logic and biting wit. Memorable images include Levi eyes wide open violently rubbing his inkstained hands together while plotting the downfall of those against Oppenheimer and Levi and Oppenheimer eavesdropping on a conversation behind a wall surrounded by rats and insects. Beyond the murky physical images hanging over the Jews Jude Suss brings a compelling psychological aspect into play being careful to inform German viewers of Jew's parasitical nature natural propensity towards evil and metropolitan sophistication the near nihilistic forgoing of values from days gone by.In most of the scenes filled with German characters booming symphonies filter through the images filling them with grandeur. Contrasting this is Oppenheimer's introduction a smart but stale dialogue between two conspirators without any music at all. Music also plays an important role with the unison between Faber and Dorthea two young lovers growing up while Oppenheimer is in power. Their love duets evoke nostalgia and even an innocence of long ago or life before the Jew. This is a direct mirror of Volkist philosophy and the absence of pretty music in Jew occupied scenes is a powerful ignition to the subconscious.Jude Suss climaxes to Faber's torture Dorthea's rape and drowning the death of the Duke arrest of Oppenheimer and his hanging. The last moments of film are enwrapped in a slow snow fall focusing in on Faber's sorrow as a representation of the Jewish consequence. Although Oppenheimer is hanged and the Jews are forced to leave Wrttemberg the director manages to inject the nagging question of what if into his audience. What if Oppenheimer was never let into Wrttemberg to begin with? What if the Estate had acted faster and seized control of Oppenheimer's power before it was too late? What if the Germans of 1940 longing for a land of language culture and time before the imprisoning JudeoChristian ideology annihilated the Jewish race and lived the life they dreamed of?";

It's been long so I couldn't give a detailed summery of what exactly happened however the plot wasn't what stayed with me anyway. What registered more than anything was that this was a propaganda film intended to convince the audience that Jews were evil. It is not that the villain  whom I remember to be partly intriguing partly repulsive  just happens to be Jewish. The final scene makes it quite clear that he is the way he is because he is Jewish. It's when the film abandons all subtlety and decides to give its message a final hit with a hammer to assure it's been properly driven into the heads of the audience.I find it quite impossible to judge this film under any other than the propaganda aspect. While it may be a decent film a far as technical apect are concerned it is nothing anyone could watch purely for his or her amusement at least not if they know about the historical background and people in Germany are probably even more aware of this than anyone else. I cannot ignore that this film was meant to sow hatred and nor do I want to. All other questions whether the acting and directing were good or whether the dialogues were wellwritten are of secondary importance to me. Certainly the film was wellmade  how else would it have worked so well?  but even this doesn't make it into something watchable or entertaining.".

It didn't seem to bother him for years after making the film...IF such guilt was the reason. How would anyone know anyhow. All nonsense. Is the same yardstick applied to the movies made by Hollywood during the 1940s thru today which constantly makes anything German look evil? No. Bruce Willis films show evil characters with German names andor German accents. Get a life.".

This was based on a real case and a further novel by Jewish author Lion Feuchtwanger  obviously the Nazis completely distorted the source material so that this film is completely antiSemitic. The movie was a huge success at its time  millions of Germans watched it and SS boss Heinrich Himmler made viewing the movie mandatory for every member of his organization. Today the film is banned in Germany.In 18th century Germany the foolish duke of Wurttenberg decides to make the Jewish businessman Joseph Suss Oppenheimmer his financial adviser. Soon disaster will come to the dukedom in the form of a higher cost of living under advice from Suss the duke sharply rises all sort of taxes. Suss also advices the duke to let the Jews enter Wurttenberg from where they were banned from residing. Eventually the members of Wurttenberg council decides to rise against the duke and his adviser.Ironically in some ways the message of the movie looks different today than originally intended. To a modern audience the Germans in the movie are so nave ignorant and narrow minded that they seem off putting while Suss appears to be until he turns into a rapist and torturer toward the end not such a bad guy just a sharp quick if a bit ethically loose businessman. Putting tolls in the roads of Wurttenberg doesn't look to be such a bad thing while the politicians of the council opposing Suss seem uptight arrogant and pompous. The character of Faber seems an unbearable prejudiced young hothead while his wife Dorothea the Christian girl Suss strives for and that will be one of the causes of his downfall played by Kristina Soderbaum wife of director Veit Harlan is so dumb and foolish one feels she is not really worth the trouble. Even the portrayal of the rabbi of the community seems almost positive to a modern audience he tells Suss to be very careful in his political dealings with the Germans lest this backfire on the Jewish community. In this way the movie takes for granted the anti Jewish prejudices of the German people of the day that we no longer take for granted. Ferdinand Marian gives an amazing multifaceted performance as the cunning but magnetic Suss without him the movie would be far less powerful than it is. Finally I give this movie a high rating because I think is very well made  I certainly find its message hateful.".

	schema:headline " The Most Vile Interpretation";
	schema:reviewBody "The life and unhappy end of said life for Joseph Oppenheimer the famous Jew Suss has been interpreted in many ways over the years in a variety of medium. The most vile interpretation was that done in this 1940 film personally produced and supervised by Joseph Goebbels.The real Oppenheimer was out of Vienna where he had done considerable business with the Catholic Hapsburgs and moved to the Wurttemberg area where he came to the attention of the heir to Duchy of Wurttemberg who after he became Duke made Oppenheimer his first minister.Duke Karl Alexander played by Heinrich George is an ambitious fellow who would like to create a miniature Versailles over in Stuttgart an ambition that a number of German heads of state wanted to emulate including Frederick the Great over in Prussia. Ferdinand Marian as Oppenheimer is a worldly high living fellow himself who provides a number of financial schemes that increase the Duke's treasury. Of course while doing it he arouses the ire of the local Lutheran gentry. After Duke Karl Alexander dies the burghers of Stuttgart do to Oppenheimer precisely what you see in Jew Suss.Without the religious component the closest thing approximating this story was that of Nicolas Fouquet Louis XIV's minister of finance over in France. He lived high on the hog too high in the opinion of his king. Fouquet was however first given exile and then had the sentence commuted to life in prison.What Oppenheimer's story played into was a latent antiSemitism already instilled in the population by Martin Luther. During the course of the movie the burghers of Stuttgart warn the Duke of Luther's warnings about how vile those Jews are but the Duke fails to heed. The Catholic Hapsburg connection isn't brought in as the Austrians were now part of the Reich.The real Oppenheimer was accused of being an agent for those Hapsburgs in real life. But here he's the agent of a deep and nebulous Jewish conspiracy to take over Wurttemberg. Today Wurttemberg tomorrow the world. Like Jews always do he's got designs on Aryan women and in his sites here is Krista Soderburg a Swedish actress married to the director of Jew Suss Veit Harlan who always played the prototype of Aryan women in German films. Her being debauched and later suicide sparks all the latent hatred against Oppenheimer that gets unleashed with the demise of Duke Karl Alexander. Her Aryan sweetheart played by Malte Jager leads the mob against Oppenheimer.Again in real life Oppenheimer was a worldly sort who never had any trouble getting women to give up the goods. A whole lot like Fouquet over in France but again we have the religious component here.Mind you this same story had been filmed six years earlier over in Great Britain with the exiled Conrad Veidt playing Oppenheimer. In that version Oppenheimer is endowed with saintly qualities and is a martyr saintly qualities the real Oppenheimer probably would have scorned. It's fascinating the different spin you can give especially if you're in the propaganda game. Joe Goebbels the little club footed maniac who ran German cinema as part of the Propaganda Ministry had a casting couch that dwarfed any in Hollywood and anything that Oppenheimer in real life could ever dream of.I won't put a rating on Jew Suss this is such a vile story meant to inflame antiSemitism and succeeding horribly. This was required viewing for people entering the S.S. those who became guards at the concentration camps. It was vile when it occurred in real life and viler yet when told by the Nazis in this film.".

Similar propaganda although not involving Jews is made today against communists and all other groups not joining the holy American world of business and it is here that this film becomes much more interesting and revealing. If the unfortunate attacks on Jews in this film would have been let out and the rest was left then we would have a most intelligent film attacking business and everything that goes with it. The main character teaches the stupid duke how he can turn power into money and money into power. He teaches what capitalism is at the core namely this ability to freeze the efforts of the people in currency which can be transformed back to efforts back and forth at will. Without the possibilities of these transformations there could be no power. The film also reveals how people who are used to business are most helpful lackeys to power since there deeply rooted habit of legalized theft  business makes them reliable tools for any immoral dealings that could be wished for on the side of power. I give this film at least 6 stars if not more because I find it harmless to nonmorons that will never buy the racism which incidentally even contradicts itself in that there is a black servant in a smaller role who also helps the people against the Jew a smart move by the director who thereby reveals that maybe he is not a true racist.

	schema:reviewBody "In this film I show primordial Judaism as it was then and as it has remained until today substantially unchanged. In contrast to international Judiasm there is only the Jew Sss the elegant court financial adviser the treacherous schemer in short the disguised Jew. Veit Harlan DER FILM Berlin January 20 1940 In 1737 GermanJewish financier Josef Sss Oppenheimer stood trial for fraud embezzlement treason lecherous relations with the court ladies and accepting bribes and Veit Harlan's antiSemetic propaganda piece is the Nazi prosecution to Lothar Mendes' 1934 British defense film of the same name. In the early eighteenth century no Jews were allowed to enter Stuttgart and the crafty Jew Sss vows to get in and open the way for the rest of his people. Indebted to the moneylender the weakwilled blustery lech Duke Karl Alexander allows him in and makes Sss his financial adviser against the advice of the governing Counsel. Soon the city begins to buckle under the heavy taxation and rampant inflation and after he begins pimping for his sovereign Sss persuades the Duke to lift the ban on Jews. Next Sss urges him to disband the Council and proclaim himself absolute monarch but after Sss rapes a Councilman's daughter and she commits suicide the people rise up and revolt causing the death of the Duke. Despite his protests that he was just a poor Jew following orders Sss is tried convicted and executed strung up in a bird cage high above the village square where in real life his corpse hung for six years as a constant reminder. Jews aren't wise only clever. The Jews are cast out of Stuttgart again and the film's closing speech warns future generations to do the same ...for the sake of the children. Correlations between both Rasputin and the court of Versailles are evoked and the Lord is invoked just as often to condemn Jewry in no uncertain terms. One Councilman reads from Luther a Lutheran bible? which says that outside of the Devil man has no worse enemy than the Jew and God wants them scattered like ashes across the earth which gave me a bad ISIS vibe but despite the reprehensible message there's no denying director Harlan had a sure hand when it came to staging public unrest and the pomp of court intrigue. Lead actor Ferdinand Marian was reminiscent of Hollywood's Joseph Shildkraut in MGM's MARIE ANTOINETTE and he also knew his craft. Commissioned by the Third Reich's Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels JUD S is almost as melodramatic and just as lavish as its British counterpart with the same attention to detail and long unseen had acquired a mythically horrific reputation over time. Objectionable to modern audiences everywhere except the Middle East the film was a big hit in Nazi Germany when first released. Reexamined of late Veit Harlan's key historical document...remains a deeply unsettling cinematic experience with a legit restored DVD release.After the war director Harlan stood trial for crimes against humanity and insisted that not only was he ordered to make the film he actually managed to tone it down considerably. He was given a light sentence and his artistic reputation has been somewhat rehabilitated in recent years. The film's Jew Sss Ferdinand Marian was similarly accused and committed suicide in 1946. Although I'm no scholar on the subject like everything else the truth about Jew Sss most likely lies somewhere between the British canonization and the Nazi demonization and the contrast between the two films is both fascinating and enlightening. Ironically Harlan's ANDERS ALS DU UND ICH Different From You And Me 1957 was another long unseen shocker that was alleged to have done for gays what JUD S did for Jews but seeing both the cut and uncut versions now its clear Harlan's film was much more sensitive for the time anyway than the homophobic German censor's cut.".

Indebted to the moneylender the weakwilled blustery lech Duke Karl Alexander allows him in and makes Sss his financial adviser against the advice of the governing Counsel. Soon the city begins to buckle under the heavy taxation and rampant inflation and after he begins pimping for his sovereign Sss persuades the Duke to lift the ban on Jews. Next Sss urges him to disband the Council and proclaim himself absolute monarch but after Sss rapes a Councilman's daughter and she commits suicide the people rise up and revolt causing the death of the Duke. Despite his protests that he was just a poor Jew following orders Sss is tried convicted and executed strung up in a bird cage high above the village square where in real life his corpse hung for six years as a constant reminder. Jews aren't wise only clever. The Jews are cast out of Stuttgart again and the film's closing speech warns future generations to do the same ...for the sake of the children. Correlations between both Rasputin and the court of Versailles are evoked and the Lord is invoked just as often to condemn Jewry in no uncertain terms. One Councilman reads from Luther a Lutheran bible? which says that outside of the Devil man has no worse enemy than the Jew and God wants them scattered like ashes across the earth which gave me a bad ISIS vibe but despite the reprehensible message there's no denying director Harlan had a sure hand when it came to staging public unrest and the pomp of court intrigue. Lead actor Ferdinand Marian was reminiscent of Hollywood's Joseph Shildkraut in MGM's MARIE ANTOINETTE and he also knew his craft. Commissioned by the Third Reich's Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels JUD S is almost as melodramatic and just as lavish as its British counterpart with the same attention to detail and long unseen had acquired a mythically horrific reputation over time. Objectionable to modern audiences everywhere except the Middle East the film was a big hit in Nazi Germany when first released. Reexamined of late Veit Harlan's key historical document...remains a deeply unsettling cinematic experience with a legit restored DVD release.After the war director Harlan stood trial for crimes against humanity and insisted that not only was he ordered to make the film he actually managed to tone it down considerably. He was given a light sentence and his artistic reputation has been somewhat rehabilitated in recent years. The film's Jew Sss Ferdinand Marian was similarly accused and committed suicide in 1946. Although I'm no scholar on the subject like everything else the truth about Jew Sss most likely lies somewhere between the British canonization and the Nazi demonization and the contrast between the two films is both fascinating and enlightening. Ironically Harlan's ANDERS ALS DU UND ICH Different From You And Me 1957 was another long unseen shocker that was alleged to have done for gays what JUD S did for Jews but seeing both the cut and uncut versions now its clear Harlan's film was much more sensitive for the time anyway than the homophobic German censor's cut.";

The purpose was to solidify hatred against the Jewsnot only in Germany but throughout occupied Europe. How much this contributed to the Europeans often embracing the deportation and execution of the Jews is debatable but it surely had SOME effect.The film purports to be a true story about a German state in the 18th century where Jews insinuated themselves into the government and then began taking advantage of the good Christian people. The Jewish atrocities included murder rape and excessive taxationand ultimately the people rose up against their idiot Duke due to his complicity in these injustices.As far as the technical aspects of the film goes you can see that UFA studios had great actors sets and directors. The film looks greatlike a Hollywood product. So I cannot just give the film a score of 1 due to its evil and sinister plot. Plus while a complete lie the plot did workit does arouse hatred and fear of the Jewsmeaning it was great propaganda. Evil but great in its own sick way The film is well worth seeing unless you actually believe the insane notions of an international Jewish conspiracyand from a historical aspect it's a sad but fascinating look into the Nazi psyche.By the way I also recently saw a fascinating documentary entitled Harlan In the Shadow of Jew Suess and it would make a great companion piece to watching Jew Suess. It's about the director Veit Harlan and how his family to this day reacts the this viciously antisemitic film. Some are naturally very apologetic and their lives have been altered by this genetic connection while others are unapologetic and think that everyone should just forget and accept that Harlan was supposedly forced to make this film. Fascinating viewing that's for sure.".

It was my mother who brought me there when I was about 11 years old my father was a soldier in Russia. It was a sad moment when my mother left. but it was soon forgotten with all the regimented activity that we were submitted to. I was in that school till about 3 months before the war ended when my mother asked for my release as my father was missing in Russia she was concerned about my safety all the bombing and the Russian advances. I could have been called a Nazi as much as you can call a 13 year old a fanatic of any political persuasion but serious doubts came to mind towards the end and the demise of National Socialism was no big loss to me. The final proof of the brutality of the regime was when a list of people to be arrested and sent to a Concentration Camp was found in the Ortsgruppenleiters Party Mayor office with my mothers name on it. Reason my removal from the Napola. I am now 74 years old and have been living in Australia for 52 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Napola at the Montreal World Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. This choice of a random movie turned out to be a real cinematographic gem. Set during World War II this movie is about the dilemma and choices of some German teenagers who attend a napola  a special institution for gifted boys to turn them into the Nazi elite. Their days consist of military training and indoctrination they are forced to lose all pity and become ruthless servants of the Fuhrer. The story follows the entrance of Friedrich into a napola the changes that he undergoes and the choices that he makes. Admitted because of his boxing skills he seizes it as an opportunity to escape his poor working class situation. His best friend at the napola is the Governor's son  sensitive caring humane and opposed to Nazi dogma he is obviously in the wrong place but has no choice but to fulfill his dad's wishes. As their friendship develops Friedrich struggles between the ideology that the napola is forcing upon him and his friend's pacific beliefs. This powerful film with excellent acting culminates on the boxing ring as Friedrich fights against the champion from another napola. The scene of the morning practice on the frozen lake left me breathless while the ending of the grenade throwing session shook me with its passion despair and horror.Another reason why I liked this movie so much is that it is made by Germans indeed one would expect Hollywood to come up with such a story and that the outcome would be a highly emotional melodrama. I could feel the director disagreeing strongly with the Nazis but rather than feeling shameful for what his countrymen did 60 years ago he denounced it. Indeed Friedrich's ultimate choice should be the choice of the new Germany.My rating 910".

	schema:headline " Dead Nazis Society";
	schema:reviewBody "NAPOLA is on screen in a German Film festival touring Australia and like DOWNFALL may get a proper cinema release. It is certainly a commercial film. Not unlike Dead Poets Society but in a Nazi sports academy instead NAPOLA features an exceptionally good looking cast and really absorbing locations and detail. I found it quite an experience to sit with a largely German audience many of whom were clearly old age couples and a lot of 30 somethings who were Jewish. Those Anglos like me and my friends enjoyed the atmosphere provided by the audience as much as this very well made film. It is the first time ever I have been able to really feel what I have always only imagined a true sense of the thrill that German WW2 teenagers had by joining an elite Nazi regime their sense of belong to something that was glorious and encompassing. Some more brutal elements from the teachers and Nazi hierarchy I personally found not too far removed from my experience of Catholic school in late antivietnam 1968! Sorry about that but it really did. Another person commenting on this page is angry that the film is misleading from his genuine Napola experience and it is well worth reading his comments as he was actually there in 3842. I am sure he would know. However for today NAPOLA needs to speak to a new audience and present an experience in a new and idealized way to people who have only imagined what it was like I think the film must fit that in order to succeed as a film in 2005. I found that acceptable. There is many strong physical and emotional scenes the teen casting is quite ideal and the castle location is eerie and medieval and exactly what I have seen in Hitler Youth Documentaries turrets Nazi flags flames stone walls etc....it all looks evocative and thrilling in cinemascope. For a 20 something audience this film succeeds well for them those older might see it as a Nazi pantomime with overtones and snowy style of The Emperor's Club or Dead Poets Society. But for a look into a thrilling and brutal world of elite Nazi sports and harsh idealism NAPOLA is a very commercial and visually successful film. One sensational scene under the ice on a lake is right out of DAMIEN OMEN 2 and a bit of TITANIC thrown in as well. It is a great scene and quite heartbreaking.

If NAPOLA gets a commercial release I would certainly suggest you see it it delivers what we as an audience want to see in a Nazi teen movie especially with ideal casting and production values.

	onyx:emotionText "NAPOLA is on screen in a German Film festival touring Australia and like DOWNFALL may get a proper cinema release. It is certainly a commercial film. Not unlike Dead Poets Society but in a Nazi sports academy instead NAPOLA features an exceptionally good looking cast and really absorbing locations and detail. I found it quite an experience to sit with a largely German audience many of whom were clearly old age couples and a lot of 30 somethings who were Jewish. Those Anglos like me and my friends enjoyed the atmosphere provided by the audience as much as this very well made film. It is the first time ever I have been able to really feel what I have always only imagined a true sense of the thrill that German WW2 teenagers had by joining an elite Nazi regime their sense of belong to something that was glorious and encompassing. Some more brutal elements from the teachers and Nazi hierarchy I personally found not too far removed from my experience of Catholic school in late antivietnam 1968! Sorry about that but it really did. Another person commenting on this page is angry that the film is misleading from his genuine Napola experience and it is well worth reading his comments as he was actually there in 3842. I am sure he would know. However for today NAPOLA needs to speak to a new audience and present an experience in a new and idealized way to people who have only imagined what it was like I think the film must fit that in order to succeed as a film in 2005. I found that acceptable. There is many strong physical and emotional scenes the teen casting is quite ideal and the castle location is eerie and medieval and exactly what I have seen in Hitler Youth Documentaries turrets Nazi flags flames stone walls etc....it all looks evocative and thrilling in cinemascope. For a 20 something audience this film succeeds well for them those older might see it as a Nazi pantomime with overtones and snowy style of The Emperor's Club or Dead Poets Society. But for a look into a thrilling and brutal world of elite Nazi sports and harsh idealism NAPOLA is a very commercial and visually successful film. One sensational scene under the ice on a lake is right out of DAMIEN OMEN 2 and a bit of TITANIC thrown in as well. It is a great scene and quite heartbreaking. The use of snowflakes is particularly emotional in several scenes. If NAPOLA gets a commercial release I would certainly suggest you see it it delivers what we as an audience want to see in a Nazi teen movie especially with ideal casting and production values. I also find it quite interesting to see modern German film makers explaining the Nazi past in what seems to be a brave attempt at being honest about its seduction of morals and values and visual excitement.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about the a type of Nazi school called the NPEA which means NAtional POLitische erziehungs Anstalt National Political Education Institute design to train the future Gauleiters heads of Nazi Districts of the world. Napola was the popular name for the schools just as Nazi was for NAtional soZIalist. The movie starts in Berlin during the middle of the second world war. A young Friedrich fights in a boxing match and ends up impressing a teacher at the Napola school for the Nazi Elite. In the end he gets an invitation to attend the school.The film heavily leverages contrasts. Friedrich is a simple boy of non remarkable parents the father could be communist one of the Nazi party's strongest foes who forges his fathers signature to get into the school. At one point we are introduced to one of Friedrich's roommates. Sigfried has a bed wetting problem and is made a public example of. Later during an exercises with live grenades he sacrifices himself to save his friends. He gets a hero's death. The teacher that made a public example of him runs on the other hand leaving the boys in harms way. It was the weakling bed wetter that saves the day. Here we also have the biblical image in play of a man laying his life down for his friends.Albrecht the best friend of Friedrich is a poet and tends more to the artistic side of life. He is fond of writing poetry while his father who is the Nazi Gauleiter of the region has a very brutal side which will become apparent in the movie. His father despises him for his weakness but takes Friedrich as a man after his own heart after a demonstration at his home.The students are called to help in an action. Certain events happen that cause both Albrech and Friedrich to question themselves and their future. Albrech uses his writing skills to protest what had happened. The consequence is very severe unless he writes a retraction. He does not. Instead he chooses a different way that traumatizes Friedrich and brings shame to his father. Friedrich suddenly sees things through Albrecht's eyes and decides to do something on his own.The message of the movie is clear. Success in this school is not necessarily determined by intelligencebut rather brutishness. Those who have any ounce of humanity are weeded out. Then we find in these perfect exemplars surviving this elimination serious character defects that have separated them from humanity.What I like about this movie very much is that it contains the interesting paradox that when you try to root out humanityit is only found in greater abundance as which is what happens to Friedrich. The final contrast is that instead of making a better Nazi of Friedrichit make him a better human instead. So as he failed at the school he succeeded in life. I highly recommend it even if you have no interest in the history of World War II or the Nazi's its a very good story!".

This story just happens to be about Hitler and his 40 Napola training camps for the elite German youths in 1942 and the young boys and men who trained in these National Political societies. It could be found in many places and in many times...Friedrich Weimer handsome and talented young Max Riemelt comes from the lower class in Germany his father is aiming him toward factory work and is a fine young boxer. His talents are noted by some representatives from the Nazi party and he is asked to report for enrollment in a Napola an important means of education and training that Friedrich sees as being his way to become something special someone important. His father is antiNazi and refuses to let Friedrich go but Friedrich is determined and runs into the night to join the Napola. Once there he is admitted groomed as a boxer for the Napola and introduced to the Hitler's youth movement. His fellow classmates vary from the very wealthy to other fine Arian lads. They are trained observed and brainwashed as to the glory of the Thousand Year Reich. Problems begin to arise when Friedrich gets to know his fellow classmates Siegfried Martin Goeres is a bed wetter and is humiliated publicly for his problem Albrecht Tom Schilling is a poet and writer whose father is one of the governors of the Napola and Albrecht is antiwar other lads seem on the surface to be obedient yet most have hidden reservations about what they are doing.Being 1942 some changes are occurring in the Nazi dream and the Senior class is sent out on a mission to fight the enemy. And one night Friedrich's class is called out of bed and sent into the woods to find Russian soldiers who are 'threatening' their security. The boys open fire on the Russians only to find that they have killed a number of unarmed Russian boys. This profoundly disturbs them all but Albrecht in particular. Friedrich continues to observe the manner in which he and the other boys are used and slowly his best friends find ways to martyr themselves and ultimately Friedrich does the same in his only way  by changing the way he approaches the Napola expectations of his boxing.Max Riemelt as Friedrich is outstanding not only does he have the solid extraordinary good looks but he also can act satisfying every nuance of this challenging role. The remainder of the cast  both young boys and the adults running the Napola  are superb. The cinematography is subtly beautiful ranging from the tough interiors inside to the vistas of a Germany before it was destroyed by the not too distant fall. Director Dennis Gansel who cowrote the script with Maggie Peren is a young man the featurette with the DVD has an enlightening conversation between Gansel and Riemelt knows exactly how to capture both the wideeyed innocence of youth and the slowly crumbled ideals of young men. This is an outstanding film to see and experience. Its lessons are terrifying and intense. In German with English subtitles. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "This film's title NaPolA is the acronym for Nationalpolitische ErziehungsAnstalt or National Political Education Institute  a group of boarding schools established in Hitler's Germany to mold the elite of the future German grand society. It is stated in the film that the young men who attend these schools will be the future governors of such places as London and New York. For some reason those in the know have chosen to give the film the mundane title Before the Fall for its existence here in the United States. NaPolA is a fairly predictable comingofage story but its story's location in history excellent acting and superior production values give it five stars in my mind.The film begins in 1942 where we meet Friedrich Weimer a young boxer of extraordinary talent who seems destined to follow in the footsteps of his workingclass father and slave away his life in the factory. His boxing talent is witnessed by an official of a NaPolA and he is given the opportunity of enrollment in the school. Friedrich is thrilled with the prospect of attending such an elite school but his father is as dead set against it as he is disdainful of what the Nazis are doing to Germany. Friedrich forges his father's signature on the application and leaves for the school.The scene in which Friedrich is getting his physical for entry into the institute made my skin crawl. You see Friedrich  played by Max Riemelt  is a perfect physical specimen by Nazi standards. His facial features are measured and his hair and eye colors are compared to numbered standards. As these features are recorded we see his mentors in the background slyly smiling at their perfect super human  creepy. The director in this understated scene expertly portrays the racial evil that was Nazism.Friedrich meets another student Albrecht Stein  played by Tom Schilling  who is a sensitive writer. Albrecht has been enrolled by his father the governor of the institute and is not as enamored of the system as is Friedrich. These two opposites form a deep friendship. Needlesstosay events occur that cause both boys  especially Friedrich  to examine their attitudes toward the system.As stated before the plot line of the film is fairly predictable but the overall quality of the film causes it to rise far above that plot line. The boxing scenes in the film are superior. In the extra feature on the DVD the director states that Max Riemelt is a boxer and was instrumental in making those scenes so powerful. The director's quest inspired by his grandfather who actually attended a NaPolA was also to make the events in the film as accurate as possible. In that quest he hired a technical adviser who had attended one of the institutes. It is interesting to see the adviser putting the actors through their paces demanding unquestioning performance from these young men of today much in same way it was required of the actual young men some sixtyplus years ago.Striking distinctive uniforms and the thoughts of honor and glory are so very alluring to young men in their late teens. NaPolA effectively reminds us of how that allure can be directed for the benefit of evil. This is one of the many excellent German films that shatter us with the harsh reality of what was Nazi Germany  truly effective use of the lessons of history.".

Anyone who showed any trace of independent thinking or sensitivity to human values were sadistically harassed and weeded out.Based on the recollections of his grandfather Dennis Gansel's Before the Fall Napola Elite fr den Fhrer is a riveting coming of age story about the training of one such Nazi elite in the Germany of 1942. The work transcends its limitations as a genre film to tackle a more universal theme  the struggle between external ideals and matters of inner conscience. Like Igor the idealistic teenager in Dardenne's La Promesse Friedrich Weimer Max Riemelt a Nordiclooking working class boxer must deal with issues of conscience in an environment that is anathema to the assertion of human values. Friedrich is only seventeen when he is approached after an amateur boxing match by a Nazi instructor at a Napola school. Seeking to salvage the athletic reputation of the school he sees in Freidrich not only a boxing champion but a blank slate that can be molded to fit the Nazi ideal. Friedrich destined to follow his father as a factory laborer sees the chance to both serve the fatherland and advance his own career and signs his own registration papers when his father refuses to agree. The boy is still very innocent but genuinely idealistic and possesses genuine warmth as shown in the scene in which he reassures his younger brother. Friederich's mind is open to the Nazi indoctrination not because he is without conscience but because he simply hasn't seen any reason to question the prevailing zeitgeist.Freiderich's limited world experience suddenly expands however when he meets two other classmates Siegfried Gladen Martin Goeres a boy who has a bedwetting problem ruthlessly exploited as weakness by his fellow cadets and their sadistic teachers and Albrecht Stein Tom Schilling the son of Heinrich Stein Justus Vob Dohnanyi a hateful Nazi governor. Albrecht who has the dangerous idea that people should consult their own conscience before blindly following orders is a boy of sensitivity and poetry the embodiment perhaps of the true German spirit of Goethe and Heine.

He also recoils in horror and speaks out publicly after the cadets are marched out into the forest to track down and murder allegedly escaped Russian POWs in reality unarmed children. This incident results in a break in the relationship of the two boys and a sudden but predictable tragedy. Before the Fall is more than an accounting of the Nazi's disregard for human values a fact already wellestablished. It is a more profound statement of how people need to be educated to think for themselves and take a stand for what they believe to be right. Impeccably directed and beautifully performed Before the Fall is one of the most powerful and disturbing films of recent memory.".

Max Riemert did not overplay his part and I believed him to be a real person felt his sadness at leaving his parents home and his pride when he put on his uniform for the first time.

	schema:headline " Superb!  But special edition please";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a superb film  miraculous performances from the whole cast especially Max Riemelt and Tom Schilling. Script direction lighting camerawork editing sound effects and music are wonderful. It's a spellbinding film of extraordinary emotional power and haunting in its beauty.I'll just make a few of points no one else has mentioned. You may remember that Alfred Hitchcock used to make cameo appearances in his films. They were jokey and lasted only a few seconds. Well the director of this film Dennis Gansel also appears in an acting role. Only he's serious not jokey. If you look at the beginning of Napola you'll see Dennis Gansel takes on the role of the coach at the boxing club. He makes a disparaging remark about the Napola students who are present and turns away in disgust when Friedrich agrees to try to join the academy. Thus the director subtly signals to us the attitude he's going to take throughout the film.One of the things this film shows is why Nazism was so attractive to many young Germans. The Nazis knew how to target young people and play on youthful idealism. They used this idealism as a cover for their murderous agenda. They not only coerced people they seduced them. Gansell shows this seduction at work. Someone once said Hitler was a gangster but a gangster with style. When it came to style the Nazis had few rivals. Even today their ceremonies festivals rallies buildings cars fighting machines and uniforms excite awe. Many young Germans found them irresistible. The Nazis seemed cool. The Hitler Youth wore designer uniforms. The black uniforms we see the Napola boys wearing were designed in the 1930s by a German fashion house that still exists  Hugo Boss. The firm also designed the black uniforms of the SS!Nazi Germany was a country in uniform. It changed the way people looked felt and acted. A key moment in the film is when Friedrich first puts on his black designer uniform  complete with a socalled 'dagger of honour' worn on the left hip  and stares at himself proudly in a mirror. Overjoyed he goes down to the assembly hall and finds himself surrounded by dozens of cadets all wearing black designer uniforms. He is now  he thinks  part of the elite.Napola is a subtle and multilayered film that deserves repeated viewings. Gansel avoids the mistake of overloading his movie with dialogue. The script is terse. Sometimes there are few or no words at all as he lets the pictures tell the story. Things are hinted at and not spelt out and it's possible to miss them on first viewing. But they're all there. For example it took me time to realise that Albrecht is not only Friedrich's friend. He's also the conscience of the film  the moral centre. He gets inside Friedrich's mind and changes the way the young boxer thinks about the Napola and the Nazis.Then there's the look of the film. The movie is set in the late summer autumn and winter of 1942. The Third Reich was past the high summer of its success  1940  and was now entering the autumn of its years. This is reflected in the retro lighting and colours of the film. Nearly all the colours are autumnal or wintry  brown khaki green blue black white. The only bright colour in the film is red  the red of the Nazi flags and banners the red of the Nazi armbands and the colour of human blood.Dennis Gansel comes at the Nazis from new angles and provides valuable insights into the German mind. Although a former cadet rubbishes Napola on this site many of the things Gansel describes in his movie really happened. You can compare his film with a TV documentary series on Nazi education on YouTube. It's called 'Hitler's Children.' Episode 2  Education  deals with Napolas. It contains archive film from the 1930s and '40s and interviews with former cadets. Incidentally many Napola cadets who survived the war rose to become respected members in the new Germany. One became a famous actor  Hardy Kruger. He starred in many British and American films as well as German movies. Kruger attended the Napola at Sonthofen. While training Kruger and two other cadets had to hack two holes in the thick ice of a frozen lake. The holes were 10 yards apart and the cadets had to climb into one hole and swim under to ice to the other.There are various DVD editions of Dennis Gansel's movie Napola  some with no features others with interviews and documentaries. The German edition contain the most deleted scenes interviews with the cast and a director's commentary which I desperately want to understand. Unfortunately everything is in German. I speak only English! There are no subtitles. Could I make a plea to Dennis Gansel to issue a twodisc special edition with subtitles in various languages bringing together all the interviews features etc that are scattered across the various editions. Also any other material he has about this remarkable film lurking in his archives. And we need it on Bluray please.As a general point  many of Max Riemelt's films exist only in German editions. They have no subtitles. I think they would have a much wider audience if they did.Incidentally Max speaks good English. He has a delightful German accent tinged with American sounds. I'm writing this review some years after Napola appeared and he's made many films since. Surely it's about time a British or American director discovered Max and put him in a movie. He could play a German character speaking in English. I'm sure he'd have a great impact.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a superb film  miraculous performances from the whole cast especially Max Riemelt and Tom Schilling. Script direction lighting camerawork editing sound effects and music are wonderful. It's a spellbinding film of extraordinary emotional power and haunting in its beauty.I'll just make a few of points no one else has mentioned. You may remember that Alfred Hitchcock used to make cameo appearances in his films. They were jokey and lasted only a few seconds. Well the director of this film Dennis Gansel also appears in an acting role. Only he's serious not jokey. If you look at the beginning of Napola you'll see Dennis Gansel takes on the role of the coach at the boxing club. He makes a disparaging remark about the Napola students who are present and turns away in disgust when Friedrich agrees to try to join the academy. Thus the director subtly signals to us the attitude he's going to take throughout the film.One of the things this film shows is why Nazism was so attractive to many young Germans. The Nazis knew how to target young people and play on youthful idealism. They used this idealism as a cover for their murderous agenda. They not only coerced people they seduced them. Gansell shows this seduction at work. Someone once said Hitler was a gangster but a gangster with style. When it came to style the Nazis had few rivals. Even today their ceremonies festivals rallies buildings cars fighting machines and uniforms excite awe. Many young Germans found them irresistible. The Nazis seemed cool. The Hitler Youth wore designer uniforms. The black uniforms we see the Napola boys wearing were designed in the 1930s by a German fashion house that still exists  Hugo Boss. The firm also designed the black uniforms of the SS!Nazi Germany was a country in uniform. It changed the way people looked felt and acted. A key moment in the film is when Friedrich first puts on his black designer uniform  complete with a socalled 'dagger of honour' worn on the left hip  and stares at himself proudly in a mirror. Overjoyed he goes down to the assembly hall and finds himself surrounded by dozens of cadets all wearing black designer uniforms. He is now  he thinks  part of the elite.Napola is a subtle and multilayered film that deserves repeated viewings. Gansel avoids the mistake of overloading his movie with dialogue. The script is terse. Sometimes there are few or no words at all as he lets the pictures tell the story. Things are hinted at and not spelt out and it's possible to miss them on first viewing. But they're all there. For example it took me time to realise that Albrecht is not only Friedrich's friend. He's also the conscience of the film  the moral centre. He gets inside Friedrich's mind and changes the way the young boxer thinks about the Napola and the Nazis.Then there's the look of the film. The movie is set in the late summer autumn and winter of 1942. The Third Reich was past the high summer of its success  1940  and was now entering the autumn of its years. This is reflected in the retro lighting and colours of the film. Nearly all the colours are autumnal or wintry  brown khaki green blue black white.

Of course this is only my thoughts on the matter. I do think more Americans I'm American too so I don't mean this as an attack need to see movies like this and Downfall. Anything that shows a slightly different view of Nazi Germany than the one we are use to seeing. It's not as if all of Germany woke up one morning and decided to be 'evil'. It was a gradual progression. One we would do well to understand in this day and age. Even the person I saw the movie with said she didn't understand how the Germans could have gone along with what happened. I believe this movie was good for trying to show how a German youth in this case could at one point not fully comprehend what the Nazi agenda is. The main character was happy and proud to be where he was at the beginning of the film. Often in life you find that things are not how they seem and by then it is generally too late. Don't watch it for a 'gay' movie don't watch it for a 'boxing' movie. Watch it to see a view into a young Nazi German mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a mustsee movie for people that love movies about nature. The movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the North Pole and going down south as the movie progresses. The footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and I many times wondered how on Earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky. However beautiful a large part of the footage I had already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth' narrated by David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's narration of Planet Earth to be much better than the narration of Earth. 'Earth' is an easier movie. It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series. For instance Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and doesn't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals like large sharks etc. To me that's an important difference. That together with Attanborough's far superior voice make Planet Earth a far better documentary than Earth. Still however I think Earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television miniseries Planet Earth narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough. Nevertheless whether it was screened down here in Australia or not I never caught up with it and when I happened upon the opportunity to see 'Earth 2007'  a featurelength compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen I jumped at the chance. The theatre was basically empty just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though I had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet Earth. For 90 minutes I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film. Awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times 'Earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction.Though the film directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight. Instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world to experience the resilience and also the fragility of life on Earth. I hear that the original miniseries which ran for eleven episodes delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems but I think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time. By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals anthropomorphising them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy.'Earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the lifesaving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta. The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predatorprey interactions. Though occasionally perhaps to cater towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final hopeless efforts at survival. There's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slowmotion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey the result of a single fateful misstep or the majestic midair leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion. It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.Aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes. Of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing highdefinition timelapse photography throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it. Consequently 'Earth' left me thirsting for more and fortunately I now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD boxset for Planet Earth. Uplifting and tearjerking aweinspiring and heartrending 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.".

It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species.Aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes. Of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles via some astonishing highdefinition timelapse photography throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it. Consequently 'Earth' left me thirsting for more and fortunately I now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD boxset for Planet Earth. Uplifting and tearjerking aweinspiring and heartrending 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.";

He wasn't a presenter on Planet Earth just a narrator and I'm sure he's modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a Good Thing.Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe majesty and glory. All reviewers agree on that. Those who love it ie. everyone willshould go on to see an buy Planet Earth.

Planet earth is also a wakeup call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the bleak future of planet Earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not present us with a future representation of what might occur to our planet if we don't radically change things around but they rather show us the genuine beauty of planet Earth in all of its amazing glory. We see places that we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this movie we see a wide array of the most extraordinary places such as forsaken deserts giant forests full of fauna and flora and icylandscapes as far as the eye could see. And in all of those immensely different environments we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive.This is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made in combination with the one from Al Gore in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to meddle with. The voiceover by Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though I was watching an Xmen movie instead! The cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing of this documentary. At times what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all of that delightful footage.In short This is definitely a mustsee for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is I never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful!".

The movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive.I am all for preventing global warning but this was over the top political and environmental junk.That's another thing I went to see it on the big screen but was disappointed in the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home.If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture go out and buy rent or borrow the BBC's Planet Earth series.

There are regularly shots of the Earth from space so that's may be appropriate. In any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it. There are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from North Pole to Antarctica. 3 animal families polar bear elephant and whale appear in more than one of these parts. Each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is. We see something of each kind of animal but only mammals and birds and some fish and some beautiful shots of vegetation mountains waterfalls deserts and jungle a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth. You get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or villages or cities aren't in the film so it's a typical nature documentary but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music. When the film opened I already knew it would end far too soon for me. It is a family film so no brutal killings of any animals. When one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slowmotion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit 6 in The Netherlands. No blood is shed. Some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be adored by kids. It looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took 4000 and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty. It had it's Dutch premiere yesterday a month before the actual release in a cinema of 500 seats of which 15 were taken. True beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers it seems. As I knew the TVseries I was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie. Some didn't but the most impressive shots big waterfalls did luckily.

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary makes you travel all around the globe. It contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness. It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be. The polar bear's future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it. After all its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming. This documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue. It can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive. Scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of Al Gore's documentary An inconvenient truth but frankly...what a description!!! A question may then arise Isn't it worth preserving our world's beauty? Because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions. By living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature. All things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called EARTH.".

The idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness I think began with or at least it's the first I recall seeing the television show Kung Fu during the early Seventies.An interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed. There are enough dramatic humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs. Perhaps because of some selective editing sparing us as it were from the grisly end of a preypredator moment and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on DVD it is a solid film in its own right.

However the screen version Earth in comparison is a huge letdown for three reasons 1. I was prepared to see mostly the same footage which was the case. What I was not prepared for was the low resolution! Of course some parts of the film have excellent resolution but many of the slow 'feeding' scenes had terrible resolution. The theatre I watched this in today was one step down from an Imax screen huge and curved amphitheatre seating and I sat almost center. In particular the white Arctic wolf chasing the baby caribou was particularly poor resolution to the point were effort was required to discern any detail at all but the white mass running. Note on a good size TV this was simply not an issue. Maybe this would not have happened in 70mm but in 35mm an extremely fast sequence extremely slowed down was simply not satisfying on the big screen.2. Time and content wise watching these 90 minutes was a little like watching a commercial for the real thing. It is over edited and under informed. Very little info is given to the viewer whereas the series was packed with info. Some scenes were overplayed some were over  and repeated 6 chicks falling from tree 20 times! some were overextended shark munching seal splashing to the water hidden because of splash goes on and on. The series had excellent editing or didn't need so much as there was sufficient time in each episode to actually show what needed to be shown and proportions made sense.3. Emotional impact. Many viewers commented how the kill scenes were a little too much and at first as a biologistecologist I snickered as did others well that's nature. However the 90 minute breakdown is approximately 30 minutes scenery 60 minutes animal. Of the 60 animal minutes there's approximately 10 minutes of fun 20 minutes of neutral and 30 minutes of killing time. Taken in perspective I also now feel the kill time was overdone. It felt like it was all in the name of shock value.All in all although Earth has much nice footage I simply can not recommend it it has minimal knowledge content bad editing and the large screen format is a double edged sword.

First THIS IS THE SPOILER there is a scene in there that is directly taken from a show I saw on either Discovery or National Geographic. I was expecting totally new and original footage so I'm now wondering how much of this film is new? Second nonspoiler I was watching the movie on a DLP screen. A few of the scenes especially when you see the zebra running on the sand are grainy. I would not have expected something filmed probably in hidef on a DLP screen to be so grainyespecially if it is completely new footage. I love my techie stuff and pristine images is something I really enjoy.Other than the two things above this film is VERY enjoyable and amusing in some sections. There was a trailer on this movie for The Oceans which is coming on Earth Day in 2010. I am already looking forward to that film.If you plan on taking your family to see this movie make it a matine. It's a good thing to watch with your familythey do show a few kills but there is NO blood nor carnage shown. Also you're basically paying to watch an expanded and shouldbenew version of a TV original so no need to pay high dollar when you can pay matine. By going to the movies to see this you're saying you want to see more films made like this and hopefully you care about preserving the planet and animals so that more films like this will happen!".

	schema:reviewBody "Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn Cary Grant and Doris Day may have made better screwball comedies but this one just about works by downplaying punchlines and taking obvious idiocies as read such as the leads' addictions to sweeties and their penchant for falling through doors or knocking things over. But with these traits how is it their apartments are immaculate? A directorial fauxpas here. Julianne Moore is wonderful as usual playing the rather uptight divorce lawyer impressed despite herself with Brosnan's physical attractions. She is a mistress of the personality contrasts sweet smile against daggerdrawn eyes disconcerted reactions with suave sophistication professional aplomb in the courtroom but slobbing out in front of the TV. She is not only determined to resist Brosnan but successfully compete against him while her mother brilliantly played by Frances Fisher is determined to persuade her to accept his overtures. Frances Fisher almost steals the film with her overthetop muchmarried society fashion character distinctly contrasting with Julianne Moore's more stuffy persona reminiscences of Edina and Saffy in Absolutely Fabulous?.I cringed at the scenes in Ireland but this film does not pretend to be anything other than a sweetthing romantic comedy of deliberate gameplaying. It doesn't go for standup jokes but just bowls along happily in its overdose of sugar. Moore is marvelous in serious drama The Hours and Far From Heaven but is proving equally at home with zany comedy see also Cookie's Fortune. Brosnan relies on his handsome looks to see him through any part but his comedy timing is as excellent as Moore's. The characters' common clumsiness is as welltimed as anything Doris Day did in That Touch Of Mink or Cary Grant in Monkey Business. Given that Brosnan and Moore are more often seen in adventure or drama an outing into comedy does not go amiss and gives us a chance to see them do something different. I wasn't sure of the film to begin with but it grew on me. As long as it is accepted as a light and frothy entertainment with no other purpose than whiling away a Sunday afternoon in front of the fire with a box of chocolates it's a fine movie. Does Frances Fisher ever play any other character than someone's mother?".

This is a movie for people who are in love and or thinking about getting married or are married. Despite the humour their is a serious message ie not everything in life is easy and you need to be willing to compromise if you wish to find happiness with the one you love. Not all reviews of this film have been positive. My belief is these critics are not romantic people. This is a very hard film to dislike if you are a romantic person my wife says I am.

When she meets her opposing counsel she has no reason to think that this scruffy man poses any threat to her. When he hands her her ass she steps up the competition and so begins a tense relationship in the courtroom. However outside of the court the couple find a certain chemistry growing between them but surrounded by so many divorces and arguments how could anything good come of it?Billed as a big name romantic comedy in the mould of sparky screwball romances of the forties and fifties this comedy at times is great fun but at others falls terribly flat. Given what it was basing itself of it should be no surprise that the first half is the best with energetic duelling between the two leads. Later on the script has to deliver a believable romance out of this and here is where it really falters. It suddenly becomes this twinkly affair in Ireland where love blooms although it doesn't really although it might. It is a difficult hurdle to get over and the film doesn't really manage it and the final third is deeply unconvincing and hard to care about as it mugs its way towards the inevitable conclusion. It is strange that McKenna's script is so slick when it is in the banter stage but so heavy with syrup and silly clich towards the end almost like all the talent was put into the first half leaving nothing for the latter stages.Brosnan and Moore do try hard to make it work and mostly they succeed but the material does gradually leave them out in the open. It helps that together they do manage an easy chemistry but later in the film they do struggle to convince with the more emotional side of the characters that exist outside of the fizz and snappy exchanges. Brosnan does well for the majority as he charms his way through but Moore can't seem to slide between the film's levels  she works with the snappy comedy stuff but when the emotional stuff comes she seems to drift between romcom level acting and trying to go deeper. Support from Sheen Posey Fisher and a few others add some limited value around the edges but none can stop the script falling apart the longer it goes on.Overall then what starts as a reasonable hark back to screwball romances gradually turns into an unconvincing silly and sentimental affair that not even the big name stars can keep above the water. Not really worth a look for that reason.".

That should give you a quick idea of what I thought of this film. This film was blander than the sugarfree bread we eat at this house. There was no suspenseful moments there was absolutely nothing to laugh about other than the sheer stupidity of this film and the chemistry was horrible. How does a director expect us to sit through an hour and a half of this without hiring two actors that actually seem like they enjoy being together or that they would realistically meet in real life. I never once imagined Moore and Bronson as a couple and unfortunately this film did not strengthen my imagination.So where did this film go wrong? To start with the characters would mean having to talk about Moore and her inability to be funny. She is not a comic actress. She commands the screen in her dramatic roles but brings nothing to her humorous side. There was a moment during the film when I thought I could see her humor onoff button. It was hard to distinguish between Moore the actress and Moore the dehumanized robot that attempted to provide humor to this dry piece of crust I like to call Laws of Attraction. It was pathetic and at times silly. It was not helped by the fact that Brosnan didn't even bother putting any effort into his role. I think that is what bothered me the most about the characters they were not complex though they tried to be they were not entertaining and they were not challenges on the actors part to portray. I enjoy a film so much better when actors go beyond their normal stroke of acting ability and provide something of substance and intrigue. The only aspect of this film that I was intrigued about was the ending credits.How many times have we seen this story? For those that argue that Hollywood brings us unique and crisp stories with each production should see this film. This film felt like a cinematic representation of an Alley McBeal episode. There was even the scene with the unisex bathroom  did nobody see this connection? There was nothing special about this film. Normally when I write these reviews I have at least one positive note to bring to the table but with this film there was nothing. From beginning to end this film was horrible. The director must have known that it was an overplayed story because he literally rushed through this story. It reminded me of a child's first time with a woman rushed and fumbled they try to make it to the end but never really succeed in satisfying anyone. I hated and cringed every time Woods' mother was on screen. Her parts were underdeveloped dull and unnecessary to the story of the film. She was filler nothing more. I kept looking for something anything that I could bite down on and taste the flavor of this film but all I seemed to find was gristle and fat a meat joke for those carnivores out there.Overall there was nothing redeeming of this film at all and I can now fully understand why it rushed directly to the silver screen and even faster to the video release. I can now fully understand why there were so many copies for me to choose from at the store. I guess others discovered the truth about Laws of Attraction and why the box oddly smelled like curdled cheese.Grade  out of ".

But she wasn't very good. Seeing her in this role reminded me of a time when I attended an office Xmas party and saw someone I respected down and out drunk. It was embarrassing and I wished I had never seen it and never let it tarnish my image of that person. However in defense of Ms. Moore who I still think is a fine actor I can't imagine the finest comedic actress in the world saving this film.As they say if it's not on the page it ain't on the stage. In my opinion when this film was finished it was put in the wrong can. It should have gone in the trash can. Horrible boring clichd script that didn't know what it was supposed to be.

There weren't over twenty people in the theater to watch this picture and I would be surprised to see this picture on the upper list on ratings as time goes on and people have a chance to talk about it. As with most all movies the previews of this one kind of give you the sense that it may be funny and very interesting to watch.  I think the best parts of the movie were the previews. I would suggest saving your time on this one and see something else.".

Moore and Brosnan are a delight to watch especially how their love story unfolds in the courtroom. Brosnan is great at playing the Irishman as he also proved in 'Evelyn' perhaps because he is one. Moore keeps proving what an incredibly versatile actress she is as she shows a flair for comedy. But it is the scenes between Frances Fisher and Julianne Moore that I enjoyed watching the most. The movie has some great punchlines the best of which are delivered by Fisher. Lending hilarious support are Michael Sheen as a rockstar and Parker Posey as his fashion designer wife. The Irish scenes may be a little clichd and 'touristy' but nonetheless fun to watch. On the flip side 'Laws of Attraction' felt a bit rushed in parts and the plot could have been better developed. However that doesn't stop it from making the viewers laugh out loud and root for Daniel and Audrey to succeed in their fun romantic adventure.".

They are witty and at times do actually make the audience laugh out loud. This makes up for the poor plot line and otherwise completely unsuited dialogue. The characters do not exist in what they say and it is only due to Brosnan and Moore that they exist at all. Moore who plays the uptight to the point lawyer has lines that could go either way depending on who is delivering them. And as for Moore talented as she is this is not her movie. Brosnan is the one to watch. He finds his character easier than she does and plays along. When watching Moore you get the impression that she thinks she is part of something more important than this embarrassment of a movie.It's not worth 8.50 and it's not even worth a rental fee. Avoid it. There are better movies to waste your money on this spring. ".

Pierce Brosnan is witty charming cute as per Frances Fisher in the film and above all incredibly gifted in this role. When you watch him here you are reminded of the films of David Niven or Cary Grant and that is no mean comparison coming from someone who sorely laments the lost of such talents. Julianne Moore comes up to Pierce brilliantly and you could see this film occurring thirty years ago starring Grant and Hepburn. Julianne's character is the perfect foil for Brosnan's in this delightful duel of the sexes. Parker Posey and Michael Sheen are the typical young adults caught up in their success and going through a rough patch of the I'm so neglected stage of marriage which the two of them carry off wonderfully. The maraschino cherry on this particular confection is the wonderful appearance of the beautiful Frances Fisher than lovely lady who has the cheekbones of Venus de Milo and the accompanying smile. Rated PG13 for sexual content and language I personally recommend this as a film for you and that significant other when the kids are in bed or for Date Night.".

Daniel is an unethical lawyer that uses any resource to win a battle no matter how dirty he is. And Julianne Moore is also great in the role of an ethical lawyer that follows the rules.

	schema:reviewBody "Laws of Attraction is a decent romantic comedy but it's not really worth watching. Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan are rival divorce lawyers who wake up after a drunken bender in Vegas to find out they've gotten married. In order to keep their reputations intact they must make the most of it and pretend that they're happily marriedbut could true love be far behind? The story has been done a lot and Laws of Attraction does nothing new to try to make it exciting. The film is pretty bland and it just goes straight down the middle with pretty much no surprises. So the only reason why the film works a lot better then it should is because of its two leads. Julianne Moore plays her role well as does Pierce Brosnan and they manage to carry the film but their isn't a whole lot of chemistry between them. The movie also has these unrealistic scenes where one character just happens to run into another in a random street corner or even in a random road in Ireland. At least the film keeps it short with a running time of 90 minutes so while it does get boring you won't have to sit through it for that long .Peter Howitt directs and he keeps it at a slow pace. The supporting cast is also pretty good which include Michael Sheen Frances Fisher and Parker Posey. The film starts off well but some events happen near the end that are to hard to take serious. This film actually had a lot of potential but due to the poor writing it didn't turn out to be such a good film. Rating 610 worth watching if your a fan of Brosnan and Moore but if your not then this film is not really worth watching since it has nothing new or exciting to offer.".

	schema:headline " One of the best martial arts movies based on a video game adaption my personal favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Mortal Kombat 1995 is a childhood classic of mine and it is my all time favorite martial arts movie based on a video game adaptation. I love love love love this movie to death! It is a martial arts tournament people who fight for our world. I love everything about this movie. The story characters soundtracks actors and so on the action everything I love it. I love the theme song TechnoSyndrome 7inch mix by The Immortals! I love it so much I love but I hate the sequel to this movie. It was directed from Paul W.S. Anderson who later directed Resident Evil films and he directed well. I love the soundtracks so much TechnoSyndrome 7inch mix by The Immortals Goodbye by by Gravity Kills JukeJoint Jezebel Metropolis Mix KMFDM Halcyon  On  On  Orbital and George S. Clinton ft. Buckethead  Goro Vs. Art . This movie kick ass. I love love love so much Bridgette WilsonSampras in this film she is so gorgeous and sexy. I love Linden Ashby and Robin Shou in this movie so much. I grew up with this film I saw it 20 years ago when I was 14 years old. I played Mortal Kombat 2 video game in the hospital with my friends when I was 13th years old. Trevor Goddard R.IP. is in this movie he almost in every good movie from the 90's Baywatch Deep Rising Mortal Kombat and so on. CaryHiroyuki Tagawa is always the bad guy in any action movie in the 90's like Showdown In Little Tokyo. We need movies like this back. I love the fights beautiful choreographed the final battle between Liu Kang who searches for his brother killer against Shang Tsung is the best in the movie. Three unknowing martial artists are summoned to a mysterious island to compete in a tournament whose outcome will decide the fate of the world. I love the characters Lord Raiden  Liu Kang Johnny Cage Shang Tsung  Sonya Blade Kitana  Kano Scorpion and SubZero love those character so much. Johnny Cage is my favorite character of all time played by one and only Linden Ashby who was the right actor for this job. Johnny Cage is a Hollywood action movie star in the media clams he is a fake martial artist and he sign in to tournament Mortal Kombat to show his martial arts skills. Johnny fought Shang Tsung's goons and beat them. He fought Scorpion and Prince Goro on the end.Sonya Blade is Bridgette WilsonSampras is my all time favorite character no one else could play her Sonya Blade is Bridgette Wilson not Sandra Hess. Sonya is a tough cop who chases Kano Trevor Goddard who killed her partner. She face his enemy in a tournament Mortal Kombat he was her toughest opponent. Liu Kang is an ex monk who searchers for his brother killer a sorcerer Shang Tsung as he sign to compete in a tournament Mortal Komabt to avenge his brother's death. Liu Kang will always be Robin Shou he was no one else  he was excellent martial artist. Liu fought Shang Tsung CaryHiroyuki Tagawa SubZero Franois Petit and Reptile Keith Cooke and of course Shang Tsung thugs. Robin Shou is the only actor who played the character so well. The fight choreographer was crazy. Finally Lord Raiden is Christopher Lambert from Highlander only he could play such a great character God of Thunder.I don't understand why Terminator 2 Judgment Day has the best score 8.5 while this movie that I love only has 5.8 it is not right this movie should get higher. I would take it anytime over Resident Evil or Tomb Raider movies anytime. 1010 Mortal Kombat is my personal favorite martials arts science fiction film that is based on a video game. Sue me I love this film to death.".

Not a fantastic movie nor one that goes in my top ten but Mortal Kombat without a doubt is one of the better gamebasedfilms.MK wisely avoids inventing plot in unwelcomed places and sticks to the game as frequently as it can get away with.  Actually the biggest contradiction that comes to mind is Scorpion and Subzero on the same team.  Die hard fans will call the screenwriter on this the rest of us won't care.All the mistakes Street Fighter made MK avoided.  Instead of colorful campy cameofest Mortal Kombat comes across as a dark tale about a handful of martial artists shot with an exaggerated epic style with humorous undertones to provide comic relief every now and again.  Then again it is ironic that Street Fighter would feel cartoony and Mortal Kombat more concrete when looking at the style of the games drawn sprites versus live actors.  MK is a little silly when reproducing game effects and trademark moves though now more and more films are moving in that direction Matrix anyone?The movie's premise is the first Mortal Kombat arcade game featuring a few plot hints journey to Outworld and a few characters from Mortal Kombat 2 Kitana Jax a youthful Shang Tsung.Christopher Lambert and CaryHiroyuki Takawa make the most memorable impact as Thunder God Rayden and Shapeshifting Sorcerer Shang Tsung.  Both ham up their performances just enough to remind us that we're watching a liveaction video game but they don't go overboard into Street Fighter's territory.  The rest of the cast plays their part straight forward and makes their characters believable.It's a quick and slick film gets to the action and gets over with before you can ask too many questions.  It's a pretty decent martial arts film and an outstanding video game' film.  And in 1995 it was the best gameinspired film you could find.  Today it's still in the top five.".

	schema:reviewBody "1010 review your eyes do not deceive you. Mortal Kombat simply put is not only the best best game tofilm adaptations ever made but one of my personal favorite movies of all time. I first seen this movie in the theaters in 1995. I was only five years old at the time! Back then it was a fantastic film and in 2015 it's still a great film! Maybe it's nostalgia but on the other hand compared to all the other overrated junk of 2014 and 2015 I consider this movie excellent and it is one of my favorites. This film and franchise even encouraged me to study martial arts for almost 15 years now.Mortal Kombat simply put is a movie rendition of the original Mortal Kombat arcade video game. It's about a group of warriors from Earth who compete in an ancient martial arts tournament for the fate of the world. In more than one way it borrows many conceptsideas from Enter the Dragon but on the other hand it has it's own unique twist and storyline to it.Everything about this movie is awesome. Simple storyline with humor in the right spots great casting EXCELLENT choreography and a fun soundtrack that still rocks today. In particular this is one of my favorite fighting movies because the fights were excellently choreographed. Some standoffs between characters were extremely convincing and fun to watch. The fights were very dirty and not too overthe top. They also paid homage to the video game with cool fatalities and even a funny friendship scene. Probably the ONLY weak spot in the film would maybe be some of the CGI especially for Reptile Reptile didn't look great in 1995 and the movie aging 20 years has not helped! With that being said the nonCGI Goro looks better than any junk they would probably try to make today. It makes me very sad that the franchise as far as the big screen goes is in limbo. But at least we have this great classic filmed by Paul Anderson! If you enjoy video game films martial arts or the new age MK video games I recommend you check this film out. It is a fun film and worth adding to your DVD or blu ray collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "A number of martial artists converge in China from which they're taken to a seeming alternate dimension to fight in a tournament that's only held once each generation. This time however the stakes are even higher as the outcome of the tournament will determine the fate of the Earth.Believe it or not this is the first time I've seen this film and I've not yet had experience with any of the games the other films the animated series the lunchboxes or anything else related to the Mortal Kombat universe. After watching the first film however I definitely will seek out some of the other material as I enjoyed the film quite a bitit earns an 8 out of 10 from me. At this point however I can't compare it to any other instantiations of Mortal Kombat.The film is basically a combination of a classic Hong Kongstyled martial arts actioner and a fantasy that leans slightly to the horror side of that genre. To the film's benefit it's also not something that either director Paul W.S. Anderson or writer Kevin Droney take too seriouslythe film is ultimately an adaptation of a popular video game after all. There is a tongueincheek slightly campy sense of humor and playful cheesiness throughout the film the humor being primarily fueled from two characters Johnny Cage Linden Ashby and Lord Rayden Christopher Lambert. True Lambert has a kind of almost smarmy campiness to anything he says or does in any film but for me that's part of his attractivenessit's a large part of what sold me on the Highlander films.The fantasy aspect was something I didn't expect before watching the film. It was a very pleasant surprise. Being a huge horror fan I was especially taken with the set design. The fantasy characters such as Goro and the fantasy traits of other characters were well done and even subtle at times.As for the fights which are the propelling force behind the film they're pleasantly varied and well choreographed although having just watched Master of the Flying Guillotine 1975 again recently I was slightly disappointed that the fights weren't more brutal and gory and in fact this is one of the areas where I subtracted a point. But they almost make up for the lack of violence but their imaginativeness especially the fights with SubZero and The Scorpion. That cleverness was required over brawn in most instances was also a nice touch.Overall this is a great film that any fans of martial arts or fantasy films should enjoy.".

	schema:headline " A nice adaption!";
	schema:reviewBody "MK 1995 is a fine just fine adaption. It is pretty often for movies based upon video games to end up crappy as a final product. Well this one was more than OK. No need to tell anything except a few things... a few good things. The acting crew is great  Robin Shou Liu Kang Linden Ashby Johny Cage and Bridgette Willson Sonya Blade were great in their parts. Robin Shou is not the best actor around but he proved to be great as Liu Kang and I find him for now to be the best who portrayed Kang in live action film. Linden Ashby was an excellent choice for Johny Cage. He was funny cocky and sarcastic as a character and I think that Ashby did a great job. Bridgette Willson was OK but not all that great. Maybe because they give her so little to work with. And when it comes to that our leading characters are not that much developed. They are just there to win the tournament but their backgrounds are pretty solid and that's about it. Too bad that they didn't give them more to their character. Christopher Lambert was fine as Rayden mysterious and tall. But his acting was a bit wooden. CaryHiroyuki Tagawa was excellent was Shang Tsung his performance was inspiring and he made Tsung with such unmitigated charisma. So far he is my favorite Shang Tsung. Talisa Soto Kitana was also good alas just like Sonya little developed and two dimensional. She was there to increase the plot for Liu Kang. Now the one I really found most entertaining is none else than Trevor Goddard Kano his Kano was very fun! His Australian accent and charm were just through the roof! To mention the fact that most voice actors in video games based their performances on Goddard's. Thanks to him this Kano is memorized and trademarked forever. Love this Kano! The martial artist that played Reptile Keith Cooke Sub Zero Francois Petit and Scorpion Chris Casamassa were amazing in what they do best  kicking some butt! They really gave a 200 effort and hard work in fight scenes. Fights are excellent dynamic and well choreographed. The atmosphere in certain scenes is good in a way it gives us a decent impressions of fighting locations. The locations and studio sets were good CGI was not that great. But don't despair. One of the most beautiful things in this film is Goro. Performed by special effects master and student to Stan Winston  Tom Woodruff Jr. Who did an impressive job on Goro. You just can't deny his puppetry and animatronics. All that is pretty well mixed with voice acting of Kevin Michael Richardson who voiced Goro. For the end Paul WS Anderson is not my favorite director nor I don't find most of his films good. But this one is very special and it was one of his early works in Hollywood so he had to prove it. And he did it. He did a good job. Keep it in mind that this movie offers you only a tiny amount of blood. Whereas the game is extremely violent. This movie reasonably is not. It's a decent fun! Watch it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was living in San Diego particularly in the suburban armpit of Del Mar in 1995 and I remember waiting eagerly well over a year for MK's release. And it was definitely worth the wait I saw it a total of 13 times which stood as my alltime record for nearly four and a half years. When all was said and done it had grossed a strong 70 million domestically plus 100 million worldwide.I'm not a Mortal Kombat fanatic anymore but in retrospect MK was one of the most entertaining movies of the 1990s. It was easily the first video gameturnedmovie to contain a halfway decent plot exciting special effects good acting and spectacular martial arts action the latter which was before all the presentday Crouching Tiger wirework nonsense. The actors underwent a threemonth crash course in martial arts training and their hard work paid off beautifully. On screen they looked like they were really performing those moves instead of just imitating them. Unlike previous video game movie washouts like Double Dragon and Street Fighter MK also had a comprehensible plot that remained faithful to the games and in the end won a space in gamers' hearts.Along with the supporting cast of wellrenowned martial artists MK featured a nice cache of actors Linden Ashby  whose screen personalities have all had a bit of a humorous smartass element to them  was perfect as Johnny Cage likewise thenrising star Bridgette Wilson as Sonya Blade and Robin Shou as the film's centerpiece Liu Kang. Christopher Lambert gave a witty performance as thunder god Raiden constantly misspelled as  Rayden much to the aggravation of many MK fans like myself and nobody cared that he was a French actor playing a Japanese character. CaryHiroyuki Tagawa who recently starred in Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes clearly had a ball playing the evil Shang Tsung and it showed. Heck how many evil sorcerers get to wear cool black leather jackets?Unfortunately save for Tagawa and Wilson MK unfortunately did not spell the worldwide exposure that many had predicted would come to the stars following the film's success and the art of animatronics used here to bring the fourarmed Goro to life is all but extinct in this day and age but there was no denying that back in the day the cast and filmmakers knew they had made an entertaining movie. While I hardly watch MK anymore the bottom line is that it was undeniably a kick in the pants during its time and for that reason alone it continues to maintain my highest vote to this day. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Mortal Kombat 1995 is my favorite martial arts scifi action classic flick based on a video game that I have grown up! I grew up playing Mortal Kombat II video game I played in a hospital with my friends. I heard about Street Fighter 1994 movie that played JeanClaude Van Damme in it and that time I thought that movie is one of the best Van Damme movies that just come out recently in the 90's but boy was I wrong! Street Fighter sucks ass! JeanClaude Van Damme sucked ass in Street Fighter! Mortal Kombat is the opposite of that film I love this film to death and it is my favorite Paul W. S. Anderson film that he ever directed! In my honest opinion I think is the best video game movie ever made that was before Resident Evil movies were made! I love the theme song TechnoSyndrome 7inch mix by The Immortals! I love this movie to death it is a classic my favorite childhood movie of all time!! Too bad it got a sequel 1997 and ruined this movie. This in my opinion is a classic SciFi underrated martial arts flick that I love it so damn much!!! A handful of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?Plot Three unknowing martial artists are summoned to a mysterious island to compete in a tournament whose outcome will decide the fate of the world.Nothing in this world has prepared you for this. Summoned to a mysterious island three martial arts warriors engage in the ultimate battle of good against evil the supernatural tournament of Mortal Kombat. Starring Christopher Lambert Higlander Talisa Soto Don Juan DeMarco and featuring world class martial arts champion Robin Shou Tiger Cage II it's the most awesome actionjammed realityshattering adventure the Universe has ever witnessed! In this movie we have a beautiful cast as Christopher Lambert from Highlander Linden Ashby Bridgette Wilson Robin Shou from Tiger Cage II and Beverly Hills Ninja CaryHiroyuki Tagawa as the bad guy every time I watch a movie from the 90's I see this guy in it been a bad guy! CaryHiroyuki Tagawa was a perfect choice for playing the bad guy sorcerer Shang Tsung who killed Liu Kang's brother. I absolutely love this film it is my childhood film I love the fight choreography in this movie the plot and story was really great. I really like the special visual practical effects and the fight choreographer did a decent job showing those martial arts. It has a beautiful ending a beautiful song to the movie I love the fight scenes with Johnny Cage and Scorpion and it is the best one in the movie the fight scene between Liu Kang and Reptile is perfect the second best martial arts scenes. This is an awesome movie and the games are incredible. That has the REAL Mortal Kombat song. This is a film that is actually about martial arts tournament it has a great characters. Johnny Cage is my favorite character of all time! Linden Ashby was so great and excellent as Johnny Cage I wish he would play more roles like he did his character. I really love this movie one of the most underrated 90's movies I really enjoy and love this film it is fun flick to watch and I grew up with it! Overall I own this movie on Bluray and I absolutely love this movie! I used to had on VSH both of the movies that my mom bought me Mortal Kombat Annihilation on my wish list and I love this one but Annihilation was such a disappointment I hate that movie. I also don't get why this movie got so many hate? I love this film and I don't agree with critics and haters with this film! I think your wrong this movie get's 10 out of 10!

	schema:headline " Awesome adaptation!";
	schema:reviewBody "The only way I can review this is the pros cons similarities and differences between the game and the movie.Similarities 1. The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano Sonya Rayden Liu Kang Johnny Cage Kitana Shang Tsung Scorpion SubZero Reptile and Goro.2. Scorpion has his iconic Get over here! accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands.3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game.4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kickass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones.5. Three words Johnny Cage's nutshots.Differences 1. Little to no and I mean NO fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MKlike action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games fatalities are pretty much an attempt and success at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible.2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved.Pros 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time.2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other gametomovie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games should be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie.3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally I think he's best when it comes to adapting which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games House of the Dead Alone in the Dark Far Cry Postal.Cons 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect.2. The costumes weren't bad but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous.3. Like I stated before no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say but hey it's Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality.Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good could have been better but I'm still fine by what I received.".

	schema:headline " Paul Anderson's only good movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always believed that videogames will never make good movies. But Warner don't seem to understand what a goldmine they're sitting on when it comes to Mortal Kombat. The franchise has so many characters complex backstories and mythology that it honestly dwarfs the XMen. There is a huge amount of potential in Mortal Kombat. This juvenile 1995 effort only scratches the surface of that potential but still manages to be an enjoyable nobrainer.I remember when this was released back in October 1995. It had been No. 1 at the US box office for three straight weeks. The audience did actually manage to go along with the silly tongueincheek hokum and it worked. By modern standards this film is laughably awful. The CGI effects look like they were rendered on a Commodore 64 even when the technology to make much better was readily available at the time. I feel so old thinking about how dated and retro Mortal Kombat is.A bunch of muscular toughguys are called to an exotic island to take part in a fighting tournament that could decide the fate of the planet. The Outworld Emperor wants Earth as his new dominion and is one tournament away from victory. His mortal demonic minions led by the brilliantly overthetop Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa as dark sorcerer Shang Tsung must fight Earth's toughest warriors. All but three are expendable Liu Kang Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade. The film follows them as they fight their way through many colorful environments.It looks and feels very much like an oldfashioned kungfu movie. The production design is frequently wonderful and there's hardly any unlikeable characters. Even 4armed Prince Goro brought to life by lovely puppetry is fun to watch. The story however is paperthin. Like I said it could be so much more but the talent or motivation to make such a film in 1995 just wasn't there.I've never been a fan of Paul Anderson as a matteroffact he's one of the worst filmmakers currently working but his US debut is a fun little potboiler with some funky 90s techno.".

No we didn't kill each other we just loved the characters.Yes despite this being a typical video game movie I still think it was cool to watch still to this day I don't mind watching. It has an awesome soundtrack excellent moves and a great look and feel to the movie itself. Just let go and have fun with it if you enjoyed the video games I think you should enjoy Mortal Kombat.

Using limited SFX to their fullest in the story Anderson gives life to incredible characters and situations with a simple story inspired by the Acclaimed aha Mortal Kombat video game using some of the background story. Anderson manages to stay quite faithful to the game even if blood is nowhere to be found using SFX where needed letting actors have fun  oh yes I forgot Christopher Lambert portraying Rayden with quite some humor but being the wise God dispensing knowledge to human fighters ...

Using limited SFX to their fullest in the story Anderson gives life to incredible characters and situations with a simple story inspired by the Acclaimed aha Mortal Kombat video game using some of the background story. Anderson manages to stay quite faithful to the game even if blood is nowhere to be found using SFX where needed letting actors have fun  oh yes I forgot Christopher Lambert portraying Rayden with quite some humor but being the wise God dispensing knowledge to human fighters ... Fun fun and fun is what you'll get her enjoy!";

	schema:reviewBody "... and then straight away it ends. Did they not realize when they wrote this movie that if they strayed from the storyline at all it would flop?? Well I guess not. Lui Kang Robin Shou was a student at the Shaolin Temple so why did they write it so that he left? They felt there was another movie needed to suggest that you cannot fight your destiny? Give me a break!Straight away we see Lui Kang's brother Chan Kang Steven Ho being killed by Shang Tsung Hiroyuki Tagawa at the Shaolin Temple. There is a definite problem with this. Did Lui Kang have a brother at all??. Where was Kung Lao during all this? Kung Lao is the last descendant of the one who fought in the first Mortal Kombat and won his name sake. Did they study the history at all? The introduction to this movie would have been one hundred times better if they looked into the history of this game. It would have been so much better having Lui Kang as a devoted student of the Shaolin Temple and Shang Tsung carried into the temple on a pagoda and Goro behind him completely covered and hidden by a cloak.Making a prequel to this would have blown away the majority of the fans of Mortal Kombat. It would have also brought in much more money. I have no idea what possessed the people who produced this movie to let it out in the condition that they did. It should have been left on the cutting room floor.Okay. I have said enough about the storyline. But that is not where it stops going down hill. The settings looked completely fake and was sadly lacking in atmosphere. The settings look like painted cardboard plastered onto the structure pulled together to make the setting with no form what so ever. I expected the walls to cave in whenever there was a fight scene. When the camera zoomed out as they climbed up the staircase when they first arrived at Shang Tsung's Island it looked like it belonged in Krull. Now Krull isn't a bad movie for what it was. But let's face it. MK was made 20 years later. Hence the comparison. The sets and scenery should have been 20 years to the better. Not 20 years behind. As for the atmosphere it felt like a pirates' den rather than the island of a great sorcerer in another realm.The fight scenes where do I start? Robin Shou took part as one of the fight choreographers. Unfortunately this does not save the movie. There seems to be no natural flow in any of the fight scenes and how they repeatedly jump off the walls is over the top. Laughter passes my lips every now and then.When I first saw this movie in the cinema I had high hopes but the more I watched it the worse it became. Characters were left out they mixed one and two and there was very little of the background stories for any of the characters. I do have a complement to give however. The casting was spot on. Robin Shou as Lui Kang Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung Linden Ashby as Johnny Cage Brigette Wilson as Sonya Blade and Christopher Lambert as Lord Rayden did an exemplary job at playing their part. They were believable and easy to follow with no complexity or hesitations. The dialogue was well written also with both comical and storyline based scenes.A hand full of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world? Brigette Wilson. Exactly! Christopher Lambert. A wonderfully delivered and written scene. Unfortunately there are times where the dialogue is melodramatic mainly Shang Tsung's one liners. It has begun. and Your soul is mine! although delivered well are too melodramatic and are two of only 3 or 4 lines which were taken from the game at all.There were a lot of games made for this series. If they played their cards right they could have made several great movies all following the rich history and storyline created by the game makers and brought in more money and provided a better level of entertainment. After all if they don't provide us with entertainment they don't get our money. I am very disappointed with this movie and I will not be viewing the third installment to this disaster. This movie gets 1 carrot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just watched this film on T.V. because it was the most interesting thing on and I fancied seeing something I hadn't seen before.  It was rubbish.  This is just another of those martial arts movies that can only appeal to children and those who need to be told but still don't believe that WWF Wrestling is faked.  The kind of people who think that Steven Seagal really is one of the hardest men on the planet.  These films are always full of fights that are choreographed by people who seem never to have seen a real fight or even a decent movie fight the characters taking turns to execute their ridiculous moves. If this is your thing then I envy you it means you can get enjoyment from the worst of movies as well as the best. It is a huge mistake to make a film with such a violent premise as gladiatorial death matches for children it can't be done! Kids from 6 to 13 years would have loved this film had the violence been trimmed to make it suitable for them and yet as it stands the adult viewer is disappointed with the lack of violence. Another problem was Christopher Lambert he is quite a big name and would have undoubtedly taken a serious chunk out of the budget.  I think they would have been wiser to have hired another newcomer for the role of Rayden and kept the money they would have saved for better art direction and SFX. They had the script in their hands and must have known that it wouldn't make money on its own so they gambled on starpower to save them.  What they forgot was that even Lawrence Olivier can look awful with a bad script. They gambled and lost.  The film was obviously short of money the sets were of television standard and lighting has its limits on what it can do to hide this sort of thing.  The effects were the same a small effects house with an inexperienced team cannot hope to look as good as the likes of the masters at I.L.M.  The acting was unremarkable nothing that any soap actor couldn't have done.  The female interest was lacklustre and ordinary looking with even Talisa Soto so poorly lit she looked bland.  The plot was weak as wet tissue paper and the fact that the movie was based on a video game is no excuse it was so full of holes the cast could have fallen through them and I wish they had!  The soundtrack was a vulgar synthesized effort that any music student still in university could have knocked up in his bedroom. Still as I said it will appeal to some people...because some people can get excited by monster trucks! Rating Very poor 210.".

	schema:headline " Blood Mountain";
	schema:reviewBody "The original German title Bergblut translates into English as Blood Mountain a much more poetic and fitting title than the misleading Holy Land of Tyrol.Despite the English title and despite the fact that writerdirector Philipp Pamer was born in South Tyrolia releasing this film on the 200th year anniversary of the Tyrolian rebellion which it depicts this is surprisingly NOT a very patriotic film. Rather than glorifying the peasants of Tyrol who went up against Napoleon it portrays them as flawed human beings crude bigoted and rather unlovable. This took me by surprise and I spent half the movie trying to figure out who the good guys were.Then it dawned on me there really are no good guys. There are good motives good ideals and certainly good intentions but what I liked about this movie was the realism of showing people as they truly are. Although this sort of presentation may be difficult to digest especially if you're expecting a clean goodvsevil war story it gives the tale a provocative dimension.The story itself is basic. It takes the narrative point of view of an upperclass Bavarian woman who gave up all her comforts to marry a poor Tyrolian man. From her frigid welcome into the man's family  country we soon figure out that this is the story of an person faced with extreme prejudice. The interesting part is how she learns to deal with it.The war serves as a backdrop and is not intended to be the primary focus of the film similar to the way The Good the Bad  the Ugly was set during the Civil War without focusing on the war or similar to the way Madame SansGne was set during the French Revolution but was more tuned to personal life. The focus falls instead on individuals personalities and human nature during desperate times.One thing that did seem like a propaganda angle and deservedly so! was the lush scenery  gorgeous landscapes featured prominently. Right after the flick I found myself checking cheap airfares to South Tyrol.

	onyx:emotionText "The original German title Bergblut translates into English as Blood Mountain a much more poetic and fitting title than the misleading Holy Land of Tyrol.Despite the English title and despite the fact that writerdirector Philipp Pamer was born in South Tyrolia releasing this film on the 200th year anniversary of the Tyrolian rebellion which it depicts this is surprisingly NOT a very patriotic film. Rather than glorifying the peasants of Tyrol who went up against Napoleon it portrays them as flawed human beings crude bigoted and rather unlovable. This took me by surprise and I spent half the movie trying to figure out who the good guys were.Then it dawned on me there really are no good guys. There are good motives good ideals and certainly good intentions but what I liked about this movie was the realism of showing people as they truly are. Although this sort of presentation may be difficult to digest especially if you're expecting a clean goodvsevil war story it gives the tale a provocative dimension.The story itself is basic. It takes the narrative point of view of an upperclass Bavarian woman who gave up all her comforts to marry a poor Tyrolian man. From her frigid welcome into the man's family  country we soon figure out that this is the story of an person faced with extreme prejudice. The interesting part is how she learns to deal with it.The war serves as a backdrop and is not intended to be the primary focus of the film similar to the way The Good the Bad  the Ugly was set during the Civil War without focusing on the war or similar to the way Madame SansGne was set during the French Revolution but was more tuned to personal life. The focus falls instead on individuals personalities and human nature during desperate times.One thing that did seem like a propaganda angle and deservedly so! was the lush scenery  gorgeous landscapes featured prominently. Right after the flick I found myself checking cheap airfares to South Tyrol. FYI it's 933 roundtrip from NYC ugh I guess I'll be sticking with the 5 DVD.Acting is well done and convincing cinematography is artistic I loved the extreme darknesslighting sets  costumes are dirty  realistic and the musical score is lavish.

	schema:reviewBody "Bergblut or Das heilige Land Tyrol or Mountain Blood or The Holy Land of Tyrol is a GermanItalian coproduction from 2010 so this movie is already way over 5 years old. Itw as written and directed by Philipp J. Pamer and it is by far his most known work even if it's not a famous film at all. It was actually his very first full feature film after a handful of short films and it took him six years to follow up with his second movie afterward. The two lead actors are Inga Birkenfeld and Wolfgang Menardi and it would really surprise me if many people have heard of these. I guess judging from the cast list the most known cast member is Mathieu Carrire even if he just plays a minor part. So yeah this is a historic movie that takes place in the mountains for the most part during its really massive almost 2 hours runtime. But the material in terms of the quality is far from enough to fill such a quantity unfortunately. The movie takes place early in the 19th century during the days of the famous liberation fighter Andreas Hofer so there is the possibility of this film making an impact from the historical perspective. Maybe it's just me because that's not exactly an era I care for a lot but I also felt this was not elaborated on convincingly. Instead the film loses itself in repetitive love story themes that never involve the audience or actually make an emotional impact and even important subjects of discrimination miscarriage or others never really work as much as the filmmaker wants them to work. So overall the outcome is not a good one and I felt the film dragged a whole lot. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

The title in English could mislead the viewer into thinking this is a religious film which it is not. The people depicted are Catholic and pray the rosary but they're also farming cooking doctoring partying after early success in the rebellion.The Bavarian Katharina is a doctor's daughter in the city of Augsburg who falls in love with a Tyrolean carpenter named Franz and flees with him to his family home in the Alps after a fight with a French soldier of Napoleon's occupation makes him a wanted man. Her inexplicable fortitude and courage to stay on this poor mountaintop farm in the face of Franz's unwelcoming brothers and parents particularly an antagonizing motherinlaw becomes the focus of the film early on. Katharina grew up educated with servants with nice clothes in a lovely home and hasn't the slightest notion of how to milk a cow decant the vinegar or even how to efficiently slice the potatoes. In Hollywood this might have been played for laughs but here the unsympathetic matriarch not only shows her no kindness but consistently chastises her. In town Katharina is also despised because of her nationalityher only ally being the parish priest himself a Bavarian transplant. Her emotional isolation is complete when Franz leaves with his younger brother Veit to serve as sharpshooters in the Tyrolean rebellion.Katharina proves helpful at nursing Franz's ailing father back to health after a gunshot wound and increases her knowledge of folk healing arts working alongside Franz's older brother Hermann a country doctor of sorts who eventually enlists her help in the town's makeshift infirmary for warwounded. Battles themselves happen offscreen and the viewer is spared amputations and other gore while the bloody aprons and bandages establish the facts. The characters' story eventually intersects with that of rebel leader Andreas Hofer a historical figure who espouses the population's desire for selfdetermination and the choice to stop running. But it's not preachy there's no eloquent oratory no supernatural heroics and no perfect characters in this film. Katharina rebukes the Tyroleans who refuse her help pointing out their stupidity and the futility of their outmanned outclassed struggle. She wins and loses the affections of her inlaws during the course of the story. Without giving away any spoilers her marriage has its own ups and downs.I'm trying to brush up on my German so I found this film included with Amazon Prime. I noticed the English subtitles are effective translations and the dialogue is not wordy so it shouldn't be too offputting for people who have little tolerance for reading their movies. It's more about country life and a personal story carried largely by facial expressions characters' behaviors and production design than it is about any sort of details of the war and the political demarcations that were in flux in that era. It's not a pretty period piece but rather a gritty portrait of crude living that does not at the same time belabor the tribulations of trying to farm that impossible landscapeit's not a farming movie it's not a war movie I wouldn't even say it's a love story per se because we don't really know much about Katharina and Franz's courtship and why they're devoted to each other. Still I was strangely enchanted by this film and it's certainly a glimpse of one slice of the Napoleon era that I've never seen anywhere else.".

He is without a doubt one of the cinema's most fascinating minds ever. He is in my opinion the King of the New German Wave of the 70s. And he still makes great and exciting movies! One of his most enchanting moments in his long and ambitious career really was there any man more ambitious in films than he? is Heart of Glass a totally bizarre portrait of a town gone mad. Although the picture for all intensive purposes defies the boundaries of any genre it has been described as an absurdest dramady. That's a pretty suiting classification. If Heart of Glass can be described in one word it would have to be absurd.The film's protagonist Hias a prophet of sorts. He can see the future and seems usually to be depressed with the burden. His village has just lost the proprietor of its livelihood. The foreman of their red Ruby Glass factory the only man who knew the secret of how to make it died without ever getting the chance to pass it on. The town now searches in vain for the secret. Without it they grow depressed and begin losing their sanity particularly the man who owns the glass works factory in his bid to discover the secrets.That's really all that I can disclose about the film. Herzog's film is one based on style and atmosphere getting at something underneath its story. He famously hypnotized the entire cast for each scene save for the actor playing Hias and the professional glassblowers. Much of the dialogue was then improvised in a hypnotic state by the actors. Herzog described how an uneducated man in the cast was hypnotized and then told to read a poem on the wall. The man replied he couldn't' see it without its glasses. Herzog told him to just move forward and he would see it. He then reportedly read off a stunning poem  a work of his own mind since no poem ever existed on that wall. The hypnosis not only gives the actor's improvisations an peculiarity but also their manner of delivery. It's bizarre but totally encompassing.It's moments of comedy are bizarre but joyful. Two men argue about who will die first then the townspeople find them and argue which one is still alive. Later the live man takes the dead man to the pub for a dance as a hurdy gurdy man plays.The film starts with a long shot of Hias sitting in the mountain field watching cows in the fog. Herzog then employs footage he shot of clouds in the mountains taken over the course of days. One shot in particular appears as though a wave of clouds is invading the hills. It's an absolutely breathtaking shot and one that I've never forgotten and likely never will.Herzog once famously suggested that he directs landscapes more so than actors. In Heart of Glass he gives ample evidence to his claim. He takes joy in cutting away to seemingly completely unrelated events a mountain waterfall close up as Hias narrates it is claimed that this shot will have a hypnotic effect especially if you speak German and do not have to read the subtitles smoking springs and ancient trees at Yosemite and a finale that involves a 500 year old monastery on a steep rocky Island off Ireland Skellig Islands fascinating place. The imagery and moody accomplishments of Heart of Glass are difficult to describe in words. It's one of the most visually arresting movie's I've ever seen. Herzog shot the film just a few miles from where he was raised in Bavaria. To list all the stunning shots in the film would be a tedious task. Virtually ever outdoors shot triumphs. It's visual poetry is profound.Heart of Glass is one of Herzog's most unabashedly poetic and abstract films. Who else but Herzog would hypnotize his entire cast for artistic ambitions? It's a glorious film that thrives on its own integrity and the mad visions of its ingenious helmer.".

However in the case of Heart of Glass not knowing that most of the cast is hypnotized and that Hias's prophecies are the actual prophecies of a Bavarian peasant would probably lead me to deem the film pretentious and confusing. That said knowing these facts the film is quite remarkable. I wouldn't read to much into the allegory part of it which is to say that I wouldn't say it's an allegory of something specific in history. I'd say it's more allegoric of human life in general. Senselessly pursuing something unattainable understanding the value of friendship only when it's too late wrestling foes that only we can see foolishly rowing into unknown waters etc. A fine film not Herzog's best but an intriguing one indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "According to IMDb trivia most of the actors were hypnotized by Herzog and given instructions to carry out while acting. Aware of this many comments mention the hypnotizing quality of the movie. The movie is slow and very weird indeed. Take one scene Two men sit at a table they drink beer and talk about a prophecy that one of them will sleep off his hangover lying on the dead body of the other. In the course of this conversation one tears the other at his hair who hits back with his beer mug and so on. Later we see that the prophecy has come true. And later on the living is taking the dead one into the tavern to dance with his corpse. Heart of glass was written by Herbert Achternbusch a prolific Bavarian filmmaker and author who got some mostly local attention during the 1970s80s because of his ruthless opposition against the Bavarian reactionary catholic government personated by the late Franz Josef Strauss. The movie bears a lot of resemblance to Achternbusch's other works. Since Herzog is much better known worldwide I will focus on Achternbusch's contribution here.Achternbusch always mixes his own strange private mythology with regional influences from Northern Bavaria Niederbayern Bayrischer Wald and other often ancient Greek but also all kinds of 'native' mythology. The outcome is not very accessible of course but there are some threads which help to read his works. There is the anarchist despise of power and the sympathy with the victims of power. But this sympathy never leads to illusions about the poor and the wretched. They are ugly because they are made ugly their emotions are coarse  like in the scene described above where two friends are only able to express their affection through violence and death. In Achternbusch's works the only place outside a world where power and violence affect everyone and everything is ruled by absurdity. Where he fails to make sense his journey to freedom begins. Not unlike his fellow countryman Karl Valentin he explores the limits of his own language because language is reason is the tool of the powerful. Achternbusch once said that the only genuine national culture which postwar Germany had left after Worldwar II was that it had no national culture and that it is losing this as well after 1989. Heart of Glass follows a similar 'logic' The industrial revolution represented here by the glassworks once was carried by a dream a secret knowledge the red ruby. This vision of turning the world in a gleaming cold world of glass was terrible in itself yet bore some beauty. Now that this dream is lost industrialization is running loose turning the world into a burning hell aka Worldwars I and II. But here I shall stop trying to make sense of the movie it refuses to yield to reason and so shall I.P.S. Funny to talk about Spoilers when it comes to movies like this.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a rural 1800s Bavarian setting director Werner Herzog tells the timeless tale of tragic loss and its consequences. The young master of a glass mill who appears to be ruling the village of people whose lives revolve around this source of employment becomes obsessed with the formula for the making of a special kind of ruby glass the secret of which the foreman of the factory apparently took to his grave.The bizarre behavior of this young master is compounded by another character Heisl who constantly bubbles over with premonitions affecting the townspeople immediately as well as prophesies reaching beyond their own lifetimes. One account clearly describes the events surrounding WWI and WWII remember that the characters in this story are living in the 1800s.Several of the characters appear to be mad either mentally or emotionally. One young woman is shown in various situations indicating that she is not of sound mind stripping her clothes off and twirling in a daze in a state of mental unconsciousness. The young master's father an elderly man who is shown wearing clothing befitting an aristocrat yet he babbles and laughs uncontrollably all the while refusing to walk. Towards the end as the townspeople are in a panic over a fire the man wanders about his house searching for his shoes then again laughing uncontrollably and without motivation. Two drinking buddies are bewitched by Heisl's premonition that one of them shall die while the other shall walk away from the deadly accident. The events happen just so then the survivor fetches the corpse for a dance. Even when putting this material in the perspective of the setting it appears extremely morbid pointing again to the disproportionally large number of village idiots.Another scene indicating the depth of the symbolism employed by Herzog is set in the primitive jail in which the young master and Heisl are thrown one because he murdered his maid in a euphoric daze the other because he was faulted for wishing the series of misfortunes he had predicted on the village. The young master was pictured with his wrists tied in shackles and chained to the wall while Heisl was pacing the floor restlessly lamenting that he must be in the woods to see things not in this place of confinement. The next scene shows Heisl back in the woods.There are too many gripping scenes in this masterfully written cast photographed and directed film. The authentic Bavarian dialect and the period language give this film true genuineness. Both written and spoken German has evolved considerably in the past 100150 years. Anyone speaking like the characters in this film would be ridiculed today. The difference compares to The King James Bible vs. Webster's Dictionary.Some would consider it strange but upon giving the message of Heart of Glass more thought the viewer must conclude that this is more than an old Bavarian folk tale. When replacing some of the characters with known figures of World History we may be struck with haunting similarities.This is not the kind of film to view in a Sunday Matine but it certainly makes for some great discussions for a film club a university level German class or a literary club. For its many outstanding features this film earns my highest recommendation.".

It is a film that invites you to meditate and freeassociate at your own will. The narrative linear but disjointed suggests a breakdown of time itself a consequence of the lost secret of the glass. The long sections with hypnotizing music and magical landscapes balances well with the rest of the story and there are scenes were dialogue visuals and music creates an incredibly dense atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "Each of Herzog's films is an experiment in one way or another. Heart of Glass is one of the most overtly experimental of the lot. Like almost all of Herzog's films Heart of Glass makes the most of spectacular landscapes and visual context  every scene is in its own way a beautiful stilllife. However in Heart of Glass the effect of the visual context is compounded by the fact that almost every member of the cast  throughout the entire film  is in a state of hypnosis. Predictably the acting is to say the least avantgarde. Nevertheless characterization is strong and more importantly this bizarre somewhat jarring method of execution creates the film's time and place just as much as the gorgeous landscape shots.Heart of Glass takes place in 19th century Bavaria. The Director's comments always worth hearing after viewing a Herzog film indicate that Herzog grew up in a place very much like this. This doesn't stop Herzog from turning his keen analysis of the human condition and modal personalities to attack the central problems of life in this time and place. The story involves a small town in crisis. The one person who holds the secret that is the key to the town's prosperity has taken that secret to his grave and the master of the glass factory in which he worked is losing his mind looking for a solution. Meanwhile one of the film's more sympathetic character's a deeply insightful prophetlunatic shepherd with no sheep Hias predicts an even greater crisis.Herzog's most consistent theme  his view of human nature  is powerfully illustrated in Heart of Glass. As the great director has often done Herzog universalizes his view by giving us an essentially alien dreamlike setting and atmosphere. The effect of the cast's hypnotic state is even more jarring than the sheer intensity of Klaus Kinski's performances in many of Herzog's films from this period and Heart of Glass is as avantgarde as some of his later efforts such as The Great Blue Yonder. In other words the average cinemagoer will have a difficult time with this one.Recommended for Herzog avantgarde and artfilm fans. Not recommended for anybody else.".

In this case he works on the sense of place as the animator of the people within. The fecund harsh motherland as the holder of fate. All of the people  the stuff WE think is important  stagger around in trances barely managing to scoop some minerals some blood out of the pores of the mother to refine into small art here glass objects. The interesting thing with all such projects to me is what the filmmaker does to equate the people we see with the people we are. What he does  or tries to do  here is to put us in a trance with the somnambulant queues and laconic pacing. With the steady drum of tedium with the meditation on beauty. With the careful discovery of charm in the ordinary. Was there ever a more endearing character than Ludmilla? Was there ever less artifice in a character's formation?But Herzog never escapes the Germanic lure to be a craftsman himself to be one of the fine glassworkers he shows. So even though he makes great claims for single takes and discovered framing and accidental light and nuance many  indeed nearly all  of his tableaus are painterperfect. Even though he invests in the nature of place he uses a virtual place assembled from around the globe. Even though his mad factory owner decides to sacrifice the art of the glass by throwing it in a lake Herzog literally with his friends secrets those gems and keeps them safe for our peering.This is what Koyaanisqatsi pretends to be.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

This film simply is a piece of art and cannot be measured with hollywood standards. Besides 2001 a space oddyssey and Chabrols 1969 masterpiece 'The beast must die' this is my altime favourite.";

If you and I were old friends sitting over beers you might get me to talk about that... he responded.  So I asked him if the the arabesque at the end of Heart of Glass held a clue. He responded by repeating that true story of fishermen who left for a rock on the horizon. This movie is a dream about people who allow their dreams to be controlled by the vagaries of the society and economy of the moment because when that is gone and they have no personal dream they are truly lost. Warning All of Herzog's films tend to be poetic allegories and as translucent as the clouds rolling through the Alps in slow motion to the dream music of Popol Vu AKA Florian Fricke who does Herzog's soundtracks and tantric instrumentals.An yes this movie is more obtuse dream like and surreal than even his usual stuff.  So if you want Sound of Music Alpine scenes or real life MTV you will hate this film.  But if you've ever dreamed in color you might enjoy it.".

The writer and director is Werner Herzog and this is why this film is among the most known works from 1970's West Germany. The lead actor here is Josef Bierbichler in his 20s who is still acting successfully these days in German film and worked with Herzog on other occasions too Woyzeck. And while I like Bierbichler and think he has great physical presence in his films similarly to Mario Adorf I must say that his film here did very little to me. This surprised me as I am usually a big Herzog fan. But to me this felt more like a Schlndorff movie perhaps. Yes these almost 100 minutes are full of beautiful shots as always with Herzog and also some nice metaphors but somehow I would have expected a Herzog film on ruby glass to be a lot more memorable. The action was very slow and I felt it was difficult to really get interested in the characters or the story in general. For me this was definitely one of the worst Herzog films I have seen. I cannot recommend the watch here and I have zero interest to ever see it again. Thumbs down.".

	schema:headline " a muddled merging of poetry and documentary a film that will hit miss or both for its audience";
	schema:reviewBody "Heart of Glass is a period piece not merely because of its probable 19th century time period but because of when it was filmed what footage was used the music the acting appropriate in quotes and the experimental attitude. Werner Herzog has always been one of the most unconventional and challenging of filmmakers of himself and for his audience but in this case his challenge almost becomes more of a gimmick. I wonder if my reaction to these nonprofessionals Herzog has here would be any different if I was not aware before that all of the actors were hypnotized save for Hias who to be honest could've fooled me with how his 'performance' goes. Maybe not by much like JeanLuc Godard whom Herzog once said is like intellectual counterfeit money Herzog used his cast as much as gets them to be their unnatural selves by having them almost as mouthpieces to say his dialog more leaning to being stylized poetry as much as their sort of physical presence being controlled to the note. Also like Godard he attempts to combine this with a technique in composition that merges documentary with a sensibility that is as well closer to a form of poetic personal expression. Unfortunately like Godard I mean later Godard though it doesn't really fly.It may for some and in fact it's up there on lists of Herzog fans as one of the best. But the problem is that Herzog is so wrapped up in how everything should try to be in evocation and in his own usually warped way provocation that its a style that can shut out the viewer from what should be a rewardingly hypnotic experience. But even if there was no knowledge of the hypnosis of the cast things still feel off at times I almost felt like I was watching some demented hippie filmmaker from the period waxing and waning in 19th century garb about random intonations in nature or what the 'ruby glass' has in significance with stares and glazed looks and demented laughter. It's not unmerited for a man of such immense talent and artistry of Herzogs's to experiment and push the envelope of how a story can be told and how to get characters on screen in a way that is totally his own. The problem though which is usually not the case particularly with his prime work in the 1970s is to experiment without much of a real story to work with or for that matter any characters to really give a s about. The main character Hias Bierbichler is the one who gets the town into its sort of madness but I didn't even really get this sense until more than halfway into the film. By the end even as Herzog's reached something of a quasiresolution with the factory burning down his message which does lie somewhere in the film about the beauty and dangers of a 'cult' mentality lays in a muck of flat scenes of symbolism.Needless to say however Herzog tripping over himself in my opinion contains moments of wicked absurdity that are quintessential and moments where the documentary style works strongest as well as his ever strong eye for 'adequate images'. Maybe the funniest scene amid two cartoonish looking fellows sitting at a table has these guys in a daze working out their issues with glasses of beer one throws a glass at the other's head without any response as well as the other just dumping the beer on his head. A moment like this or the scattered laughter during a botched glassmaking attempt rises to Herzog as a subtle master of weird comedy. It was also worthwhile to actually see how the glassmaking process actually worked as Herzog's eye for men in a physical act like this was pretty interesting. I even dug the whole fastspeed shot of the clouds running over the valley. But even in getting his footage of landscapes some of it seems like it's aged put to Popol Vuh music that accentuates its 'trippiness' where it doesn't need it. And it's sad to admit that by having characters that give off a totally empty aura in exquisitely framed and lit compositions aren't a good match.For me which it won't be for everyone seeing the film as some may be even more turned off by as being totally boring which is sort of isn't despite its pretensions and for those who find in it great and moving art which is understandable it's not a success. But as with directors like Lynch and Woody Allen and even Godard to a degree I'd rather watch a moment of stumbling than a complacent work by a hack Hollywood director. In the midst of the muddle at the least there are some bright spots of artistic expression.".

Detractors accuse his films of being slow and pretentious a word I hate. I adore Tarkovsky Bergman Antonioni Kieslowski  all of whom suffer the same slings and arrows from wouldbe cineastes  but I just can't get into Herzog at all. I certainly enjoyed some his films more than others  The Enigma of Kasper Hauser Nosferatu The Vampyre and in particular Woyzeck all have their moments for me.Heart of Glass is best known as the outcome of Herzog's most radical experiment having most of the cast perform under hypnosis. Accused to this day of gimmickry Herzog insists that this was done for the sake of stylisation not manipulation in order to add a trancelike aura to the characters' increasing insanity. Factoring in the fact that almost everyone in the film was a nonactor what do you think the outcome was? Let me save you the suspense. The outcome as far as I'm concerned was that we get to watch 90 minutes of people in what appears to be a stoned stupefied coma. This is confounded by the fact that the dialogue  if it can be so called  seems to be written in some trite haiku style. For the most part nobody talks to anybody else they simply recite this flowery contrived poetry at each other. Half the time the actors are not even looking at each other! At the risk of sounding incredibly shallow most of the cast could also be contenders for the title of Ugliest Person Alive.Don't get me wrong I like a film to be challenging but there's a line and Herzog not only crossed it he set fire to it and threw it out the window. There's nothing challenging about an old man in a chair randomly and unconvincingly cackling or a naked baldheaded woman holding a goose yes a goose and staring into space or two halfcooked men slowly pouring beer over each other or a man sitting perfectly still looking at a hand of playing cards while madness ensues around him. This is considered halfarsed filmmaking if we're talking about people like Jess Franco but somehow Herzog gets away with it.I'd love to sit down and watch this again with someone who likes it so I can ask them to point out what I'm missing.The most painful thing about this film is that after 90 minutes of genuine suffering there is very little payoff. Okay I get it Herzog is making a point about faith despair hopelessness and the fragility of humanity the heart of glass. He could have done this just as effectively in ten minutes this being about the collective total of the film's screen time which I would like to see again as it contains some lovely cinematography which has nothing to do with the rest of the film.This notwithstanding the only reason I could recommend this film to anybody is for the sheer baffling pointlessness and stupidity of it.

However try as I might I felt the life being drained from me with each passing minute. Truly this is an almost impossible to watch film. And this is saying a lot as I have seen and enjoyed tons of pretentious art films! The biggest problem with me and this films is that although the towns people SHOULD have been depressed none were upsetjust catatonic. It made the film utterly joyless and SHOULD have been better. For example La Femme du Boulanger from Marcel Pagnol had a very similar theme but was clever and funand is one of the best French films of the 1930s. Unlike Heart of Glass it did NOT feature scenes showing a pile of dead flies or Hias the fortuneteller talking about the apocalypse!".

However try as I might I felt the life being drained from me with each passing minute. Truly this is an almost impossible to watch film. And this is saying a lot as I have seen and enjoyed tons of pretentious art films! The biggest problem with me and this films is that although the towns people SHOULD have been depressed none were upsetjust catatonic. It made the film utterly joyless and SHOULD have been better. For example La Femme du Boulanger from Marcel Pagnol had a very similar theme but was clever and funand is one of the best French films of the 1930s. Unlike Heart of Glass it did NOT feature scenes showing a pile of dead flies or Hias the fortuneteller talking about the apocalypse!";

The script may suck but the visuals the cinematography and the miseenscene represent some of the greatest moments in all cinema. It's not a nonstop beauty festival but there are many individual scenes of outrageous splendor. If only Herzog had planned the script as intricately as he searched out locations for the shoot. What this film really reminds me of an Andrei Tarkovsky or Michelangelo Antonioni film with no substance whatsoever. I can't give Heart of Glass more than a 710 but in many ways it's a must see.

I have to say though thanks to the wonder of DVDs this does come with an accompanying conversation with the director. Watching the commentary track is for me a far more engaging and satisfying experience. Enjoyable too! Herzog is simply marvellous in giving full explanations in instances such as the circumstances of the hypnosis and totally uncooperative when the questioning gets a bit close to seeking 'the answer'. I always hate it when an artist is asked to interpret his work as if there would be any point in it if it can be fully explained another way and here Herzog slaps down his interviewer on several occasions.

	schema:reviewBody "Heart of Glass begins with a scene of quiet contemplation as the central protagonist sits alone on a rock overlooking a field of cattle entranced by the pulsating sounds of the Scandinavian soundtrack and the sight of a thick impenetrable fog that lingers across the screen. The pace of this scene and of course the pace of the proceeding film is one of slow foreboding and persistent dread as the filmmaker allows the images to run naturally refusing to break the trancelike pace that is slowly being created between the subtle symbiosis of sound and vision. At this point the voice over comes in and the film cuts to a lengthy shot of a cascading waterfall that we as an audience are directed to stare into. Here Herzog is inviting the audience albeit subjectively to drift off into the same dreamlike state that is inhabited by his characters and indeed enter into a hypnotic realm of woozy reflection and severe stylisation.It is important for Herzog to establish such a lethargic and entrancing mood at the beginning of the film with the stylisations here used to convey to the audience the sense of blind obsession entrancement possession and greed. Around this central cinematic notion as well as the basic plot  the film is further fleshed out by Herzog and his cinematographer Jrg SchmidtReitwein who here creates some haunting and hypnotic compositions which further compliment those bold stylisations and overexaggerations or indeed underexaggerations depending on how you look at it from Herzog and his performers. To some extent the film is similar to von Trier's masterpiece Europa with both films beginning with their director's using repetitive imagery and a powerful voiceover to captivate the audience before leading them into this strange world in which the actors don't necessarily build characters but rather perform like rigid marionettes composed onto these lush beautiful landscapes all the while being controlled throughout by the director.The film is also quite similar to the work of Tarkovsky with Herzog purposely drawing the film out so that scenes unfold slowly creating a dense and suffocating atmosphere that seems right for the story whilst the use of philosophy mysticism and the idea of dreams and visions isn't that far away from the ideas and ideologies of some of Tarkovsky's key films for example Nostalgia and The Sacrifice. Of course certain images  such as the seemingly mentally handicapped woman doing a random striptease on a tabletop or the lethargic barfight that erupts from a moment of quiet contemplation  could have only come from the same man that gave us the treetop riverboat from Aguirre or Stroszek's dancing chicken. However there are many aspects of the film I don't quite understand for example the ending with the surreal nature of the film and the mystical aspects of the plot making the whole thing quite impenetrable for the casual viewer. So if you're looking for an easy way into Herzog's work... then this isn't it and you'd be better off sticking to something like Aguirre The Wrath of God The Enigma of Kaper Hauser or the acclaimed Fitzcaraldo.All we can be sure of with Heart of Glass is the bare bones of the plot with the central character prophesising the town's downfall in his opening hypnotising dream before we move into the actual narrative in which the town try desperately to figure out the correct method of creating ruby glass which has been an integral part of the town's financial success for many generations. The only person who knowsknew how to create the glass was the town's elder who dies at the start of the film therefore leaving his son and his various cronies to tear the town apart in the hope of finding some hidden instructions that may or may not have been left lying around. As the town descends into slow hysteria our central protagonist relocates to the mountains and has a vision of surreal potency  not entirely dissimilar to the vision at the end of The Enigma of Kasper Hauser  and the film ends there with a question mark as opposed to a full stop. As with most Herzog films the final shot is absolutely gorgeous and somehow makes us want to go back and rewatch the film and reevaluate it further in the hope of discovering more about it's elusive charms and stark ambiguities.Heart of Glass is without question Herzog's most demanding work... asking a great deal of patients and concentration from the audience most of whom will be alienated by the film's lethargic pace and stark stylistic diversions. However despite these factors the film still remains one of Herzog's defining moments  easily on a par with films like Strozseck Signs of Life and Fata Morgana and possibly more integral than Nosferatu and the later Cobra Verde  with the director creating another poetic dreamlike allegory about greed trust fate and obsession making this film an obvious stylistic and theoretical close cousin to his masterworks Aguirre Woyzeck and The Enigma of Kasper Hauser. Although it perhaps lacks some of the depth and emotional complexity of those works it is without question an enchanting film which despite it's alienating qualities and cinematic short comings remains a haunting and hypnotic visual experience without equal.".

The four actors are great and so absolutely convincing that I can't imagine they played anything but themselves. The characters are smart and their arrangement discloses some interesting correlations. It made me think about my own 'inner odds' and the question where they come from and if there's a way to overcome. I can't remember a film that was going so deep I even think it raises some of the most important questions of our soul or psyche  which are normally dealt with very superficially.

This program is clearly geared to evoke a variety of politically correct responses to the fuzzy and questionable pseudoscience prevalent in society today.Firstly the way humanity steps off this mortal coil makes a huge tremendous difference in how events would play out. Simply vanishing is a dramatic but narrowminded way to captivate the viewer and instills a do not question attitude that again is so prevalent with pseudoscience.We are shown elephants in a suburban neighborhood where all the trees are denuded. This would be understandable if the elephants were late comers to the feast but they are first arrivals. It is June but the filming must have been done in autumn or very early spring. Just lousy editing.We are shown lions hunting a baboon in a playground and the poor felines can't get the ape because it's on a plastic tubeslide. However the slide comes off a wooden play structure that has a flight of stairs but we're expected to believe the lions are such lousy hunters they don't circle the structure and go up the stairs.We are told that birds fly south and more will survive this year because the lights in the cities are off. The narrator explains that birds navigate by the stars and in cities at night many circle the buildings till they tire and die. Now I've seen a dead bird or two in cities but the suggestion here would have us find hundreds or thousands every morning. It's patently ridiculous.Many of the mechanical catastrophes depicted seem on the whole accurate however since most people do not visit their Waste Water Facilities they are unaware of how they work and this shockumentary takes advantage of that ignorance to outright lie about it's failure.Further there is a claim directly from the EPA and the IPCC that automobiles pump out 19 pounds of CO2 per gallon of gasoline. Now the fuzzy pseudoscience crowd adore the EPA and IPCC mainly because these agencies do not use the scientific method when doing science. They start from a solution and work backwards to prove it as opposed to asking the question and experimenting to determine the answer. Gasoline is basically 8 Carbons with 18 Hydrogen. In one pound of gasoline there is about 0.84 pounds Carbon and when burned in the combustion engine combines with about 2.24 pounds Oxygen to become 3.08 pounds of CO2 nowhere near 19 pounds.Why is it the pseudoscience crowd always lies about their claims? They'd get more mileage from the truth but then they wouldn't get any money from the average Joe who can't be bothered to study the real science.Watch this movie for the entertainment value but please please please educate yourself and your children as you watch so you don't get caught believing the hype and dogma.".

It's patently ridiculous.Many of the mechanical catastrophes depicted seem on the whole accurate however since most people do not visit their Waste Water Facilities they are unaware of how they work and this shockumentary takes advantage of that ignorance to outright lie about it's failure.Further there is a claim directly from the EPA and the IPCC that automobiles pump out 19 pounds of CO2 per gallon of gasoline. Now the fuzzy pseudoscience crowd adore the EPA and IPCC mainly because these agencies do not use the scientific method when doing science. They start from a solution and work backwards to prove it as opposed to asking the question and experimenting to determine the answer. Gasoline is basically 8 Carbons with 18 Hydrogen. In one pound of gasoline there is about 0.84 pounds Carbon and when burned in the combustion engine combines with about 2.24 pounds Oxygen to become 3.08 pounds of CO2 nowhere near 19 pounds.Why is it the pseudoscience crowd always lies about their claims? They'd get more mileage from the truth but then they wouldn't get any money from the average Joe who can't be bothered to study the real science.Watch this movie for the entertainment value but please please please educate yourself and your children as you watch so you don't get caught believing the hype and dogma.";

The outdoor scenes in the mountains just blew me away and the acting of the two main characters  the children  is really impressing. The film was realized with love to the detail and I got a good impression how life was a hundred years ago. The film has the potential to become a film classic itself.

	schema:reviewBody "Bergkristall is a German Germanlanguage film from 2004 and one of the more recent efforts by director Joseph Vilsmaier even if the film is also almost 15 years old already. This one is from the days when his wife Dana Vavrova was still alive and of course she appears in here too just like some of their children. Also on board but with not too much screen time is Katja Riemann and so is her daughter so it is a bit of a family affair. The script is by Klaus Richter and it is of course based on an old tale by Adalbert Stifter and this is not the first time this one has been turned into a film but maybe the most known. Like pretty much all other works by Vilsmaier there is a strong South German component in here in terms of language and photography the mountains are dominant. Still atg the center of it all is the story of two families who have not gotten alonge well at all for a long time and what happens when their young children do get along better than anybody would want them to. The performances are all solid the photography is decent and the story is not too shabby either and yet there was something missing here for me to get me really to care about the characters depicted I must say. It's tough to put a finger on it what the exact reason may be. It's not necessarily the bleakness of it all or that I did not really connect with any of the characters in here I think. I just did not care for anybody overall or what would happen to them or that the families eventually get along andor that the kids may spend as much time with each other as they want to. The heart that the film offers felt like it never got an approach where it really gets you emotionally involved and the eventual search for the kids in the mountainside is when the film is perhaps at its weakest as it tries so hard to be a dramatic highlight but never really comes even close to truly making an impact. Or making an impact at all. Quite a shame to be honest. I think this film had all the potential to be something far better than it eventually turned out. You will find quite a few known names and familiar faces from Germany's movie industry in here. Some I mentioned already and others would be the young Lau and Goeske but also Tidof Wlaschiha Knaup and others you probably came across in other projects already if you are interested in German film. Nonetheless I overall do not recommend checking out these slightly under 1.5 hours. It wasn't a memorable watch on any occasion. Go for something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Transporter' is pretty good for what it is  a sleek slick highoctane action thriller that couldn't possibly expect us to believe anything we are seeing on screen and quite frankly doesn't care that we don't.  That attitude is probably all for the best in this case since it allows the filmmakers to devise elaborate action and stunt sequences without having to pay the slightest heed to that fantasy killjoy known as credibility.'Jason Statham literally drips attitude as The Transporter a stolid nattily dressed former military man who spends his time delivering packages no questions asked all over the French Mediterranean for what turn out to be some pretty shady criminal clients.  One day he discovers that the package' he is to deliver happens to be a human being  a pretty young Chinese girl named Lai Kwan who has been dropped bound and gagged into the trunk of the sporty car on which he lavishes most if not all of the love and caring he has to offer.  Yet Frank turns out despite his initial air of callous and selfserving indifference to be a criminaltype with a heart of gold and he is soon helping Ms. Kwan foil an attempt by her nefarious father to sell a crate load of Chinese immigrants into slavery.   However the plot is the least of the matter when it comes to a movie like The Transporter.' This film is far more concerned with attitude and style than it is with its storyline which exists merely as a vehicle on which to hang all the explosions car chases and kickboxing fight scenes that have become the stockintrade for modern action pictures.   The movie is well directed well edited and quite beautifully photographed by cinematographer Pierre Morel who gives the film's French Riviera setting a bright sparkling sheen.   In fact Morel's camerawork here is some of the best I have seen in a film in a very long time.In addition to Statham who makes for a very cool' action film hero Francois Berleand turns in a wonderful performance as a shrewd wisecracking police inspector who knows that Frank is up to something but who has enough faith in his own instincts to at least give the man the benefit of the doubt.  Qi Shu is cute and charming as the uninvited and unwelcome complication' that steps into Frank's smoothrunning wellordered life.The Transporter' is the cinematic equivalent of junk fast food  not high in nutritional value but quickly consumed and satisfying when you don't have the time or inclination for something more demanding.   Like its coolunderpressure protagonist the film delivers the goods.".

But the plot was secondary to the action it only served to make the bad guys bad and the good guys good.  The rest was up to Jason Statham's considerable fighting talents.There were some unbelievable yet jawdropping stunts a terrific fight scene in oil and some great car chase scenes.  There were no smarmy oneliners making light of good action sequences as is too often the case in Americandirected action flicks.  The hero was cold yet compassionate.  He didn't kill unnecessarily but when he had to he was ruthless.  There are many great action sequences some so unbelievable you have to just shake your head and remember that action movies are not supposed to be based on reality.  There is even a great shot of the hero jumping off a speeding semi while it races over a bridge onto the back of a bus going perpendicular to the truck under the bridge!!  I mean come on!  It would never happen but I have to give credit to the stunt coordinator who imagined the possibilities.There is another hilarious scene where the hero chases down an airplane on foot hijacks it jumps out of the plane at great altitude in order to land on the back of a speeding transport with a conveniently located borrowed parachute!  I am glad all crop dusters carry such indispensable equipment and that it is so easy to land on the back of a truck speeding down the highway at 130 KMhour.All in all 90 minutes of sheer enjoyment.  Even with the predictable ending I have to highly recommend this movie.  If you can suspend belief for a little while you will be rewarded.".

He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt Matt Schulze. Instead of delivering the goods he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...A fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight.

One of his latest and most ambitious projects was The Transporter released in 2002.I have to admit this is one flick I approached with a very open mind  very open. I mean I like Jason Statham. I think he's a pretty cool guy and at first even I questioned his casting as Frank Martin in The Transporter. But the problem is and I'm assuming this is the result of the quickly edited action scenes which were toned down to make the film PG13 he's not being given the room to really be the best he can be.As the lead character he's a transporter. He can get you your associates or your property anywhere anytime on time no questions asked. But you know what? Common sense tells us that it was curiosity that killed the cat and the cat in this picture thankfully doesn't die some horrible death but instead curiosity yields him a break  a beautiful woman named Lai Shu Qi  bound and gagged and in the trunk of his BMW.It's not spoiling much that she and Frank get together and as a result are forced to do battle with shady and vicious American businessman Wall Street Matt Schulze and his army of highkicking disposable assassins. There's a little more to the plot and Lai and the circumstances surrounding her appearance in the trunk of Frank's car and it involves some smuggling of poor Chinese immigrants from China to Europe where much of the action takes place.Speaking of action and there's plenty of it Statham does display some pretty impressive moves but the frantic editing just doesn't do him justice. He obviously worked out for this part and there are frequent moments when his ripped torso is on display. He also barely manages to shy away any possible accusations that he's just a British novelty to American audiences. Director Corey Yuen whose work on Jet Li's 2001 action film Kiss of the Dragon I admired is behind it and Besson's got a producer credit.The problem may not be Statham because I think he's a really cool actor with a raspy British accent but the script is worth some deeper examination by more thoughtful minds. There are plenty of holes and unanswered questions i.e. the extent of Frank's military training and experiences Lai and how she wound up with Frank and her quarrelsome relationship with her father who is played by Ric Young and the plot with the Chinese smuggling.But why am I making such complaints? The Transporter is an action movie no plot required. Despite some bumps in the road The Transporter is pure action fun from beginning to end and I got my free ticket to see The Transporter 2 on Friday.710".

Jason Statham makes a great tough guy loved him in The Italian Job as well.I recommend inviting your friends over grabbing some Orangina and watching this great movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Meet Frank Martin. Martin Jason Statham is a retired British Special Forces officer currently enjoying retirement in France. Well sort of retirement. Frank actually makes his living by transporting goods or people from one location to another. His services have made him a millionaire many times over evidenced by his oceanview palace. The twotower structure comes complete with fancy gates a brick driveway a garden two kitchens and even an elevator. In his pristine garage resides the only love of his life a perfect BMW. His services come with three rules the deal never changes no names and never look in the package.The movie begins when Martin arrives with perfect punctuality outside of the world's richest bank. He is to whisk three robbers to safety but four emerge. Citing rule number one Martin refuses to leave and calmly explains why he cannot carry four men. The lead robber puts a gun to his head but without the ignition code he cannot drive. Checkmate. The panicking leader executes the fourth man.Martin starts the car and is pursued by police in a wild chase through busy streets and narrow alleyways. Dodging and swerving his way to safety Martin outsmarts the police in the film's high point. This car pursuit has drawn comparisons to a similar scene in The Bourne Identity.The movie only rests for little while and then it is on to his next job. His contact explains the job then says It is for a man named... No names Martin interrupts reiterating his strict adherence to the rules. The client's name is Wall Street I suppose since he is only addressed with pronouns. The cargo is large bag to be fit in his trunk.While tending to a flat tire on the way he notices his cargo squirming. Curiosity gets the best of him and he discovers a hopelessly bound girl Qi Shu with her mouth sealed shut as well. He has no sympathy and completes the deal but when his customers double cross him he enacts revenge and the hostage ends up in his home.The girl Lai is grateful for the help and stays with him though she is free to leave. However her former captors are not too happy with her current quarters. 5000 bullets later she informs Martin that she was smuggled in from China as part of a human slavery operation and many more will follow.Up until this point the film is performing admirably but once it's second half commences the wheels begin to fall off one by one. The chemistry existing between Statham and Shu in the first act quickly evaporates. Not even the discovery of Martin's conscience works.We are led to believe that Lai's father Ric Young is one of the slaves but we later find out that he is the mastermind behind the operation. This new discovery throws into question why Lai was in the bag in the first place and raises many other questions as well. The film never gives its audience the courtesy of answering those questions and it feels as if Luc Besson is making it up as he goes.The action also goes down the toilet. It mostly consists of Frank being confronted by a group of ruffians and knocking them to the floor. Each man rises up to fight again and every time he has them beaten more henchmen appear and join the fray. His reluctance to use lethal force is astounding. The invulnerability of every character completely undermines the effectiveness of everything the film wants to do and reduces it to the level of Beverly Hills Ninja. The climax involves Frank parachuting onto to a semitruck in an attempt to commandeer it. It is boring and reminded me of how much more I enjoyed the semitruck chase in License to Kill.Statham flourishes as the amoral Martin and Qi Shu fares well as the confused and vulnerable young girl in strange surroundings. Francois Berleand is satisfactory as a friendly but suspicious detective but has no interesting material. Matt Schulze falls flat in embarrassing fashion with his lifeless treatment of Wall Street. Ric Young is equally bad. Even Shu who probably set the record for time being bound on camera becomes a drone in the second half.Cory Yuen is better than this. Luc Besson is better than this. Moviegoers deserve more than an action film that slowly destroys itself. The first half warrants a good score but what follows is so putrid that The Transporter rates only a four out of ten.".

You know that the girl will save his life and kill her father you know it  but you really don't want it to happen and when it does well  lets just say that every time i watch the ending I want to throw the TV out the window.

In all fairness I thought she was really cute as Lai  the woman who complicates things by popping up from the bag but also viciously annoying with her little highpitched girly screams and submissive approach. Thankfully Statham and Shu's onscreen chemistry makes up for this and facilitates the whole plot on an important fundamental level. Because they are so different machoman vs. girly girl they somehow look great juxtaposed.This plot never strays from its template story. Ever. It's simple. It's straightforward.

The fight scenes are uniquely detailed attempts to copy the style and energy of Jackie Chan. But the former film is a proper hardbitten thriller where sinister people on both sides are fighting for high stakes. When cars are driven down public streets innocent members of the public get hurt. 'Transporter' crosses over into Blues Brothers territory such as the car leaping into the air from a standing start and landing on the lorry.

This attempts the same thing in a illfitting version of a 'hardbitten' thriller and ends with sheer nonsense. After the endless fight on the bus and in the station one man in unarmed combat versus dozens there is then the ridiculous fight in the oilcovered room with its absurd bicycle pedal denouement. The hero then returns to the bus station and takes a gun from an injured man. If the injured man had a gun why didn't he use it? Throughout the movie the baddies have guns and use them except when the scriptwriter decides to fit in some Jackie Chan action.The 'hero' in this movie is in fact an extremely unpleasant individual. He is quite prepared to deliver The Girl into slavery or whatever fate awaits her. He rejects a number of chances to help her even after he has discovered the only important thing about the character that she is hohum exceptionally attractive. OK  that's the stereotypical antihero.

And second the ending which remarkably is an almost scene by scene copy of the ending in the James Bond flick LICENCE TO KILL. I mean there are homages and then there are ripoffs and the ending in THE TRANSPORTER is a total ripoff of the ending in the 007 movie. It's unreal. I'm surprised Brocoli corp  MGMUA didn't sue. During the climax in both films there are two trucks transporting illegal goods with the villains in two cars driving behind the trucks. In both films the hero flies over the moving vehicles in a cropduster and lands on one of the trucks. In both films the hero battles with the driver of one of the trucks and gains control of it. In both films the cars try to shoot the hero by driving next to the trucks. In both films the hero ends up underneath the truck and his shot at by the villain in the cars with machine guns etc. There's no need to go on. The whole thing is ridiculously similar. The scenery even looks similar in both films.Except for a couple of ok fighting scenes THE TRANSPORTER was an almost complete waste of time.".

Some of the acting by the supporting actors is rather bad on the other hand though Jason Strathan has a very natural and commanding presence on screen and makes an interesting choice for an action hero. Qi Shu has a very thick accent and her English isn't very good but she delivers a very impassioned and probably better then this film deserves performance.

Statham this is the first film I saw him in he's now one of my favorite actors dazzles the screen as the amazing driver of the BMW right from this opening.I could talk about character development and there is some on Frank's Statham's character's part acting and it was decent et cetera but in all honesty that's not what this film is about. This is about having fun watching some amazing martial arts and viewing some great driving. Not to say that it totally relies on action I absolutely loathe xXx for everything it represents just that the action scenes are simply the highlights of the film.And that's why this is one of my favorite action films. The martial arts were some of the best I've seen. Though they may not have been all entirely believable well this is an action film they were always at least possible versus something like The Matrix. And they were great eyecandy. The martial arts also utilized many things that haven't been in past martial arts flicks ex fighting in oil thus much slipping around etc. Basically action  good.The action direction that Corey Yuen contributes gives John Woo a run for his money. The cinematography seemed to always provide a clean crisp French Riviera sunshine that gave a vibe of energy and excitement and aesthetic appeal. Fight scenes were never hard to follow and always fun to watch. Car chases were beautiful. I don't know if I've said it yet but this is a great action film! It's never too overthetop and it's not totally nonstop action so the action that is provided is boosted that much more. A mustsee for actionbuffs Statham fans or Shi Qu fans this is one of the most recent cult films I know of.".

All the films I come across here have without exception been given the 810 and 910 ratings which only the truly devoted award. And each of of those films has also earned the very pitiful 110 and 210 ratings.On the one hand praise such as 'awesome dude truly awesome' and 'real genius dude this is the real sht' are bandied about like beer at a truckers convention on the other those same films get also '90 minutes out of my life I'll NEVER get back!!!' 'this SUCKED big time man!!!' and 'this would get 010 if the system allowed it' from other less enchanted viewers. All that is only to be expected and  clich alert  wouldn't the world be a duller place if we all thought the same. But what do you do when you see a wellmade entertaining piece of complete schlock which stands head and shoulders about its peer films and then a wellmade very moving and thoughtful film which is unlike the schlock as cheese is to chalk? In all honesty there can be no comparison yet both deserve a high rating.Of its kind Transporter does stand out. But it does so without characterisations and plot entirely. What vague storyline there is simply the help the hero in this case Jason Statham roar from one fight to the next. In in Transporter's case it works. Why I have no idea. Certainly the producers hired good talent not least Luc Besson who has latterly made this kind of film his stock in trade. A great deal about this film boasts 'class' except it has to be said the film itself. But the point is it doesn't matter. You don't go to your neighbourhood hamburger joint and expect haut cuisine and you would be thought of as dimwitted if you then criticised the joint for not reaching haut cuisine standards.So those who like this kind of thing the Transporter movie will get their money's worth and then some. And it would be futile not to say ineffably silly to criticise Transporter for being utterly and ludicrously over the top. Because of course it is meant to be utterly and ludicrously over the top. It succeeds and stands out for several reasons. One is Jason Statham the Transporter. I like Jason. I have now seen him in three films and I'm on his side. If Jason gets through his day job by not taking it seriously he doesn't show it. But nor does he give the impression of believing himself to be 'an artist'. He has a certain quality about him which if not unique is rare. He knows what he can do and presumably what he can't do and doesn't pretend. With Jason you feel what you see is what you get. And I like that. I could of course be completely wrong but somehow I don't think so and it is that certain honesty which comes across on camera and helps to raise what is at heart pretty mediocre material rather higher. Jason gives value for money. If Jason flipped hamburgers you could be pretty sure they would be standout topdollar hamburgers. And it is that quality which carries the film as far as I am concerned.In another's hands the role he takes would go bearshaped quite soon although that is not to say there aren't other men about with the same quality as Jason. There are other 'hard men' out their  Vin Diesel and Steven Seagal although I haven't seen a film by either  but I doubt whether any of the others would carry it off as Jason does. So there you have it Transporter is not The Merchant Of Venice On Golden Pond ET Schindler's List The Godfather or any of the other films which get consistently good ratings. It is just another macho piece of bs. The important difference is that of its kind it is rather more impressive in that way rather like anther Luc Besson scripted film District 13. Hence my high rating.".

When I went to see this movie I was expecting a nice Roninesque like action flick. Especially considering I'm a huge fan of Jason Statham and all the previous movies he has done. Instead I've got a poorly thrown together clichs and scenes with absolutely no point. The lead female character barely speaks English they TRY to explain this fact in the movie and needs to spend much more time in acting school. That probably goes for at least half of the actors in the film. The soundtrack is horrific. The music in and of itself is great however it seems as in the sounds somehow were mixed up and the wrong music was played at the wrong scene. There are times where techno is playing during a slow scene and a nice slow song plays during an action sequence. The dialogue is forced the story is clich and nothing whatsoever stands out from this movie to write about. The only decent scene was the car chase at the beginning of the movie and the fight scene between Jason and the many villains in the warehouse. It did manage to show off Jason's potential as an action hero as well as had some creative fighting moves. However this movie has nothing to offer. The same action can be seen in different and much better films. Avoid this as you would the Black Plague.1 out of 10".

There are so many things wrong with this film that it's difficult to know where to start.  Just how dumb can a film actually be?  The following situations in the film just defy belief Contains Spoilers!1 The breathing apparatus conveniently stored in the water under Franks house!2 Frank chasing a light aircraft  on foot  and catching up with it!3 The truck steering and accelerating all on it's own while Frank is fighting the bad guy inside it!4 The bad guy conveniently having a time bomb in a suitcase handy to give to Frank when he drops of the package!5 The bad guys getting to the bus station so quick!Don't get me wrong I love a nice wellmade brainless action flick as much as the next guy but The Transporter is so pathetic so ridiculous and just so plain DUMB that I actually felt insulted after I watched it. Also6 Jason Statham's accent!  What the hell is going on there??7 The music!  Could they have actually chosen worse music for this film?? It annoys the hell out of you and does not fit the onscreen action at all. The song played over the end credits is absolutely hilarious unintentionally of course  just have a listen to the lyrics and you'll see what I mean.As a comedy this is about as good as it gets!  The ludicrous scenes described above coupled with terrible accents and an even worse plot means you'll be laughing out loud most of the way through  I know I was. However as an action movie this is definitely one to avoid. like the plague!".

The plot itself is not only bad but is thrown together making for a really patchy film. The action is great  but that's all. Even at some points its absolutely ridiculous what is pulled off. I found myself laughing at a few parts. And those weren't the parts I was supposed to be laughing at.Transporter tries to be funny at parts and it really isn't. It tries to be serious throughout when really it's just weird. I wouldn't recommend this movie even as an action flick since most of the action is repetitive and unrealistic. For example two cars collide and burst into flames before they barely even hit each other. But what bothered me most about this film is the extremely poor music selection. What was left of the Transporter that made it any bit redeeming was ruined by the awful soundtrack. Half of it was hiphop when there really shouldn't have even been music. And the score for the rest of the film simply isn't that good and doesn't fit the tone of the movie. All in all it was another disappointing movie rental. I could keep the flick for another week but I returned it the day after. I didn't really want to look at it. This kind of makes me not want to see Transporter 2 but I will still give it a chance.".

Ironically perhaps the best example of this is the television series CASUALTY where if the camera shows a chip pan then you can be sure it'll burst in to flames later in the sequence . In some ways this is a film employing the anti hierarchy of image since it toys with the audience in to thinking they're going to see an object kill the hapless victim only for the rug to be pulled from under their feet .

It gets a quick reaction like ooh I feel your  pain man.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a 90 minute or so string of those painful shots  as each character one by one meets an unfortunate death by household  appliance. Bodies are slammed by trucks heads are impaled and limbs  fly through the air. When one of the characters dies when her car's  airbag explodes out of nowhere I blurted Yeah! Wow did they do  that??? Yeah they DID do that. Right on!  Although the film has a very serious atmosphere about it what with the  creepy score and people sincerely freaking out and everything it still  retains a campy humor about it buried beneath its highbudget exterior.  Many movies would shy away from smashing up plastic ketchupfilled  dummies opting instead to avoid the gore. Not FINAL DESTINATION 2!  This movie is an honest approach to moviemaking hearkening back to  the day when you got together with friends and said Okay in this  scene we cut to the dummy falling off the building it's run over by a  Mack truck and it splatters chunks of blood all over that Oldsmobile  over there.  As for the premise behind FINAL DESTINATION 2 how do I put it into  words? A.J. Cook has premonitions that people died in a nasty pileup on  the highway. Thing is this never happened. And ... she continues to  have premonitions that those same people will die in due time. Those  people eventually die. Did I get that right? The universal law of  nature is that well Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix  its mistakes which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet  and other freak accidents of home improvement. If this all sounds  convoluted watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.  The premise of FINAL DESTINATION 2 as much potential as it might have  doesn't make much sense and is pretty hokey but if you medicate your  inquisitive mind with heavy sedatives you'll be able to look past the  flimsy premise and enjoy the movie. I'm definitely looking forward to a  Final Destination 3.".

So I didn't see it in the theaters.  I was wrong. If anything the commercials used the film footage to mislead you so that the surprises were even greater.For what Final Destination 2 is trying to do they do it perfectly.  From the script to the acting to the directing.  This was a tough score for me. While it doesn't rate up there with the the best films of all time.  In every aspect they perfectly accomplished what they set out to do.  It's a Thriller full of a lot of unpredictable turns and surprises and with great action.  They wasted no time the movie starts they get right into it and it keeps on at pretty much full pace until it's done.".

So I didn't see it in the theaters.  I was wrong. If anything the commercials used the film footage to mislead you so that the surprises were even greater.For what Final Destination 2 is trying to do they do it perfectly.  From the script to the acting to the directing.  This was a tough score for me. While it doesn't rate up there with the the best films of all time.  In every aspect they perfectly accomplished what they set out to do.  It's a Thriller full of a lot of unpredictable turns and surprises and with great action.  They wasted no time the movie starts they get right into it and it keeps on at pretty much full pace until it's done.";

Unfortunately the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects.

In such a desensitized world we live in being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first the deaths are better. Kimberly A.J. Cook is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers Ali Larter the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex who died between films had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end this is a very good sequel that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.810 check this film out as its very entertaining.".

I much prefer the good old prosthetic latex approach which is gorier and more realistic see Scanners The Fury Day Of The Dead Robocop etc. There is a nice score by Shirley Walker which creates some suspense the opening highway pileup has some great stuntwork and most of the characters have horrorfilm director names.

	schema:headline " More gory than the first but not as good";
	schema:reviewBody "The director obviously thought that when making a sequel everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory and only that practically no buildup to the scenes and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody gory death scenes you won't like this movie. In fact you will most likely hate it unless you're a big fan of the genre or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest and probably made forand maybe even by fans of the old bodycount movies from the 1980's. It has very little realism whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes this had little to none at all. As many other slasher movies it has the little twistintheend at the very end but it is very weak considering what it could have been. The first movie is a lot better but if you need to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die this isn't the worst you can watch. But if the choice is between this and the first I would definitely choose the first. 710".

	onyx:emotionText "The director obviously thought that when making a sequel everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory and only that practically no buildup to the scenes and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody gory death scenes you won't like this movie. In fact you will most likely hate it unless you're a big fan of the genre or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest and probably made forand maybe even by fans of the old bodycount movies from the 1980's.

Acting direction script just name it it's all bad in the words strongest meaning. In some places she is like the earlier film innocent fun and pretty cool death scenes even though the quality is a bit low.Final Destination 2 Is just the most pointless sequel to a movie ever! She connects to the first one a little bit but not a lot happens with the plot they just keep picking them off one at a time and most of it repetitive. Sometimes you even feel you're watching the first one again  only with funnier yes I said funnier death scenes This film is not as entertainingly dark as the first one Not like that's a surprise  former Xfiles guys behind that one. Rather boringly bright and that dragged the movie a little down in the ratings for me. But most of the work goes into the disgustingly awesome kill scenes and nothing else unfortunately. Maybe that doesn't sound appropriate but it's all apart of the Final Destination ride and if you don't like it get of it! The accidents scenes are a lot better here then in the earlier film but over all this is a mild disappointment with a couple of laughs.But how can you not laugh at the final death scene? Had to mention it! 310".

There was one scene that had me reminiscing about a scene from the movie Cube. It's not for you if you're looking for romantic comedy or something like that.

However the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone naturalism and levity of the book.It certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film. I imagine the latter would seem disjointed with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot.It's amazing to see how filthy the film is given that it was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors only finally unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in Ireland as late as 2000 it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club the Irish Film Theatre in the late 1970s. Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes. Never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922  they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967.It is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s respected players all daring to utter and enact Joyce's hugely transgressive text with such gusto.Bravo!".

	schema:reviewBody "To adapt the words of some venerable Austrian nuns how do you solve a problem like 'Ulysses'?  Considered by most to be the greatest book of the 20th century it is also notoriously one of its most difficult.  How do you film a book where each character exists in a narrative set on 16 June 1904 but also corresponds parodically to Greek mythology.  Where each chapter is a parody pastiche interrogation of a whole host of literary styles and conventions where almost every line is an allusion crucially mutated to literature theology philosophy history etc.  Where each character event setting is subject to rigorous verbal deconstruction so that they can seem to dissolve in front of our eyes and put back in playfully different combinations or where whole episodes evolve from word games.  Where each setting is rich in historical significance providing a metanarrative to all the squabbling narratives that comprise 'Ulysses'.Take for example the episode 'Proteus' where Stephen Dedalus walks on the beach.  In the book his mixture of observation and thought creates an unsettling difficult text where what he sees and what he thinks meld indistinguishably into one another and the reader risks getting lost fixed as he is in the flux of Stephen's head not guided by an impartial narrator. We travel in fragments on a Dublin beach through the centuries  from Elsinore to the Renaissance to Paris from literature and politics to memory all the while doused in vast philosophical imponderables.  Strick shows us a young man walking on a beach chased by a dog to the bathetic recitation of the novel's words.  On paper the dog inspires a number of puns including colonialism intellectual slavery and man's mortality. Here it's just a dog.  The words are full of soundbites such as 'ineluctable modality of the visible' phrases that have to be gone over worked out understood necessitating maybe even a dictionary.  To have them sped read seems selfdefeating unless you know the book and if you are only making a film for people who've read the book than what's the point?Strick films the formal landmine of 'Ulysses' with a studied focus on narrative.  He avoids structural rupture or any attempt to translate the novel's techniques many borrowed from cinema into film.  A true 'Ulysses' would require someone with fiendish formal daring a massive intellect a sense of history and place but also someone with a love of stories resonant sentimentality and popular culture and especially a taste for farce.  Godard of the 60s maybe or Richard Lester.  Or some unholy mixture of Welles Huston and Gerald Thomas.ULYSSES is redundant full of scenes slavishly recreated with dialogue spouted verbatim but arbitrarily selected so that they make no sense.  It might have been an idea to take a couple of digestible narrative lines and create a film around them but Strick wants to get everything and in a standard feature film can only give a few minutes to each episode which makes a nonsense of them.  Even on this level his filming is fizzleless flat cautious as if what is said in 'Ulysses' is crucial when of course it's how it's said that counts.  The crucial dichotomy of the novel between Stephen's intellectualism and Bloom's corporeality is fudged and the triangle between Stephen man Bloom womanly man and Molly woman only comes about by pilfering the book's structure.This is the accepted view of the film and it is theoretically accurate. It makes the film sound inept which as Joyce it may be but it is very entertaining.  Milo O'Shea is an incomparable Bloom transcending the leaving cert level script capturing this hero's multifaceted humanity in all its inglorious glory his decency and desire his tragedy and sense of exclusion the mirroring of virulent racism in Bloom's time with our own more sophisticated age is chilling and his peerless good humour.He is supported by an extraordinary cast many of whom are familiar from TV or theatre and anyone who is not Irish will completely miss the frisson of seeing Dinny Byrne as a cheeky Lothario on a birthdaysuited pedestal or most alarming of all Mrs. Cadogon as a leatherbooted whipwielding Madame.  Barbara Jefford is an extraordinary Molly Bloom that hothouse flower spending the day in bed voluptuously ordinary her soliloquy is one of the best things in the film  it completely bypasses Joyce's intentions but in its mixture of voiceover and silent literal imagery it achieves a dreamlike power reminiscent of  PerecQueysanne's later UN HOMME QUI DORT.There is great humour throughout usually courtesy of Bloom my favourite being his entry into a cafe of uncommonly audible munchers  the Nightown sequence though again a travesty is great fun more Nabokov or Flann O'Brien in its Carrollian topsyturvy even if you wish as did John Devitt who introduced the film that it had been magicked by Fellini.This was a Bloomsday treat at the Irish Film Centre.  And the print itself was of historic interest in that it was a censored one from the 1960s. Instead of cutting offending scenes the sound was simply turned down signalled by an amusing warning noise or the picture being blacked out. Luckily I have the video and the book! so I went to check what I'd missed which wasn't very much some innuendo a few choice epithets and Molly's orgasmic face.  The decisions behind the censoring were erratic as some scenes left intact seemed more fruity than some of the victims.  In a film based on words this vandalism interrupting especially a soliloquy of snowballing impact made me increasingly furious and reminded me that relative liberalisation in this country after decades of Francolike repression was not all that distantly achieved.There was real pleasure as a Dubliner though in seeing the city of my parents in clean monochrome  due presumably to budgetary constrictions Strick made no attempt to recreate turnofthecentury Dublin making another evasion of Joyce but achieving something pleasantly different none the less.  And as I could never have hoped Martin Dempsey is perfect as my favourite Joycean character Simon Dedalus like all his friends meanminded selfish dreadful  but capable of great humour and in his recitation of a heartmeltingly sad melody emotional beauty.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film the adaptation of James Joyce's most famous novel which is one of the most important and complex works of the 20th century literature in the early 90s. The Videotape was on the shelf in the local library where I worked at the time. When I saw the title I could not believe my eyes and said to myself This just can't happen because it is impossible. But I held in my hands the evidence to the fact that the epitome of the unfilmable book had indeed been adapted to the screen. Even before I started watching I was fascinated with audacity of the film's creators who were not afraid to aim a blow at the most famous literary stream of consciousness of the 20th century. The film left many parts of the books out and could not capture the whole realm of book's richness it would be impossible but the attempt still made me feel respect and appreciation to the film directorcowriter Joseph Strick and everyone involved for making an interesting and entertaining motion picture from the incredibly complex versatile polyphonic novel which is filled with the dizzying flight of thought for which there is no limit in either space or time.What Ulysses the film did right it is certainly a cinematic portrait of Dublin James Joyce's city that lives sounds and moves during a single day known in literature as Bloomsday June 16 1904. Joyce once wrote that he wanted to describe Dublin in in such way that even in hundred years if the city disappears from the face of the earth it could be restored based on the novel Ulysses. Now in addition to the Joyce's prose there is a movie portrait of Joyce's Dublin carefully reproduced with its streets avenues harbor docks quays pubs the red lights district cathedrals cemetery etc. I was very impressed by Milo O 'Shea in the role of Leopold Bloom. That's how I always imagined Bloom's appearance body language behavior the whole persona. The best and most memorable are last two scenes of the film a long surreal Circe depicting Bloom's and Stephen Daedalus visit to a brothel and of course the culmination of the film and the novel 'Penelope'. Molly Bloom Barbara Jefford  caught on a thin line between waking and dreaming just the moments before she falls asleep thinks about very intimate events in her life recent and long gone. She reminisces about her and Bloom's present and past and finally falls asleep with the most beautiful and life affirming thoughts ever captured in English language ...I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes. Molly's inner monologue takes almost 30 minutes in the film but it is rich playful feminine wavelike spiral and soothing. It is so beautiful and Jefford made it her own yet relating to any viewer regardless of gender that I could listen to it again and again. In my opinion Ulysses 1967 adapted by Joseph Strick is interesting even if not completely successful film experiment which was awarded the Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. Incidentally I have quite a seditious idea that Ulysses has been successfully transferred to the screen and the film has turned out amazingly captivating entertaining and profound. He has another title and is the adaptation of another work of literature. I mean the posthumous Stanley Kubrick's film his swan song Eyes Wide Shut. But this is a topic for another review.".

She reminisces about her and Bloom's present and past and finally falls asleep with the most beautiful and life affirming thoughts ever captured in English language ...I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes. Molly's inner monologue takes almost 30 minutes in the film but it is rich playful feminine wavelike spiral and soothing. It is so beautiful and Jefford made it her own yet relating to any viewer regardless of gender that I could listen to it again and again. In my opinion Ulysses 1967 adapted by Joseph Strick is interesting even if not completely successful film experiment which was awarded the Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. Incidentally I have quite a seditious idea that Ulysses has been successfully transferred to the screen and the film has turned out amazingly captivating entertaining and profound. He has another title and is the adaptation of another work of literature. I mean the posthumous Stanley Kubrick's film his swan song Eyes Wide Shut. But this is a topic for another review.";

It just can't be done.  Joyce pioneered the plotless novel concentrating on character development and situation together with the melding of his characters' inner thoughts running in a hodgepodge of images and overlapping runon sentences. For those unfamiliar with the work Ulysses is the story of an author in search of a character about whom he can write a novel two men one middleaged one young wandering aimlessly through Dublin for 18 hours finally meeting in a brothel and then discussing their day over a cup of cocoa.  That's it.  Joyce himself joked that he had written a novel that would keep English professors busy for the next century and the deciphering of his masterpiece has become a cottage industry.  This is not a motion picture rather it is a tour de force in the nature of Charles Laughton reading from the New York Telephone directory  the presentation may be brilliant but the exercise is pointless.  The actors recite Joyce's prose brilliantly and Milo O'Shea Maurice Reeves and Barbara Jefford as Leopold Bloom Stephen Daedalus and Molly Bloom respectively look exactly like what one would imagine the characters to appear but this is hardly enough to sustain the viewers' interests for an excess of two hours.  Literary critic John Greenway observed To read it 'Ulysses' with ease one should have a PhD in comparative languages and literature.  Indeed Joyce himself spoke some 15 languages fluently and his work abounds with multiple lingual puns.  Caveat unless you have at least majored in English Literature and taken a graduate course in James Joyce you won't have the slightest idea what is going on here  nor will you care.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has always been said that cinema as an art form is yet to develop into an autonomous expression because the way film is mostly assumed today with notable exceptions is as a subordinate of narrative literature. As film industries are structured today it is going to take a long time until cinema reaches a level of evolution as literature and in this case as James Joyce's writings. But I do not agree that works as Ulysses cannot be transferred to film. What seems more obvious to me is that narrative cinema as it evolved in the past 20th century is too a primitive art form to equal a work as Ulysses. I do not mean that there are no masterpieces in cinema but in my opinion possibly they are not as complex highly evolved or sophisticated as some literary works. Even a novel like Bram Stoker's Dracula is yet to be filmed in form and spirit that make justice to Stoker's prose. This considered I reassert my belief that all written works can be translated into moving images. In adapting the written word the scriptwriter has to find equivalents in film resources to put on the same level of the text Joyce's being one of great richness and novelty. As T.S. Eliot wrote in 1922 instead of the narrative method James Joyce used in Ulysses the mythical method meaning a technique of ironically juxtaposing modernity against traditional narrative structures. In their attempt to express this method in moving images Americans Joseph Strick and Fred Haines did not make a fine job in their adaptation of Joyce. Both men were inclined to literary works Strick also worked on Genet's The Balcony Durrell's Alexandria Quartet filmed as Justine Miller's Tropic of Cancer and revisited Joyce with A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man while Haines adapted and directed a film version of Hesse's Steppenwolf. For Ulysses they resorted to long fragments of monologues by Stephen Dedalus stiff Maurice Roves Leopold Bloom Milo O'Shea in a breakthrough performance and Molly Bloom a pale characterization by Barbara Jefford while illustrating them with images and more images beautifully shot by Wolfgang Suschitzky in widescreen black and white that total a very dull film something that is neither literature nor film even if it is captured on celluloid. Moving images are young the electronic ways to manipulate them are even younger Until film reaches a stage of maturity similar to the level achieved by literature and moreover in a case like James Joyce's Ulysses please read the book in the meantime.".

I was highly interested in seeing how certain mindbogglingly difficult and seemingly unfilmable sections from the novel were portrayed by his lens and I was left impressed and entertained. While a truly proper adaptation of Joyce's massive literary landmark would be about twelve times the length of this experiment Strick's Ulysses is a fine and almost flawless attempt at condensing and adapting the perplexing classic to the big screen. The performers chosen are all excellent both visually and performancewise the actors embody what one's mind likely interpreted the iconic characters whilst reading the original work.Although I seem to be solely using this review to be comparing the film to the book I should also point out that even if the novel never existed this would be among the greatest movies of its kind. This is an avant garde journey through the streets of Dublin that is crafted brilliantly on all cinematic fronts. The many beautiful locations are shot with lovely black and white cinematography as I already mentioned the performances are fantastic the editing is noticeably well done and the final product has the ability to be both a companion to Joyce's novel and a wonderful work of art in its own right. Here you will find much to love and the two hour running time flies by. Seriously this film feels much faster than two hours similarly to how the original novel felt much shorter than 700 pages at least in my opinion anyway since many others loathe the book and find it tedious and WAY overlong.Joyce's prose seems necessary to be heard rather than just read and the final segment this being Molly Bloom's beautiful and dirty soliloquy masters the challenge of reading the master's work aloud. It is read with grace passion and character in a way that conveys all of the humor and pain and extreme sexual desire hidden within Joyce's many pages of inner monologue.

I felt that the film did very well in capturing the streamofconsciousness present in Joyce's original text. Like its source material Ulysses is a film that demands your full attention. If you look away for even a second then you're lost. The narrative constantly jumps around. This isn't an insult to the film but rather a portrayal of Joyce's writing style.Ulysses as a text jumps from idea to idea from writing style to writing style. It is a difficult text to read but a rewarding one.And so is the film although I was disappointed at how the film watered down some of the book's more explicit scenes. I felt that THIS was an insult to Joyce to wanted to push the boundaries of anything that came before.Read my full review for more httpgoo.glWGkf16".

	onyx:emotionText "Having read and studied this novel for my English Literature course I was looking forward to watching its film adaptation.The end result left me feeling a little ambivalent. I felt that the film did very well in capturing the streamofconsciousness present in Joyce's original text. Like its source material Ulysses is a film that demands your full attention. If you look away for even a second then you're lost. The narrative constantly jumps around. This isn't an insult to the film but rather a portrayal of Joyce's writing style.Ulysses as a text jumps from idea to idea from writing style to writing style. It is a difficult text to read but a rewarding one.And so is the film although I was disappointed at how the film watered down some of the book's more explicit scenes. I felt that THIS was an insult to Joyce to wanted to push the boundaries of anything that came before.Read my full review for more httpgoo.glWGkf16";

Henry Bromwell directed this film with a sure hand and it shows. One always wonders about the secret life of hit killers. One doesn't have to go too far to realize they probably are one's own neighbors or social acquaintances or even friends they're no different from us at least on the surface.In this story the grandfather is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price. He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son and even to the grandson!Alex is a man living in turmoil. He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions. He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself. In going to Dr. Parks he is trying to find absolution although he doesn't find it there. On the contrary there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who is supposed to kill next.Alex brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy mesmerizes us. Not only is he a fantastic actor but he makes us believe he is that man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. He is equally convincing as Dr. Parks the man who unravels the mystery.Donald Sutherland as the grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah. She shows a capability and range that are incredible. Tracey Ullman is Martha the suffering wife and she doesn't get to do much. Also Barbara Bain in a rare appearance is the grandmother from hell. David Dorfman is a delight in the film. He shows a maturity beyond his years.".

	schema:headline " a genuinely chilling thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The banality of evil' has long been a source of fascination for those artists exploring the dark side of human nature.  Gloomy houses filled with vengeful spirits or twitching psychos hold less fear for the common man than the sudden discovery that the people next door' the PTA member down the street or the social director for the local church youth group are the true villains who surround us unnoticed people whose very normalcy' serves to mask the evil within.  For only when the mask is finally ripped off and we at last get to see what we have been living next to all along do we come to realize how very tenuous is our security and safety in this world.  What could be scarier than that?In this category of works Panic' emerges as a genuinely chilling emotionally unsettling psychological thriller short on gratuitous violence and long on characterization and mood.  Writerdirector Henry Bromell has fashioned a dark disturbing tale of a man named Alex William H. Macy who seeks the professional help of a therapist played by John Ritter.  Alex's problem is a decidedly unique one  it seems that since he's been a teen he has served as hit man for his father Donald Sutherland whose mysterious shady business' apparently calls for the elimination of certain parties at the request of unknown clients.'  Alex is a seemingly good man devoted to his wife and son who has somehow found a way to distance himself emotionally and morally from the heinous crimes he commits.  Yet obviously Alex has arrived at a point of moral reckoning  for how else to explain his sudden need to unburden himself to this total stranger?  Macy gives a brilliant performance as Alex showing in his totally understated reactions to the people and events around him what it is like to be buttoned up so tight that even with all the mayhem and filial abuse he's experienced in his life he is able to truthfully say I don't know if I've ever been angry'  even at his father who got him into this life in the first place.  What makes Panic' so unsettling is that it violates all our comforting notions about the ties that bind father to son and family members to each other.  Rather than setting a fine moral example for their child both of Alex's parents Michael Donald Sutherland and Deidre Barbara Bain have actually groomed him to become a coldblooded killer.  Yet life seems to go on in surface ease within the confines of not only that family but Alex's own family as well.  Alex keeps the truth hidden from both his wife Martha Tracy Ullman and his 6year old son Sammy David Dorfman allowing them to function almost as any other normal suburban family.Yet Alex has other perhaps more mundane problems as well.  He meets a somewhat disturbed 23year old fellow patient named Sarah Neve Campbell to whom he feels an immediate attraction.  Tentatively these two lost souls grope towards each other both of them hoping to find in the other that which is lacking in themselves.  But in many ways Alex is actually a man of strong moral character in certain aspects of his life and he agonizes over taking the initial step towards consummating their relationship knowing it will harm the wife he loves but no longer feels attracted to.  Bromell's sophisticated screenplay refuses to spell out every psychological detail for the audience allowing us to make our own connections draw our own conclusions and reach our own moral judgments.  As director as well Bromell establishes and maintains a mood of almost heartbreaking melancholy and sadness.  Characters rarely speak above a hush the camera glides slowly along taking in the scene at a leisurely unhurried pace and the haunting musical score heightens the strange unreality of the world which these people have come to inhabit a world that seems to call into question everything we take for granted in the area of morality ethics and basic common decency.  The performances from every member of the cast right on down to little David Dorfman are letter perfect.  Each of these fine actors knows exactly the right note to hit in every scene never cutting against the grain of understated seriousness that Bromell has established.Panic' is a small underrated gem that lingers long in one's memory.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why Panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen it's much too smart and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it comparing it to American Beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis and Sopranos and Analyze This in it's study of illegal goingson amidst family life. Though Panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material Brommel's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man.William H. Macy stars as Alex a hitman who works for his father's Sutherland  contractkilling business. He leads a double life with his wife  Ullman and son unaware of his real trade.  In his middleage he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life. Under his calm collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father's controlling grasp on his life. When he meets a young womanCampbell he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business.The fact that writerdirector Henry Brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contractkilling is disposable.  He could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession his characters are so welldeveloped and believable scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on Macy's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman.  Brommel's script feels like a Shakespearean tragedy with a definite theme of destiny running throughout.In Alex Macy creates a tragic easily sympathetic character and turns in yet another brooding great performance as can always be expected.  Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian.  Consider a scene in a bicycle shop where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion.Henry Brommel's first feature Panic is a film that is wellcrafted in its sincerity.  With a firstrate cast a plausible script terse dialogue and nice direction this characterstudy is hopefully just a taste of Brommel's aptness for creating characters that seem real.   8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has so many good things about it that watching it was frustrating for me since I could never swallow the story line. William H. Macy plays Alex a hit man who is carrying on the family business under pressure from his father. The first obstacle for me was accepting the mildmannered Macy as a hit man. I can accept the fact that there are hit men living in apparently normal circumstances and keeping their business a secret I just did not accept Macy in the role. As the father I suppose Donald Sutherland portrays a person who is amoral enough to be a hit man but there again there was some hardness lacking. Think of the hit men in The Godfather and compare.The next obstacle was believing in the relationship that developed between the young beautiful and lively Sarah Neve Campbell and the confused middleaged and withdrawn Alex? What was there about Alex that would attract Sarah who was shown as predominately lesbian? I didn't see it.The scenes with Alex and his six year old son Sammy were touching and were the only scenes where Alex seemed relaxed and engaged. But the kid spoke in a manner way beyond his years and clearly was just reciting written dialog.Alex has kept his deathdealing profession a secret from his wife. Supposedly he made a living by running a mailorder business selling lawn ornaments kitchen gadgets sexual aids and such. Does his wife really think that he is supporting the family with that kind of business? She would certainly have to be involved in such a business to make a go of it and consequently she would know about the finances and see that things did not add up.The dialog tended toward the affected. For example the first lines in the movie have Alex saying to himself Do you ever get the feeling that you're dead? Like some dog lying on the street that's been hit by a car and left there to rot. Does anyone actually talk to himself like that?The music tries to add an element of suspense and threat but I felt it was too intrusive.Having said all of that the beautiful photography saved this movie for me. The settings are artistically composed and the lighting impressive. And the actors are all in good form. It's too bad that all of this talent was not put to better use.".

Other than welldone cinematography I couldn't find much of anything to like about this film. The plot and characters are cliched and onedimensional I would rather watch more acknowledged cliches done well than more ridiculously precocious children criminals with family lives and bad guys who see therapists. The characters' extreme simplicity would be forgivable in a movie with something else taking up screen time but in a movie that seemingly is about nothing but characters it's dumbfounding. Only Macy has any hint of complexity and it's really little more than a veneer established by making him awkward and moody.  The major plot points are fairly easy to predict it's only a matter of when. The performances are mostly decent with the exception of the typically lousy Campbell but the actors aren't given that much to work with there are no memorable lines or particularly impressive acting moments.  That about covers this film's lack of anything appealing  in the end there's no thrills no laughs no insight no point.".

It's not a topic that lends itself well to screenplays since the attacks are by nature inexpressible.  One doesn't know what's happening except that one feels the need to medicate with drugs alcohol or sex.  Something's wrong but what? But that's exactly what makes Panic so engaging.  Most of the film's psychological drama lies like an iceberg beneath the surface.  One watches the main character behave as if in a somnambulistic trance going through the motions of life not knowing exactly what he is doing or why.  We see him commit a murder in cold blood and then go home to his lovely wife and son as if he'd just made a trip to the grocery store.  Yet the confusion and the angst are visible for the knowing eye to see.  And when he's with his father who has crafted every inch of his son's personality as his own mirror image there's a sense of normalcy to bed down the feelings of panic and anxiety.  One practically feels reassured as to the nobility of the assassin's profession.  Panic is a movie that expresses these difficult conflicting emotions through actions body language and gestures but not with words.  The scenes in the psychiatrist's office are a far cry from the blubbering effusive outbursts in movies like Prince of Tides and thankfully so.  There's one other thing that I really liked about Panic which I admit comes directly from my own personal experience  the panic stricken man comes to understand his father as a monster not a stern but loving patriarch by comparing his relationship with his son to his father's relationship with himself.  Take it from me  it doesn't get any more real than that.".

Every time they were on screen together you keep asking the same thing  When are we going to see Sutherland again?  I'm a child of the 60's when movies were VERY good.  So when I hear some young person praise a recent movie as great I must remember that great movies made today would have been only good in the sixties.  I refer back to what I call the John Carpenter Syndrome.  It works like this.  John Carpenter made some good thrillershorrors back in the seventies.

Macy and Donald Sutherland.  It's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must of necessity at last be resolved.Alex Macy is tired he has a loving wife Martha Tracey Ullman a precocious sixyearold son Sammy David Dorfman a mail order business he runs out of the house as well as his main source of income the family' business he shares with his father Michael Sutherland and his mother Deidre Barbara Bain.  But he's empty years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist Dr. Josh Parks John Ritter.  And to make matters worse or maybe better depending upon perspective in Dr. Parks' waiting room he meets a young woman Sarah Cassidy Neve Campbell whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember.  She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her.  His whole life it seems has become a situation' one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves.  He can deny his age and the fact that he has indeed slipped into a genuine midlife crisis but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own.  He's at a crossroads and he's going to have to decide which way to go.  And he's going to have to do it very soon.From a concept that is intrinsically interesting Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through.  He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers that in real life there is no easy way out.  His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and moreover within any given family unit. The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny with irrevocable consequences and effects.  When you're growing up you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son.  And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds ergo the midlife crisis or more specifically the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape.  It's a powerful message succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.For some time William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in Magnolia' The Shoveler in Mystery Men' and Jerry Lundegaard in Fargo.'  And that's just a sampling of his many achievements.  At one point in this film Sarah mentions Alex's sad eyes' and it's a very telling comment as therein lies the strength of Macy's performance here his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing.  Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed staring off into the darkness in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling not only with his immediate situation but with everything in his life that has brought him finally to this point.  In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt confusion and uncertainty all of which have been successfully suppressed until now all the things that have always been at the core of Alex's life only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing demanding confrontation and resolution.  It's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable.  It's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate. It's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.Sutherland is extremely effective as well his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling.  It's frightening in fact to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth.  This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain but a true personification of evil hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door which is what makes it all the more disconcerting.  And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly with a great performance.Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah but her performance as is the usual case with her seems somewhat pretentious although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film.  If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters. Panic' however is one of her best efforts a powerful film that in the end is a journey well worth taking.  910.".

Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly unfunny roles and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see.Panic is the story of a hit man Alex Macy who actually works for his father Sutherland. He covers his true profession by doing mail order work by all appearances he and his wife Ullman and their son Sammy Dorfman are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist Ritter telling only his mother Bain. In the waiting room he meets a young woman Campbell to whom he is immediately attracted which complicates his situation further. His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next assignment he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist.This is a profound story of a gentle good man made into a killer by a monster of a father with his mother's knowledge who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit. His rage is so deepseated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son  and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. When it's time for Panic to moves it does  quickly.Panic doesn't seem panicked at all. In fact it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it's poorly made  the slowness is deliberate mirroring Alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. By making a decision about Sara the Campbell character and by seeing his mark his own psychiatrist as a living breathing human being Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they don't jive. And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche Sammy's.William Macy gives another brilliant performance as a loving father a distant husband and a cold killer the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated.This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. It's too adult too small too subtle too characterdriven and too good.".

	schema:headline " A Superior Low Budget Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "It has long been debated whether genetics or the environment have more of an effect on childhood development. Although there are many cases supporting and disapproving both theories it is hard to argue against the fact that children raised in a hostile environment are usually aggressive themselves. In Henry Bromell's Panic 2000 Alex William H. Macy was trained to be an assassin at a very young age by his father Donald Sutherland. After a childhood of practicing on squirrels rabbits and other animals Alex becomes the primary hitman in his father's family business of contract killing. Years go by and Alex never complains about having to assassinate numerous people some innocent. However eventually Alex realizes that he is suffering from severe depression and he can't figure out why. He has a loving family yet he aspires for a dramatic change in not only his occupation but his entire lifestyle. In an attempt to transform his life Alex begins forming a romantic friendship with a young girl Neve Campbell he meets at his psychologist's office. Also for the first time he begins to stand up to his parents who have always demanded perfection from him especially when working on the job. The relationships that Alex has with the people closest to him including his psychiatrist and his new love interest are what make Panic a superior thriller.Personally my favorite scenes are the flashback sequences in which Alex's father Donald Sutherland teaches his son the art of murder. All of these scenes have a very creepy undertone caused by the way Sutherland reacts lightly to the murdering of innocent animals and people. Very few actors are able to pull this off to the same extent as Sutherland does which can also be seen in one of my favorite films from the 1980s called Eye of the Needle 1981. Overall Panic may be hard to find at Blockbuster or Movie Gallery since it was such a lowbudget film but if you are a member of Instant Netflix it is definitely worth your time. Although there are not many action sequences it is more thrilling than most films.".

	schema:reviewBody "You may feel revulsion for this hitman played by William H. Macy but you may also feel a bit of uncomfortable empathy too.  I was prepared to be offended by this movie about a man who kills people for money especially since when this man the central character is supposedly made sympathetic because he seeks out the help of a psychologist.  Perhaps this would be a dark comedy?   I'm not sure what type to consider it as a whole but all in all I found it very moving.  Alex the hitman is trained from early childhood to exercise cold control and use a gun to take a life first a squirrel years later as a young adult a stranger in a car.  His father Michael establishes the business of being a hired killer by wedding a woman who could help him get started in the business.  Alex's life is contradictory from early on  he exhibits the professional detachment needed to carry out hits yet he lacks the confidence even as a middleaged man to defy his father and quit the business.  Yet it is obvious that Alex wants out.  He finds himself to be considered old by a young woman he finds beautiful yet he is helpless to turn his life in a more moral direction. He is a fairly good and certainly gentle husband and a wonderful father despite having been raised by his seemingly sociopathic parents who are also absurd control freaks.  It is not beneath his dignity to dress up as a monster to delight the children at his son's birthday party.  But he is deeply deeply sad.  As the movie progresses it seems that Alex truly believes that a way out for him is pure fantasy.  One can in their mid to late forties turn one's life around if the faults are less severe than Alex's.  But one cannot give life back to those who were murdered.  Still he yearns for a miracle and to me this plays out in his halfhearted pursuit of a muchyounger beautiful woman Sarah.  He knows that a real lasting relationship with this fantasy woman would be very unlikely unless he could transform himself into a young man of her age....perhaps when he killed his first victim.  It seems that Alex believes only timetravel could save him....back to a time before he crossed the line that he could never uncross.SOME SPOILER Alex to me is resolved to the idea that he doomed yet he does eventually show the moral courage to stop his father from committing any more murders or recruiting anymore children into the business and also to stop himself. It is ironically his father's contemptuous remark to Alex of Who says? Alex had just told his father that he should not have taken Alex's son and Michael's grandson Sammy out to the woods to experiment with shooting a squirrel.  Finally Alex has an identity and it is a braver one than he had known.To sum up VERY good movie!!".

It is amazing to watch it all the way through and then start it over again just to reaffirm the amazing transformation the character goes through from beginning to end. She not only looks different but her mannerisms are also so innocent and naive in the beginning. It's unbelievable. I have to say I am completely angry that her acting was not mentioned in any awards nominations or anything by Hollywood.All the acting was incredible. Robin Penn Renee' Zellwegger Michelle Pfieffer all did outstanding! I've never hated Michelle Pfieffer before but she did an incredible job being someone you could truly be disgusted with. Also loved the job...and sorry to do this but the guy who was in Almost Famous...have no idea what his name is...did.

	schema:headline " extremely powerful film";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all those guys out there who see the posters and advertising and assume this is some sappy chick flick you couldn't be more wrong.  What it is is an extraordinarily moving piece of work.  It's the kind of film that hits you right in the pit of your stomach.  Personally my mind has a tendancy to wander during movies but with this one I was glued to it right from the first frame to the last.  It's been awhile since I found myself so touched by a movie.. and it reminds me of why I love movies in the first place.  The performances here are top notch.  Alison Lohman Astrid I never even heard of her before going to see this... but she tackles this difficult role like she has the experience of an awardwinning veteran. I'm not even sure most of the big names could pull off this role like she did. Michelle Pfeiffer Ingrid who I was never a big fan of is also excellent...she has a character who's so beautiful yet so repulsive at the same time.  The motherdaughter relationship her character has with Alison's is probably the most unconventional i've seen in a film and that's what makes it so compelling.  Renee Zellweger as Clare also gives her best performance here.  Her relationship with Astrid is a beautiful but ultimately a tragedy one mainly due to Clare's infatuation with her cheating husband Mark Noah Wyle but I won't give it away of course! All I really have to say is if you want to see a movie with strong performances throughout and an excellent story that will leave you fully satisified and personally touched when you leave the theatre this one's for you.  I highly reccomend it to everyone! One last thing I should say though... quite often when a movie comes out that's based on a book the cliche seems to be for people to say it wont bewasnt as good as the book.  Now I never read the book to this movie... but the way I look at it people need to judge the movie for the movie... not the book.  If the directors were to follow the book word for word and detail for detail we'd be left with a movie that would probably take days to watch.  The advantage of a book is that you can have a complete knowledge of what the characters are feeling inside their head which of course you can't always get in a movie unless they make it obvious or tell you how they're feeling truly.  The advantage of a movie is that it brings it all to life... and let's you witness it for what it'd be like if you lived out the story.  After all if you were witnessing these actions in real life you wouldn't have a book to help you understand what thoughts caused them. So to all the people who go hating a movie before they even see it just because it's based on a book... keep in mind that the book and movie are essentially two different things and that both have their advantages. I've honestly never seen a basedonthebook movie where people were completely satisified with how it was translated to film.  You can like both the book and movie separately you know! My rating 10 out of 10... HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!".

The motherdaughter relationship her character has with Alison's is probably the most unconventional i've seen in a film and that's what makes it so compelling.  Renee Zellweger as Clare also gives her best performance here.  Her relationship with Astrid is a beautiful but ultimately a tragedy one mainly due to Clare's infatuation with her cheating husband Mark Noah Wyle but I won't give it away of course! All I really have to say is if you want to see a movie with strong performances throughout and an excellent story that will leave you fully satisified and personally touched when you leave the theatre this one's for you.  I highly reccomend it to everyone! One last thing I should say though... quite often when a movie comes out that's based on a book the cliche seems to be for people to say it wont bewasnt as good as the book.  Now I never read the book to this movie... but the way I look at it people need to judge the movie for the movie... not the book.  If the directors were to follow the book word for word and detail for detail we'd be left with a movie that would probably take days to watch.  The advantage of a book is that you can have a complete knowledge of what the characters are feeling inside their head which of course you can't always get in a movie unless they make it obvious or tell you how they're feeling truly.  The advantage of a movie is that it brings it all to life... and let's you witness it for what it'd be like if you lived out the story.  After all if you were witnessing these actions in real life you wouldn't have a book to help you understand what thoughts caused them. So to all the people who go hating a movie before they even see it just because it's based on a book... keep in mind that the book and movie are essentially two different things and that both have their advantages. I've honestly never seen a basedonthebook movie where people were completely satisified with how it was translated to film.  You can like both the book and movie separately you know! My rating 10 out of 10... HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!";

Based on the terrific novel of the same name director Peter Kosminsky's film version of White Oleander is quite powerful yet at times hollow and choppy.  Due to the intricate details of the book this is somewhat expected however as filmgoers we do not get the full impact of the three years in Astrid's life.  Stunning performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Alison Lohman give the film its power.  Their scenes together are as painful for us as for them.  Pfeiffer the most beautiful convict one will ever encounter shoots a couple of evil eyes that are pure genius.  She is truly a cobra  don't get too close.  I really think Alison Lohman's performance is one of the best I have seen in a while. Touching heartbreaking independent distant and loving she longs for someone to trust.  When she does find her soul mate she fights the urge assuming they will somehow disappoint each other.  The movie is told through the episodes of each of her foster homes and her struggles to make them work. Robin Wright The Princess Bride plays a sexy desparate bornagain Christian who mistrusts Astrid but needs the state funds.  Rene Zellweger is fantastic as the broken no self esteem wannabe actress who is desperate for companionship and finds it in Astrid.  This is another of Astrids heartbreaking relationships and nearly turns her against the world. Patrick Fugit Almost Famous offers a nice turn as the one who provides the out for Astrid.  Subtlety abounds in his performance.  Don't miss Billy Connally as the recepient of the flower in the title.  Keep an eye out for future films with Alison Lohman  she shows much of the fine acting abilities of Jena Malone.  These two should be fun to watch for years.".

It shows that she can act in dramas just as well as in comedies and thrillers. Allison Lohmann was very convincing in her role of Astrid which I think this is her first big film.This is an excellent movie but it is more of a chick flick than an 'everybody' movie.

I first thought this was Kirsten Dunst but I soon realized it wasn't for though Lohman has Dunst's overall facial shape she has deep set dark brown eyes that really speak volumes.Lohman plays Astrid Magnussen daughter of Los Angeles artist Ingrid Magnussen played by Pfieffer. It's not apparent yet at the beginning but the motherdaughter relationship is strained at best and Ingrid is clearly the one who has the last say in everything. She wants to control everything including Astrid.When Ingrid murders her boyfriend Barry because he was cheating on her Astrid is immediately remanded to the custody of CPS and placed in the foster care of a woman named Starr Thomas Wright. It's apparent right away that THIS household is shaky and that Astrid's life already torn and uprooted is about to get even more difficult. Starr is an exstripper excocaine addict who was been born again so naturally she is a biblethumping holy roller although she still loves to dress pretty racy and still smokes and has sex out of wedlock with her boyfriend Ray Hauser. Her other foster daughter Carolee has nothing more than bitter contempt for Starr and calls her a hippocrite more often than not. I thought Starr was fake the minute she came on screen and my hat is off to Wright for such a believable portrayal of just another misguided holy roller who doesn't realize what true Christianity is supposed to be like. Ingrid tells Astrid that the whole born again and baptized thing is crap and Astrid knowing nothing else harkens to her mother again.Astrid develops a crush on her foster father Ray and although he knows it's wrong he has feelings for her too.

She uses a knife to chop off her lovely blonde hair and warns one of the girls that she will slit all their throats if they mess with her again. Astrid has had one too many assaults already and you see the inner change happening. The one person who shows her any kindness at all is Paul Fugit who like Astrid and Ingrid is an artist although Ingrid immediately shoots holes in Astrid's faith and admiration for him. It is at this point where you begin to see Ingrid as one of the cruelest mothers since Mommie Dearest. Only she uses words not concrete weapons.The next foster family to take in the girl is the Richards actors who reside on the ocean and whose lives seem utterly perfect. Claire Zellwegeris not as successful as her husband Mark Wyle but she seems very glad to stay home and she seems to have needed Astrid for a companion. All too soon however Mark appears to be a very cold distant annoyed hubby when he's home. His work on a TV show keeps him gone most of the time but when he reunites with his wife he doesn't seem at all pleased. When you look deeper you see that Claire is extremely depressed over Mark being gone all the time and that her acting career is pretty much a joke of B horror movies.When Ingrid summons Astrid and Claire for a visit she wreaks more havok than ever by making Claire feel smaller than she already feels and by trying to shake Astrid's faith again. It really seems as though Ingrid wants Astrid as miserable as she is because she's angry that she's been imprisoned.You see a flashback of Ingrid slashing somebody's clothing with a knife and you understand just how cold and cruel Ingrid really is. She is a snake a reptile a bloodsucker. Kudos to Michelle Pfieffer. I think this is the best work she's done in a long time.The inevitable happens and Astrid is once again in the displaced minors' facility.

She's not nearly as lovable as Claire was but not nearly phony as Starr was so she's okay in Astrid's eyes.The final showdown is a great scene where Astrid shocks Ingrid with her heavy slutty makeup tattoos dyed hair cigarettes and completely new personality. Astrid has transformed from a sweet frightened innocent child to a tough jaded sick of mother's BS woman and she gives Ingrid the ultimatum we've thought she deserved from day one tell me the truth about everything you've done to hurt me or rot in here.And Ingrid for the first time in her selfish cruel hateful existence submits to Astrid's wishes.I haven't read the book yet but I'm really planning to soon.

	schema:headline " Alison Lohman stands out in subtle comingofage drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the sametitled novel by Janet Fitch White Oleander tells the story of a teenage girl Alison Lohman struggling to survive in foster homes while her freespirited mother Michelle Phieffer is in prison for having murdered her lover with the poisonous flower 'White Oleander'. It is a complex story of the relationship between a powerless girl and a loveless mother that in spite of its cheesy sounding premise manages to avoid all clichd Hallmark moments and project quite a lot of heart in doing so.White Oleander sees Alison Lohman in a superbly bruised and fragile performance as Astrid Magnussen and we follow her through her struggles both to bond with her mother and to survive in foster cares. All developments in her life feel natural and genuine for example seeking the affirmation of an older man Cole Hauser in one of her foster homes and putting herself into a strangely Lolitalike situation  and this part is viciously wellhandled and more effective than any other teen girlolder man jail bait situation I have ever seen.The film stars a wide variety of blondes Michelle Phieffer Alison Lohman Robin Wright Penn and Rene Zellweger in different parts and they all feel appropriate. Phieiffer is proud cold and heartless and this is juxtapositioned with Lohman's mildness and loving ways. White Oleander is a film that is indeed very sad but does not purposely pull at the human race's collective heartstrings in every emotional scene and setup. This way in spite of its content it never becomes sappy. It's not a film I would watch again however and I would never recommend it to male viewers because it is very chickoriented.710".

The girl knows all the horror there can be in the kind of institution she finds herself sent to or in the foster homes she ends up in. She is nothing but a substitute for something the foster parents do not have or the dream that her presence is going to solve their own problems or whatever. But the worst part is of course her mother who is from behind the wings pulling the strings that pretend to protect the girl whereas she is only treating her as a possession that has to be defended for future use. She thus more or less creates temptation or even death in those foster homes that could have helped her daughter. When this daughter finally realizes her mother's game it is by far too late and she can only sever the tie the connection the link the bond. And it is then that she builds a compensation and pretends she finally understands that her mother loved her. When it becomes obvious the mother will not be granted an appeal or win the one she may be granted and that she will not be granted parole the daughter has to more or less make it sound as if she were responsible for her mother's crime her mother's destitution and even her mother's continuing ordeal she deserves quite a lot. Such mothers are puppeteers with their children daughters and they turn their daughters into musketeers who are fighting with their own reflection in a mirror with their own shadows when it is not with their own mothers' shadows.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

	schema:reviewBody "White Oleander 2002The harrowing journey of a teenage girl through a series of foster parent and foster home situations because her mother went to jail for murder. On the surface this is about survival in a hostile world and one layer down it's about getting to know her mother and what a mother's love is all about. But even deeper we get to know what this adolescent girl is all about with growing complexity and growing interest and concern.There are two keys here the layered and ever changing story based on the bestseller by the same name and the lead actress Alison Lohman. Both Lohman and director Peter Kosminsky come out of television work and for Lohman this is her breakout film into Hollywood she was in a Ridley Scott movie after this and then played the young Jessica Lange character in the fabulous Big Fish a couple years later. Lohman makes her character really sympathetic but in a hardened way never cloying and never clichd.But she has fabulous support along the way. Two of her foster mothers are given juicy roles that are played with convictionRobin Wright Penn as a born again floozy Renee Zelwegger as a needy but caring actress out of workand her biological mother is played with icy slipperiness by Michelle Pfeiffer. That's a weirdly amazing cast. And well constructed very serious. In all the editing is usually pretty fast the filming is visually smart without being overly seductive and the writing and screen writing is sharp as an Xacto knife. All the while watching and being impressed you will also realize it's just a movie. You can feel the presence of the film world a glitzing up of characters an unavoidable pandering to clichs to make it look and feel pretty. I don't mean that a hardhitting drama about the tragedy of a young girl's life has to be gritty and truthful and meaningfulbut that was a possibility. And you can see how this film might have been something intensely moving without resorting to filmmaking tearjerker tricks like the repeated glances through the windows near the end or a bizarre dealmaking finale.Reservations aside I found myself more absorbed with each scene. A nice surprise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since the birth of Hollywood countless films have aspired to dispel the myths surrounding the city of lights cameras and action. Films like 1950's Sunset Boulevard and 1991's Bugsy have juxtaposed palm trees sunshine and mansions with murder jealousy and madness. These films look pretty and bright but they showcase the darkest shades of human nature. With his adaptation of Janet Fitch's novel White Oleander Peter Kosminsky tries to join the ranks of such Hollywood demystifiers as Billy Wilder and Robert Altman. On that front he succeeds only marginally. However on other fronts he accomplishes quite a bit.When her mother goes to prison for a violent act of vengeance young Astrid the protagonist of White Oleander floats from foster family to foster family. Due in part to the efforts of her conniving mother Ingrid Astrid cannot seem to settle down in any one place conflict always strikes. As time goes by innocent Astrid must confront the cruelest of circumstances again and again. Her foster mothers have strikingly different characteristics but no one of them is what she seems. From her beautiful but selfish mother Michelle Pfeiffer to the allegedly saved but jealous Starr Robin Wright to the kindly but illequipped Claire Renee Zellweger Alison Lohman's Astrid seems to have nowhere safe to turn.The film's poster says almost all that needs to be said about the plot and theme of White Oleander. The poster displays the faces of the four leads all four are blonde all four look beautiful and each face seems to meld into the next. While beauty resides an eeriness pervades the image everything looks a little too perfect. As it happens it is. Each face hides some tragic truth that will guide the flow of Astrid's young life. Like the shining city in which the film takes place the leading ladies of White Oleander are externally pretty but internally dark and unstable. This is ail very well but we've seen it before done better in other films. The larger arc of Astrid's character comes across brilliantly but the structure moves in episodic fashion which prevents the film from having a true climax. Moreover the movie's supposed payoff an imminent confrontation between Astrid and Ingrid comes across as simply a rehash of what the audience already knows. The film seems too desperate at times to make its point it even resorts to wistful narration that while softly spoken still manages to hit the viewer over the head. Even some of the shots in the film try so hard to show eerie beauty that they come across as hackneyed and heavyhanded. Still White Oleander offers up a lot of greatness in other areas.All four leading performances work brilliantly. Alison Lohman has a great understanding of her character and thus manages to play every one of her emotional and physical states with conviction. While not given much screen time to flex her always exciting acting muscles Robin Wright fleshes out her Biblethumping mother with just enough humanity to make her believable the character stands as a bit of a stereotype but Wright at least gives it emotional resonance. Even better is Zellweger as Claire. She communicates sweetness and quiet instability with shocking humor and grace just as Astrid loves and admires her we do. All things considered though Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of the film. As Ingrid she is ferocious. An actress who rarely resorts to theatricality for her roles Pfeiffer plays every scene so true to character she is truly scary. In the end White Oleander moves fairly quickly although not very subtly towards a disappointing finale. It will not be remembered for its notsogroundbreaking plot but it should be remembered for its brilliant performances. Where the film sometimes fails to show the whitewashed grime of its city the actresses compellingly render the whitewashed grime of humanity.".

Unexpected. But as I watched it it proved me wrong especially the intro of it but when I first saw it I didn't know that was it the movie I saw in the commercial and it surprised me! This is what made me want to sit to watch this movie. It is basically a young woman who is arrested and her daughter has to move form home to home and visits her mother in prison telling her the experiences she had in which her mother contradicts and as she continues her mother still says how she should really be instead of following what she has learned love friendship belief in God and as she hears this she realizes her mother won't let her go all she ever says are things that describes herself and not anyone else. So she decides to tell her what love really is and find out about this guy she was involved with. It is typically about a disillusioned mother who has become cynical about the outside world after she's been heart broken and now is brought to prison after she murders the one who wronged her and her daughter has to be somewhere else. I really enjoyed it and it did made me feel a bit sad and made me sympathize the characters in it I recommend it to fans of Michelle Pfeiffer and those who enjoy dramas and those who find other soaps tedious this is for you as for me I give it an excellent 10! Renee Zellweger is in this too be sure to spot her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Astrid is only 15 years old living in California with her free spirited mother. Things aren't as jubilant as they seem. Her mother falls in love with a man named Barry. In a rage of jealousy for dating another woman Astrid's mother murders Barry and gets hauled off to prison. Astrid moves from one foster home to another. Along the way she inadvertently makes a woman succumb back to alcoholism gets sent to the hospital from a gunshot wound witnesses a suicide and falls in love herself. Before you decide to watch this movie make sure you're in the right frame of mind as it's a very depressing experience. This isn't one of those movies that will leave your head as soon as you are done watching it. It sticks with you for a long time. It's been a while since I have thought about a movie before going to sleep. This movie reminded me of my troubles with my Mother. In a very different way of course but it reminded that you only have one birth mother and there is nothing you can do to change that. Each encounter with the foster parents is disturbing in different ways the worst for me was Renee Zellweger. She was a gentle soul who was too emotionally broken for her own good. The storyline between her  Alison Lohman haunted me. Speaking of Lohman I thought she was phenomenally good. She was so poised. Her repressed emotions made me feel for her in a big way. Her character is so likable you just want to help her at times even though you can't. That's how you know you give a great performance when you act like they are real. Watching her evolve throughout the film was unforgettable. Michelle Pfeiffer is just as good as Lohman is. Her beauty is hypnotizing. Her hypocritical character is alternately heartbreaking and surreal. You'll definitely feel mixed emotions when it comes to her. The final confrontation between Pfeiffer  Lohman was chilling to watch. Robin Wright is excellent so is Cole Hauser in a more subtle way. Keep an eye out for a Melissa McCarthy cameo as a paramedicFinal Thoughts This movie was very hard to review. I don't think i'll watch this movie again anytime soon. It's a fantastic film but emotionally exhausting. You expend so much energy on your emotions while watching this movie. The score the acting and the story is near perfect. It's a movie you won't forget. 9.310".

It tells the story of a woman with one daughter who goes to jails due to murdering her boyfriend now she goes from foster to foster experiencing both positive and negative things. I just saw this movie and discovered what a masterpiece this is it was entertaining at first but afterwards got depressing which caused me sadness. Then again I felt weirdly sadly happy at the end and didn't know really why. This isn't a lighthearting movie but yet it's good and just succeeds at almost every level. I found the acting to be good and the writing to be well down and as will as the direction and effects and all that stuff but I wished their wasn't so much sadness in the movie and mostly I found sadness coming from that background music. Anyway for all those who hadn't seen the film I encourage you to see this one and I can assure you won't regreet but please don't be a negative viewer and what I mean about that the events of this movie runs somewhat slow their's not that much of action but even though the movie itself is good I'm usually not fond of movies with slow events but this movie seriously attracted me cause it opened my heart to make me realise how excellent it is. I can't express how I'm in love with this movie I just feel so passionate about it so I would like to thank the whole cast and crew and especially the writer not forgetting the author of the novel which without it this movie never would've existed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I could watch this movie from end to end over and over again. Just as I could read Janet Fitch's book cover to cover and then start it over again. I'm torn between whose performance is better  Alison Lohman or Michelle Pfeiffer. I think I've decided after several viewings from the time it came out on video in 2003 until now that Pfeiffer's performance is stronger. I can see so much of my own mother in her haunting portrayal of a perfect mother who could turn evil in a second and did by killing her lover. The movie itself focuses on Lohman as she transitions from foster home to foster home after Pfeiffer is sentenced to 35 years to life in prison. The screen just eats Michelle Pfeiffer  her long blonde hair is perfect in every scene including the time she's in prison. The book describes her as beautiful and the role was cast well. Pfeiffer is stunning. The supporting cast is equally strong most especially Robin Wright Penn and Renee Zellweger. Wright Penn is outstanding as a Biblebeating trailerish they don't actually live in a trailer foster mother. Astrid Lohman enjoys this place at first but she and Wright Penn's boyfriend Ray Cole Hauser in a performance that made him a star fall for one another.All around well worth the time and energy in seeing it White Oleander is and remains one of my favorite films.710 3 of 4 stars.".

Astrid realizes in a mature way her mother can't even grasp that she must acknowledge her mother's role in her life and her mother's contribution to who she is and who she will become while at the same time breaking away from her mother and becoming her own person. I think Lohman's acting steals the show away from Pfeiffer Zellweger and the rest though everyone was good especially Robin Wright Penn and even Rena the foster mom who makes her sell her own clothes.

	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate enough to attend a gala screening of White Oleander at the Toronto International Film Festival this week.  I loved it.  The performances are wonderful  Michelle Pfeiffer is just terrific as Ingrid the artistmother arrested for murdering her cheating boyfriend and Robin WrightPenn and Renee Zellweger are great as foster mothers who take in her daughter.  But the real revelation of this movie is the daughter Astrid played brilliantly by Alison Lohman.  Her life is instantly and irrevocably changed when the police come to her door early one morning to take her mother away.  The movie is really about how she grows and changes in the company of the women who take her in and how she copes with her constantly changing circumstances.  Lohan is completely convincing subtle and graceful.  Any 21 year old newcomer who can steal a scene from Pfeiffer or WrightPenn is definitely somebody to look out for.  I couldn't take my eyes off her as she turned from her mothers little girl into a bright talented young woman. The script is brilliant.  At the same time we are watching as Astrid is forced to grow up almost overnight we are also learning that her relationship with her mother is anything but simple.  Ingrid is controlling and jealous but she is also brilliant and talented. Astrid must break free of her mothers grasp before she can really know herself.  And while her mother is telling her to think for herself she is at the same time trying to tell her what to think.  With Ingrid locked up Astrid is desperate to regain some sense of safety and security and it is only through her exposure to a number of very troubled women and a boy who finally offers her some kind of unconditional love played brilliantly by Patrick Fugit the young star of Almost Famous that she finally finds that security within herself.  The movie is full of surprises doling out information as we need it and never resorting to cheap sentimentality. The film is bright and colorful and just a joy to watch and the score by Thomas Newman is absolutely beautiful the best I've heard this year and certain to be an Oscar contender.  The Film Festival isn't over yet but I'm certain White Oleander will be one of my favorite films this year.".

There'as also a fine performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as the mother who conveys a hint a madness each time she rolls her eyes about her feline face. But it's a pity a lot of the execution is so unsubtle. The mother's crime for example is murder while in foster care the girl first finds a fostermum who tries to kill her and then one who succeeds in killing herself. Each of these events are plausible in themselves but not altogether and tragedy does not require death on this scale. While the initially clever way the film starts to divert our sympathy away from the mother becomes increasingly obvious and slightly dishonest when it undermines the idea originally conveyed that mother and daughter had been close. The film also suffers from a slight overdose of Hollywood gloss everyone is beautiful everyone is talented in part this is justified by the plot but one sometimes despairs of ever seeing someone normallooking in a leading movie role. These flaws mean that 'White Oleander' is far from a great film but its ambition to explore complexity in human relationships keeps it interesting even if its realisation doesn't quite deliver the potential of its ideas.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of my favorite late night cable presentations. Beautifully filmed story of a group of girls attending a Swiss Boarding School. They spend their days talking about boys and sex things they obviously don't really understand. Then one day a new student arrives an American girl. The others naturally assume that this new girl played wonderfully by Nastassja Kinski is experienced in these matters. There is romance and school girl pranks involving the students at the neighboring boys school across the lake. The cast is gorgeous to look at and the softfocus photography reminded me of the films of David Hamilton. In fact the whole theme of beautiful young girls dealing with the first stirrings of sexuality is all quite reminiscent of Hamilton's work such as Erste Sehnsucht and my favorite Laura. Also worth mentioning is the music score by composer Francis Lai who was responsible for the music in many art house and erotic films of this era. I think Boarding School is sadly overlooked. I would like to see this one released on DVD with the original German audio and uncensored as I am sure this American version must be cut in places. American censors are unkind to films like these confusing art for exploitation. The presence of Nastassja Kinski one of the most beautiful women in the world along with the appearance of Fabiana Udenio should warrant an official DVD release!".

They employed a variety of gimmicks. One girl belly danced. Another performed a swanlike ballet. Fabiana stripped out of an alligator costume but only down to a bikini to the tune of See Ya Later Alligator! My favorite however was performed by Vronique Delbourg who did a dance with a banana skirt similar to Josephine Baker's. She passed out some of these bananas but not enough to appear bottomless!Nastassja did not compete but she did treat one of the boys to a private nude performance after the show. This is the most erotic footage of her I have ever seen!If you find Nastassja Kinski or Fabiana Udenio attractive and would like to see them and other beautiful actresses at their sexiest this is a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is is one of a number of German films they used to show on latenight cable TV stations a lot in the late 70's and early 80's. But it's different than a lot of those other movies in that rather than being a sexsaturated oompahpah scrompfest it's kind of comingofage film not unlike the American teen comedies of the early 80's it especially resembles the summercamp classic Little Darlings. It's set at a Swiss boarding school where a bunch of girls decide not only to lose their collective virginity to the boys at a school across the lake but also to make money by charging them for it! This is one movie I probably wouldn't expect a modernday Hollywood remake of. They have a surprising and rather ridiculous amount of trouble pulling this off though.Even though this movie opens with a closeup of the bare breast of one of the older bustier girls this is actually surprisingly innocent movie with very little actual sex in it. It's very dumb but kind of sweet. The main attractionof course was Natsassia Kinski who plays the new girl at the school who becomes the catalyst for the whole thing after she meets a handsome guy from the boys' school on the train. Except for the topless girl at the beginning Kinski pretty much provides all the nudity and sex here. She does a memorable striptease out of an alligator costume! for the boys at a party and her devirginising is the only one that occurs onscreen. Although she was not very old here Kinski is not particularly believable as an inexperienced virgin perhaps because in reallife she'd already had torrid affairs with Roman Polanski and Milos Forman by this time.The only other cast member that might look familiar is Fabiana Udenio the ItalianArgentinean beauty who later played Alotta Fagina in the original Austin Powers. She has only a very small role here though and even by German standards she was too young at the time to really participate in the sexual shenanigans.This movie doesn't compare to other late Germanmade cable fodder as a sex film or to Kinski's truly erotic followup to this Stay the Way You Are. But although it has the disadvantage of being dubbed it's really no dumber than most of the early 80's teen sex comedies and it's one of the few that's about sexually curious girls rather than horny boys. It's worth seeing I guess.".

Penguin books had kicked things off in the 50s with the DH Lawrence novel Lady Chatterly's Lover of course. Gradually there was a move away from literary material which was sexually oriented Lady Chatterly A Cold Wind In August etc. to books which were targeted towards erotic entertainment rather than serious literature. Passion Flower Hotel by Rosalind Erskine  pseudonym for Roger Erskine was a case in point. It was a saucy lightly humorous novel about a group of boarding school girls who set themselves up as a rather tentative brothel for the benefit of the local boarding school boys a different neighbouring school. This for a 60s adolescent lad who had not not joined the Permissive Society was pretty spicy stuff. My copy became dog eared and took to falling open at certain pages.I encountered this movie late one night on TV and it was well under way when I thought Hello! This is Passion Flower Hotel! Although the adaptation is distinctly European the book is very English the story is pretty much the same.Don't expect this film to be sexually lurid. There is some nudity the plot is driven by sex but there is an air of innocence about the girls' enterprise and also the movie itself. These were simpler times and by being set even further back in time the innocence is amplified. It is mildly erotic pretty to look at gently entertaining and rather charming in its own understated manner.And for me it brings back very welcome memories of the book.".

Instead of doing the logical thing i.e. contacting the boys to let them know that there is a nearby bevy of virgins in desperate need of deflowering they decide they have to present themselves to the boys as being very experienced indeed all of them. And who is more sexually experienced than a prostitute? So prostitutes they become designating the boathouse as their brothel and buying lingerie and lanterns and costumes and such. The only reason they charge any money is because they'd be rather unconvincing prostitutes if they didn't.It all sounds very naughty and the fact that the opening shot is of a barelylegal teenage tit doesn't make it seem any less so. But the movie is more sweet and funny than sleazy and one can't help but chuckle at how difficult it is for anybody to get laid when everybody is so very very willing. It is available on DVD in a package deal called Hollywood Hotties paired with Kill Cruise and Choices two other movies nobody would remember if not for their soontobefamous stars Elizabeth Hurley and Demi Moore respectively. Fabiana Udenio was about fourteen when Boarding School was made but she stays covered up enough just enough.One thing I find interesting is that the girls become prostitutes not because they want the money but because they want the status.

It stars the really young Nastassja Kinski in one of her earliest roles as a school girl with some naughty fantasies. But she is not the only one. Her female buddies are just as bad and they decide to launch a business which allows the school boys to see the girls naked if they pay enough money and if they really pay enough money even engage in sexual activities. So prostitution is a major plot reference here. but it is not displayed as something evil rather as something that belongs to the girls' sexual awakenings for some bizarre reason. The film was directed by Andr Farwagi a French filmmaker and Paul Nicholas wrote the screenplay based on Laura Black's novel. I have not read the book so I cannot say if it is as much garbage but this film here surely is. The actors are all pretty bad and the way they talk about their business was supposed to seem innocent and inexperienced but due to the lack of range it just looks all very amateurish. Klaus Kinski's daughter does not stand out at all and as this is one of her most known German films I cannot say I got curious about any of her other works. These 100 minutes were extremely underwhelming and are not better than most of the 1970's sex comedies from Germany Austria and Switzerland with the major difference that this film here does take itself so seriously on many occasions that it feels pretty cringeworthy. You'd better stay away or don't say I haven't warned you.".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason Turner Classic Movies here in the UK keeps showing this film at 5 or 6 in the morning. It deserves to be more widely known. As another reviewer noted although it was made soon after the events that inspired it it's no exploitation film. It's a solidly scripted and acted story with multidimensional characters. I wish more movies made now which are based on headlines were as thoughtful and  respectful.That said the film's story only resembles the actual escape from East Berlin in the way that it shows 28 people fleeing from a tunnel. The real Tunnel 28 as it was called and this was an alternative title of the film in a 1960s poster for it I saw in the Museum in the House at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin it was titled Tunnel 28 was built in May 1962 from a in a street in West Berlin that was close to the Wall the tunnel ended in a basement in a house in East Berlin. It was not a family but a group of students who constructed the tunnel. They hoped to continue using the tunnel but the night after the 28 people escaped it was flooded by a burst pipe. I've read that some East Berliners hoped to reuse this tunnel during the following winter after the water froze but I don't know if this is true. Several people were told about it and when they came to find the tunnel's entrance they were arrested by the East German police.Interestingly enough the tunnel's building was financed by NBC in exchange for rights to exclusive footage of the students working on its construction and footage of refugees escaping. I've always wanted to see this documentary but I've never found a copy of it. Some of the NBC footage is featured in a recent German documentary Der Tunnel  Die Wahre Geschichte' that interviews the builders. While filming this documentary researchers found remains of the tunnel that they dug. I don't know why the writers of Escape from East Berlin' felt that they had to change the story. I suppose it was to make it more like a suspense and adventure film. I'm glad that the story they wrote is sympathetic with the East Berliners' point of view and it is unsensational it must have been a terrific temptation at the time to drive home the horrors of the situation and the horrors of Communism. It holds up very well aside from one thing that annoyed me. How could people escape from such a narrow and meandering tunnel so quickly holding suitcases and luggage including china? In the actual tunnel escapes the refugees were told what the neighbour tells Erica's parents bring nothing. Besides carrying suitcases through the streets would have alerted the Stasi's suspicions immediately.".

I wish more movies made now which are based on headlines were as thoughtful and  respectful.That said the film's story only resembles the actual escape from East Berlin in the way that it shows 28 people fleeing from a tunnel. The real Tunnel 28 as it was called and this was an alternative title of the film in a 1960s poster for it I saw in the Museum in the House at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin it was titled Tunnel 28 was built in May 1962 from a in a street in West Berlin that was close to the Wall the tunnel ended in a basement in a house in East Berlin. It was not a family but a group of students who constructed the tunnel. They hoped to continue using the tunnel but the night after the 28 people escaped it was flooded by a burst pipe. I've read that some East Berliners hoped to reuse this tunnel during the following winter after the water froze but I don't know if this is true. Several people were told about it and when they came to find the tunnel's entrance they were arrested by the East German police.Interestingly enough the tunnel's building was financed by NBC in exchange for rights to exclusive footage of the students working on its construction and footage of refugees escaping. I've always wanted to see this documentary but I've never found a copy of it. Some of the NBC footage is featured in a recent German documentary Der Tunnel  Die Wahre Geschichte' that interviews the builders. While filming this documentary researchers found remains of the tunnel that they dug. I don't know why the writers of Escape from East Berlin' felt that they had to change the story. I suppose it was to make it more like a suspense and adventure film. I'm glad that the story they wrote is sympathetic with the East Berliners' point of view and it is unsensational it must have been a terrific temptation at the time to drive home the horrors of the situation and the horrors of Communism. It holds up very well aside from one thing that annoyed me. How could people escape from such a narrow and meandering tunnel so quickly holding suitcases and luggage including china? In the actual tunnel escapes the refugees were told what the neighbour tells Erica's parents bring nothing. Besides carrying suitcases through the streets would have alerted the Stasi's suspicions immediately.";

This is enhanced by the fact that the male lead has an ambiguous attitude to the west and to any concept that life could be better or that there is any real freedom over the wall. Not only that but we are  subtly  shown why he has developed this attitude and it is reinforced by some agreeably underplayed secondary roles such as his mother and his uncle you always feel that uncle is going to produce some sort of surprise... and he certainly does in the end!The female lead is a slightly weak link but not in any sort of Sophia Coppola style disastrous way and I do think more could have been made of her parents particularly her mother who added a religious dimension to the ingredients of the plot that was not adequately explored. Her father's behaviour towards the end of the film displays the corrosive effect of Communism upon the human soul brilliantly.A more complex and enjoyable film that it at first may seem it is an intelligent contrast to so many modern 'action' vacuums.".

As the movie goes on we can see how people live in East Berlin as American point of view. I have found some interesting points in this film that appear in a quite imperceptible and yet poignantly way. People is not only afraid of being controlled or spied by the government itself but also by their neighbors. Although this is not major developed we can clearly seen how Schrder's neighbor watches almost every movement they make or how fear the family is when Marga Maria Tober speaks with two German soldiers and the family thinks she is reporting them. When the Spanish civil war ended another civil war began neighbors reporting neighbors to be republican to obtain a gain or simply because they hated them. Human beings at their worst but also at their best which we can see by helping others and giving them the chance to escape. Having been left apart from Hollywood industry due to communist accusations Siodmak did not want to make a political film and that's why he made it an intrigue one as well. And he hit it. Surprisingly or maybe not so the film was considered a minor one and not a success nor in Western German where it was found too soft nor in France where it was found too propagandistic but it was in the U.S.A.".

	schema:headline " Escaping Life Behind The Berlin Wall";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the true story of an actual escape under the Berlin Wall Escape Form East Berlin is a sometimes slow moving film that does manage to capture a bit of the atmosphere of the time. It was of course the height of the Cold War with the Communists having built a wall dividing the Soviet occupied East Berlin from the rest of the city which was occupied by the British French and Americans. The viewer certainly gets the point that paranoia is called for in East Berlin. There are guards and soldiers everywhere and people have to be careful who they talk to and what they talk about. Even one's own family isn't necessarily going to keep confidences. The opening scenes are of an attempt to smash a truck through the wall and the fate of the driver leaves us with no doubt that the Communist guards were quite willing to kill to ensure that no one escaped their socialist paradise. That atmosphere was captured well although there was surprisingly little direct political commentary aside from a few sarcastic comments on the lips of some of the characters about the benefits of a planned economy.The movie mostly revolves around the effort to build a tunnel from the basement of a house near the Wall to the West. The main character is Kurt Don Murray  the driver to an East German major and his wife  who befriends the sister of the man killed in the opening escape attempt and who not realizing that her brother is dead wants to join him in the west. Others find out about the plan and join in and eventually there are 28 people who want to make their way through the tunnel. The last few minutes of the movie are quite suspenseful as East German authorities try desperately to stop the escape attempt.This is certainly a propaganda film. That much is obvious. It's also obvious that it was made pretty quickly. The actual escape on which it's based had only taken place a few months before the movie had its debut. Aside from Murray and Werner Klemperer most of the cast are better known for their work in European films. It's a little bit uneven but it's also an interesting portrayal of life behind the Berlin Wall. 610".

That atmosphere was captured well although there was surprisingly little direct political commentary aside from a few sarcastic comments on the lips of some of the characters about the benefits of a planned economy.The movie mostly revolves around the effort to build a tunnel from the basement of a house near the Wall to the West. The main character is Kurt Don Murray  the driver to an East German major and his wife  who befriends the sister of the man killed in the opening escape attempt and who not realizing that her brother is dead wants to join him in the west. Others find out about the plan and join in and eventually there are 28 people who want to make their way through the tunnel. The last few minutes of the movie are quite suspenseful as East German authorities try desperately to stop the escape attempt.This is certainly a propaganda film. That much is obvious. It's also obvious that it was made pretty quickly. The actual escape on which it's based had only taken place a few months before the movie had its debut. Aside from Murray and Werner Klemperer most of the cast are better known for their work in European films. It's a little bit uneven but it's also an interesting portrayal of life behind the Berlin Wall. 610";

	schema:reviewBody "This film shows men from several different nations all pulled together in war and discovering the humanity in the enemy. The film is made almost completely without dialog.From a purely historical perspective this is a very important film in that it shows a film created by the antiwar crowd that was very important and vocal in Germany before the Nazis obtained control in 1933. Today you might not know that such a movement was strongas the memory of the awful Nazi years and the Nazi government's efforts to eradicate this movement were mostly successful. Copies of Erich Maria Remarque's book All Quiet on the Western Front and films like Westfront 1918 were systematically destroyed by the new fascist governmentand it's a miracle that Hell on Earth survived. Apparently the opening titles were obliterated but restored well after the war.However from an entertainment point of view the film has A LOT to be desired. It apparently was produced for an international audience and as such dialog and unfortunately the story as well are severely simpletoo simple. As a result the many scenes of war and its awfulness experienced by these multinational soldiers in the film come off more as film snippets than a real honest to goodness narrative. It's a noble experiment...but also a very boring one.So am I recommending you don't watch this film? Not exactly. I recommend instead you see the better examples of the 1930s antiwar films first...then if you must see Hell on Earth. My advice is for the best Germanmade film of the type see Westfront 1918 mentioned above. Then watch the 1930 American film All Quiet on the Western Front. It is THE best film of the era and is very sympathetic to the Germans AND unrelenting in its awfulness in the depiction of war. Then you might try seeing the 1930s remake of J'Accuse or the German movie not really a war filmbut still having the same message Kameradschaft or the American films The Eagle and the Hawk and Ace of Aces. Then STILL look for other films of the same bent...then after seeing all of them you might finally try Hell on Earth.All in all a film that is simply poor viewing and dulland there are so many better films that manage to make exactly the same statement...only better.By the way you might wonder why the black man dances so fast in the film. This dancing scene was obviously shot as a silent piece using an oldstyle camera that would normally play the film at between 1622 frames per second. However when you play this film in a normal sound projector which always goes at 24 frames per second it appears way too fastparticularly if the cameraman originally filmed it at about 16. So unless you deliberately record the event too slow in the first place you can't just stick silent clips into a sound film and have it look normal. So that's why he appeared to have ADHD!!".

That's not always correct but most of the time it works  especially with famous movies of course. But when I read the title of this movie I really didn't know what it would be about. Of course I didn't think that it would be a movie about the insect but I just couldn't form a good idea about it. That's why I just gave it a try not knowing what to expect but hoping for the best. And I'm glad that I did because this certainly was a nice movie.The Locusts is situated in the 1950's and shows how the arrival of Clay Hewitt changes life drastically in a small town. He's looking for a job and is hired by the local feed ranch's owner an aging widow who likes to drink and seduce younger men. He quickly becomes her new lover but also has an eye for her quiet son Flyboy. The boy hasn't spoken a word in years and is completely withdrawn since the death of his father. The only one who he talks to since his recent return from a mental hospital is his pet bull. But Clay wants to give it a try and gradually he manages to get the boy out of his isolation much against the will of the boy's mother...Even though this is perhaps not the most original story ever I must say that I had a good time watching this movie. The acting has a lot to do with that of course. Vince Vaughn is very enjoyable as Clay Hewitt and Kate Capshaw did a very fine job portraying Delilah but in my opinion it is Jeremy Davies as Flyboy who was the best this time. But overall this is a movie that portrayed its characters well and didn't drown in an overdose of plot twists. This is John Patrick Kelley's first and so far only film but it certainly makes me look forward to new projects from this man. I give this movie a rating between 710 and 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are so many words that can be used to describe the emotions that I felt while watching this movie and I'm not sure how to display them. But I must preface my comments about this movie with the following I am an unapologetic unabashed fan of Vince Vaughn's acting and I'm pretty sure that I always will be. I am however unbiased when it comes to a movie role and can admit when I'm unimpressed with his work his hosting of SNL back in 1998 quickly comes to mind. Having said this here is a brief synopsis of what I received from this movie. My comments are based on the assumption that you have already watched this film.I felt that Vince Vaughn was amazingly convincing as Clay a drifter on the run from his past. His portrayal of Clay Hewitt was nothing short of genius. I'll never understand how he successfully pulled off this role because the script in itself left a lot to be desired in my opinion. Somehow Vaughn balanced a tough gritty emotionally unattached character with one that was gentle and loving at the same time. I was also surprised at how well the actors displayed various trust and emotional issues throughout the film. Flyboy Jeremy Davies gradually opens up to Clay which allows him to gradually expose Flyboy to a whole new world little by little. Flyboy trusts Clay with everything even to the point of eventually revealing the awful truth to him about The Anniversary. Clay eventually feels comfortable or desperate enough to disclose information to Kitty Ashley Judd about tragic events that occurred in his recent past.He reveals that he has been lying to protect himself from his past and hopes to move on and start over. The irony is that upon arrival to this rural Kansas town Clay is unknowingly placed at the center of a family web of murder suicide lies and deceit. I also appreciate the dynamic between Clay and Kitty. He is emotionally detached from her throughout the entire film and his emotional capacity is dominated by his concern for Flyboy. Kitty is spurned by Clay on every attempt at affection and communication with him. It turns out in the end that Kitty is all that Clay has emotionally and he instantly becomes desperate for her support he literally needs her help to physically stand up in the end. I enjoyed how this played out.Flyboy's mother Delilah actually sets the whole stage for the tragedy that ends their branch on the family tree. In the last scene of the movie it is obvious that she is plotting in her mind how everything will play out and things turn out tragically according to her plan. Clay is the one person that Flyboy was correct in knowing that he could trust with his life. The fact that Flyboy died believing that Clay committed the ultimate betrayal is a devastating end that was admittedly almost too much for me to handle. This is especially considering that Clay's whole existence throughout the last 34 of the movie was centered around his interest and eventual love for Flyboy. One may think to himself that it's horrible for Clay to have entered Flyboy's life only for Flyboy to meet such a tragic demise. It may even appear indirectly that Clay is the reason for Flyboy's death. But I believe that had it not been for Clay Flyboy may have lived longer but remained miserable. He would never have known what it felt like to be loved by someone who truly considered Flyboy to be his best friend or cared for by a woman that showed him genuine affection and considered time spent with him as the best date she ever had...to sum it up had it not been for Clay entering his life it's safe to assume that Flyboy would never have known what true love was. It's amazing to me that these actors namely Vaughn and Davies could work together in a way that allowed me to receive this much from this movie. I was truly touched by this film and it has become one of my all time favorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING SPOILERSSet in the 1950s this intense drama is about secrets lies and misfortune. Personally I think it is welldone. Clay Hewitt Vince Vaughn comes to a small town from St Joe and while on his way hitching to California where he can get together with his brother who serves in the marine corps. With only seven bucks in his pocket he has to find work in order to get some money. Immediately he is hired by Mrs Potts Kate Capshaw to work at her cattle ranch and lodge and board are provided. He notices that Mrs Potts has a young son Flyboy Jeremy Davies who never speaks to anybody but his beloved bull. Later Clay befriends Flyboy and tries to guide him to the outside world which he has been excluded from for years due to his stay in a mental hospital. They say he has a shock when his father hangs himself.Meanwhile local girl Kitty Ashley Judd falls in love with Clay. Flyboy starts talking to people and makes steady progress but at the same time the whole thing is about to go extremely wrong Clay's brother has long been killed in a friendly fire and the reason why he's going to California is because back in Kansas a sixteenyearold girl with whom he has had sex accidentally hurts herself and dies so Clay has to flee from being executed. Eventually Clay decides to take Flyboy with him away from the domination of Mrs Potts Flyboy has been treated as a slave and has been emotionally abused by his promiscuous mother who cuts the balls of his pet bull. But when Mrs Potts has found out Clay's intention she threatens him that if he took her son with him she would inform the police as she already has learnt about what has happens in Kansas. It is at this very moment the dirty secrets of Mrs Potts and her son are revealed. Clay can take his wages and leave on one condition he has to do what Mrs Potts asks him to. When Flyboy finds the two of them in Mrs Potts' bedroom following his father's not even his birth father footsteps he hangs himself. Soon afterwards Mrs Potts takes her own life as well. Despite such catastrophes Clay and Kitty manage to escape.In my opinion this is a very fascinating twisting story. The whole cast is good especially Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Davies. In 'The Locust' every main character is a victim except perhaps Kitty Ashley Judd who actually has strength to give Clay a helping hand. Clay is a victim of his mishap Flyboy is a victim of his mental trauma due to his father's death his mother's behaviour and the unintentional betrayal by Clay Mrs Potts is a victim of her incestuous father and Mr Potts is a victim of his wife's infidelity. This film is about deaths there are five of them three of them are suicides.P.S. Clay seems to have endless cigarettes to smoke. Where does he get the money for them?".

Considering all the preparations made to the buildings in downtown Sealy for this film I was disappointed to discover very little of the town was actually shown in the movie. It seems a lot of effort for so little but I'm sure the city administration was happy just getting Sealy in the credits. As for the movie itself really not my cup of tea. I don't like these kinds of films at all. But I will say I thought the acting was as good as it could be considering the script moved like a pregnant snail and the dialog was often very weak.".

Considering all the preparations made to the buildings in downtown Sealy for this film I was disappointed to discover very little of the town was actually shown in the movie. It seems a lot of effort for so little but I'm sure the city administration was happy just getting Sealy in the credits. As for the movie itself really not my cup of tea. I don't like these kinds of films at all. But I will say I thought the acting was as good as it could be considering the script moved like a pregnant snail and the dialog was often very weak.";

The castrating of bulls was really excessive and unnecessary. Watch this as a measure of how big a star Ashley Judd will become.".

	schema:headline " TV Movie Sequel Is Almost Horse Feathers.";
	schema:reviewBody "As mentioned I watched both this and the classic original last night 032708back to back because my local library had both. In my review of All Quiet On The Western FrontI stated that remakes are hard to doespecially a TV movie version. TV sequels to theatrical films are just as difficult. The idea and story of John andor Horse returning to seek solace and then fighting battles with his adopted tribe should have easily beennot just a great adventure but a film that makes some strong statementlike the original.Unfortunatelythe constraints and pitfalls of TV make this difficult sometimes. One thing for sure in my view is the use of that Little House On The Prarielike music in scenes. In the opening it's finehe's returning to America and looking forward to seeing everyone again. When things get more serious  violent laterit really has no place here. This kind of story and this kind of music do not mesh very well. As for the actors playing NativeAmericansTV always did go for an easier route.

In my review of All Quiet On The Western FrontI stated that remakes are hard to doespecially a TV movie version. TV sequels to theatrical films are just as difficult. The idea and story of John andor Horse returning to seek solace and then fighting battles with his adopted tribe should have easily beennot just a great adventure but a film that makes some strong statementlike the original.Unfortunatelythe constraints and pitfalls of TV make this difficult sometimes. One thing for sure in my view is the use of that Little House On The Prarielike music in scenes. In the opening it's finehe's returning to America and looking forward to seeing everyone again. When things get more serious  violent laterit really has no place here. This kind of story and this kind of music do not mesh very well. As for the actors playing NativeAmericansTV always did go for an easier route.

If one follows these things with some sense of continuity the error seemed to be an unforced one.With the 'vow of the sun' ceremony so prominent in the original picture I didn't think there would be call to revisit the ceremonial rite here but that's what happened as a prelude to Morgan purifying himself and seeking his vision. More surprising was seeing how younger males of the tribe willingly submitted to the ordeal as well. There's some historical fact to back that up for young warriors it was a physical and spiritual test that was offered in sacrifice for their people. As I watched the scene it occurred to me that Morgan showed no scarring from his sun ceremony of five years earlier another unforced error if I had to guess.Reading previous posters for this film it appears that it's not nearly as well regarded as it's prequel. Personally I thought it was a decent story but would have to concur that the original was better since it was exploring the Lakota Indian rituals for the first time. Oddly I've never run across the sun ceremony referenced in any other movies other than these 'Horse' films a bit surprising since the Western is my favorite genre and I've seen hundreds spanning the decades.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lord John MorganRichard Harrisis an English aristocrat who was captured and enslaved by the Yellow Hand Sioux on a visit to the American west in the 1820s. Over time he fought to prove himself and eventually became a respected member of the tribe. The Sioux called him Horse. Years later Morgan has returned to England and the Sioux are attacked by bloodthirsty trappers who massacre most of the tribe and destroy their sacred home. A jaded Morgan returns to the west to aid the Sioux in their fight against the trappers.I particularly enjoyed the first movie A Man Called Horse1970. It was a fascinating essay on life in a Sioux tribe that was colourful and inspiring too. This sequel however is really just a forgettable potboiler which drags on. The characters are not allowed to develop and the plot looses itself in endless scenes of chanting screeching and riding. The villainous trappers are barely seen and appear to be nothing but a bunch of dumb labourers. Geoffrey Lewis' head honcho had especially little to do trying his hardest to be menacing but never really succeeding in doing so. The script feels as if it's been written by a 14 year old with several unnecessary scenes which are merely there to pad out the movie's 2 hour running time. The film is at least half an hour too long and several important plot points are tossed aside. For example the film did not delve deep enough into Lord Morgan's life at home in England with his wife and how he suffered when returned to civilised society. Also his reason for returning to the tribe is explained so promptly that you are likely to miss it if you aren't paying attention. So much potential is wasted the depth and atmosphere of the first movie is nonexistent here .The purification ritual is featured in this film once again. In the original it was executed with professionalism the end result being gorgeously psychedelic. Here it just looks outlandish and takes up too much time. I found it unintentionally humorous as well as corny. There isn't much action apart from the climatic attack on the fort which was pretty well shot but far too abrupt and rather anti climatic. The fact that some of the horse falls have been removed took away the tension thus making me enjoy the battle even less. Richard Harris just runs around the interiors of the fort trying not to get shot but the special effects were really good. The final explosion of the hut was ruined by the fact that the adjacent watchtower did not come crashing to the ground. Again it was an action sequence that they could have done a lot more with by throwing in some handtohand combat ambitious stunts and maybe even Lord Morgan sacrificing himself for his Sioux brothers. Although the film did boast some fine scenery with beautiful vistas of sun kissed plains and lush forests and it at least sounded nice courtesy of Laurence Rosenthal's operatic score.Don't worry if you haven't seen this sequel you're better off watching the original and leaving it at that. The sequel is one of those movies that is best enjoyed when one is intoxicated. 610.".

In these days Harriet Beecher Stowe's popular novel of Uncle Tom's Cabin is known more by historians as a contributing cause of the Civil War than as an actual literary work . Uncle Tom's Cabin was the bestselling novel of the 19th century and the second bestselling book of that century following the Bible . Stowe was partly inspired to create Uncle Tom's Cabin by the 1849 slave narrative The Life of Josiah Henson  formerly a slave now an inhabitant of Canada as narrated by himself  as Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the Province of Upper Canada now Ontario where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become selfsufficient and where he wrote his memoirs . It talks Tio Tom John Kitzmiller obedient yet not lacking integrity  but a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts and Tom eventually falls into the hands of the sinister Simon Legree Herbert Lom  a slave trader. Uncle Tom is a dutiful longsuffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress . AfricanAmerican slavers are afraid of the new strict fugitive slave law and some of them attempt to getaway . Eliza Catana Cayetano and her little baby escape from the plantation in the wintry night  their flight across the ice covered river as there is a memorable scene of her flight to freedom across the ice flows with her son  but sympathetic northerners like the Quaker family you see rescue Eliza and her baby . During Eliza's escape she meets up with her husband George Harris who had run away previously . They decide to attempt to reach Canada . After that  St. Clare O.W. Fischer purchases Tom  the good black slave . St. Clare then asks Tom to educate her daughter Eva Michaela May . After Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years Eva grows very ill. There takes place the surreal death of little Eva . Then Tom sold to Simon Legree and the events go awry .This the best and only European film adaptation of the classic Harriet Beecher Stowe novel  one of the more expensive films for the time . Tio Tom's cabin successfully captures the mood of the old prewar South while emphasizing the horror and immorality of slavery . Uncle Tom's Cabin or Life Among the Lowly is an antislavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe  being published in 1852  the novel helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War  the impact attributed to the book is great reinforced by a story that when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe at the start of the Civil War  Lincoln declared  So this is the little lady who started this great war . This is a surprisingly good  interesting but sentimental adaptation of the novel . The faith connection between Tom and Eva is completely described from the movie yet one can appreciate the true nobility of their characters without seeing this bond between them brought about by a shared love of the world beyond . The film captures most of the highlights from the novel including a very well done Eliza's flight across the frozen river pursued by bloodhounds  the death of Little Eva  and the villainous Simon Legree  the film gets better as it goes along building to the exciting finale . John Kitzmiller gives a fine performance in the title role John as lead role is outstanding as Uncle Tom . What is even more outstanding is the dignity and lack of minstrelsy in the way he is allowed to play him . KitzmillerTom carries great emotional weight and manages to humanize slaves and rightfully demonize the institution of slavery itself . Special mention to villain Legree  perfectly interpreted by the great Herbert Lom . Released by Central Cinema Company Film CCC with allEuropeanstar cast such as Herbet Lom  O.W.

Eartha Kitt's song at the end is unforgettable. The film is distinctly European the director is Hungarian in style and the story and songs could merit a rerelease.

	schema:headline " Perhaps poorly executed as novel adaptation but not bad as cinema work";
	schema:reviewBody "Many years have passed since Geza Radvanyi directed this movie an adaptation of an abolitionist cult novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe UNCLE TOM'S CABIN a very famous literary work that similarly to other voices of truth in history cried out for freedom righteousness and equality in spite of attacks from politically correct people. The many I met as well as some reviewers on this board expressed their strong criticism claiming that the film is more a European uncle Tom interpretation. They also say that there are so many discrepancies between the book and the film that it is absolutely useless to see it. I agree it is different it is more ONKEL TOMS HUETTE than UNCLE TOM'S CABIN in its direction style and acting style but it does not mean that Radvanyi's work is bad as a film.Let me first analyze the beginning scenes that really captivated me as original and raised my interest in the movie. What we are exposed to is something like double retrospection. First we see modern skyscrapers Statue of Liberty and...the monument of Abraham Lincoln a man who changed the destiny of many Americans as the narrator adds. Immediately the action moves more than 100 years back  April the 14th 1865 we see President Lincoln in the famous theater. On that day of his death he is given the book UNCLE TOM'S CABIN by its author Harriet Beecher Stowe who thanks him for changing America. When things turn bad for Lincoln we are supplied with the view of the novel's cover. This memorable closeup appears to constitute the answer why such a good man as Lincoln had to be assassinated... Was America still divided? From this moment the film constitutes the adaptation of the novel. I described this beginning in such a detailed way because I found it exceptionally accurate and memorable. Later it is true that the action seems to be quite slow the film is long. Nevertheless it has sometimes unnoticed but important advantages that make it a nice film or at least significant to be seen by any film lover.It is undeniably the music. The wonderful Negro songs based on the Biblical texts as well as on their hard experience and thoughts raised in sorrow and suffering moved me to tears. The musical pieces about Moses and the Red Sea or the Missisipi River which was a sort of symbolic reference to the Bible are beautifully executed. The viewer even if not very knowledgeable of the historical period has a clear picture of the lifestyle of dreams those people had dreams of better times when the black and the white may join hands as free men. Therefore with this music comes the idea comes the American dream of liberty. This idea is more a universal subject of American history from abolitionists to Martin Luther King and those who will come after. And that makes the film a must see no matter how faithful to the novel it is.It is also some performances that make Radvanyi's film worth a look. Herbert Lom a German actor born in the Czech Republic memorably portrays the cruel Simon Legree a man for whom a slave is less than animal. Similarly to the book he represents the whole system of the southern plantations where tears beating rape and overworking were the daily bread for the black slaves not 100 plantations were like that for sure which raised negative reactions towards the book among many southerners and the content was regarded as subjective. A lot of moments with Mr Lom remained in my memory but in particular the unforgettable scene when Legree comes to Shelby's house. The two world views are beautifully contrasted and this behavior of his obscene and vulgar is something that Herbert Lom accurately expressed. I also liked the Italian actress Eleonora Rossi Drago and Vilma Degischer an Austrian who plays Mrs Shelby. They do fine jobs. Except for those facets the movie is not that great as some other productions of the time. It's a pity that the colors and the cinematography in this film are seriously dated. Faded colors indicate the older years of cinema when the film was made but it is I agree the fact that lowers the value of this production from today's perspective. There were many better movies with magnificent cinematography in the 1960s than this one.All in all if you look at this film as only a novel adaptation you will be confused or even disappointed since each of us who reads the book first has hisher own view imagination which is usually disturbed by the director's vision. If you look at this film from the perspective of the modern viewer you will find it dated and not very attractive perhaps. You should look at it independently as an optimist viewer frank one who can find good sides in each piece of art. Then the movie will be worth seeing. UNCLE TOM'S CABIN has one thing absolutely in common with the book. It asks of course nowadays a different generation the questions that our ancestors were asked by Mrs Stowe Is there a right to humiliate someone deprive himher of dignity only because heshe was born black?".

Despite popular distortions Stowe's title character is not at all remotely similar to what is commonly called an uncle tom an African American who sucks up to whites he is a figure of towering dignity one who takes his Christianity very seriously who resists evil with all his being while rejecting hate and violence who provides moral leadership for his enslaved neighbors who  is beaten senseless by his owner for refusing to flog a fellow slave and tortured fatally for not revealing the whereabouts of fugitive slaves. He is in fact proof that Martin Luther King's program of nonviolent resistance did not just derive from Gandhi but had roots in AfricanAmerican culture. The portrayal of Tom in the film by an almost unknown American actor conveyed that brilliantly.Before commenting on the other actors one should note as another reviewer at this site has already done that there are some weird and not very well conceived changes in the plot.

Nor do I understand why Tom's death in the film is due to a fall from a wagon rather than as in the bookhis torture by a sadistic master maddened by Tom's goodness and determined to break him by making him betray his friends.Be that as it may the other characters are well acted also Topsy as in the book is not the familiar pixie but as in the book nearautistic from neglect and abuse Shelby is the deluded weak liberal who congratulates himself for his kindness and magnanimity but is ready to rationalize selling Tom to pay a debt I'll buy him back someday Legree is the transplanted New Englander hating himself for what he does and sadistic like all those who spend their energy doing what they know they shouldn't whose only companions are his likewise selfhating Black slave drivers and the slave girl of 15 whom he sexually abuses. All these portrayals are faithful to the novel.I also congratulate the filmmakers on their correction of the book's one great flaw namely the portrayal of the saintlike child Eva. Stowe pulled out far too many stops in drawing Eva her mushy sermons and preternatural goodygoodiness is so cloying as to be embarrassing to the reader. In this film all that crud is mercifully toned down though she does remain believably a child wise and gentle beyond her years and we all HAVE known at least one such child have we not?All in all a most unexpectedly fine piece of cinema.".

	schema:headline " Comparing the story from the book with one little spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "Uncle Tom's Cabin is my most favourite novel ever. It is reasonable that I've been at quest to find a film version that can do it some justice.Unfortunately I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. While it may retain some semblence of the outer shell of the story along with a few character names the vital core of the story is entirely changed. I would challenge any film company to depict this story faithfully.It must also be pointed out that while the characters are in themselves ficticious most of the events in the book actually happened.The actual story is so magnificent that I shall not write any major spoilers here albeit one or two necessary to discuss. The real ending however of which the movie totally replaced must remain a closelyguarded secret reserved only for those who brave the book.The original story was intended to argue Christian values against the cruel and inhuman system of slavery at the time. It is therefore intensely fundamental in its Christian basis.Tom is a committed and devoted Christian unswervable in his absolute faith despite intense oppression. He has a wellworn Bible that he reads at any opportunity and regularly proclaims the Gospel with almost everyone he interacts. Evangeline who is only five years old in the book is likewise if not more so. There was no event anywhere in the book of Tom encouraging others by singing. Rather it is always by evangelism and prayer. That revolting substitution was an unforgivable degradation to his character. And it is little Eva who is able to spiritually penetrate the stonehearted and belligerent childslave Topsy with the meaning of divine love that chapter in the book being one of the most remarkable of all.This movie deletes the Christian themes entirely. The one scene which makes a vague mention of it is not found anywhere in the book. Spoiler In fact the movie wrongly shows Tom being injured in a wagon accident when in the book he was physically beaten to death by Legree for withholding intelligence on Cassy's whereabouts for he would not betray the innocent. The martyrdom in the story is tremendous and very tragically discarded in this movie. And Cassy's real hiding place was far more ingenious and exciting than the way it was shown in this cowardly film.The story really follows two paths Tom who is sold south because of his master's debt and Eliza who makes a desperate break for freedom to protect her child whom she learnt had been sold as well. Eliza's infamous river crossing which is historically true was terribly underplayed in this movie. In the book she had taken refuge at a small inn by the Ohio River in Kentucky looking for a way to cross. When several slave catchers bore down on her location she took up her five year old child scrambled down the riverbank and made a desperate flying leap over about ten feet of turbulent current onto an ice floe which pitched wildly under her weight. Upon reaching the Ohio side a neighbour she knew helped her up the bank and led her to some abolishionists with the Underground Railroad. Then with the assistance of Quakers was reunited with her fugitive husband enroute to Upper Canada. This movie very wrongly shows Eliza travelling into the deep south to be hidden by Cassy. This is strongly contradictory to the story and doesn't even make sense.The one positive comment I can make is that it appears as though some effort was put into the sets and costumes. It is only tragic and wasteful that the story was not better preserved.So in summary this movie makes a weak attempt to tell a grossly modified version of the story while it cowers away from its core themes and real exulting climax.I welcome feedback from any fans of the book who want to discuss the story! I am rather passionate about it.".

It was a sensationally positive surprise to observe how interestingly the book has been tampered with to make it an even better film. The book was certainly one of the most important and influential novels of the 19th century and as Lincoln said it was what started the war Leo Tolstoy ranked it as one of his favourites especially for its consequences only books like 'Oliver Twist' and 'Les Miserables' had similar social effects in all its roughness the book remains an absolute classic and the film lives more than well up to it.The credits are many. The first one must go to John Kitzmiller who makes a perfectly convincing Uncle Tom in an intensely warm and sustained human performance and what a wonderful idea that he starts singing and has such a wonderful voice at that! The Negro Spirituals of the film greatly enhance its emotional pathos and add a glowing colour of aesthetic charm and human dignity to the film. He is seconded by Olive Moorefield as Cassy whom the film successfully makes more of than the book while Herbert Lom as the supreme villain Simon Legree who is allowed to dominate the film from the very beginning has never had a better time for a full range of his acting since he was Napoleon in 'War and Peace' the best Napoleon ever by the way. The others fall in line and support the drama satisfactorily well.Max Ophuls would have loved this film for its wonderful details. The riverboat journey is a highlight much effort has been given to reconstruct a perfect and intact 1850s environment in homes and towns there is a marvellous sequence from old New Orleans with a circus and parade there is a splendid tavern brawl and where did they find that fascinating music box? I have never seen one so large. Another striking detail is the guest appearance of Juliette Greco she didn't appear in many films and only exclusively and while she appears you can't take your eyes from her fascinating character.The alterations from the book are on the whole well construed. That Legree is in from the beginning sets the drama off directly the invented cause of little Eva's sudden death adds another interesting intrigue not at all implausible Eliza's amazing escape never fails to impress both on screen and in the book and it's a good idea not to let her come home until the very end to at least give the end one good turn of relief.On the whole this is a film that never reached its appropriate recognition it is indeed worth discovering and loving while at the same time it constitutes an enriching and well deserved compliment to the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "Onkel Toms Htte is a West German color film from 1965 so this one already had its 50th anniversary last year. It is the Germanlanguage take on the famous Uncle Tom's Cabin story by Harriet Beecher Stowe probably nothing I would have ever thought that it existed but it was a positive surprise for the most part. I found different numbers in terms of this film's runtime. IMDb says 2 hours 50 minutes other sources say 1 hour 50 minutes but the version I saw was something in between namely slightly over 2 hours and 20 minutes. The director here is Gza von Radvnyi and he was pretty successful and prolific back in the day. This one here is still among his most known films I guess. The cast is solid too. O.W. Fischer O.W. Fischer Michael May in her first performance and Mylne Demongeot had star potential and the title character is played by John Kitzmiller in his final performance very briefly before his death. The latter is mostly known for his Bond film performance today. Overall this is not a perfect work by any means and it has difficulties occasionally in terms of keeping focus. Then again it is almost impossible to do so for a film with this runtime. There are moments when it drags and I feel it should have been 3540 minutes shorter. But I would still say it's a success overall. Especially the first third of the film was pretty interesting to watch. I myself am not too interested in the era the film portrays but people who care more for this time and the historic context may actually end up really loving this film. I personally would only say I liked it. Not a mustsee but I still give it a thumbsup even if it struggles with getting shades on characters beyond the blackandwhite depiction no pun intended! and the message it sends is an honorable one. Worth seeing.".

Special mention to pet chimp called Biba that steals the show  getting into mischief  pranks and antics  including a surprising ending . The lightingpaced storyline slows down at times  but frenetic fightsequences and fun make up for it . It's an entertaining romp plenty of brawls  including amusing bounds and leaps . This is a nice and funny juvenile story for Giuliano Gemma fans  as he's delight and likable . It packs action fistplay slapdash humor with tongueincheek and is quite bemusing . This release has some cool and several hilarious moments  adding a wonderful Ursula Andress as lady in mystery . The film isn't always good  sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions  it's frankly delicious. The movie displays innumerable laughters  jokes and slapstick .

Catching and commercial musical score by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis Spaghetti Western's ordinaries and composed by synthesizer as always  including some beautiful songs . It's followed by Safari Express by Duccio Tessari with similar artist and technician team . The motion picture written by Mario Amendola and Bruno Corbucci is middlingly directed by Michele Lupo who directed various Bud Spencer vehicles as Bulldozer The Supersheriff Buddy go west and E.T. and the Supersheriff .

This film had a sequel called Safari Express with the same cast as the original but is harder to find. To add to the confusion some distributors released both this movie and the sequel as Tropical Express!! I still recommend this as a great family film. Kids will love the animals and parents will appreciate  the intelligent humour.

The film is an episodic adventure with all of the usual  i.e. clichd  situations involving local natives and local wildlife. I found it all pretty dumb if I'm honest with little in the way of wit or insight to entertain. Gemma tries hard to charm but feels a bit lightweight while Andress is there as a clothes horse alone. Only Palance entertains in his small role. This is one of those films you sit through for the sake of the actors but get little from overall.

	schema:reviewBody "This benevolent movie early spaghetti western is basically designed as a comedy for me it succeeded and includes a harmless lovestory.

Agreeable ButifarraSpaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italy and German secondary participation  being proceeded in American style more than Sergio Leone wake  but also including closeups  zooms  and choreographic duels . All in all this film is predominantly a Spanish film rather than an Italian one . It's a three country coproduction but is clearly dominated by the Spanish contingent and the traditional leanings of the Spanish producers of the time have their stamp on the entire proceedings . The Spanish westerns of this era were far more likely to try and emulate their American source material than cultivate a distinctive style of their own the way the Italians were doing but their product  though here is developed in the US wake with brief Spag remarks . The film packs action  shootouts  drama  high bodycount and it's fast moving  being quite entertaining and approaching increasingly American style  but keeping some details that make it special in this particular genre . It's a thrilling western with spectacular scenes and breathtaking confrontation among protagonist Rick Horn and heartless enemies as well as dubious ranchers and nasty gunfighters . It's a middlebudget film with ordinary actors  professional technicians  adequate production values and pleasing results . As lighthearted as can be The Oklahoma Man is very reminiscent of the bygone American cowboy feature from the golden era of Saturday matinees with a twist of the Euro filmmaking style . If you've seen even one vintage BCowboy picture you've probably figured the whole ending . Charismatic performance for whole casting . Oklahoma John is well starred by Anton Geesink  under pseudonym of Rick Horn as an exgunslinger desperately wanting to deliver justice .

	schema:reviewBody "Immensee  Ein deutsches Volkslied or just Immensee is a GermanItalian coproduction that resulted in a Germanlanguage movie of approximately 95 minutes. It is from 1943 so it will soon have its 75th anniversary. The director and cwriter is Veit Harlan. He collaborated with Alfred Braun on the script here and the two central characters are played by Kristina Sderbaum and Carl Raddatz. This is actually a quartet of film people that you will find collaborating on other occasions back then as well. And there are other cast members that are also somewhat known today even because of the work they left us. The best example is probably Paul Klinger. But back to this one here. it is based on the work of Theodor Storm and it is not too difficult to see why the Nazis liked him not that you can blame him for any reason as he was still long dead back then. So I already mentioned the Nazis but you probably understood that yourself when reading 1943 and that it is a German movie. Of course Sderbaum was also a huge star back then and people loved her. In here she does not end up as the Reichswasserleiche for a change. But it is still a very dramatic and occasionally tragic story. Unlike other works by Harlan the focus here is much more on storytelling than on propaganda even if there are motives of course that the Nazis certainly appreciated in the plot and film. There is a huge deal of pathos in here for sure and lots of music from start to finish. But all this cannot make up for the lack of a story I really cared for let alone connected with. The last part is probably still the best and I am referring to what happens when the central male character returns from Italy. But it's also no more than a 610 perhaps and everything before that is way weaker. As a whole it is of course very modern for a film from World War II as it is in color like other Sderbaum films and sometimes pretty beautiful to look at but in terms of story or acting to a lesser extent it just is not a satisfying outcome. The best thing about it? Probably the stunning Germana Paolieri in her few scenes. Sadly I cannot say the same about Sderbaum. I have never been a great fan of her and this film does not change my perception. She always seems to play very similar characters in films at least back then and I don't see much range in her. I don't recommend watching Immensee. Thumbs down.".

Unlike other works by Harlan the focus here is much more on storytelling than on propaganda even if there are motives of course that the Nazis certainly appreciated in the plot and film. There is a huge deal of pathos in here for sure and lots of music from start to finish. But all this cannot make up for the lack of a story I really cared for let alone connected with. The last part is probably still the best and I am referring to what happens when the central male character returns from Italy. But it's also no more than a 610 perhaps and everything before that is way weaker. As a whole it is of course very modern for a film from World War II as it is in color like other Sderbaum films and sometimes pretty beautiful to look at but in terms of story or acting to a lesser extent it just is not a satisfying outcome. The best thing about it? Probably the stunning Germana Paolieri in her few scenes. Sadly I cannot say the same about Sderbaum. I have never been a great fan of her and this film does not change my perception. She always seems to play very similar characters in films at least back then and I don't see much range in her. I don't recommend watching Immensee. Thumbs down.";

It is at this point that Perry first meets Ashley Judd and his life begins to change. Essentially he becomes trapped by his love with a woman that is clearly no good for him  leading to fights crime and his eventual capture.Perry takes a huge leap away from his 90210 posterboy image with a good haunted performance as the man forced to live outside his smalltown normal life by Judd's desire for more excitement than a small town can give.Ashley Judd is excellent as Pam constantly riddled with suffering and inconsistency as she flies around emotionally cuts herself with knives and puts guns to her head and only finds peace when taking drugs spending money or stealing. The only criticism is that she is required to be nude almost once every ten minutes  this doesn't develop her character and made me think that the director wanted to have it there to satisfy the men in the audience it almost like she was being exploited.Overall the film is well plotted and makes Perry's change almost believable  however his final change doesn't totally make sense. That said it's a pretty emotional ride that doesn't let you get bored at any point is well acted and well scripted. All through the film you can't help but feel sad for Perry as he is henpecked corrupted and ultimately tormented by Judd's childish alluring Pam.".

Chris was typically reserved and softspoken but Perry made it clear that there was high tension underneath.Judd one of my favorite actresses was not so adept with Pam. In order to portray hysteria I think you have to go there otherwise the acting is painfully obvious. That's what I saw here.

	schema:reviewBody "When the honest and idealistic policeman Chris Anderson Luke Perry meets the gorgeous and sexy but alcoholic and drug addicted Pam Ashley Judd in a bar they date and have great sex. Chris immediately falls in love for Pam and marries her but the reckless and emotionally unbalanced wife brings troubles to his relationship with his family and spends her credit card in futilities leading the couple to financial problems. When Chris loses his job in the police department he concludes that they are insolvent and decides to heist banks to resolve their financial issues.I have just watched Normal Life for the second time and my opinion remains the same it is a great movie but could be better with a simple modification in the screenplay. In the beginning of the story the fate of Chris and Pam is unnecessarily disclosed and the viewer watches the film knowing that the FBI and the police arrest Chris and chase Pam and consequently breaking the tension or the imagination of the viewer. Ashley Judd astonishingly sexy and Luke Perry have great performances and chemistry in this modern Bonnie and Clyde story apparently based on true events. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Fronteiras do Crime Borders of the Crime".

	schema:reviewBody "Normal Life was barely given a theatrical release by its studio Fine Line. That's a shame because there is a lot that is worthy in this movie. John McNaughton was a good choice to direct this movie because in Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer he showed he had a talent for showing those in lower class positions with low self esteem  just like the two main characters in this movie. These characters have high ambitions and try to do better at least initially but they are shot down by themselves and their surrounding society. They want but don't get respect. The movie is focused on their insides not much on what surrounds them like their jobs. They are drawn together because they are two lost souls  they at least have that to share. The two actors are excellent in their roles Luke Perry sheds his prettyboy image completely here. The movie is not perfect  there are a few details that are not explained like what exactly is used to justify Perry's character's firing from his job. Also the movie is a bit too long more noticeably in the first half of the movie  cutting fifteen or so minutes from the movie would have helped. But despite these faults the movie is still well worth seeking out.".

He's a diligent cop and she works in some sort of electronic assembly plant. The problem is that she becomes erratic. She starts boozing it up and taking drugs. She gets moody. She goes on wild spending sprees and gets them into terrible debt while the distracted Luke Perry is so absorbed by her that he alienates his partners and is finally fired. She shows up late at work and is truculent with her boss and after a period in rehab she's cashiered as well. Perry and Judd have furious arguments over expenses in their modest apartment. What they have going for them is her occasional lucid periods and a tendency to rut like two chimpanzees in heat. In the print I just saw some of the more lurid glandular encounters were cut as were some scenes of self mutilation and that's too bad because here the nature of the sex actually plays a part in the story.Well they have individual interests as well. Judd is a feverishly rapt amateur astronomer and Perry would just love to open his own book store. Perry has a bearded friend with whom he takes friendly motorcycle rides and Judd has a lesbian friend from work. That's about it for this unhappy couple.In order to get them out of debt and to keep them together Perry takes to holding up banks. As an excop he knows how to do it. He fibs to Judd and tells her that he's putting in overtime as a security guard. When she improbably discovers his real source of income she's not at all shocked. She finds it exciting. She's overjoyed and is finally able to achieve orgasm with Perry.At her insistence Perry takes her along on his next heist but she's so elated she shoots a row of holes in the ceiling before he manages to yank her through the bank's door.By this time it's clear that Judd is a Class A bipolar. She's right out of DSM IVR. She's glum and given to cutting herself all over. The next minute she's wildly gleeful or sometimes irritable over nothing. Her judgment is impaired. Compared to Luke Perry though she's a chrome dome. He's one of the stupidest men who ever walked the earth. At one point she leaves him to live with her lesbian friend. When he begs her to come back home she lays everything out for him in plain language but it all bounces off him. Her truths are as ping pong balls.It's not an unintelligent plot reminiscent of a classic cheap noir called Gun Crazy with John Dahl and Sparkle Annie or whatever her name was. I'm too lazy to look it up. It's the kind of crazy story that might really happen to two screwballs.Ashley Judd does a good job. She was superb in another crime drama Heat as Val Kilmer's wife. She's demonstrated the limits of her range as an actress elsewhere but in this film her performance is unimpeachable.Luke Perry is another matter. He seems to be a nice enough guy but as an actor he's sufficiently lightweight that he should stick to the small screen where presence matters less. He had the same problem that David Caruso had but I can't put a name to it.Judd's oddness is accurately shown. When the couple visit some relatives for a barbecue instead of sitting at the table and drinking a beer with the adults she immediately wanders off and kicks a ball back and forth with the family's child ignoring the usual rules. Nothing dramatic just askew. But otherwise the direction is flat and uninspired. When Judd speaks at a group therapy session she's shot from a high angle for no discernible reason. It's kind of disappointing coming as it does from the director of Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer.".

If you're a Judd fan you'll be pleased to know there's several topless shots of said lady.Tittletattle aside this is a very entertaining movie to watch it doesn't spend ages on building up characters but gives you all you need to know with the minimum of fuss which allows time for the film to progress nicely.There are a few plot holes and there wont be any awards for acting but this was a decent enough thriller that should be checked out.";

I went looking for photos of Jeff Erickson as I was doing my presentation and I was sitting beside myself when I noticed that Luke Perry with the the mustache even looked like Jeff Erickson to the t. Luke Perry's performance is easy his best role very convincing in playing the character based on Jeffery and I am wondering how much about the news story did he read into getting ready for the role. I was 20 years old when I caught this on HBO. I remember parts of the case in detail as my mother was one of their book store customers in 1991. I am not going to link up the Chicago Tribune articles because they might give too much of the plot away but it's been so long with this.Those of you who are reviewing this movie how much do some of you know the real story behind it? This movie is based upon a very real news story that broke in the early 1990s as I was a Sophomore when it was fully surfaced. I do remember the movie and the case. Roselle did produce the Bonnie and Clyde as I wrote about this on FictionPress. The story I wrote from the events was called Bonnie 'n Clyde 60172 as my own book An Eye In Shadows provided some insight about the case too.The ISBN 9781682731086 is how you can find this and you want to do further reading on the case you can do so here if you haven't read the articles about it. I went through the old articles about the case and wondered how much did the director research about this as he's from Chicago. It's a very unique character study piece and I do encourage those of you who are Illinois based writers to explore the case some because there is a story there. This movie I am looking at from a local's standpoint and it is well written at to boot. Those of you who never been to the area and want to look into the locations  I know each one where they are at. Normal Life if you're looking at it from a Chicagoan perspective who grew up around Roselle Schaumburg Hoffman Estates and Hanover Park  you're thinking about this film if you seen it and wonder Where were you doing when you learned about this? It's the kind of movie you want to sit down with your friends in a diner who had never been to Chicago before and seen the film you want to tell them This really happened!My five year memoir An Eye In Shadows discusses this in the 19911992 part of the book as my mother was one of his customers in passing.".

He made the far darker 'Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer' but in both films we see people who for one reason or another must commit crimes not for the money but for the need to do so.The movie is nothing without the performance of Ashley Judd who does a complete turn around from her equally great performance in 'Ruby in Paradise'.

It's a shame that I caught this yesterday afternoon on TV. I wasted time watching this garbage when I could've just watched something else.The protagonist of the story is Chris Anderson portrayed by Luke Perry. Anderson is a good cop and overall a good guy. One night he meets a young attractive blonde in a bar. Always a great place to find the girl of your dreams. She's screaming and cursing what a dream at some guy who was lucky enough to get out of there. Anderson on the other hand isn't so lucky. He approaches the woman who has cut her hand from a broken glass. Anderson plays the knight in shining armor and helps her. They have a slow dance and she tells him her name is Pam. From the start Anderson should've known there was something up with this dame. Don't get me wrong Ashley Judd is a beautiful woman blonde or brunette. But once you get to know Pam you'll wish you didn't. Anderson drops Pam off home and he decides to see her again. The more the movie goes on Anderson gets to know Pam and the movie makes less and less sense.Pam's behavior gets more and more neurotic and you realize along with Anderson that Pam is damaged goods. But for some reason he loves her and wants to help her. Chris ends up asking Pam to be his wife.He never really does help her. He just keeps beating a dead horse. Our idealistic cop turns into a complete idiot. He takes someone who is mentally ill and completely out of it. He thinks that by marrying her and making her his wife that is going to help her. Not only does Chris do nothing about her illness he also turns a blind eye while she does drugs and drinks. As the marriage goes on Pam gets sicker and Chris gets dumber. Pam goes to the store to buy a special telescope to view an eclipse. Instead she comes home with a knife. Instead of being worried he's angry that she spent 500. He comes home one night and sees that she has cut herself all over. His solution is to buy her a dog. Whenever Chris has Pam around his family it is obvious that she doesn't know how to interact with people. Chris gets mad and yells at her. When Anderson's father dies he tells Pam to get a dress and make sure that she's there. Pam shows up at the funeral parlor dressed like she's ready to go roller blading. Still Chris does absolutely nothing to help her. This is the woman in trouble that he was going to save and he doesn't have a clue.The couple have financial trouble and they are barely able to live in the shack they're in. Chris loses his job as a cop and we are never told why. Later Pam loses her job because of her drug use. Chris comes home to find Pam with a gun to her head. By now Anderson has to be a complete idiot to not see that his wife is suicidal. What does he do? He continues to leave her alone and tends to their money problems by becoming a bank robber. Like I said as the movie goes on it makes less and less sense. There is even a ludicrous ending. Why bother to continue? This movie is very difficult to watch. Whoever made this has to be either crazy or just stupid. Poor Ashley Judd who has a great body is stuck shedding her clothes for no good reason. I've never seen a movie with such unnecessary nudity. Ashley Judd is filmed naked in many scenes just for the sake of being shown naked. Whoever made this movie must have something wrong with them.I'm sorry I ever saw this movie. I hope I never come across it again. I almost didn't even want to waste my time writing a review but I figured others should be warned. Don't even waste your time on this garbage. Ashley Judd fans especially should stay clear of this. The very talented and very attractive Ashley Judd is wasted. Actually she is exploited. Luke Perry fans should stay clear of this too. Sometimes it looked like he was giving a decent performance when he was yelling but I wouldn't be surprised if he was really yelling because he was sorry he got stuck making such a horrible and worthless movie. Stay clear of this trash.".

It sounds a little like the plot to Fun with Dick and Jane only neither of these two clowns is as smart as Dick or Jane either in that movie or in the kids' books.Perry is Chris Anderson a bythebook cop who meets wacky wild wacked biker babe Pam Judd in a bar. He's instantly smitten she's obviously unstable. It's true love at first sight at least from his standpoint. Eventually Pam comes around and they get married. But as I've already noted twice in this paragraph she has some mental issues. Whether it's hiding from Chris' parents when they come to visit or threatening to kill herself with one of Chris' many firearms Pam clearly needs some kind of help. Even rehab provoked by habitual tardiness to the research lab ! that employs her isn't the cure.We know within five minutes of the movie's start that this won't end well for either Chris or Pam as they're in the process of being caught by the FBI after a robbery. The rest of the story is told in flashback so the focus is really on how the pair got to the point of robbing banks and successfully.Neither of the leads stands out here. Perry is almost unrecognizable sporting a standardissue cop mustache and his character is alternately clever and stupid. Chris sticks by his dotty wife even when it's clear her actions are having a severely detrimental effect on his work family and friends. Judd fares a little better but not much. Judd is eye candy that can actually act and she does an acceptable job with a complex character. Still and all Pam is so far around the bend that it's hard to relate to her. Sure being unpredictable is generally a good trait for a character to have but if there's not even a passing nod to coherence then it's all for naught. You may as well have Pam twirling a hula hoop with her neck while dressed as a pirate for all the sense her character seems to have.Not much to see here just a flat toneless story of two unlucky saps who frankly got what they had coming anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "Normal Life starts out with great promise with a great burst of energy right at the start. But that energy fizzles out very quickly and what we are left with is a rather bad movie. The film follows a husband and wife who happen to rob banks for a living. The movie begins with their last ultimately failed robbery. We see the husband arrested and the wife lead police on a highspeed chase as she attempts to get away. And then we go back in time back to the beginning to see how these two illfated lovers met and what brought them to the rather unfortunate situation we have just seen. Turns out the husband Chris as played by Luke Perry is a former cop. And the wife Pam as played by Ashley Judd is completely and utterly nuts. A whole team of psychiatrists couldn't help this girl. But Chris thinks he can and he'll do anything to make her happy. Suffice to say their relationship doesn't quite work out as he envisioned. A happily married couple they are not.Eventually Chris loses his job as a cop and starts robbing banks. When Pam discovers what he is doing she is rather excited and suddenly much more enamored with her husband than she had been. And she wants in on the action. So they start robbing banks together and eventually we end up back where we started at the film's beginning. Back where it seemed the film had some promise. But Normal Life never lives up to that promise. It's terribly scripted. Much of the dialogue is utterly ridiculous. The acting leaves much to be desired most notably with Perry going over the top again and again in his attempts to convey anger and frustration. He's constantly overemoting and at times it's so laughable it's hard for the viewer to stifle a chuckle. Which is a problem because this is not meant to be a comedy.The seemingly endless confrontations and arguments between Chris and Pam become rather monotonous after a while. It's just the same thing over and over again. Every few minutes the two leads have a fight about something. It's like clockwork. It's also exceedingly dull. The story never moves along. We just spend the whole time watching these two people bicker and watching Pam have one psychotic episode after another. OK their relationship isn't quite working out we get it. Move along please. It's a frustrating movie to watch because it started with such promise and then just does not work at all. You get the feeling it should have been a lot better than it is. As it is it's a rather tedious movie.".

The troupe reformed found patronage and went on the road for thirteen years performing all over France.

The only other film remotely comparable is Carne's Children of Paradise which unlike Mnouchkine's Moliere subordinates its portrayal of the theater world to the romantic plot.

	schema:headline " ... or a splendid biography";
	schema:reviewBody "Molire is one of the greatest French writers of all time so it was almost inevitable that the cinema takes an interest in the man by devoting him a movie. It's Ariane Mouchkine who made this biography she's a woman of the theatre and the manager of the theatre company the Theatre of the Sun. However her movie isn't a filmed stage production because she introduces a lot of life and movements in her making. Moreover there isn't one sole scenerie but a thousand various sceneries! In another hand the performance of the actors isn't theatrical except of course when they're on stage. The movie you can guess it was expensive but it was worthwhile! An important budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the seventeenth century the costumes and sceneries are magnificient and the muddy streets of the towns are very realistic. The movie mainly focuses on the most important events of Molire's life his childhood his student years his beginnings in the theatre and his success in the court of Louis XIV in spite of Tartuffe's scandal . Some of these events will later inspire him for his plays. For example at the beginning of the movie Molire's mother dies of a fatal disease and the doctors are powerless to heal her. More serious they don't hesitate in feasting and eating in Molire's house. This last one understood that doctors are only profiteer charlatans and that medicine is far from being efficient. He'll ridiculise them later in some of his plays. Besides it's not only Molire's character who interests Mouchkine but  all an era the seventeenth century with all its miseries its grandeurs and its contradictions. Nevertheless the end of the movie is a bit disappointing. Molire's life after 1666 and until 1673 date of his death isn't clearly made. It's during this era that he knew his hour of glory by writing unforgettable plays despite his disease  he suffered from tuberculosis . It would have been interesting to see him writing and performing these plays on stage. At last Philippe Caubre is an excellent Molire and in the end in spite of its length Molire is simply a beautiful movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Molire is one of the greatest French writers of all time so it was almost inevitable that the cinema takes an interest in the man by devoting him a movie. It's Ariane Mouchkine who made this biography she's a woman of the theatre and the manager of the theatre company the Theatre of the Sun. However her movie isn't a filmed stage production because she introduces a lot of life and movements in her making. Moreover there isn't one sole scenerie but a thousand various sceneries! In another hand the performance of the actors isn't theatrical except of course when they're on stage. The movie you can guess it was expensive but it was worthwhile! An important budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the seventeenth century the costumes and sceneries are magnificient and the muddy streets of the towns are very realistic. The movie mainly focuses on the most important events of Molire's life his childhood his student years his beginnings in the theatre and his success in the court of Louis XIV in spite of Tartuffe's scandal . Some of these events will later inspire him for his plays. For example at the beginning of the movie Molire's mother dies of a fatal disease and the doctors are powerless to heal her. More serious they don't hesitate in feasting and eating in Molire's house. This last one understood that doctors are only profiteer charlatans and that medicine is far from being efficient. He'll ridiculise them later in some of his plays. Besides it's not only Molire's character who interests Mouchkine but  all an era the seventeenth century with all its miseries its grandeurs and its contradictions. Nevertheless the end of the movie is a bit disappointing. Molire's life after 1666 and until 1673 date of his death isn't clearly made. It's during this era that he knew his hour of glory by writing unforgettable plays despite his disease  he suffered from tuberculosis .

Also a very painstaking reconstruction of 17th century France. The humanity of a full life an engaging storyline excellent sets and cinematography  its all there.We recently had the pleasure of Ariane Mnouchkine's Theatre Du Soliel staging a production of Le Dernier Caravanserail here in Melbourne. 7 hours long. That was truly amazing as well. They were selling copies of the Moliere DVD at this show so I bought a copy there. It contains the 244 minute theatrical release of the film not the 300 minute TV version in French with English Italian German and Spanish subtitles. The digital transfer quality is very good the soundtrack is Dolby Digital mono and wide screen 16 x 9 format. Region 2 only.There is also a 46 min interview with Ariane done very recently in which she talks extensively about the struggle in making the film the reaction at Cannes how she structured the story and the ideas behind the death scene amongst others. Great stuff!I would recommend that any fans of this film make every effort to get this DVD probably French Amazon or Ebay. For others it is a shining light in French cinema history and well worth tracking down.".

The six or seven other people I know who have seen Moliere would very likely agree with these thoughts. I would encourage any of you who have seen the film and agree with these thoughts to express your feelings on this site. Thank you.";

Was unlike any other film I'd seen whether on TV or the big screen. I'm not surprised to see here on IMDb that it won an award in France for its cinematography. The visuals were AMAZING like a giant colorful dream. The two scenes I remember after all these years are 1 when some people are traveling across the French countryside and are shown from a distance  I remember at that moment thinking oh my GOD this film is incredible!! and 2 the final scene with Moliere being chased or chasing someone ? down some circular stairs ... I think they slowed the film at that point and you just saw his haunting face and it seems as if he was injured maybe mortally at that point which spelled the end for him. But he was still young. I REALLY really want to see this film again but hadn't been able to find it so far. Based on these comments I think I will try blockbuster.com again. Perhaps it would be fun to compare the '78 film with the 2007 version!".

Brigitte Helm METROPOLIS here in one of her last screenroles plays the femme fatale. The film tells the story of two scientist who have discovered a way to make gold from lead. Its achieved by using radioactivity. The experiment gets sabotaged by an unscrupulous tycoon who likes to cash in on this discovery. One of the scientists Friedrich Kayssler dies when the lab explodes the other one Hans Albers after recovering from his injuries tries to find the saboteur.

There isn't much propaganda in this particular film although the villain is a Brit. The British in general aren't depicted as terrible except for the villain. Hans Albers stars as a scientist who along with his partner has nearly perfected atomic alchemy the ability to turn lead into gold. Their experiment goes suspiciously wrong and Albers ends up barely alive. His partner isn't as lucky. After Albers recovers a British billionaire Michael Bohnen offers him the opportunity to repeat the experiment in England and Albers immediately suspects him of involvement in the original accident. In England he meets and nearly falls in love with Bohnen's daughter Metropolis' Brigitte Helm which distracts him from his own German wife Lien Deyers. This is more a slow burning drama than hard scifi but there are big electrical Frankensteinesque machines Frankenstein having already been made obviously. It's a decent film with a very good lead performance some good cinematography and a good climax. Helm is probably the main point of interest for many and it is nice to hear her speak. She's probably in it less than ten minutes though.".

But the propaganda ministry was not so refined yet in terms of what German films had to look like so you can easily use this film as an example of a movie from Nazi Germany that does not try to push a certain ideology on people. The director is Karl Hartl and the writer is Rolf E. Vanloo and both have worked on a handful other known films from the 1920s and 1930s in Germany. But the star here is of course Hans Albers who plays the big lead character a scientist who is disappointed with evil forces killing his mentor after he apparently found a way to turn lead into gold. A tragic story really but if you know a bit about that era in terms of filmmaking you will also know that in contrast to earlier German horror film most film around that time managed to reach a happy end somehow and this one here is no exception. It is a sound film a new technology that became a lot more frequent and Albers was one of the earliest German sound film stars. Brigitte Helm one of Germany's biggest silent film stars also appears in this 100minute movie. All in all there are some good moments here and Albers definitely shows why he is such a great star but storywise this was only enough for a 60minute film max. There were many uninteresting scenes and the film dragged on several occasions. That's why I give it a thumbs down. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Liebe Bleibt Und Ewig Bleibt Das Lied... love and the song remain forever  with an exceptionally sentimental song by Zarah Leander we get the opening sequence of the movie made by the Ufa star's favorite director Carl Froelich. Thanks to great collaboration of Universum Film and Black Hill Pictures we can admire the visuals of the movie with elaborate sets and dazzling costumes. But the assumption that ES WAR EINE RAUSCHENDE BALLNACHT the title misleadingly translated into It was a gay ballnight was another purely Zarah Leander vehicle soon proves to be wrong. It is not the Zarah Leander film like DER WEG INS FREIE for instance. Why? Froelich's film which bears significance to many Russian theme movies is an artistic communication with the viewers of the time a very specific period in Germany when Nazi propaganda also imposed certain demands on the artistic visions. The artistic communication is manifested in three concepts atmospheric influence protagonist's interpretation and portrayal of two women.ATMOSPHERIC INFLUENCE expressed in sets stunning cinematography by Franz Weihmyr enchanting costumes by Herbert Ploberger and music by...TschaikovskyLeander It seems quite obvious that most of the movies of the period had a strong impact on viewers through visuals. Everything was supposed to look beautiful awesome even in order to delude the perceptions of its audiences. In that aspect the movie appears to represent the purest concept of what atmospheric influence meant. Heavily relying upon German Expressionism and the modern trends of the time as well as some of the individual visions of the director it serves that purpose powerfully. Therefore you can see dreamlike wardrobe elaborate sets little details. Music as in most films about composers in that case it is Tschaikovsky constitutes a backdrop character of the movie leads us into the musicality of the characters controls the changeable feelings corresponds to various emotional states. In that case however we can divide it into the original pieces by the composer in particular 4TH SYMPHONY and the songs sung by Zarah Leander in particular the much appraised Nur Nicht Aus Liebe Weinen  All but no tears for love. But Zarah Leander's songs like in most of her other performances exceptionally handled under the director of Carl Froelich mean something in constant relation to the protagonist of the movie.PROTAGONIST'S INTERPRETATION Played by Hans Stuewe based upon Geza Von Cziffra's novel and inspired considerably by Jean Victor and Georg Wittuhn's story it is more the 'fictitious' Tschaikovsky of cinematic vision than the faithful portrayal of the composer's personality. The movie cannot be categorized as a biopic whatsoever. And not at all do I mean to refer to the aspect of sexuality indeed stressing the homosexuality of the composer would miss the point in the context of a movie made in the 1930s but foremost to the depiction of his passions. The passions of any composer are foremost revealed in his masterpieces in his works. Here however 'WORK' is an advice of Professor Otto Hunsinger Leo Slezak as a cure for love disappointment. What of these passions would speak to the minds of the viewers of the time if not a tragic love story a tearjerker that made many women use too many handkerchiefs. In that respect Mr Stuewe does something extraordinary. With gentleness perhaps too much for an artist he recalls the musicality and moods of Paul Henreid in a movie about Schumann THE SONG OF LOVE with Katherine Hepburn or a much appraised DECEPTION with Bette Davis. But what stands behind all this is simply the fact that he is a male character and...doomed to be shadowed by...women. The women competing for him. Something very innovative at the time. He is a sort of the Vronsky of ANNA KARENINA an object of female feelings a sweet motive of their sighs.TWO WOMEN Perhaps we are more educated as viewers who see the movie with today's experience. Two women of the film however arouse an almost never ending awe of inner freedom tragic dramatizer and a way towards emancipation Marika Roekk the famous dancer who made an international career and delivers some perfect moments in the movie in the role of Natassja Petrowna and obviously Zarah Leander in the role of Katherina. While the former one surprises us with a few moments and particular skills delivered before the camera the latter one has some predictable moments delivers some predictable lines as an unhappy wife of a monstrous man Michael Iwanowitsch Murakin Aribert Waescher  again echoing classic literature by Tolstoy. Nevertheless both appear to be charming portrayals the women in Tschaikovsky's life fictitious or real no one cares but given some very authentic bases and supplied with absorbing feelings. They add the purely emotional resonance to the whole story and in their rivalry provide unforgettable tensions. That also pushed some limits of moral acceptability in social contexts among viewers for sure. All however leads to the inevitable finale a tragic tearjerker.All things considered the movie is a nice looking fairy tale which after all may supply some sensitive viewers with a flair for the special period in German cinema when beauty on the screen had its motives and screen art served its purpose. Highly worth seeing!".

What of these passions would speak to the minds of the viewers of the time if not a tragic love story a tearjerker that made many women use too many handkerchiefs. In that respect Mr Stuewe does something extraordinary. With gentleness perhaps too much for an artist he recalls the musicality and moods of Paul Henreid in a movie about Schumann THE SONG OF LOVE with Katherine Hepburn or a much appraised DECEPTION with Bette Davis. But what stands behind all this is simply the fact that he is a male character and...doomed to be shadowed by...women. The women competing for him. Something very innovative at the time. He is a sort of the Vronsky of ANNA KARENINA an object of female feelings a sweet motive of their sighs.TWO WOMEN Perhaps we are more educated as viewers who see the movie with today's experience. Two women of the film however arouse an almost never ending awe of inner freedom tragic dramatizer and a way towards emancipation Marika Roekk the famous dancer who made an international career and delivers some perfect moments in the movie in the role of Natassja Petrowna and obviously Zarah Leander in the role of Katherina. While the former one surprises us with a few moments and particular skills delivered before the camera the latter one has some predictable moments delivers some predictable lines as an unhappy wife of a monstrous man Michael Iwanowitsch Murakin Aribert Waescher  again echoing classic literature by Tolstoy. Nevertheless both appear to be charming portrayals the women in Tschaikovsky's life fictitious or real no one cares but given some very authentic bases and supplied with absorbing feelings. They add the purely emotional resonance to the whole story and in their rivalry provide unforgettable tensions. That also pushed some limits of moral acceptability in social contexts among viewers for sure. All however leads to the inevitable finale a tragic tearjerker.All things considered the movie is a nice looking fairy tale which after all may supply some sensitive viewers with a flair for the special period in German cinema when beauty on the screen had its motives and screen art served its purpose. Highly worth seeing!";

A some what fictitious retelling of part of the life of Tchaikowsky. It tells of a factitious heterosexual version of him It was not only the first time Marika Rokk not only was in a Zara Leander picture but she's not the lead.It was also the first time she was in straight laced drama. In most of her feature it was mainly comedy except for Kora Terry. Shes having trouble adjusting to it it shows in her eye's. It got me a little confused cause i kept waiting for her to pull a prank. Ironicly it looks like she almost forgets what type of movie shes in then she catches herself. This is the reason I gave it 9 instead of a 10. The plot Tchaikowsky's ex wife Katrina played by Zara  who's now married to Michael I Murakinplayed by Aribert Wascher has gone to a ball where he's at. They are both still in love with each other but he's engaged to dancer Nastassia played by Marika Rokk . She is going to demonstrate a ballet dance at the ball.Tchaikowsky  played by Hans Stuw Is then not to sure that he loves Nastassia. Well after that they began to get together again Katrinas husband Michael gets suspicious. In one scene Iwan Gykow  who's fond of Nastassia played by Paul Dahlke I think starts having an argument with Peter claiming that he's falling back to his ex wife . He denies this then marries Nastassia but does not fulfill the wedding night because of his love for Katrina. This could be a cover up to show peters gay side without it being seen by Goebles office. Frustrated she goes out to drink and dances.Well he's on a concert tour one of his helpers get sick . He succumbs to the same illness and dies during one of his concerts and Katrina is at his side.

	schema:headline " Umberto Lenzi's finest WW2 movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Italian director Umberto Lenzi who went on to bring audiences across the globe epic schlock in The Greatest Battle and incredibly cheap thrills in Bridge to Hell begins his career in the war genre with a slambang suspense piece which proves to be undoubtedly one of the best war movies to come out of Italy in the 1960s.The story is fresh and original and presented with unique twists from beginning to end. Five German soldiers are parachuted into North Africa and will trek to Casablanca to assassinate a conference of Churchill Roosevelt and DeGaulle.Lenzi's film is a true example of characterdriven drama at its best. Ken Clark is Captain Schoeller leader of the unit and he's never less than totally convincing as a diehard advocate of Hitler and Nazism. Horst Frank Thunder from the West plays Lt. Wolf with gusto and conviction. Wolf's mother is American and his best friend is a Jew so he and Schoeller don't see eyetoeye. He and Schoeller clash over opposing ideals several times. Despite their dissension both are dedicated soldiers who have a job to get done and grudgingly work together to accomplish the mission. Lenzi never strays far from this central conflict of ideals always keeping his message clearly in focus.The supporting cast of familiar European actors is excellent allaround. Carlo Hintermann Hardy Reychelt and Howard Ross round out the German team. Hintermann makes the most of his little role as a tough dedicated German Sergeant a career soldier who'll do what he's told when he's told no questions asked. Jeanne Valerie and Fabienne Dali are two female characters whose motives are never clearly defined until the film's third act  and that's when you realize whose side each is really on. Gianni Rizzo has a few brief scenes as a French informer working with the Germans and gets to do blast away at American soldiers with a machinegun in one of the film's nailbiting action scenes. Be sure to watch for Tom Felleghy The Greatest Battle John Stacy Battle of the Commandos and Franco Fantasia Adios Sabata in small yet key roles as Allied officers.Though the actionpacked footage is scant what's here is brilliantly edited and directed. The third act is tense and fastpaced as the German heroes dodge bullets across rooftops and duck through alleyways as American MPs are in hot pursuit. The final infiltration of Churchill's banqueting hall is excellently set up with frustratingly deliberate pacing which will leave you on the edge of your seat. This climax ends abruptly with a great surprise causing your jaw to drop as you wonder What just happened? Two aspects of filmmaking that Lenzi and his crew seem to emphasize are the sets and landscapes. There is not one shot in this movie that looks out of place. When the German officers talk in headquarters the interior looks like an office in a German headquarters. The film is set in the desert and there are constant wide shots as actors speak and walk which reveal that these scenes were actually shot in the vast Egyptian sand dunes. The oasis of Kuffran looks especially bustling and the essence of the atmosphere of Casablanca during wartime is superbly captured. During this time period many directors fell back on shabby interiors and shot in outdoor locations which looked completely wrong. For example Commando Attack also shot in 1967 was lensed in Spain and exteriors were passed off as southern France yet it's clearly visible the action was not occurring in the French countryside.Finally there are a number of other little details which contribute to this film's success fine editing and camerawork give this movie a very professional look and feel it always looks professional. Lenzi is just starting to develop his style and his signature closeups are used in moderation but mean all the more when they are used. There are some great crane shots and wide shots used to establish the scope of the sets most notably in the scenes set in Casablanca.This is definitely a great film with some strongly developed internal conflicts and fleshedout characters. The quality of Lenzi's films would degenerate as the years passed but Desert Commando is easily one of the best war films to come out of 1967 ranking right up there with The Dirty Dozen.710".

Usually these moments are imposed on the story by showing atrocities like German massacres of civilians CHURCHILL'S LEOPARDS or the execution of the movie's leading lady FIVE FOR HELL.

DESERT COMMANDOS was way ahead of it's time and there may be a lesson in here for those of us who have perhaps forgotten what war is really all about which is breaking things and killing people. Being ruthless and unapologetic may seem cruel or barbaric but it can often result in the only thing good about war which is it's ending.810 Look for this on cheapo box set called 50 ACTION CLASSICS and on a double movie DVD you can sometime find at the dollar stores.

	schema:headline " A different kind of war movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Five Nazi commandos parachute into the Sahara and must make their way to Casablanca. Their mission the assassination of Roosevelt Chruchill and Stalin. Along the way the five face not only possible discovery by the British and American troops but as they are dressed as British soldiers they also face the real possibility of being killed by German troops.Before watching Desert Commandos I had only seen some of Lenzi's thrillers  Seven Blood Stained Orchids being my favorite. Lenzi has always impressed me as a good story teller. Of his movies I've seen all tend to use a straight ahead narrative style. Unlike many of his Italian peers who are criticized for being all style and no substance I don't find that to be the case with Lenzi.I enjoyed seeing a WWII drama told from such a different perspective. Because Lenzi presents the Nazi soldiers as normal guys who just happen to be fighting for the other side it's easy to identify with their concerns and fears. The Nazis in Desert Commandos are more than the stern no emotion robots as presented in most American war movies. As impossible as it seems I actually found myself wanting to see these guys succeed. It makes for a very nice change of pace.My biggest problem with the movie is the pacing during the first half. Almost all of the scenes consist of the soldiers stumbling through the desert. A little more action like runins with British or German soldiers might have made for a much better movie. But once the commandos get near Casablanca things pick up. The ending is really fantastic.The copy of Desert Commandos I saw came on one of those double feature with something called Ransom Money 1 DVDs. While the transfer wasn't pristine it's not bad for 1. The transfer however was Pan and Scan. A lot of information was cut from the sides of all of the scenes. For example if you just looked at the title page before the movie starts you would think you were watching a movie called Desert ommando. The C and s were completely cut off the screen.".

Along the way the five face not only possible discovery by the British and American troops but as they are dressed as British soldiers they also face the real possibility of being killed by German troops.Before watching Desert Commandos I had only seen some of Lenzi's thrillers  Seven Blood Stained Orchids being my favorite. Lenzi has always impressed me as a good story teller. Of his movies I've seen all tend to use a straight ahead narrative style. Unlike many of his Italian peers who are criticized for being all style and no substance I don't find that to be the case with Lenzi.I enjoyed seeing a WWII drama told from such a different perspective.

The film serves much as a vehicle for this character to develop. In fact even the other 3 Germans develop some character in their limited lines. While serving as an action desert film it also gives some good characters. We probably would've liked to see more of them.And just about everything that happens plot twists and characters who die go totally against the grain for the late 1960s and early 1970s.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to be honest and say that I don't generally have much interest in war films and thus my only reason for bothering with this film was due to the fact that it's directed by one of my favourite horror directors the great Umberto Lenzi. Like most directors that made films in Italy during the sixties seventies and eighties Lenzi dipped his hand in many different genres and while he was always best at Polizi flicks and Giallo in spite of being most famous for blood splattered cannibal and zombie films Lenzi was clearly talented enough to make films outside of his 'comfort zone' and for a cheap World War 2 thriller Desert Commandos is actually not too bad. The film takes place somewhere towards the end of World War 2 and focuses on a group of German commandos who parachute into the desert with a special mission. The group dressed as British soldiers must make their way to a secret meeting that is taking place between the allied 'Big three'  Churchill Roosevelt and Stalin  and eliminate the powerful trio.The plot is fairly preposterous and obviously a work of fiction. As mentioned I'm not a fan of war films in general so I haven't seen many so I don't have a lot to compare this film to. Umberto Lenzi was obviously not too concerned with reality and I found it odd how the group of fascist racist Nazi's easily found help from an Arab woman in the desert. The film is different to most western war films in that our 'heroes' are actually German and the British and American troops are the antagonists. The first two thirds of the film are fairly interesting but never truly fascinating as all we really have to go on is the interaction between the various members of the group and as you can probably imagine considering the type of film that this is none of them are particularly interesting. Still there's a fair few action scenes to keep the action ticking over. The film tries to become a bit deeper in the final third and while this doesn't really come off the final scenes are better than what went before it. I wouldn't really recommend this film as I'm sure there are better war films out there but on the other hand I'm sure there's worse too.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a World War II actioner this fairly passes muster but I found it difficult to get into because the protagonists were German soldiers and I'm not too keen on Nazis taking advantage of the Allies. Reverse the scenario and I'd probably rate it a notch higher. Still the film has a way of holding one's interest considering the mission  five German soldiers parachute into the Sahara make their way to Casablanca and attempt to assassinate Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin. Any single one of them would have been a formidable enough target so going for a triple header sounded to me to be way beyond fiction.Having seen hundreds of American Westerns I got a kick out of the chase in the desert on camel back instead of horses. One puzzler before that occurred when four of the German soldiers each took off in a different direction on the command of Captain Scholler Ken Clark and they all wound up at the same spot. How does that work? Well it appears there's a fan base for these Italian war films judging by the other reviews here some of which are quite scholarly. I casually came across this picture as part of the Mill Creek Mystery Collection box set of two hundred fifty films and in what constitutes an interesting reverse lottery of sorts this is the last one in the set I've gotten around to seeing today which also means I've completed a personal mission of reviewing each of the movies in the set on IMDb. Whew!".

	onyx:emotionText "As a World War II actioner this fairly passes muster but I found it difficult to get into because the protagonists were German soldiers and I'm not too keen on Nazis taking advantage of the Allies. Reverse the scenario and I'd probably rate it a notch higher. Still the film has a way of holding one's interest considering the mission  five German soldiers parachute into the Sahara make their way to Casablanca and attempt to assassinate Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin. Any single one of them would have been a formidable enough target so going for a triple header sounded to me to be way beyond fiction.Having seen hundreds of American Westerns I got a kick out of the chase in the desert on camel back instead of horses. One puzzler before that occurred when four of the German soldiers each took off in a different direction on the command of Captain Scholler Ken Clark and they all wound up at the same spot. How does that work? Well it appears there's a fan base for these Italian war films judging by the other reviews here some of which are quite scholarly. I casually came across this picture as part of the Mill Creek Mystery Collection box set of two hundred fifty films and in what constitutes an interesting reverse lottery of sorts this is the last one in the set I've gotten around to seeing today which also means I've completed a personal mission of reviewing each of the movies in the set on IMDb. Whew!";

The plotWith the hope of winning the second World War starting to fade awayHitler is thrilled to learn that a secret meeting has been set up to take place in a few days time at Casablancawhere three of the worlds most powerful leaders are going to meet up in the hope of reaching a decision over how they can finally defeat the Nazi's.Feeling the this might be his one and only chance to destroy the residence for everHitler orders for a small group of his very best Nazi's to be assembled so that they can carry out a mission to kill all three world leaders in one go.With being given only limited info of their missionthe group of five Nazi's are parachuted into North Africa so that they can make their way to Casablanca incognito.Since none of them have ever experienced the conditions of the desert beforeeach of them seriously starts to struggle in handling this new locationas some of the soldiers brains almost start to melt.Luckally for the groupthey by chance meet a woman who kindly offers to be their guide and show them the way to Casablanca.Although the soldiers main leader Capt.

View on the filmSince having been amazed by Lenzi's whippans and brilliant scatter shot directing in the past my first expectations were that I was about to see a War film filled with lightning fastenergetic action.Surprisinglywhilst writerdirector Lenzi does show some of that style for this fantasy War time thriller yarn with a terrific long scene that involves an enemy aeroplane looking down on the group of Nazi's riding on camels and a scene where the brains of the Nazi's also begin to suffer as they attempt to get a grip on the intense heat being the two strongestmost eyecatching moments in the film.For the rest of the movie Umberto disappointingly goes for a much more leisurely pacethat despite the funclean cut performance of lead actor Ken Clark and the wonderful performance by Jeanne Valerie ends up making the film feel very muddled and mundaneas the middle section of the film feels far longer than it is due to the thriller part of the plot having almost disappearedand the rest of the story just plodding alonguntil almost near the end where Lenzi gives the film a nice little twist. Final view on the filmA very easy to watch War Thrillerthat is disappointingly mundane and only able to show Lenzi's stylish directing in the films first half.".

I got it part of the Mill Creek 50 Combat Classics which also had on it the Lee Van Cleef movie Commandos and both are similar that besides being Italian WW2 Africa campaign movies they both kind of disappoint. Both movies take us on a long long long road that is entirely too long to get to its final destination. The ending for this one reminded me of an ethnic joke about a circular firing squad. It had some good promise and I wasn't expecting much but hoped it would be decent I was wrong. Check out The Eagle Has Landed for a similar plot with some decent acting and budget or if your looking for desert commando stuff try Play Dirty or Tobruk neither is perfect but both are a lot more exciting then this stuff and the print quality is bound to be much better to watch then this public domain throw away. I am being generous giving this a 5 but if your an Italian made war film fan that's about what it rates in my book. Less if your just a war film fan.".
