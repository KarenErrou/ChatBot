	schema:reviewBody "You could be happy here. We could grow up together. This epigraph from ET at the start of this quirky New Zealand comedy serves as a perfect introduction to the themes and central plot of Boy.Writerdirector and former standup comedian Taika Waititi Eagle Vs Shark The Flight Of The Conchords etc has drawn upon his own experiences growing up in new Zealand in the 1980's to shape this poignant and quirky coming of age tale. Boy deals with themes of family fatherhood responsibility the innocence and imagination of childhood that is lost when one grows up hero worship and the heartbreaking loss of innocence. Waititi further develops themes and ideas from his Oscar nominated short film Two Cars One Night and suffuses the material with subtle black humour quirky touches and plenty of his trade mark deadpan humour.New comer James Rolleston makes his film debut and has an appealing and natural presence as the 11yearold title character. Since the death of his mother Boy and his family live in the care of their elderly grandmother. But when she travels to Wellington for a few days to attend a funeral Boy is left in charge of his siblings. When we first meet Boy he is fantasizing about his absentee father whom he envisages in a variety of heroic roles. But the reality is vastly different. Alamein played by Waititi himself has been released from jail and returns home to the small dead end town of Waihau Bay. Dad turns out to be a drug addled loser a petty crook who has come home not to spend time with his children but to try and dig up some money he buried a couple of year earlier. Unfortunately he can't remember where he buried it and is forced to hang around for a few days. Boy tries to bond with his father but in the end he realizes that Alamein is a failure as a parent a father a man and a role model.Boy is a painfully personal film that deftly mixes black humour and sadness. The film is set in 1984 and Waititi also imbues the film with a strong sense of place and time particularly through Boy's obsession with Michael Jackson. Boy has becomes one of the most successful films released in New Zealand and its universal themes and quirky humour suggests that it could also have broad appeal in other territories.".

It was explored in depth and very well too and never gets nasty as some NZ movies can do but still wrings your heart out. The endpiece was stunning utilising the obsession with a teenage Michael Jackson and humour as only the NZ Maori do. I left the theatre with mixed feelings but since then I have felt buoyed up sorry and am remembering it fondly. Will definitely see it again and may add it to my small collection of NZ films. Others have mentioned Eagle and Shark and Secondhand Wedding but this is more historical and captures the era perfectly. Well done all  especially to all the actors under 20 we know the adults can act but these fellas will be worth watching out for in the future.".

The story is well documented by other users so I won't bore you with the details of that but for me the main talking point of this film is the exquisite performances of the two lead children. While James Rolleston as Boy has a very vocal part in the film his delivery range of emotions and expressions are so important to the film's success and he pulls this off with such ease and is such a joy to watch. His fragile brother Rocky played by Te Aho Aho EketoneWhitu turns in to be what I consider one of the best and most emotionally powerful performances from a child in any film I have seen. His role is largely speechlessthough he certainly has a share of words to deliver yet he is able to convey what his character is thinking and feeling through facial expressions and almost in a sense through his eyes. I cannot recommend this film enough we went to see it two days ago and I am still smiling from the memory of this great film. The incorporation of Michael Jackson tributes into the film could have been hard to pull off in some movies yet here Cohen blends these in to the mix with great effect in particular the final scene which simply has to seen to be fully appreciated. The comedy elements have universal appeal and are well dispersed throughout the film.Just go see it when you are able as simple as that. Brilliant...........".

Shot in a small town that is genuinely the town that the authoractor father actually grew up in. He spoke after our screening and it was a 30 kid school house which it still is.

	schema:reviewBody "The key word in Boy is potential. It's repeatedly spoken aloud by the title character James Rolleston an elevenyearold Maori living in Waihau Bay New Zealand in 1984. Initially he has no idea what it means. All the same he thinks he has plenty of it. From our perspective his circumstances suggest otherwise he lives a meager existence on a farm with his grandmother Nan Mavis Paenga his kid brother Rocky Te Aho Aho EketoneWhitu a pet goat named Leaf and several cousins. All he really has going for him is his love of Michael Jackson and memories of his father. Even then they aren't real memories. They're merely tall tales Boy has invented as a coping mechanism for his absence. In reality his father has been out of the picture for several years having been sent to prison for robbing the local gas station.When Nan goes off to Wellington to attend a funeral Boy is left in charge. This would be right around the start of the summer holiday at which point he first hears one of his teachers use the word potential and becomes fixated on it. Not long after three men drive up to Boy's home. One of them is his longlost father Alamein Taika Waititi also the film's writer and director. Boy is immediately taken by him. He has a cool black car. He has started his own gang called The Crazy Horses. True it currently only has three members but at least Alamein gets to wear a badass leather jacket with the logo on the back. He likes Michael Jackson too but he's an even bigger fan of Steven Spielberg's E.T. the ExtraTerrestrial and he will spend a great deal of time professing his admiration for E.T.'s magic healing touch.At this point Boy has looked up the word potential in the dictionary. All the fancy words used in the definition confuse him and yet he seems to get the general idea. With his father back in his life he believes he has finally found his potential To be exactly like him. Alamein eventually says that he doesn't wish to be addressed as Dad but as Shogun like a Japanese warrior. In response Boy wishes to be addressed as Little Shogun. The two will for a time come together as they dig holes in a nearby field looking for what Alamein calls buried treasure. We already know that in reality Alamein and his men are looking for the spot in which they buried the money they stole from the gas station. His problem is that he can't remember how many paces he went into the field nor the fencepost from which he started.What kind of potential does Alamein have? The audience is not made to see him in the same way as Boy  an aggrandized figure at the center of several amateur reenactments of Michael Jackson music videos. Instead he's made to be seen as an opportunist a buffoon a manipulator a marijuana smoker a hard drinker and generally someone who is dangerous and unreliable. Boy will eventually pick up on this forcing him to reassess his own potential. No matter what part of the world you're from this is called growing up. Simultaneously he will go through all the typical adolescent trials and tribulations including trying to impress the girl of his dreams RickyLee WaipukaRussell inflating his reputation by passing off the vacuum hose mark on his chest as a hickey and avoiding the local bully and his big brother. Alamein will occasionally offer advice in these areas even though he has no idea what he's doing or saying.Meanwhile Rocky is the subject of an absorbing yet oddly disconnected subplot in which he befriends a local drifter Boy has dubbed Weirdo Waihoroi Shortland who spends all his time crouched over as he looks for things in the dirt. We don't know if he's homeless mentally challenged both or neither. All we do know is that he's the only person willing to indulge Rocky in his belief that he possesses super powers  the ones bestowed by his mother as she died giving birth to him. There's a touching moment when he approaches his father puts his fingers on his forehead and apologizes for killing his mother. It's unclear whether or not Alamein blames Rocky for her death as he never treats Rocky any better or worse than Boy.Rocky is a source of frustration for Boy although there seems to be no reason for it apart from the convention that older brothers automatically hate their younger brothers. Perhaps it's the fact that Rocky sees the world differently namely as animated childhood doodles on sheets of collegeruled paper. Indeed he spends a lot of time drawing pictures mostly as his mother's gravesite. Does the word potential apply to him too? Surely it must apply to everyone. The message of Boy I believe is that we each possess positive and negative attributes and that the key to a successful life is finding the right balance. The film isn't so conventional as to show this happening with any of the characters we merely see the process of living from day to day and taking things as they come. As they say it's not the destination that's important but the journey. Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

The Boy does not spare the viewer when confronting these impacts but they are not thrown at the viewer like a massive headbutt they are only shown as the common factors of a life being led. As opposed to the movie's commentators I was particularly attracted to the father played by Tanka Waititi the boy of the story his son was virtually a canvas upon which Waititi painted his strange attempt at reality. I know I know film students will say it has all been done before his character is a cutout etc. etc. I've read it many times before but the fact remains that he and his gang of three are funny and his exploits used in the broadest sense of the word are funny.

Boy lives with his grandmother and his brother Rocky and many of his cousins on a poorfarm in New Zealand in the Bay of Plenty area and is a huge Michael Jackson fan. This is a movie about a boy that meets his real father and realization hits that his father is not as great as he had hoped. The movie brings in the hard facts that Boy's father is a criminal who returns to dig up a bag of money and has very little care for the boy. It is a coming of age movie and depicts real life drug and money issues but the main issue is absentee fathers.This movie started out with the title Choice and then The Volcano before acquiring its current catchy title. The New Zealand hit won 9 awards and received 8 nominations. Awards included Taika Waititi winning AFI Fest 2010 Audience Award Best International Feature Film and for the Sydney Film Festival 2010 Waititi also won Best Feature Film Audience Award.I think most people will understand and enjoy this movie thanks to a drastic decline in bad fathers in the world.".

Boy James Rolleston Rocky Te Aho Aho EketoneWhitu and Dynasty Moerangi Tihore are now being brought up by their grandmother as their mother died during childbirth to Rocky and their father Alamein perfectly portrayed by director  writer Taika Waititi is doing jail time. Creating fables about his father exwar hero living the high life and so on Boy as the oldest has been given adult tasks of fending for his younger kin despite being only 12 years old. Despite having 'potential' he wastes away his time up to mischief with his peers conveying dreamlike stories about his father to his pet goat Leaf as a getaway from the load of responsibility. The situation changes when Alamein returns to them not quite a fatherly figure but nonetheless fulfilling wants of his sons especially Boy. Strong masculine with wicked Michael Jackson moves Boy becomes enticed with emulating his father. Alamein on the other hand has only returned to town to dig up a stash he buried before being incarcerated but slowly grows attached to his flesh and blood in ways he doesn't want to admit to himself.Despite the above synopsis Boy is nowhere as dramatically morose as the subject matter would suggest. Instead it is layered with wry at times brilliant humour which manages to pack both an emotional and comedic wallop of epic proportions. Fronted by three charismatic performances of the father and his two sons comes off an instant classic which despite dealing with issues similar to that of Once Were Warriors has an entirely different take. Comedy and drama intermingle seamlessly delivering one of the most enjoyable movies in memory whilst delivering a sombre portrayal of the Maori community not quite as proud and victorious as some would want. Within the confines of a comingofage story lies a heartfelt story with immense impact. The ultimate victor is Taika Waititi arguably now hot property and one of the most promising actors  directors  screenwriters in the world who deserves all the praise and the success afforded to him by this movie.And whatever you do don't turn off the movie before the end credits or you miss out on the absolutely epic Haka Thriller!".

I rarely review movies but I just couldn't stand that a film of this caliber had so little love. I think the reason for this is that it has been marketed as something quintessentially New Zealander. Which is absolutely true. And completely irrelevant to how much you will enjoy this film.Some things are universal and as Boy teaches us two of those things are Michael Jackson and that worldshattering humiliation that seems to haunt our adolescence.Boy is a an unremarkable kid growing up in an even more unremarkable world. Having lost his mother during the birth of his younger brother Rocky he's looked after by his Nan and is often responsible for Rocky and his younger cousins. His absent father is a samurai warrior champion boxer and deep sea treasure hunter. When this godamongmen finally shows up just after Boy's grandmother is called away reality and fantasy collide.The funny moments are more hilarious than any outandout comedy I can remember and while Boy has moments of drama they are all played with a subtle hand and carried out believably by the actors who I'd never heard of before. It's a comingofage film and very male orientated. There are sequences so beautiful and fantastical you only see them in these pieces crafted through a haze of loving nostalgia. Both Boy and his father seem painfully real. They're hoping but afraid to hope and covering it in a thin veneer of masculine bravado. The film asks all those typical questions of the genre about what it means to be a man in a world where the men are rarely rolemodel material.What could be a dank gritty piece about poverty and deadbeat dads is transformed through Boy's dreams and the sketches from Rocky a superhero in the making who sees more than anyone and says far less.The accents are pretty thick I'm an Aussie from a thickaccented region and still missed a word or two but if you can make it through that I can't imagine an audience that wouldn't enjoy this film. Oh and please please watch the final scene and appreciate it for exactly what it is. I know people have complained that it was meaningless and didn't tie anything up but who cares? A hakaflavoured ode to Thriller is just as wonderful and ridiculous as you'd imagine. But if the scene has to mean anything and I doubt it does it would be that dreams beat reality every damn time!".

The eleven year old Boy played by James Rollestonlives with his brother Rocky and three Cousins. They are cared for by an Aunt whom we never see because their Mother is dead and their Father is 'away'. The family is a selfsustaining little unit and although they get by it is clear they are on the breadline. Boy is a bright happy innocent child who idolizes Michael Jackson and is over the moon when he finally gets to meet his Father. When his Aunt goes away Boy must run the household with the help of his young brother and cousins. Initially things run relatively smoothly but that all changes when out of the blue the brothers' Father shows up with the intention of digging up a cache of money he buried years ago. Boy is spellbound by this Father he never knewand idolizes his every move. As Alamein becomes more comfortable around his sons and the house it is clear he is not particularly interested inor capable oftaking on the responsibility of child care. Much of his time is spent horsing around with his mates drinking beer smoking weed puffing up his ego and desperately seeking sources of money. Boy who was previously picked on at school and ignored by the girl he fancied is now bursting with pride as he shows off his Father to the folks of the small town. Boy's attempts at emulating his Father are almost painful to watch but as the treasure hunt goes on and on Alamein's selfabsorption petulance angerand abuse of alcohol and drugs initiates a dramatic shift in the dynamic between Father and Son. The beauty of this film is its simplicity outstanding acting and the combination of matteroffactness radiant joy and palpable sorrow expressed by Boy as he deals with the radical changes that befall his family life.

Watiti shows his prowess as a director and writer through extremely effective cinematography and hilarious but subtle script. The acting and score for this film are almost perfect.

It's as if the writers scribbled the script in one night sorry Neil and Tom.The only shining scene is the pig scene wonderfully performed by Mark Sands.Not anywhere near the class of Get Real and Like It Is yet worth a watch if it ever comes on television which i doubt.I think i may put the video on my bookshelf and not in a cardboard box in the attic like last time.".

It's as if the writers scribbled the script in one night sorry Neil and Tom.The only shining scene is the pig scene wonderfully performed by Mark Sands.Not anywhere near the class of Get Real and Like It Is yet worth a watch if it ever comes on television which i doubt.I think i may put the video on my bookshelf and not in a cardboard box in the attic like last time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hmm the lead characters are like Barbie and Ken. How much more ridiculous can it get?! Hollywood's obsessive love affair with making remakes of successful Asian horror films has given many chilling treats like 'The Ring' and 'The Grudge'. But nowadays more and more disappointing and mediocre films are being made. Unfortunately 'Shutter' is one of the more disappointing ones I have seen. This film didn't scare me didn't hold my interest for the most part save the scenes after the false climax. Few days back I had defended 'One Missed Call' actually that was more creepy than this but now I will not take this film's side. Directed by Masayuki Ochai this is a remake of a Japanese and Thai film. Know how much parents think before showing their young ones a horror film? Don't think about it on this one just let them watch it. They will have seen so many photos on Tshirts more scarier than the ghostly elements in this movie even they will probably get bored. I have even forgot that ghost girl's name! Ben Joshua Jackson and Jane Rachael Taylor are newlyweds who excitedly head to Tokyo where Ben has a prestigious fashion photography assignment. However that excitement soon turns to dread as the couple is haunted by the ghost of a girl who appears in all of their photographs and Jane had actually crashed her car into this spirit girl some time back. Jane is curious as to who the girl might be and her bizarre attachment to them but Ben is more cynical at the beginning. Jane discovers some shattering truths that can change her life forever.This was coming on TV the other day and the opening sequence looked cool so I watched it. It has some formulic horror genre elements a Japanese ghost girl who is vengeful black haired and possibly anorexic!! a subdued color setting and set design which imitates The Ring a very happy couple. I was just waiting for the spirit to seek revenge and right all the wrongs inflicted upon her. Now that would be a good thing for me if not for the laborious screenplay which doesn't take the plot forward and has no clever twists. Even little children won't be scared by this film it was more like a drama to me. Performances are bland throughout except for Jane but she didn't have any other work other than clicking photographs. What other things did she do? Never explained but Rachael did try her best and was pushing herself I will give her credit for that. If the director had just focused on her rather than Joshua who still hasn't evolved from his Dawson Creek I like that TV show by the way level of acting this would have been better. His friends are simply awful they are caricatures and highly superficial. In terms of content originality characterization or emotional journey this film didn't give me anything at least it should have given me some chills. So don't waste your time on 'Shutter' instead go and see 'The Ring' again.310".

Ben's friends raping Megumi to get her out of his life is so far out there that the person who wrote it needs help from a competent therapist or they should at least make an effort to study human behavior rather than cobble together a weakass plot out of a few poorly thought out ideas and then write in actions to justify the events of the film as an afterthought. None of the characters besides Jane behave in ways that make sense or in ways that a normal human would. I know I know this is supposed to be the result of a terribly tragic event that created psychic ripples or whatever but it's just not plausible. Sorry I just need more than what this movie's story offered.The events in this movie could have been believable if the three characters who were involved in the abuse of the dead girl had at some point during the film been exposed at least a little as being somewhat sinister. I think the writerdirectorwhomever MIGHT have TRIED to convey this but unfortunately did so in such a poor manner that what the three of them did just didn't make sense based on the characters and how they were presented and how they behaved throughout the film I just couldn't see them traumatizing that poor girl. The filmmakers should have attempted to show some private side of these three shown that while they were adept at appearing normal they were in fact the real monsters made even more monstrous by their ability to seem so normal.But no instead we are presented with an implausible scenario perpetrated by people who given examples of who they are as presented in the film are acting so incongruous to their presented natures as to render suspension of disbelief nearly impossible. A good horror film should be immersive persuasive even and Shutter's lack of that which is due to its disjointed story is the final nail in the proverbial coffin.If however you have particularly low standards when it comes to entertainment and can be easily taken in by cheap camera tricks that have been done before and better if you can overlook bland mediocre acting if you don't mind scary content that is so cliqued that it's no longer even remotely disturbing...then you might like this movie. For those of you out there who like me want more than pretty pictures and a hackneyed plot for 90 minutes...look elsewhere.".

Why did they need to do a remake of a movie that was released only 4 years ago? Did they think they can improve it in some way? Not only did they not improve it they made it worse than the original in many ways. The brilliant music and sounds from the original are gone the ghost is less scary is shown more often and it seems less menacing at one step the ghost is even singing! the acting is worse and the characters are less believable than in the original.The producers introduced a few new elements hoping to make the movie more scary but in fact they made it more disgusting the flies for example. The original movie was full of clichs but this one is even more so. The most brilliant part of the original movie was the ending. In the remake they simply copied every scene from the last part of the movie but with less talent and less impressive results.So I return to my original question why did they need to do a remake? What was the problem with the original movie released only 4 years before this one? The fact that the main actors were Asians and that they didn't speak English? Or more likely the fact that Hollywood which is apparently all out of ideas couldn't let a good story fly by them without them making money out of it?".

There's more than that going on here.And without giving any plot points away the final shot of the film is going to stay with me for a long long time.Sure this isn't the most original piece of work ever.

This is not always a good thing as it's these little things that give the story a bit of character and individuality.To be brief the story involves the haunting of an American photographer and his new wife in Japan after hitting a young woman with their car on a lonely country road.Most of the ghostly horror is more suggested than overt with images appearing in photographs and just out of direct sight. Most of the set pieces from the original are here but several of the most startling and effective moments of horror are missing. The unfortunate PG13 rating keeps everything in check so while compelling the horror is fairly muted. Another fault is the ghost lacks a bit of the personality the original has in spades. The final twist takes the story in a very different direction and is quite startling. But like another reviewer wrote leaves you feeling justice has been done.Not a great film but very watchable and satisfying.".

Without watching Shutter you already know the format. Spirits that have pasty faces and fail to recognise the value of the slogan rest in peace. Shutter is also another ghost in the machine story except this time the machine is a camera.The trouble is there is absolutely nothing scary about this movie . There is plenty of bangs and crashes and you are bombarded with noise but nothing at all visual that would remotely send a chill down the spine. There is one scene that i liked where the screen went black every few seconds as to imitate the flash of a camera but that is all i cant think of that i can say is good about this film.The acting is irrelevant because the film is so dull . Fans of The American Office and Heroes might recognise a couple of the cast.This is the first Asian remake i have seen that hails from from Thailand but it is still the same old dross that has been dished up over the last couple of years . Director Masayuki Ochiai has failed miserably to achieve anything worth while and it's a film that will fade from the memory very fast indeed.The PG13 rating says it all while opening the gates to bored teenagers it will turn hardcore horror aficionados in the other direction.I don't know about you but i want my Horror movies to be 18 rated and nothing less.3 out of 10".

That's not to say that it's genuinely decent on its own merits if you've not already seen 2004's seminal Thaihorror Shutter that reignited that country's interest in producing slow burning luxuriously made horror films. Interestingly and perhaps even fittingly the Hollywood machine that devours and regurgitates the recent slate of JHorror films has turned its sights on Shutter which arguably finds its core roots in Japan's horror conventions in its vengeful waifish ghost girl tormenting the living by manifesting through various electronic mediums. So what Masayuki Ochiai's adaptation essentially becomes is a carbon copy of copy.American photographer Ben Shaw Joshua Jackson and his blonde schoolteacher bride Jane Rachael Taylor go straight from nuptials to a working honeymoon in Japan natch because America just isn't as scary to Americans as Asia is. Before heading off to Ben's lucrative assignment in Tokyo the newly minted couple heads to a remote countryside inn when a brief accident derails Jane's constitution and compels her to seek out answers led by a phantasmal presence in photographs and a newly discovered knowledge of spirit photography.Unremarkably Luke Dawson's screenplay omits and appends details to its basic premise. The original uses the stark disassociation of city living to intensify the eeriness of isolation and the idea that we never really see what we think we know. Dawson's script transplants the couple to a different country ramping up the cultural alienation and exoticism of another culture. It's not dissimilar to what we've already seen in The Grudge remakes.Even as Ochiai's direction is comparatively surefooted and patient with the camera choosing to hang on to a scene instead of ludicrously harping on jumpcuts and eyeballrattling shots that bounce off the wall the film feels unambitiously stale. Shutter goes through the motions of dourly checking off lookbehindyou set pieces and reflections on windows. The plotting and performances are so apparent you'd find yourself a couple of steps ahead of the film's central fauxmystery. While the bizarre symbiotic relationship audiences have with particularly mediocre remakes of Asian horror films should still live on after this what remains most terrifying is how textbook simple and undemanding the filmmaking has become for films of its ilk.".

There was no point in the movie where I was  scared... I didn't even jump. All in all this movie was terrible don't  waste your money on it watch something else instead... like moss  growing ANYTHING but this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shutter was a pretty decent movie. The movie was pretty predictable. People will probably not like this movie because of the ending. The thing that people need to realize is that when they are going to see a movie like this you know what you are going to get out of it. I hate it when people keep cutting down movies like this such as One Missed Call and The Eye. In these kind of movies the ending is pretty predictable its pretty much going to leave you hanging. Thats why I think people need to understand you can't hate a movie because of the ending. I thought that their was so much more to the story than just spirit photography. It explains why its happening to the people that are on their honey moon. It seems like in these kind of movies the story explains a lot more near the end. They kept doing many flash backs in this movie as well. That's when they were explaining the story a lot. This was actually pretty creepy freightning and scary all at the same time. It had a ton of sudden pop out right at your face scenes. Im sure that when you see this you will jump many times. I thought that it could have been a little bit better. I liked the idea of having it be two newly married couples that this spirit photography is happening to. I liked how the wife was fighting the ghosts the whole movie. The acting was surprisingly really good I thought. The wife in this played by Rachael Taylor did such a great job playing all the scared parts and emotional parts. Her husband played by Joshua Jackson did a great job as well. Some of the visuals were pretty sweet. They had a lot of nice camera shots of the whole city in Tokyo. After some of the people left the theater I heard them say I want my money back. This movie was trying to prove to you that making fun of people and treating them like crap at a younger age will come back to haunt you. Overall this was a decent movie with some good scares. I would go see this at the cheap show or only pay five dollars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately I didn't manage to catch the 2004 Thai original before this American remake premiered at the annual Belgian Horror and Fantasy Festival. I didn't bother to see it when it initially got released because there already was an overload of Asian Ghost movies at that time and I really couldn't cope enduring another dull and scarefree imitation of Ringu. After seeing the US remake I'm definitely interested in checking out the original sooner or later. The basic idea of restless spirits trying to communicate through photography is remotely original but the elaboration at least in this remake remains somewhat tedious and predictable. Immediately after their marriage Jane follows her photographer husband Ben to Tokyo where his friends arranged a splendid job for him. Jane but soon after also Ben suffers from visions of a deceased girl and all the pictures they make are ruined by ghostly images of this same girl. There's more than obviously a link between this girl and Ben's past days as a bachelor but Jane only gradually learns the truth of what happened exactly. To my knowledge this is the first and so far only Thai film to be remade by a Japanese director but with American funds and cast members. Talk about an international coproduction! Masayuki Ochiai previously directed the incredibly atmospheric and uncanny hospitalhorror film Infection so he definitely knows how to build up suspense and terror through suggestion. The main problem here is that the ghostly subject matter is too soft and doesn't lend itself to provide some genuine shockmoments. We've all seen too many Asian horror movies already in which whitefaced spirits spontaneously appear  disappear again and the mystery is always build up towards a point where the script can't possibly fulfill the audience's anticipations anymore. In Shutter you rather quickly figure out that Ben knows than he tells so you can easily guess each and every plot twist far in advance. There are a very limited number of sets and exterior locations. Why didn't the film take advantage of the wondrous city of Tokyo like for example Lost in Translation did? Rachael Taylor is certainly a promising actress with a lot of growing potential so I hope she'll get offered a couple of better screenplays in the near future. Thus far she only has horror rubbish like See No Evil and ManThing on her repertoire and those things won't get her noticed. Neither will Shutter for that matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone remind me what's the point of a remake again? A dearth of ideas? Thinking that one can do the job better? Don't laugh but one of the better Asian horror I've seen probably amongst the first few too in recent years was the Thai movie Shutter which played on the plot device of spirit photography those strange streaks of blurs that cover weird angles in a photograph and with a vivid imagination you can even make out faces of people you know or know not.There are remakes which challenge on the technical fronts  having to recreate scenes shot by shot or those helmed by master directors in the hopes of injecting some depth into characterization and story. Some filmmakers even choose to remake their own films with a different cast Funny Games anyone? and the list goes on. But one thing's for sure I seriously hope that the number of Asian horror remakes start to dwindle given that the westernized versions pale in comparison to their Asian originals and Shutter happens to be one of them.OK so perhaps half the fun was eliminated when you know just about every plot twist and turn character motivation and probably even what dialogue will come out of the actor's mouths so I jest. But in all earnestness I reckon that this remake will appeal more to those who have not seen the original. It's easy to be thoroughly bored because you know just what's about to come and can eliminate red herrings as well as spot the nowsoobviously subtle hints that the characters try to hide unsuccessfully.Also you can bet your last dollar that Hollywood will again go over the top in trying to explain everything verbatim as well as attempting to up the ante with the finale but in doing so tried too hard. I do not deny that it was much needed tension too little too late toward the end but really it added nothing to the plot besides succeeding in making you squirm. Technically this remade version boasts nicer production values but lacked the edginess that the original had to offer well because the directing duo of Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom were rookies then and lacked certain horrific charm and soul pardon the pun. In fact there was one critical scene which the Thai version had which boasted some ingenuity in a tracking shot but one which the remake had chickened out to do opting instead for cheap CG and unnecessary cutshots.So the remade had blinked first and didn't offer any really frightening moments to genuinely scare. Somehow I thought it was rather subtly preoccupied with sex given that you have a great looking cast with Joshua Jackson as Benjamin Shaw the photographer and his newly wedded wife Jane Shaw played by Rachael Taylor. For some reason Japan gets automatically associated with Asian horror and that's where this remake was set in maybe because the director  Masayuki Ochiai  is Japanese too.But the final straw which I found really disturbing was the lack of acknowledgement that this is a remake. There's nothing in the opening credits to inform the audience that it is one the original Thai directors given only producers credits and probably tried to pass off as an original story. Recommended of course to those who have not seen the original even then I'd suggest you only watch the Thai version. Those who have are advised to steer clear.".

Grudge  A man jumps off a balcony killing himself. Both  HallucinationsSeeing Thingsie.Grudge  Ended with character in metal hospital with the spirit nearby. Grudge Sarah Michelle Gellar's character Shutter Ben w Megumi on his shoulders. Both  Female character investigates. Grudge  Occurs mainly in Japan Grudge  Persons that are dead of Japanese origin. Ring  Bodies of the spirits found Ring  Occurrences don't stop after a proper funeralburial had taken place as expectedAnyways here's a quick rundown of the movie.Ben and Jane get married. Honeymoon cut short due to job opportunity in Tokyo Japan. Both go there. While driving in a forested area they run into a seemingly alive woman literally. Car crashes and both knocked unconscious. By the time they come to the woman is missing and they call the authorities but nothing turns up. From then on all the photos Ben takes seem to have Spirits in them which eventually mess up one of the photo shoots he was doing for his job. Also from that incident they both start having hallucinations and rundowns with this spirit. Eventually they both investigate together after Jane herself has done by herself already and find Megumi the dead woman dead in her house outside of Tokyo as a skeleton. Proper funeral occurs after a night where Ben and Jane both nearly die from her and they expect everything to be fine moving back to America. After that Jane discovers that her husband tortured Megumi in a way and then Jane came to a conclusion that Megumi was trying to warn her about the kind of man he was and leaves him. Ben then tries killing himself and ends up in a mental institution.If the story had a more original twist to it it would have been a much better film. The suspense scenes were more comical then frightening The spirit was randomly sitting down brushing her hair making a Grudgeish sound frightening Ben and random women screaming didn't help the movie in any way.However the acting in the movie was pretty good so I can't fully hate the movie.Overall 310. I only suggest seeing it if you are trying desperately for a good laugh or if you are completely bored into insanity.".

	schema:headline " It's Not The Ring but it still is a delicious scare!!";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as I'm concerned The Ring remakeand the original really is the scariest film I've ever seen. It just downright creeped me out and ever since then I've been all for the barrage of Japanese remakes that Hollywood has churned out even if some of them haven't been great. The Grudge was okay most recently Jessica Alba's The Eye see my reviews and there have been not so great sequels and remakes as well from the Japanese or Asian films but I knew Shutter looked good and I'm so glad I checked it out because I think this is one of the top ones from the genre that they've done since the grudge. The entire film just has this eerie quality about it and even though it does have some cheap thrillers scares loud noises it also really tries to get under your skin which I love about these types of films when you just get that eerie chill down your spine and Shutter does that. It deals with all the paranormal and eerie aspects of a haunting ghost story and even throws in a killer twist to boot although perhaps a little predictable I think you do see it coming but it doesn't make the film any less watchable. I happen to think Shutter is a downright brilliant horror thriller.I really like Joshua Jackson and even during Dawson's Creek I thought he had potential and for the first time I think he really shows his adult acting chops in Shutter. He's a great lead in the film and you can almost let go his teenage persona from his younger years. I think this will really open up some doors for him because he's great at it. I would love to see him come back for a sequel if they ever did one. Beautiful Rachael Taylor is Jackson's newlywed wife Jane. She is probably even more the main character getting even more screen time which is nice because she is EASY and then some to look at. Despite her near picture perfect appearance she still has a very down to earth quality and you follow the mystery with her much the way you did with Naomi Watts in The Ring. She does a great job and her and Jackson are hot together and very believable. Together they make a terrific combo and add to the already great feel of the film. Megumi Okina plays the haunting gal from beyond the grave. She is appropriately eerie and adds even more human qualities to the seeming monster killer so that it feels even more real. David Denman and John Hensley play small roles as Jackson's best friends and they both do a decent job in those roles although are kind of overshadowed by the stand out performances by Jackson and Taylor.Korean Director Masayuki Ochiai makes his American debut and he obviously has a clear grip on suspense and an intriguing story in any language. He does a really great job at the overall ambiance of the film and uses stereotypical but nonetheless terrifying settings like the abandoned buildings and images in pictures and such. The film just will make you creep with the feeling that you're being watched through a camera nonetheless. Shutter lives up to it's name by really making the camera the focal point of this mystery and how to solve it. The story is really interesting and even though I had my suspicions of how the mystery would end it didn't make it any less enjoyable. I wouldn't say that Shutter is gory or really brutal although it does have it's moments but it really does go for the thrills and any great fan of this genre of film will LOVE Shutter. I think it's just awesome!! 910".

I happen to think Shutter is a downright brilliant horror thriller.I really like Joshua Jackson and even during Dawson's Creek I thought he had potential and for the first time I think he really shows his adult acting chops in Shutter. He's a great lead in the film and you can almost let go his teenage persona from his younger years. I think this will really open up some doors for him because he's great at it. I would love to see him come back for a sequel if they ever did one. Beautiful Rachael Taylor is Jackson's newlywed wife Jane. She is probably even more the main character getting even more screen time which is nice because she is EASY and then some to look at. Despite her near picture perfect appearance she still has a very down to earth quality and you follow the mystery with her much the way you did with Naomi Watts in The Ring. She does a great job and her and Jackson are hot together and very believable. Together they make a terrific combo and add to the already great feel of the film. Megumi Okina plays the haunting gal from beyond the grave. She is appropriately eerie and adds even more human qualities to the seeming monster killer so that it feels even more real. David Denman and John Hensley play small roles as Jackson's best friends and they both do a decent job in those roles although are kind of overshadowed by the stand out performances by Jackson and Taylor.Korean Director Masayuki Ochiai makes his American debut and he obviously has a clear grip on suspense and an intriguing story in any language. He does a really great job at the overall ambiance of the film and uses stereotypical but nonetheless terrifying settings like the abandoned buildings and images in pictures and such. The film just will make you creep with the feeling that you're being watched through a camera nonetheless. Shutter lives up to it's name by really making the camera the focal point of this mystery and how to solve it. The story is really interesting and even though I had my suspicions of how the mystery would end it didn't make it any less enjoyable. I wouldn't say that Shutter is gory or really brutal although it does have it's moments but it really does go for the thrills and any great fan of this genre of film will LOVE Shutter. I think it's just awesome!! 910";

The only thing they can do now is get a better actor or more special effects. You don't go to a horror movie for a thought provoking story line you go to get scared or grossed out or to get REALLY close to your date. The movie accomplishes this unless you are one of these people that walk through haunted houses and roll your eyes no matter what they throw at you. If you are then go get a job in Kosovo because that's about the only way you are going to get scared.I liked it and the ending was fitting. There's some good jumps and they manage to pull off ultra creepy without the jerky photography so commonly used in ghost stories now. One thing though spoilerI also noticed a few comments as to why there was such a fuss about the pictures Jane finds in Ben's forgotten pictures. Ummm...lets see..he took pictures of the poor crazy girl while his two best friends raped her. There were more than 3 pictures. He didn't just mistreat her he used her to make snuff pictures which is usually why you have vengeful female spirits. Again clich but how many reasons are there to come back and terrify someone really?".

And the scale at the doctors? what????? one you think that he'd have realized it by then. and two aren't ghosts supposed to to be weightless? i don't know i would have just liked the movie to maybe build up more and not just try to be scary. i think it had good potential when it started but when the job started in japan i think it seemed to go from plot to let us try to scare you.".

The character Virginia was based on Miss Ward's own experience in a mental hospital.  Even though the film was nominated for various Oscars it only won for the musical score.  I think that was probably because at the time mental illness was considered taboo.  Olivia deHavilland acted the character of Virginia brilliantly as did everyone else in the film and Betsy Blair in her portrayal of Hester looked like she was completely and totally beyond help.  Just look at her eyes.  You will see what I mean. To this very day I think it is the most haunting and most accurate of all films that have been released on the treatment of emotional disorders.  I think all characters were portrayed as Mary Jane Ward wanted them to be portrayed as I studied her book and watched the film while in high school in the early 1960's.  Great book and a great film not afraid to show the abuse by certain medical personnel.".

She lost that year in the Oscar Sweepstakes to Jane Wyman's Johnny Belinda. That performance by Wyman was also groundbreaking and probably that and the fact that DeHavilland had won the year before for To Each His Own prevented her from copping the big prize that year. She did get the New York Film Critic's Award for The Snake Pit though. Seeing her in the Snake Pit and the accolades she got must have been of great satisfaction to Olivia DeHavilland because of the fights she had to get roles other than a crinoline heroine.In 1948 seeing stuff like electroshock was a real dose of reality to the movie going public. Today it's not used as much back then it was new and considered a panacea for all that ails you. I'm surprised that more reviewers haven't compared The Snake Pit to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Both were ground breaking films for their time and Jack Nicholson got his first Oscar for that. I guess the crazy act is always noticed by the Academy.Leo Genn as Doctor Kick had one of the great speaking voices in the world. Besides DeHavilland he's the best one in this. I can never tire of listening to him.56 years later this film will still grab you and hold your attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "Year by year the stigma of mental illness in the U.S. is easing but it is still with us nearly sixty years after the release of The Snake Pit. That a major Hollywood studio was willing to address such a frightening and misunderstood issue in 1948 in a sensitive and reasonably intelligent way is remarkable.Although the film is imperfect I think it is a fairly accurate portrayal of treatments conditions in state mental facilities and attitudes towards mental illness in the late 1940s. What makes The Snake Pit work as well as it does is the truly extraordinary work of Olivia de Havilland as Virginia and Leo Genn as the benevolent determined Dr. Kik. Their characters have to work with what mental patients and their doctors had at the time which was precious little. Virginia is fortunate enough to have a husband played sensitively by Mark Stevens who sees no shame in seeking treatment for his wife. This seems unusual for a man of that time but he obviously loves her and he is patience personified.Apart from months and months of confinement to a staterun hospital Virginia's course of treatment consists of electric shock treatments now known as electroconvulsive therapy  this software will not allow me to call it by its initials as is standard practice in the mental health community and truth serum to aid her in recovering past memories. This was a routine course of therapy for the mentally ill at the time. The two cancelled each other out however the primary side effect of shock treatment is loss of short term memory and truth serum is more a product of wishful thinking than an effective therapeutic method.Dr. Kik reduces the number of shock treatments he has scheduled for Virginia yet one particularly sadistic nurse attempts to prep her for another presumably to make Virginia even duller and more listless than she has already become. Making patients compliant by force and induced trauma to the brain was the extent of professional psychiatric care for decades. Psychotrophic drugs which are true miracles and talk therapy which when used in tandem have given millions back their lives were years away. Actually by the standards of the time the facility and staff of the hospital to which Virginia is confined are fairly humane.The ultimate diagnosis of Virginia's illness is a classic Freudian guilt complex arising out of events beyond her control. Armed with this facile explanation and with no further therapy available after leaving the hospital except to return should her symptoms reoccur Virginia is reunited with her husband and sent on her way. But not before assuming the role of wounded healer in a couple of touching scenes with a catatonic patient played by Betsy Blair that ring quite true. The penultimate scene of The Snake Pit takes place at a dance for the patients. It's awkward and uncomfortable to watch until a patient Jan Clayton takes the stage and begins singing Going Home a lovely spiritual the theme of which Dvorak incorporated in his New World symphony. Her voice trembles until she begins to listen to the words she's singing. As the entire gymnasium full of people begins to sing with her the room begins to swell with a haunting optimism. It is a littleknown but profound and inspiring movie moment.".

If she hadn't received the Academy Award two years previously 1946for TO EACH HIS OWN she most likely would have taken the 1948 Best Actress Oscar over Jane Wyman fine performance as JOHNNY BELINDA. I would say that THE SNAKE PIT along with her performance in William Wyler's 1949 film THE HEIRESS for which she won a second Oscar represent the two finest performances of her entire career. Anatole Livak's strong direction brings to life an outstanding screenplay. The film was certainly worthy of the six Academy Award nominations that it received including one for Best Picture.

One sequence sees Litvak track dancing silhouettes on a wall and to then do a pull away shot upwards to reveal Virginia in the snake pit the impact is stark in its magnificence. Another sequence takes place at a dance for the patients where a rendition of Antonn Dvork's Goin' Home turns into something quite beautiful a unison of profound optimism that strikes the heart like the calm after a storm.Leo Tover's The Day The Earth Stood Still crisp black and white photography is perfectly in sync with the material and Newman's Wuthering Heights magnificent score bounces around the institution like a spectral observer. With de Havilland doing her tour de force it could be easy to forget the great work of Genn and Stevens the former is a bastion of assured calmness as Dr. Mark Kik the latter as Virgina's husband Robert underplays it to perfection and he gives us a character to root for wholesale.It has to be viewed in the context of the era it was made but its influence on future movies and awareness of mental health treatments in the real world should not be understated.

	schema:reviewBody "I still find it amazing that this film even got made in 1948. It was such a daring project by Fox taking on the thentaboo and it still now unfortunately is not a topic readily discussed topic of mental illness and the fact that it worked and became a brilliant film was in large part thanks to its star Olivia de Havilland. She is amazing as the intelligent young woman Virginia Cunningham who finds herself in a mental asylum and doesn't know how she got there. This structure works particularly as the film becomes a sort of jigsaw puzzle in which we slowly piece together the fragments of Virginia's life and the reasons that led her to have a nervous breakdown.As I said earlier de Havilland's performance is just...Wow. Look at her dilated pupils listen to her sweet voice that could suddenly turn harsh with fear and uncertainty. She achieved an intensity in this film that few actresses could ever hope to match. I would rank this as one of the best female leading performances I have ever seen right up there with Vivien Leigh's turn in A Streetcar Named Desire. Bravo Olivia! And let's not forget the rest of the cast. Leo Genn is just marvellous as Doctor Kik. He portrays a psychiatrist without the clich of other contemporary Freudianthemed films i.e he doesn't fall in love with his patient aka Spellbound Kik is warm but firm caring yet never overstepping the professional boundaries always there to speak to but only at the institution. His scenes with de Havilland are the best in the film as these actors played off each other so well and seemed to enjoy working together. Mark Stevens also does a fine job as de Havilland's caring husband. In a role that could have easily been forgettable and overly sentimental Stevens is just perfect attractive yet solid as a rock caring yet interesting. The roles of the patients in the asylum are meaty scenegrabbing roles for any actress to play and the likes of Beulah Bondi Lee Patrick Celeste Holm and Betsy Blair pull them off with aplomb. Holm actually disappears from the film after a couple of scenes presumably allowed to go home. She acts as a sort of mirror as to how de Havilland will eventually be in her treatment of the Betsy Blair character.Litvak makes great use of the soundtrack in this film the voiceover from de Havilland works especially well and the shadows and camera pullbacks from the terrifying snake pit are very memorable and acutely show Virginia's terror. If the film has a fault it is the flashbacks to Virginia's childhood. They are the only scenes which feel forced simplistic and disjunct in a film that contains much flashing forward and backwards. Still the success of the whole beats a couple of suspect scenes and through it all we have Olivia de Havilland brilliant in every way.".

It was such a daring project by Fox taking on the thentaboo and it still now unfortunately is not a topic readily discussed topic of mental illness and the fact that it worked and became a brilliant film was in large part thanks to its star Olivia de Havilland. She is amazing as the intelligent young woman Virginia Cunningham who finds herself in a mental asylum and doesn't know how she got there. This structure works particularly as the film becomes a sort of jigsaw puzzle in which we slowly piece together the fragments of Virginia's life and the reasons that led her to have a nervous breakdown.As I said earlier de Havilland's performance is just...Wow.

	schema:reviewBody "Olivia DeHavilland gives another standout performance in The Snake Pit also starring Leo Genn Mark Stevens and Celeste Holm. In line with the interest in psychiatry after World War II Darryl F. Zanuck always at the forefront of social issues produced this film directed by Anatole Litvak.DeHavilland plays a troubled often disoriented woman with unexplained mood swings who winds up in a state mental hospital with no memory of her new husband Mark Stevens. She becomes a patient of Dr. Kik Genn who patiently works with her to try and get to the core of her problem and to do so employs several rounds of electroshock therapy. Together they uncover suppressed memories.One thing that's noticeable about the films of the golden age is their mastery of the art of the buildup while today screenwriters get to the point in the first 10 minutes of the film. The Snake Pit is very modern in this way starting on a high note and working backwards into what brought this woman into the hospital. Given the story it's very effective. It also keeps you guessing because the conditions at the mental institution as well as the behavior of some of the staff and the patients makes one suspect something sinister is going on  kind of a Shock Treatment scenario. It takes a while to realize that Dr. Kik is on the level a concerned and committed doctor.The film is beautifully done and who can forget the overhead snake pit shot toward the end of the film. The song Going Home sung by one of the patients at a dance is one of the best moments as are the harrowing scenes of the electroshock therapy and the bath with the covering over it that DeHavilland is put into  the feeling of being trapped and having no control is pervasive throughout the film. With the advancement in medications today one aches for the characters trapped in illnesses often not understood or treatable.Olivia DeHavilland is sympathetic and heartwrenching as Virginia a woman panicked by behavior she can't recall or can't control. When backed up against the wall her voice changes and becomes harsh she almost seems like a split personality. One believes every second of her torment. Leo Genn strikes the exact right note as Dr. Kik a perfect combination of gentleness concern and professionalism. His scene at the dance and his final scene with DeHavilland are very touching and especially the last moments bring me to tears. Mark Stevens gives a sensitive performance as Virginia's handsome and loving husband who is loyal to her throughout her ordeal.There has been much progress in mental disease and removal of much of the stigma. The Snake Pit reminds one of a more primitive time. Wonderful performances direction and a good story make this a true classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a two year hiatus from films embroiled in a court battle against Warner Brothers that would aid in the dismantling of the studio system in Hollywood Olivia de Havilland returned to the big screen with a vengeance. Her first major success was TO EACH HIS OWN which earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress of 1946. She would later earn another Best Actress Oscar for THE HEIRESS 1949. In between those two wins came another victory on screen if not with the Academy.Much has been said on this site about the basic plot line of THE SNAKE PIT 1948. Other users have already provided several synopses so I will assume that anyone reading this will know the basic plot points a woman is in a state mental hospital and she isn't quite sure why she is there. Really that's just the jumping off point for this film.As many other users have already mentioned Olivia de Havilland is brilliant in the role of Virginia Stuart Cunningham a woman grappling to come to terms with her situation in the proverbial snake pit of the state hospital system in 1940s America. The role of Virginia could have become a farce in the hands of a lessskilled performer but de Havilland's sensitivity and intelligence aided her tremendously in this rendering. For instance there are some scenes where Virginia's mood and emotions change several times in a matter of seconds. There are a couple of instances where these mood swings can come off as a little overdone but in a role that could have easily become a stereotypical presentation of a mentally unstable woman de Havilland's performance works. Her gift for creating a likable sympathetic character coupled with wellwritten largely internalized dialogue make de Havilland's performance more successful than not.Cinematically the true achievement of this film is that nothing is wasted in it. Every line and every scene has a purpose and is executed to near perfection. Each supporting character the cast is rather large with actors playing the parts of patients in the overcrowded hospital wards has a very clear identity that is made known to the viewer. It is quite possible to walk away from this film wanting to know more about the lives and stories of the other women in the facility What exactly happened to Miss Somerville? Why does the dancing girl dance around? What is the background of the woman who is rattling off legal jargon and trying to clear her name? While most films of this subject matter would glaze over the extras this one takes the time to make you feel like they are more than well snakes in some bottomless pit. They are there and in a sense they have as much purpose in telling the bigger story than the major characters in the film.This film as well as Mary Jane Ward's bestselling novel on which it is based sets out to expose the public to the behindthescenes aspects of state mental facilities and treatment at the time. While production codes and censors would not allow all of the truths of the system to be exposed what could be shown was shocking especially by 1948 standards. This film was able to affect change within the system and it helped start a dialogue about those who were being lost in the system.On the very basic level this is a compelling psychological drama. It has a main character with whom the viewer can sympathize  empathize and there are other riveting characters who can elicit laughter and tears from the viewer. On a whole different level however this film is a true classic. It is welldone cinematically and has proved to be influential in the social arena. When a film can have a social conscience and still be so personal it's really hard to go wrong.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the reallife series of murders in Boston from 196264 this police procedural has close to a documentarystyle approach. The filmmakers also utilized the splitscreen technique briefly popular back then in other films such as The Thomas Crown Affair. More than just splitting the screen in two there are sometimes as many as 5 different images dividing the screen and a widescreen version is necessary to get the full effect. Here the technique is used to display the actions of both the victim and the serial killer at the same time viewing their movements preceding the actual murders. Some viewers may find their concentration divided to a greater degree than they would like.The first half of the film shows how the police deal with or try to the number of female bodies steadily piling up in the city. Some of the material is dated with homosexuals being the primary suspects and various types of perverts like peeping toms rounded up in unintentionally amusing scenes see also The Detective1968 with Frank Sinatra for similar scenes of the homosexual community persecuted by the police dept.. Fonda plays the chief investigator placed in charge against his wishes but who soon accepts the gravity of the situation. George Kennedy is one of the main detectives.Curtis doesn't appear until the first hour ends. As an actor he immersed himself in this unpleasant role and from the first minute he's seen on screen all his past film roles are summarily wiped away. He was a star for close to 15 years at that point and all those comedies  sappy adventures he'd been in immediately disappear from one's mind. It's a rather astounding feat  who knew he was this method actor? But he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Also unlike for example Travolta's comeback in Pulp Fiction94 this did not revitalize his career. Sally KellermanMASH1970 also appears in an early role as a victim who just may survive. Look also for in a very early role James Brolin in one scene as a police sgt. caught in some indiscretion by a supposed clairvoyant. Modern filmmakers should also check out some of director Fleischer's techniques towards the end in that white room with Curtis.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE BOSTON STRANGLER 1968Aspect ratio 2.351 PanavisionSound format 4track magnetic stereoThe true story of serial killer Albert DeSalvo Tony Curtis a devoted family man with a split personality who terrorised Boston during the early 1960's and murdered eleven women.Perhaps taking its cue from the success of Richard Brooks' true crime drama IN COLD BLOOD 1967 Richard Fleischer's THE BOSTON STRANGLER is a dignified unsensational account of Albert DeSalvo's notorious crimes and the wideranging police investigation which led to his arrest. However modern viewers may be alarmed by the casual references to 'faggots' and a screenplay by Edward Anhalt from the book by Gerold Frank which assumes a divide between 'normal' heterosexual behaviour and other forms of sexuality all of which are bracketed as seedy deviant and marginalised. That small but significant caveat aside the movie provides an effective overview of a complex case and Curtis  an unlikely choice for such a difficult role  gives a careerbest performance as the deranged killer whose routine domestic life provided no hint of the monster lurking within his psyche. Henry Fonda is his nemesis a dedicated law lecturer assigned to the case against his will who eventually secured DeSalvo's confession. Some of the crimescene details are fairly frank for a major release of the period though the worst of it is relayed through dialogue and reaction shots and visual depictions are kept to a bare minimum. Even for those familiar with the outcome of the case the movie generates suspense through an accumulation of historical evidence as Boston's terrified populace reacts convulsively to the maniac in their midst and police trawl the streets for anyone whose sexual peccadilloes mark them as possible suspects.Fleischer was a particular advocate of the widescreen format he photographed most of his films anamorphically after being bowled over by a demonstration of CinemaScope in 1953 and his modish use of splitscreen effects is completely diminished whenever the movie is broadcast on TV you'll need a big screen to get even a modicum of the intended effect!. While irritating for some there's nothing gratuitous about this technical device by which Fleischer is able to convey layers of relevant information within the space of a single scene whereas a conventional approach might have taken more time and necessitated the removal of crucial information note also the clever use of directional dialogue and sound effects during these episodes. Few of the murders are recreated in any detail but there's a couple of unsettling scenes which describe the cunning manner in which DeSalvo was able to gain access to his victims despite a citywide alert over the Strangler's crimes and Sally Kellerman is hugely sympathetic as the only woman to survive one of DeSalvo's brutal assaults.NB. While Fleischer's film takes DeSalvo's guilt wholly for granted the facts which condemned him have been challenged in robust terms by a number of sources throughout the years most recently in Susan Kelly's 2002 book 'The Boston Stranglers The Public Conviction of Albert DeSalvo and the True Story of Eleven Shocking Murders' and much of the evidence which 'exonerates' DeSalvo is as compelling as anything in the movie. DeSalvo himself died in 1973 murdered by a fellow inmate whilst serving time in Walpole Prison.".

Leading a new taskforce to find the strangler John Bottomly continues the search and after several false leads hits it lucky with a man who appears to be the one they are looking for. However this is only half the story as Albert DeSalvo appears perfectly normal and doesn't seem to have anything to hide even though everything points to him being the serial murderer of the title.Not being aware of the real events behind this film it was an interesting story of me to watch even though I had to guard myself against the truism that many true stories will be simplified for cinema treatment. Regardless though the film still made for an interesting detective case but also a rather engaging look at mental illness and violence. The investigation part is nicely delivered and is quite tense  yes we know who the killer is but the other suspects are still interesting and I never felt like I was just hanging around waiting for Curtis to show up. Once he does the film changes tact slightly but is still interesting because Albert is so engaging a person  I was not sure what he was playing at but it was interesting to go along with Bottomly and try to piece the man together the closing captions show the slant of the film and this may annoy the more right wing viewer but it didn't take anything away for me.The cast are strong and help the tone of the film. Fonda plays his role well and provides a strong focus for the film until Curtis arrives to sweep it away from under his feet. Curtis' performance is well understated and lacking in the sort of showy acting that he could easily have done Edward Norton did a similar role in this way but the vehicle was different and it worked instead he is both a person and a monster someone we are not allowed to judge but rarely invited to feel sympathy for. Support is good from Kennedy Hamilton Kellerman and others but really it is Curtis' film and it is he that sticks in the mind. The direction seems obvious now especially with 24 in its fourth season but it is clever and effective the split screen keeping the film busy even in basic sequences while also helping the tension.Overall this is not a pacey thriller but rather a more serious drama although it still works well as an interesting look at the case but also at the failings of the system of dealing with violent mental illness sufferers. Its point is rather bluntly delivered but getting to it is well done and Curtis' performance is probably one of his best.".

He took a big chance and it paid off in some of the greatest reviews of his career but when it came to an Oscar nomination nothing. Tony Curtis is one of the greats in Hollywood. Too bad when he played the role of a lifetime the Academy forgot him. Also Henry Fonda deserved a nomination for his role. This was probably one of the most intense roles of his career.The other thing that made the film great was its innovative use of split screen. You pretty much got the creeps as you saw people living their ordinary lives on one side of the screen while on the other side you saw the strangler stalking his victim. Also I think that the director really did a good job by not really showing any of the attacks in progress at least until the last one. This film truly was a great psychological thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most people I'm fascinated with serial killers and why they do what they do. I don't need the gory details just what makes them tick. I know some people here are turned off because they say that the killer  Albert DeSalvo  was not the mental personality he was portrayed in the last 30 minutes of this film. Personally I don't care. I realize this is Hollywood and how often is the film world historically accurate? Almost never.So....just enjoy the acting the camerawork and the suspense because there is a lot to like here if you are entertained by crime stories.I for one liked the split screen technique presented in this film. It gave a unique feel to the film seeing the crimes from all kinds of angles at once. Rarely has this been done in films before or since. I presume because it didn't go over that well to most people. Anyway the story is riveting start to finish and Curtis gives a memorable performance even though he isn't in the movie until the last segment. How some critics can label him a subpar actor is beyond me. He is amazing in here as he was in Sweet Smell Of Success Some Like It Hot and other films. His fellow actors  Henry FondaGeorge Kennedy Hurd Hatfield Murray Hamilton Jeff Corey and Mike Kellin  all add to this excellent drama. It was a long wait for the DVD but at least that finally came out in 2005. This film was originally released about the time the rating system began to be employed and films changed drastically. Although there is very little offensive language there is nudity and some shocking scenes with the intense horrific subject matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Curtis really showed his acting chops when he took on the most unlikely role of Albert DeSalvo the famous Boston Strangler of the early 1960s. Though he's only in the film literally for about half of it what you see is a classic performance. Why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar the Deity only knows.13 women were found dead in the Boston area of manual strangulation and they were also sexually molested. Public concern was so great that the then Attorney General Edward Brooke played by William Marshall overrode local jurisdictions and prerogatives and assigned a lawyer from his office John Bottomly to coordinate the strangler investigation.Henry Fonda plays Bottomly who takes the task on quite reluctantly because his expertise is civil litigation. My guess is that Brooke was thinking that Bottomly would be best for the job because he came in with no preconceived notions on how to do the job and would be open to anything. Turned out he was right.Actually Fonda has more screen time than Curtis because the first half of the film concentrates on him and the investigation. He follows up every red herring thrown at him. He even hires a medium paid for with private funds by a millionaire friend of Brooke's played by George Voskevec who actually comes close in terms of geography to finding the real killer.One of the red herrings is a gay man played by Hurd Hatfield who in those days before Stonewall was considered a likely suspect. He gets turned in by his landlady who is suspicious of his reading material. It's something he's used to every time there's a lurid sex murder as an openly gay or at least openly gay for that time he's brought in for questioning. This was one of the few times I ever heard the word gay used in a film made before the Stonewall Rebellion of 1969.Curtis however dominates the film. The last 20 minutes or so is a final confrontation with him and Fonda and for those who are used to the insouciant leading man of swashbucklers and comedies this is a real breakthrough. As much if not more of breakthrough than his part in Sweet Smell of Success.In his memoirs however Curtis decries the fact that on this the second of two films he worked with Henry Fonda on he said that he found Fonda cold and forbidding as a person to work with.The film is tautly directed by Richard Fleischer with some fine editing though I think Fleischer was a bit too fond of the split screen technique. Still it's a film worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a big problem with this movie  aside from the unecessary and distracting use of the split screen a passing fad ripped off from Warhol's Chelsea Girls.  The first half is an almost flawless police procedural.  It doesn't stick to historical facts all that much.  Bottomly was a political nobody whose main job was to keep the public thinking that something was being done.  The second half deals with Albert DeSalvo the man and is pretty much hyped up and fictional.  It turns from a good docudrama into a standard piece of Hollywood baloney.  Not a reflection on Tony Curtis's performance. He's better here than in most of his performances some of which  Some Like It Hot and The Outsider  are pretty good.  But first there is a lot of controversy surrounding the diagnosis of multiple personality disorder. MPD is when two or more whole and integrated personalities inhabit the same body.  It may or may not be real and in any case is easily faked.  And DeSalvo didn't have it.  I don't mean to harp on the issue of historical accuracy.  Sometimes as in Shakespeare in Love it really doesn't matter much but in this case it does because it's used as a deus ex machina that resolves all the questions the actual facts raise.  Interviews with DeSalva make it clear that he knew exactly what he was doing when he was doing it. And he didn't need help in remembering the facts.  He recalled all of the details including the state of his penis while he committed the murders. The film changes history and turns him into just another dramatic case of MPD.  Nothing is said about his admission that he was also a criminal rapist known to the police as the green man who in the guise of a talent scout went around measuring girl's busts and hips thousands of them by his admission.  The film also leaves out any reference to his escape from jail and his subsequent recapture wearing a sailor's uniform.  He never had the anxiety attack shown in the film.  He never went over the edge into irredeemable psychosis.  Any competent shrink in reviewing the case would diagnose the real Boston strangler as a socialized type of antisocial personality disorder the kind of illness that used to be called psychopath.  He was a con man pure and simple.  The ending is dramatic but it's nothing but fictional trash designed to lull an unthinking audience into the belief that even the most loathsome and darkest aspect of human nature has a comprehensible explanation.  The twisting of fact is understandable however.  The real historical explanation or the lack of it would give not only the Boston strangler but all the rest of us an anxiety attack.  Some people commit thoroughly rotten acts  and none of the rest of us knows why.".

The first half is the police investigation which I find very fascinating. They are hopelessly without a clue. In that part even Henry Fonda isn't the star of the movie. It's the investigation and the many deadends that is the true star. I like the split screen in this section which give a scattered feel to the police work.The second half starts with the introduction of Tony Curtis. It becomes a lot of psychobabble trying to dig into DeSalvo. I'm not convinced of its authenticity and I don't think it's that compelling. The second half could have continued the idea of the first half. It could have made DeSalvo less definitive as the killer. Instead there is no mystery. The audience is simply waiting for him to admit his guilt which is not in doubt. The first half is a terrific crime movie and the second half is much less compelling.".

	schema:reviewBody "My background is not typical of the average viewer. Years ago I used to be a psychotherapist and I worked with some very very sick people. In addition I taught psychology. So I have some idea what I am talking about when I say this film is probably a lot of psychological mumbojumbo. Let me explain. Back in the 1950s the book and movie The Three Faces of Eve created a sensation. Suddenly this new diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder now called Dissociative Identity Disorder was identified and the number of cases was very large for a newly named mental illness. And when the TV miniseries Sybil came out the number of cases increased dramatically. Then came the bombshellthe lady who identified herself as 'Eve' admitted that her illness was a hoaxand there was good reason to doubt the account in Sybil as well. And each time a movie or book came out on the subject the number of cases increased! Something was clearly amiss. Today many counselors and psychologists doubt that the disorder actually exists. I am not sure I'd go that far but do know that many folks who claim to have it do so in order to avoid prisonas there is clearly a gain for them to be 'sick'. So in light of this and so much more I haven't the space for here it's very doubtful that the killer in The Boston Strangler actually had the Multiple Personality you see in the film. He more likely used this as an excuse for his sick behaviors. Instead sex offenders often 'compartmentalize'in other words while they KNOW what they did they often deny it to themselves and otherstreating their sick behaviors like it happened 'to another part of them'. Despite the distinct possibility that MPD does not exist it does NOT make The Boston Strangler a bad film. First at the time MPD was seen as a very real thing by most therapists. Second the film is very well constructed finely acted and interesting throughout.The film is about a real series of rapemurders in the Boston area and the man who is assumed to have been the perpetrator Albert DeSalvo. The entire first hour is about the investigation and furor over the killings and you don't even see DeSalvo Tony Curtis until this hour is complete! This makes this movie perhaps the only one I know of where you wait this long to see the star! I liked the investigation portion the most as it was NOT glamorized but seemed rather realistic. As for Curtis soon after he enters the film you see him committing one attackand you can clearly see it's him for the first time. This attack doesn't go as he planned however and for the first time he's left a living witness. Soon after he's caught while trying to break into another home. The problem is not whether or not he did the crimes but whether or not he's even competent to stand trial for them. Overall a fascinating portrait of the investigation and the killer. Well worth seeing and a quality production despite the strong possibility DeSalvo was NOT a Multiple Personality.By the way the first portion of the film consists of a bizarre multipaned screenwith several scenes occurring in little windows. The only other film of the time that I can think of that did this is The Thomas Crown Affair.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are three large problems with this movie. The first is the banal use of the splitscreen technique. There is really no benefit to the story or the viewer in seeing a both a finger pressing an apartment doorbell and an old woman sitting upstairs reacting to it. b a newscast being filmed and as filmed b a sequence of ten old ladies looking nervously over their shoulders instead of just two or three. The movie craves occasions to use the tool it has already decided upon and strives badly to utilize the gimmick but fails. The splitscreen doesn't heighten tension doesn't usefully complicate the narrative doesn't offer any shift in viewpoint that is ultimately productive. In short it doesn't produce any discernible result. Worse still it's used very timidly for inscrutable typical reasons. In the end you're not convinced it was used for any deeper reason than some graphic designer convinced the studio it would look rilly kewl. Stylisitically there's no coherence in the use of the technique. It's all over the place. Some compositions fill the screen Mondrianlike with equally minor scenes. Sometimes the boxes slide across the screen. Sometimes footage is inset inside other footage... all creating discord.The second problem is the usual Hollywood malarkey concerning the now absolutely dead Freudian idea that a psychotic's breakthrough can only come when he uncovers the secret he's keeping from himself. So the hogwash of hypnotism gets run through the machinery again.The third is the odd decision to manufacture a completely phony story for the criminal. Utter fiction is allowed in to the script to produce something more typically Hollywood. The script opts for 'familiar' over 'fresh' while the technique is desperately fighting this choice. Because the movie doesn't agree to study the actual traits of the killer it both offends those involved and ultimately gets at exactly nothing. The stakes of making the story an opportunity to give an actors resume a calculated boost is deeply cynical.The movie finally gets to a decent idea in the last quarter when space and time become compressed in the interviews and Fonda begins to appear in DeSalvo's memories. This is a much more promising idea but the movie ends shortly after.".

Watching these scenes today theyre both disturbing and haunting so lord knows how a 1968 audience would have reacted to them . Fleischer also casts well  and special praise should be given to Tony Curtis . Its also nice to see a disclaimer at the start of the film pointing out that many events have been fictionalised as this explains the unlikely occurance the way the cops solved the case".

	schema:reviewBody "You may only know Tony Curtis as a matineidol with a twinkle in his eye. Hollywood certainly typecast him as that before this movie came out. After it they didn't seem to know what to do with him and his career as a star faded badly and he ended up doing television.Nothing can prepare you for the power of Tony Curtis's performance as Albert De Salvo in this movie. He should have won an Oscar for it but didn't. He wasn't even nominated and has never won an Academy Award. Ironically Tony Curtis redubbed Spartacus with Anthony Hopkins the same year he played Hannibal Lecter and won an Oscar for it a win that would never have been possible without performances like Tony's in The Boston Strangler that pushed the boundaries and made playing serial killers worthy of Oscars. It is a complex and extremely honest performance. Tony Curtis said he used emotional memory during the harrowing final scenes which is methodacting in all but name. It is as good as anything Brando did but is also a performance that is shamefully overlooked and forgotten about these days.Sure the splitscreen technique is dated but it was very fashionable at the time see The Thomas Crown Affair of the same year. Tony Curtis reunites with the director of The Vikings Richard Fleischer for a very different type of movie. Fleischer does a great job of maintaining the air of mystery suspense and horror throughout with some entertaining comic relief to lighten the mood just look at the parade of weird perverts the cops shake down in their hunt for the killer.There is some interesting movie history going on here. Tony Curtis plays the Boston Strangler his first wife Janet Leigh played Marion Crane in Hitchcock's Psycho and their daughter Jamie Lee Curtis became a scream queen in movies like Halloween Prom Night and Terror Train. Jamie Lee and Janet Leigh acted together in the horror movies The Fog and Halloween H20. Sadly Jamie Lee never got to act with her father Tony. The Boston Strangler was a film ahead of its time. Censorship was just ending in Hollywood in 1968 and audiences weren't really ready for a film as brutal and realistic as this. Highly recommended...just don't watch it alone!".

	schema:reviewBody "as a psychological writer I find this garners a mixed review. Tony Curtis gives a good performance in a mostly fictionalized we now know account of the man Albert DeSalvo who was hospitalized and labeled The Boston Strangler.Some of the scenes are inscrutable if not amusing.

While I agree with an earlier review there really was no explanation and the culprit was actually never caught the reality is DeSalvo was kept at Walpole hospital and it was later discovered he was not also the measuring man who was never caught.Also there is the sense that this film skims the surface throws scenarios at the audience and then moves on to the next killing. This may be worth watching if you are a fan of Curtis but otherwise it is too highly fictionalized.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Boston and its satellite towns between June 1962 and January 1964 eleven women were murdered by one sexually depraved man.  Albert DeSalvo confessed to the killings in circumstances which later gave rise to some doubt.    The film shows the 'Strangler Scare' and the unorthodox methods used in the investigation.  Conceived in quasidocumentary format this visually sophisticated film presents a coherent narrative assembled from a mosaic of discordant elements.  A striking splitscreen technique is used to great effect.  We see the killer choose a doorbell and ring it as simultaneously his victim responds to her deathknell and opens the door.  The effect on us as viewers is rather like Brechtian alienation.  We are distanced from the horror because we can see the artifice but at a profounder level we get a whiff of the Strangler's own disorientation and disintegrating personality.    Other devices play tricks with perception  ours and DeSalvo's.  A newscaster cuts in on the 'live' action to do a videolink with Bottomley on a largescreen format some 15 years before such things became feasible. Investigator killer and commentator are 'condensed' together in a perceptual continuum which is both disturbing and enlightening.  Throughout the film scattered and confusing visuals are held in order by the unbroken flow of the soundtrack.  This reminds us of DeSalvo's diseased dual awareness one part rational and sequential one chaotic.    The death and funeral of John Kennedy which struck Boston with particular force happened in the latter part of the 19month murder spree. In an effective soundvision split we see DeSalvo at home watching the funeral on TV and then in the apartment of a victim with TV coverage continuing seamlessly.  Coherent sentience the narration coexists with fragmented consciousness the dreamlike arrival at the apartment.  Mirrors perform the same schematic function.  Twice in the film DeSalvo notices his own reflection in a mirror and each time his rational self suddenly reimposes control over his psychotic alter ego.    So what?  Everybody's banging everybody.  It's a horny world says a Boston detective a view symptomatic of a film which deals with sex in a mature matteroffact way.  This must be the first feature film to use the term 'gay'.  Many forms of deviance make their way into the story as the investigation lifts the lid on human foibles.  Humour is used skilfully to complement the sexual content as in the 'pickle salesman' scene.    In 1968 many Americans were opening up to the mindexpanding possibilities of marijuana.  The film seems to have been influenced by this trend the scenes of DeSalvo's madness having a weird dissociative quality about them.  His recollection of the first killing mixes colour and monochrome and his confessor Bottomley seems to be present at the remembered murder.  Almost as if in a Beatles song DeSalvo can enter his daughter's dollshouse and neither past nor present has any distinct identity.    Marvellous though the film is some elements don't quite come off.  It is too much of a coincidence that Bottomley should get into DeSalvo's elevator at the City Hospital and happen to notice the bite mark.  If the bite mark is so pristine why don't the police simply compare it with an impression taken from the victim's teeth?  The doctor is used as a rather crude soundingboard for some pseudopsychiatric theories.    Tony Curtis is impressive as DeSalvo showing conclusively that he can handle serious roles.  It is almost an hour before he appears onscreen but once he enters the narrative he dominates it effortlessly.  Resisting the temptation to grandstand he plays DeSalvo as a limited inarticulate man. The Boston accent is nicely captured in an understated way.  Even the crackup in the hospital is lowkey the broken man fumbling for comprehension in scenes of great emotional power.    Legal technical orderly and remote is how the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral describes a paper written by John Bottomley and the man shall be known by his works.  The city official placed in charge of the Strangler Bureau is an enlightened seeker after truth a man with humane liberal instincts but ultimately a cold and 'proper' individual. Henry Fonda is perfect for the part.    Though the film has two bravura performances Curtis and Fonda it is memorable for being an ensemble piece.  George Kennedy and Murray Hamilton detectives DiNatale and McAfee respectively lead a squad of investigators whom we come to know and like as the story progresses.  The acting style is restrained and naturalistic harmonising exquisitely with the quasidocumentary format.    Director of Photography Richard Kline pulls off a series of triumphs. The psychosis scenes have been mentioned but equally impressive is the downtown Boston 'look' which matches uncannily  truelife TV news footage of the Strangler manhunt.  As the killer moves in on a victim the heightened excitement is evoked by means of a jerky handheld camera.    The real DeSalvo admitted to 13 killings two more than the official tally.  He was detained without plea or trial in a secure hospital and it was here that in 1973 he was murdered by fellow patients.  Concerns about the validity of his confessions led in July 1999 to the reopening of the case and it is hoped that DNA testing will soon establish with certainty whether Albert DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler.".

As a movie it rolls it stalls it scares you and it ultimately has repellant passivity which was unfortunate for Tony Curtis as an actor because he might have been nominated in '68 in a tough field but the putrid flavor of detectives seeking out suspects turns this into an exploitive film with a false and unkempt morality base but that's plot stuff anyway...but that is the script the weakest part of the film but it's well worth delving into.".

	schema:reviewBody "Comments contain a lot of spoilers...Movie is an excellent telling of a reallife serial killer that occured in Boston in 1963.  Through the use of split screens and a documentarytype feel you are immersed into the world of the cops who are searching for the killer before he kills again..unfortunately he always does.  You are shown the effect the killing spree had on the police officers the women of the area the former sexcrimes offenders who are being questioned all over again and about a halfdozen innocent men who could be connected to the crime but in the end are not.  You do not see the killer until the movie is halfover and you only see the details of one of his intended victims.  The killer is Albert DeSlavo played by Tony Curtis in his best work easily and the victim is Sally Kellerman and she happens to survive his attack.  Its very frightening when he ties her up but like I said this is the most graphic scene in the movie.Albert DeSalvo happens to have a split personality and is very unaware of his own actions.  He gets glimpses into his own past in his memory but do not know what they mean or where they come from.  Its only through analysis in a mental hospital that this is discovered.  Eventually Albert is catatonic from the realization that he cannot face. Curtis is fantastic and the only reason I can think of for his lack of an Oscar nomination is that the movie is very unpleasant and grim.  However the following year Midnight Cowboy won Best Picture and that did not contain a whole lot of scenes of garden parties and sunsets so its anyone's guess...Henry Fonda is excellent also as is Murray Hamilton George Kennedy and William Hickey.  Also seen are a very young James Brolin Carole Shelley Jeanne Cooper Mike Kellin Hurd Hatfield and George Voskovec. Movie is very well done very mature very effective.  There is some homophobia but that's to be expected I suppose.  On the plus side Fonda's boss who is the Attorney General is black so I guess its a wash.  910.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 50s the major Hollywood studios produced many movies in Europe as it was cheaper to make 'quality' films there utilizing foreign labor. IVANHOE QUO VADIS and ROMAN HOLIDAY were a few memorable titles shot overseas and when the WB chose to make the last of Errol Flynn's films for the studio THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE in England no one was happier than Flynn himself. His career grinding to a halt his finances in disarray he had left America with creditors at his heels finding that in Europe he was still considered bankable and his name still had marquee value. He hoped that starring in a swashbuckler only his second since 1948's ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN might revive his career and open doors as he began to freelance. Unfortunately years of selfneglect had taken it's toll on his appearance and energy and even the most careful of lighting would no longer create a youthful illusion. At 44 Flynn showed all of his years and lacked the acrobatic grace that had made his earlier swashbucklers so memorable.Very loosely based on a Robert Lewis Stevenson novel with elements of CAPTAIN BLOOD thrown in for good measure Flynn is Jamie Durrisdeer the hedonistic eldest son of a Scottish lord who after a coin toss leaves to fight alongside Bonnie Prince Charlie while his younger brother Henry 'plays nice' with the British in order to save their estate. After the Scottish army is defeated he finds himself a fugitive allies himself with Irish mercenary Col. Francis Burke a scenestealing performance by Roger Livesey and sneaks home to borrow money to flee to France. After a tearful reunion with his lady love Beatrice Campbell who was certainly no threat to Olivia de Havilland as a Flynn leading lady Jamie awaits brother Henry's arrival with funds on the coast...only to be betrayed barely escaping with his life. Burke takes the wounded Jamie onboard a waiting ship only to be informed that the destination is the Caribbean not France. The pair had been shanghaied!After a series of events very reminiscent of CAPTAIN BLOOD Jamie becomes a successful buccaneer defeating a French rival in combat. Singlemindedly on a mission of vengeance he returns home to Scotland to confront the brother who had 'betrayed' him...At a brief 90 minutes the pace never falters and the cinematography by Jack Cardiff is rich and vivid and so impressed Flynn that he hired Cardiff to film and direct his 'pet' project an adventure film about William Tell...which was sadly never completed as Flynn went bankrupt.While THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE was certainly not of a caliber with Flynn's best swashbucklers it was undeniably the best film that the WB had assigned him to since THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN. Unfortunately the reviews were lukewarm at best and the film was largely ignored.For all intent and purpose Errol Flynn was 'washed up' in America. He would not make another American film for four years...a sad state of affairs for a man who just a few years earlier had been the toast of Hollywood!".

As a result he looked extremely old and puffy in these films and the overall energy level of the films were very low. Sadly like Alan Ladd his career was cut very short because of the drinking.Despite this MASTER OF BALLANTRAE is one of only a few shining moments in an otherwise drab decade for Flynn. Now this isn't to say the film is great and I am sure that had Flynn made the film ten or twenty years earlier it would have been better as often he looked a bit drunk and immobile but it still was enjoyable and held my interest.The film is based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel by the same namea story very similar to another famous work by Stevenson Kidnapped. Like this other tale they are set in the period immediately following the defeat of the forces of Bonny Prince Charlie after the Battle of Culloden. This time Flynn plays a brother forced to leave his homeland because those loyal to the Prince were being rounded up and executed. I am actually glad the film left Scotland as the pirate sequences were exciting even if the Tortugas look nothing like they do in the filmthere are no mountains on these barren islands off the Florida Keys.In addition to a sluggish but acceptable performance by Flynn he was very ably supported by Roger Liveseythe only actor in the film who really came off as exciting or threedimensional.".

	schema:headline " The Curse of the Duries";
	schema:reviewBody "It is generally conceded today that Robert Louis Stevenson's two greatest works are the unfinished novel WEIR OF HERMISTON and the completed THE MASTER OF BALLENTRAE. The latter story published in 1889 is centered on a filial rivalry and hatred that lasts literally until the death of the two brothers involved.Ballentrae is an estate in 18th Century Scotland and the chief heir is James Durie. On the surface he is an easy going fun loving type. When the 1745 Jacobite revolt under Bonnie Prince Charlie occurs the Laird of Ballentrae is in a quandary. As a Highland Laird he has to show he is a supporter of the ancient royal house of Scotland the Stuarts that Prince Charles represents. As a man who knows what the Hanovarians are like he dare not fully come out as a supporter. So he hedges his bets. He has James go off to fight for the Stuart cause but keeps his younger son Henry at home. Henry is not a fun loving type  he is a quiet businesslike type who does not make friends easily.So James goes off and time passes. He is eventually reported as dead. Henry immediately becomes the heir to the estate. But suddenly James returns and willingly brings troubles with him. The British government does have a price on his head and if he is found on the estate the Duries may be imprisoned and their wealth taken away. Yet the old man insists that Henry do what is right for his older brother and James keeps reminding Henry that by rights he is Master of Ballentrae.What happens of course is a disaster. To begin with it slowly comes out that James may have declared for the Stuart cause but he never showed up to fight for that cause. In short he acted like a loud mouth attracting the anger of the government but then showed he was a coward. Not a total coward where his own interest is involved but one who won't put himself out for others when the chips are down. Secondly it turns out that his funloving activities are coming home to roost  he's had an affair and left an illegitimate child. This of course means that the family has to support the bastard child.Moreover Henry has married the woman who would have married James under normal circumstances. He is now trying to unofficially regain her attention. This proves too much for Henry and leads to one of the best passages in Stevenson's writings  the duel between the brothers in a darkened room. It ends with Henry believing he killed James. Would that he had.James persecutes Henry and his wife for the rest of the novel the father eventually dies of shame after learning how James was so cowardly at Culloden. The novel eventually goes to New York then a colony where both brothers meet up and meet their joint destiny.This review of the story does not go into Henry's character flaws he is a money grubber in the end. Stevenson never did make a better completed novel even though there are elements of the improbable in it.The story was made into this 1953 film probably the last good movie Errol Flynn had the lead in that was a swashbuckler. The ambiguities and moral lapses of the two brothers are not used here Henry is played by Anthony Steel and he is far too young here for the role. James' opportunistic streak and his nonappearance at Culloden is not in the film  he shows up at the battle. Indeed he meets Colonel Francis Burke an English Jacobite Roger Livesey who becomes his one ally and friend in the novel. In the film there will be other allies. Mervyn Johns plays the family servant MacKellar who narrates the actual novel but not here and sees the flaws of both brothers all too clearly although he ends up sympathizing with Henry. Lord Durrisdeer the father of the brothers is Finlay Curray. The cast is generally quite good. But the excellence of the story is dropped and replaced into a tale of misunderstanding and how a universal dislike of the English manages to keep the family together. Stevenson would have been amazed and hurt by what was done here.I am willing to give the film an 8 for it's good points mostly the performances in particular Livesay's chemistry with Flynn. But I miss the tragic element of the novel. To properly appreciate the novel if one can't read it try to catch the television version made with Michael York and Richard Thomas and John Guilgud back in the 1980s. It too changed the end but it stuck closer to the spirit of hopeless competition and hatred that Stevenson concocted in his masterpiece.".

Perhaps to account for Flynn's age he was 44 at the time his character isn't quite as agile as in earlier adventures  given that he's wounded some three times during the course of the film that said as already mentioned his attraction to females remains undimmed though in perhaps another sign of maturity he never actually strays from his devotion to fiance Beatrice Campbell  ditto his wit especially when it becomes necessary to putdown some gruff and pompous adversary.This lively costumer is competently helmed by Keighley a regular throughout Flynn's heyday and deals with the 18th century struggle by the Scots to break free from British rule and elect Bonnie Prince Charlie as their sovereign. Besides the film is boosted by an array of British players including Anthony Steel as Flynn's overeager brother Felix Aylmer Mervyn Johns Ralph Truman Francis de Wolff and especially Roger Livesey  cast against type as the star's funloving Irish sidekick a role usually filled by Alan Hale the Warners DVD I watched then really does justice to the film's gorgeous color cinematography courtesy of the great Jack Cardiff.Ultimately while no classic THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE is a pleasant romp and at this stage I wouldn't mind checking out the rest of Flynn's ventures in similar vein actually I only have three more to go  THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN 1951 CROSSED SWORDS 1954 and THE DARK AVENGER 1955  but their lowprofile and in the case of the first two their European backing doesn't augur well for the films' imminent availability...".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I have seen a monumental number of films The Master Of Ballantrae had managed to escape my viewing until recently. I expected that it would not be of the same quality as Captain Blood or other Errol Flynn hits or else it would have been shown as much as they are. This is exactly what it turned out to be a watchable but lower quality film. Scottish laird Jamie Durrisdeer Errol Flynn leaves his father Lord Durrisdeer Felix Aylmer younger brother Henry Anthony Steel and fiancee Lady Alison Beatrice Campbell to go fight the English. Defeated in battle he is pursued back to the family castle accompanied by a talkative Irish mercenary Colonel Francis Burke Roger Livesey. Their hiding place betrayed Jamie and Col Burke must flee. Jamie believes that his brother has betrayed him to the English in order to inherit the family estate. However the snitch is revealed to be Jamie's spurned lover Jessie Brown Yvonne Furneaux. Jamie and Col. Burke hope to sail to France with smuggler MacCauley Moultrie Kelsell but he in turn cheats them by sailing to the Caribbean. There the ship is taken by colorful French pirate Arnaud Jacques Berthier. Just as you would guess Arnaud can see uses for Jamie and makes him a partner despite the doubts of Arnaud's second in command Matthew Bull Francis DeWolff. In a clever plot twist since you don't really want our hero to victimize innocent people they set out to rob the booty of another pirate Mendoza Charles Goldner. Afterward there is the to be expected falling out between Jamie and Arnaud the fight and Jamie's ultimate victory. Jamie with Col. Burke returns home a richer man but still wanted by the English. There he finds that Henry believing him dead is courting Lady Alison. Following a battle with the English misunderstandings are cleared up love prevails and our heroes escape to live happily ever after. Ah only in movies! The above highlights what is best about the film which is that it keeps moving with a lot of action for only 90 minutes running time. Also the locales in Scotland and Spain filling in for the Caribbean are very scenic. However there are three significant problems which stop this film from becoming an A picture. First as noted in many other comments Errol Flynn is showing the wear of his lifestyle. In his best pictures he displayed vitality a dazzling smile and mocked his enemies. Here he is tired broody and uninspired. However in his defense he may also of had other things on his mind. While making this film he was preparing to produce his next picture William Tell. If you don't recall that movie it's for good reason because Errol Flynn after starting production could never find sufficient funding to complete the film. Secondly there is no central villain a la Basil Rathbone et al in this movie. The English are gentlemen who thinking they've killed the escaping Jamie go out of their way to apologize to his father for having to do so. We know that his brother did not betray him it would have created more dramatic tension if the script had hidden his betrayer until Jamie and Col. Burke return to Scotland. The smuggler who waylays them has only one or two scenes. Only Arnaud generates any interest. Thirdly there is no sex. OK so there is no sex in any 1953 films but Beatrice Campbell generates none of the interest that say Maureen O'Hara or even Olivia De Haviland possessed. Yvonne Furneaux does create more energy but there is something uncomfortable about her scenes as her character is grabbing at Jamie for attention and he is blithely looking the other way. Having waited this long to see The Master Of Ballantrae would I see it again. The answer is definitely yes but I am more likely to first see Captain Blood or Robin Hood five or ten times more.".

	schema:headline " Jamie Durie the Master of Ballantrae is not a man to let close to your wife your daughter or your gold";
	schema:reviewBody "The Master of Ballantrae just might have worked as a sprawling period swashbuckler if...the Master of Ballantrae the eldest son of the laird of Clan Durie who fights for Bonnie Prince Charlie and loses hadn't been such a selfcentered clod who let his love of gold wenches and adventure get in the way of honor wisdom and trust and if...Errol Flynn had been ten years younger. At 44 he looks 54 and often a puffy and tired 54 at that. If he were younger he might have convinced us that the selfish and impetuous Jamie Durie would sometime soon in the movie find something honorable to do that would make us root for the romantic and dashing fellow. Looking in his midfifties however Flynn resembles an aging petulant rake and we know it's unlikely that there is any chance of a charming good guy emerging from the husk. Robert Lewis Stevenson doesn't help. His Master is unredeemably and emotionally selfish even though a dab hand with a sword at piracy with the ladies and with holding a grudge. No man in his right mind would place anyone he loves in the selfcentered path of Jamie Durie. Flynn doesn't have much of a chance. It's clear Flynn's rapscallion romantic swashbuckling days have long gone by. The story of the Master of Ballantrae bears some resemblance to Stevenson's novel. A toss of a coin determines that Jamie the Master will fight for the Stuart restoration when Charlie Stuart arrives from France to try to wrest the throne away from the Hanoverian King George II. As the elder brother Jamie will inherit the Durie title and estates. The year is 1745. Jamie's younger brother Henry Anthony Steele will support George. This way whichever side wins Clan Durie will have backed the winner. Henry is everything Jamie is not. He's conscientious honorable and dull. And when Charlie loses Jamie has to hightail it out of Scotland. Penniless more or less he encounters another rogue Colonel Francis Burke Roger Livesey in a rollicking performance and made up to look more of a drunk than Flynn and off they go on the adventures of wenching and piracy fighting and guffawing that make up most of the movie. Jamie never forgets however that he has a score to settle with Henry for by now thanks to jealousy and treachery Henry has become the Master of Ballantrae and the heir to Clan Durie. If Jamie can't have the title then when he sneaks back to Scotland he wants the woman who goes with the title plus a good deal of money. He's more than willing to kill Henry to get all this. Much of the movie was photographed in Scotland and looks great. Jack Cardiff gets the credit. The screenplay is often a bawdy rag tag braggadocio of ripe dialogue credited to Herb Meadow with additional dialogue by Harold Medford. There is a rousing sea attack some fullbodiced wenches in Tortuga a fine mannered dandy of a French pirate captain and a rouser of a Flynn sword fight. Unfortunately it's obvious to one who looks closely that Flynn's fencing double is getting more screen time that Flynn during the fight. Even so the story is something of a downer the tale of a man who could never have enough who kept close his resentments who never forgot and who never learned. Well maybe he learned a little at the end...if he listened to his great true and only friend Burke Not much time to remember all the girls you've known all the laughter you've heard all the gold you've spent and all the plans you had to spend more. The places we've not seen Jamie! The things that lie about the world! The fun of it! Perhaps but the happy end is about as abrupt and startling as suddenly opening a boiled haggis. Roger Livesey a fine British actor would have overshadowed Flynn in my opinion if he hadn't carefully modulated bits and pieces of his performance. Burke is a dangerous rogue but unlike Jamie Durie he's likable. To see Livesey at his very best watch him in those three classic movies he starred in for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp I Know Where I'm Going and A Matter of Life and Death. If we want to remember Errol Flynn in his sad decline let it be in that unremembered Western shot cheaply in 1950 and not promoted by the studio Rocky Mountain. Flynn's prematurely aged face brings authenticity to a Confederate officer who with his small group of men decides to act with honor and to accept the consequences. Flynn could act when it suited him.".

	schema:headline " Known tale of adventures  love and mystery  being the classic version based on the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson";
	schema:reviewBody "The exciting story of two brothers Scottish noblemen whose family is torn apart by the Jacobite rising of 1745  rallying all the nobles and chieftains of all the Scottish clans supporting Bonnie Prince Charlie . Bonnie Prince Charlie raises his royal standard on the 19th of August 1745 and claims the crowns of England  Scotland and Ireland in front of a gathering of Scottish nobles and chieftains . The Jacobite Rebellion has begun . During the succession debacle the House of Stuart received the support of their Catholic subjects  while King George II of the House of Hanover had the support of the Protestants . Catholic France supported the House of Stuart's claim to the English  Scottish and Irish thrones. And there took place Bonnie Prince Charlie's defeat at Culludon . Flynn plays as the forceful Jacobite Jamie Durrister  the heir to Scottish title who sets off wearing the white cockade the symbol of the cause  and he gets involved in a rebellion with Bonnie Prince Charlie against the English Crown  then the riot fails . Flynn heads for the west Indies where he and his partner and faithful servant Roger Livesey undertake several adventures . As Jamie accompanied by his new friend Irishman Francis Burke find themselves on board a smugglers ship . Both of them amass quite a fortune through piracy . As he becomes a pirate and fights against the French Capt. Arnaud Jacques Berthier. Meanwhile Jamie winning ways in fair ladies . Jamie eventually returns to Scotland where he finds that his brother has taken over his title as well as his longtime sweetheart . The outrageous Master Jamie is torn between vengeance and brotherhood  versus his brother Henry Durie Anthony Steel who has more traditional values and social wiles . The enmity between the fraternal rivals and the love for both  of the stalwart Lady Alison Beatrice Campbell is also a main theme .This is an amusing rendition based on vintage book  set in 18th century Scotland  during the Jacobite Rebellion  as the plot revolves around what happens after the brothers toss a coin to see who joins Prince Charlie and who remains to oversee the family estate . The screenplay may not be entirely correct in detail but the portrayal of the Jacobite Rebellion is both very accurate and insightful  surprisingly good for a Hollywood film . Colorful flick developing deeds about battle of Culludon and subsequent events with superb cinematography in Tecnicolor by Jack Cardiff and powerful score by William Alwyn . This classic story of romantic adventure  filmed in location  comes to life enriched by the brilliant photography  as the color of the Scotland's fields is stunning and being freely based on historical facts . A good clean fun with a legendary Scottish adventurer against the British army  the Red Coats . It is a fun adventure movie that certainly hits the mark  being plenty of action  thrills  brilliant costumes and catching score  all meld together under William Keighley 's fine direction along with a frankly excellent support cast . Combination of overwhelming battles  and full of villainy  romance  swashbuckler and heroism . Master of swashbuckling  Flynn could happily have found a better vehicle for his faculties than this entertaining rendition . Flynn's sword flashes as often as his smile . Well played by Errol who starred various Sword and Swagger films and was superstar of Warner Brothers swashbucklers . Although Errol isn't nearly at his most agile and deft style . Errol Flynn was 43 when he made this movie  but his wild lifestyle had diminished his health and made him less able to perform his own stunts  as he had in earlier films . Previously  Flynn made his best swashbucklers and played successes as Captain Blood  Adventures of Robin Hood The prince and the pauper  Sea Hawk The private lives of Elizabeth and Essex  Gentleman Jim . Flynn also performed some Westerns as Dodge City Virginia City Santa Fe Trail They died with their boots on San Antonio Silver River  Montana. And wartime movies as Objective Burma Norhern pursuit Dive Bomber  Edge of darkness  Desperate journey. Errol Flynn's last film for Warner Bros before he was released from his contract in 1952  he had been with the studio for 18 years . Nevertheless Flynn's riotous life had put him long past his peak swashbuckling days  as this movie unfortunately demonstrates it  and the 43yearold Errol was generally felt to look too old to play the dashing young hero .The Scottish Highlands are a treat for your eyes in glamorous Technicolor similarly to recent TV series Outlander . Being luxuriously shot by Cardiff who also directed some pictures and including a sensitive as well as thrilling musical score . The movie was well made by William Keighley who shot Noir Films  Each dawn I die Ladies they talk about The Street with no name G men Bullets and ballots  Costumer  The prince and the pauper Drama  Green pastures comedy  The bride came COD the man who came to dinner George Washington slept here and adventure  The Master of Balantry . However  this film would be a failure and panned by critics  it is  nowadays  best considered . The flick will appeal to adventures buffs .Other retelling about this popular novel are  TV movie 1984 by Douglas Hickox with Michael York  John Gielgud  Ian Richardson  Timothy Dalton  Nickolas Grace  Finola Hughes  Ed Bishop  Brian Blessed  Nick Brimble  TV series  1975  with Brian Cox  Julian Glover  Brigit Forsyth  Fulton Mackay and TV series  1962  with John Breslin John Cairney Hilary Thomson .".

The enmity between the fraternal rivals and the love for both  of the stalwart Lady Alison Beatrice Campbell is also a main theme .This is an amusing rendition based on vintage book  set in 18th century Scotland  during the Jacobite Rebellion  as the plot revolves around what happens after the brothers toss a coin to see who joins Prince Charlie and who remains to oversee the family estate . The screenplay may not be entirely correct in detail but the portrayal of the Jacobite Rebellion is both very accurate and insightful  surprisingly good for a Hollywood film . Colorful flick developing deeds about battle of Culludon and subsequent events with superb cinematography in Tecnicolor by Jack Cardiff and powerful score by William Alwyn . This classic story of romantic adventure  filmed in location  comes to life enriched by the brilliant photography  as the color of the Scotland's fields is stunning and being freely based on historical facts . A good clean fun with a legendary Scottish adventurer against the British army  the Red Coats . It is a fun adventure movie that certainly hits the mark  being plenty of action  thrills  brilliant costumes and catching score  all meld together under William Keighley 's fine direction along with a frankly excellent support cast . Combination of overwhelming battles  and full of villainy  romance  swashbuckler and heroism . Master of swashbuckling  Flynn could happily have found a better vehicle for his faculties than this entertaining rendition . Flynn's sword flashes as often as his smile . Well played by Errol who starred various Sword and Swagger films and was superstar of Warner Brothers swashbucklers . Although Errol isn't nearly at his most agile and deft style . Errol Flynn was 43 when he made this movie  but his wild lifestyle had diminished his health and made him less able to perform his own stunts  as he had in earlier films . Previously  Flynn made his best swashbucklers and played successes as Captain Blood  Adventures of Robin Hood The prince and the pauper  Sea Hawk The private lives of Elizabeth and Essex  Gentleman Jim . Flynn also performed some Westerns as Dodge City Virginia City Santa Fe Trail They died with their boots on San Antonio Silver River  Montana. And wartime movies as Objective Burma Norhern pursuit Dive Bomber  Edge of darkness  Desperate journey. Errol Flynn's last film for Warner Bros before he was released from his contract in 1952  he had been with the studio for 18 years . Nevertheless Flynn's riotous life had put him long past his peak swashbuckling days  as this movie unfortunately demonstrates it  and the 43yearold Errol was generally felt to look too old to play the dashing young hero .The Scottish Highlands are a treat for your eyes in glamorous Technicolor similarly to recent TV series Outlander . Being luxuriously shot by Cardiff who also directed some pictures and including a sensitive as well as thrilling musical score . The movie was well made by William Keighley who shot Noir Films  Each dawn I die Ladies they talk about The Street with no name G men Bullets and ballots  Costumer  The prince and the pauper Drama  Green pastures comedy  The bride came COD the man who came to dinner George Washington slept here and adventure  The Master of Balantry . However  this film would be a failure and panned by critics  it is  nowadays  best considered . The flick will appeal to adventures buffs .Other retelling about this popular novel are  TV movie 1984 by Douglas Hickox with Michael York  John Gielgud  Ian Richardson  Timothy Dalton  Nickolas Grace  Finola Hughes  Ed Bishop  Brian Blessed  Nick Brimble  TV series  1975  with Brian Cox  Julian Glover  Brigit Forsyth  Fulton Mackay and TV series  1962  with John Breslin John Cairney Hilary Thomson .";

His novel is beautifully written but is also episodic dark and ultimately tragic the two brothers ultimately kill each other.  It has a sense of isolation only an exile could have and although one of Stevenson's best works it doesn't lend itself to a Hollywood adaptation the way Kidnapped and Treasure Island do.  The movie ends with the warring brothers in happy reconciliation it also ends with a zesty lighthearted spirit completely at odds with Stevenson's dour irony but completely in tune with Errol Flynn.  Despite some comparable plotpoints the film has little in common with the original novel's themes and characters.  No matter this movie is fun. Yes Flynn looks a little worn a decadent life was leaving its mark on a beautiful face.  However he still looks fit and handsome and his jaded weary eyes actually suit his role.  In my opinion he never played a lustier characternot even Don Juan.  Maybe the location shooting unleashed his impish side because after the crew left Sicily to finish work in England Flynn stayed on an extra two weeks vacationing in the sun to his heart's content while he blithely held up cast and crew!Flynn with his happy amorality may not be Stevenson's Master but he is the master of Hollywood swashbucklers and this is his fourth best one.  It isn't up to Adventures of Robin Hood or even The Sea Hawk or Adventures of Don Juan but like another reviewer I'll take it over Captain Blood.".

	schema:headline " Dreadful travesty of Stevenson masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "How bad can a movie get? This misguided swashbuckler was evidently intended as a boost for the legendary Errol Flynn's fading career. The cheesy acting unbearable love scenes and supporting performances Brigadoonstyle costumes what was it with those nonperiod tartan leggings and sparklingclean pirate outfits? and worst of all embarrassing script with scarcely a trace of Robert Louis Stevenson make one wish that Warner Brothers had junked the screenplay by Herb Meadow and additional dialogue by Harold Medford.They might have done better instead to have adopted the 1951 Classics Illustrated comicbook adaptation by Kenneth W. Fitch artwork by Lawrence Dresser as storyboards and script. Seriously.

The cheesy acting unbearable love scenes and supporting performances Brigadoonstyle costumes what was it with those nonperiod tartan leggings and sparklingclean pirate outfits? and worst of all embarrassing script with scarcely a trace of Robert Louis Stevenson make one wish that Warner Brothers had junked the screenplay by Herb Meadow and additional dialogue by Harold Medford.They might have done better instead to have adopted the 1951 Classics Illustrated comicbook adaptation by Kenneth W. Fitch artwork by Lawrence Dresser as storyboards and script. Seriously.

However viewing it on its own terms while nowhere near one of Errol Flynn's best films it is decent with its fun and charms.Starting with the good points and there are a good many here what definitely stands out is the vividly colourful cinematography which captures the elegant costumes and handsomely rendered settings perfectly. William Alwyn's music score is appropriately rousing and bombastic it's no Korngold but it suits the film very well and adds a lot to it. Smart witty scripting some slick action including the very amusing pirate scenes and an easygoing chemistry between Errol Flynn and Roger Livesey are further things to like as are the more than able direction and the generally fun and thrilling second half. In the supporting roles Roger Livesey really comes to hugely enjoyable life in the type of role associated with Alan Hale and the rest of the cast do credibly including lovely leading lady Beatrice Campbell.For all those good things however The Master of Ballantrae also has its faults. Despite his gallant charm twinkling eyes and dashing smile Flynn is not in his best form here he looks out of shape from his drinking and fatigued and the action lacks his usual enthusiastic energy. He does handle the more dramatic scenes reasonably well though. Didn't care for the narration either the news report delivery felt out of place and it wasn't very necessary either and ground the first half to a standstill in places. More show and less tell would have made things better. The first half has a good deal of fun and charm but the second half is noticeably crisper in pace. And while one shouldn't expect another Adventures of Robin Hood or Adventures of Don Juan climax the climax here was rather anaemically choreographed and lacked excitement.All in all decent with a lot of good merits but a little disappointing for Flynn and Stevenson fans. 610 Bethany Cox".

I always felt that it deserved more attention and props than NP his most well known simply because the humor was more consistent throughout and the comedic timing especially with Jerry as Gerald Clamson couldn't have been better. Some great examples include him and the bellhop during an awkward moment involving a tip. Another one involves him and an elderly Chinese man at the pearl shop at Sea World. His remark about Confucious is the stuff of legend. So is the man's reaction. I also felt that NP was lacking in good supporting characters that were wacky enough to hold there own against Clamson. This is why the movie fizzles and becomes somewhat stale early on. Nothing for him to play off of. FJ had plenty of characters but they were all played by Jerry Lewis. In other words that movie suffered from Lewis overload. The Big Mouth is a perfect balance of all these elements. Though it may lose some of its pacing around the second half the movie is well worth at least a rental simply for the first. If you suddenly crave some good silliness that will actually make you laugh from time to time this is the Jerry Lewis movie for you if you can find it.p.s.for Hojean this is the one you're thinking of.".

Harland Sanders of KFC and a view of early Sea World in San Diego. When I worked there in 1985 I found all the places that the film was shot. And the best of all is Charlie Callas' totally hilarious bit when he sees the appranently dead Sid Valentine Lewis' other role come to life again. He comes apart as do his other friends but with much more panache and skill. His stuttering eyepopping gibberish is so funny you have to watch the same dialogue over and over again. It's a classic bit and one that actually saves the film from being a total Lewis stinker. That's him thats him that's aaaahh that's imPOSSIBLE!".

Heck the 3 parts where Lewis hides out from the Mob inside a kabuki theater onstage joining the cast in full kabukimakeup adlibbing gibberish Japanese lines is absolutely sidesplitting entertainment and still makes me convulse in laughter 50 years later.Jerry died yesterday at age 91 God rest his soul.

Heck the 3 parts where Lewis hides out from the Mob inside a kabuki theater onstage joining the cast in full kabukimakeup adlibbing gibberish Japanese lines is absolutely sidesplitting entertainment and still makes me convulse in laughter 50 years later.Jerry died yesterday at age 91 God rest his soul. Do yourself a favor and go rent the underrated 1967's Big Mouth and watch a comic legend at his finest.";

We found the experience a surreal one. A comedy film where nobody in the theater laughed including us absolutely no laughter. We caught on quicker than the adults that this was a complete sham but were spellbound waiting for a single funny sequence that would shatter the audience silence. It never happened.Afterward we scanned newspaper and magazine reviews for some sign that a prominent reviewer was going to spill the beans and expose the Emperor but there was nothing.

The Big Month deserves a place in cinema history because it was this bottoming out process that opened the door for innovative stuff like Bonnie  Clyde and Easy Rider in mainstream theaters.In fairness the chase sequences might have had some amusement value except they had been done much better by Harvey Lembeck playing Eric Von Zipper in countless beach movies released earlier in the decade.The only saving grace at the time for us 14yearolds was that Jeannine Riley Billie Jo from Petticoat Junction was featured in several eyescorching outfits.

There's also funny scenes of Jerry in a phone booth trying to get to the police as well as of police officers arguing what a certain code means as Jerry is stopped while speeding. And I did like Jerry both when he's normal and in disguise. The Bad The Asian stereotypes. It's especially embarrassing to see Star Trek player George Takei playing this kind of role as a henchman who suffers a tragic fate. Also I didn't like the dialogue exchange between Lewis and leading lady Susan Bay about his problem. Such double entendre has no place in a family comedy like this I know there's some violence but somehow that's more acceptable here. And the chase climax was pretty lame. Overall this was pretty enjoyable despite some of the more objectionable material I cited. So on that note I did like The Big Mouth. P.S. I didn't recognize Rob Reiner or Charo in their cameos so either I missed them or IMDb got it wrong.

Some described it as being among Jerry Lewis' worst films though I think films like Which Way to the Front? Cracking Up Slapstick of Another Kind and Three on a Couch are much much worse. And it certainly is no work of great genius like some have said. It's a decent little timepasser with a few faults.When the film begins Jerry is fishing and somehow hooks onto someone in a wetsuit. The guy ends up being a gangster who could be Jerry's double and he tells Jerry about some hidden loot. As for Jerry he wants to do the right thing and tries to get police and others to listen to his account of catching the man...but no one seems willing to listen. And as for the gangsters who shot the man Jerry caught they are now looking for the fisherman because they think the dead man must have told him about the money. Despite this being the theme the movie is almost plot less at times a bit like The Bellboy...which isn't all bad since this earlier Lewis film is among his best. Now I am not saying all the silliness or Jerry's dressing up like the Nutty Professor work most of the time...but it is pleasant and diverting during much of the film. Overall no bomb nor work of genius but a generally decent little film that will offer a few laughs...just a few. There certainly could have been more laughs and Charlie Callas was simply awful...but fortunately he was only used sparingly in the picture. Also awful was Lewis' embarrassingly bad imitation of Japanese folks...a definite low point in the film...or in any film that came out that year.By the way look quickly and you might spot Rob Reiner in his film debut. You'll also see Colonel Sanders...though he is pretty obvious!".

Yesterday I saw the film again in its original English version. My goodness what a difference! The film is even more frightening that I remembered. The atmosphere is asphyxiating. You can actually smell the rotting stench of the most beautiful city in the world. The ending leaves you breathless and the acting well listening to the actors real voices is another experience altogether. The pain and sudden burst of hope in Julie Christie is moving very moving and very unsettling. Sutherland as usual is magnificent. The film other than a solid cult status remains virtually unknown by the public at large. Don't Look Now is a buried treasure that is bound to be re discovered and to all my countrymen a piece of advise avoid dubbed movies at all cost.".

Nicolas Roeg plays with our instincts with our inner voices and challenge us to take notice. Just like Donald Sutherland's character. He knows even if his brain tells him not to be stupid. To believe is to commit intellectual suicide. Better not to look not to listen. Sutherland and Christie are one of the most convincing modern artistic yet normal married couples in their pain in their every daily detail. Sutherland goes along with Christie's nonsense because he sees what the nonsense does for her. They make love for the first time since their daughter's death in a way we've never seen before on the screen and probably never will again. Based on a Daphne Du Maurier's book Nicolas Roeg has orchestrated a chilling work of art.

	schema:reviewBody "There are two types of horror films really. There are popcorn horror films good for a cheap inthemoment thrill at best and there are serious horror films movies that linger in the mind and in the bones. I have just watched Nicolas Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' and my spine is frozen. It's 4am I'm alone and I have a heightened awareness of sounds and sights I usually don't notice.Here is a movie that's both resolved and unresolved ultimately growing more ambiguous as it progresses and becomes more complex. After it is over and has become a completed work to the eye of the viewer the lasting impression is that of mystery. Too many films in this genre bark up the wrong tree working to explain all of the events that unfold. By explaining nothing by being almost abstract questions and images will haunt the viewer indefinitely. It is what it is and while this movie can be watched over and over and the events that occur can be anticipated they will forever remain an enigma. This is true cinema purely visual and aural without the helpful but ultimately selfdefeating aid of a proxy observer the viewer is the direct observer and there's no filter through which the events and images develop any sort of tidy rationality.Donald Sutherland's performance here is sober adult the grief of his character palpable. And in the face of this grief is a force that runs through the movie like a dark current evoking the eternal and spookily ethereal and subterranean less an eternity of the heavens than the eternity of a crypt. Venice is not merely the ideal location for this story but the necessary location it could not take place anywhere else. The unquestionable and indeed imposing Gothic majesty of the churches whose interior height dwarfs their human occupants with the spiritual dread of the ancient overlooks the canals of Venice like the wickedfaced stone gargoyles Sutherland finds himself physically embracing while the canals that run through the city are literally the ghost of this couple's personal tragedy. Living in Venice in light of the details surrounding their loss seems almost a perverse choice perhaps a masochistic one they could be punishing themselves for their daughter's drowning by living in a flooded city.It's not that Sutherland's character is a rational man in an irrational environment but rather a rational man in an environment whose own secret code which one may trust makes perfect sense to itself like a tree in the forest that will only fall if no one is around to hear is inaccessible and inexplicable to him baring itself only in fragments in a way he chooses to ignore just as you might ignore a spectral voice in the dead of night dismissing it as a product of your imagination.The movie's notorious love scene is jarringly explicit yet rather than erotic it is profoundly sad and takes on a deeper even creepy resonance after the film ends. That the scene is intercut with scenes of Sutherland and Julie Christie dressing prevents the two from ever being completely naked and united this editing choice changes the dimensions of the love scene in a way that I've never seen attempted elsewhere. At other points Roeg inserts moments and images that carry sinister implications none of which are ever concretely substantiated and only leave the viewer with more questions.The film drifts along at a wandering pace. The final twenty minutes are among the most atmospheric and suspenseful twenty minutes in any film culminating in a montage that is absolutely chilling.'The Blair Witch Project' made over two decades later and probably influenced by this has similar aspirations but finally has only a fraction of the emotional gravity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it is bad luck that Don't Look Now was released in the same year as The Exorcist or else this might be a better known and more appreciated one of a kind masterpiece.Don't Look Now is an horror movie but not one like you would expect it to be. It isn't a movie that scares you with some scene's it is a movie that gets into you and just won't let go and builds up a nightmare like tension. The atmosphere is fantastic and gives the movie a haunting feeling. Venice really works as the perfect backdrop for this movie. The best movie set in Venice ever? Even though there aren't any scary sequences in the movie the ending is really horrifying it really freaked me out the first time I saw it I think 5 years ago. On my second viewing not too long ago I was prepared for the ending but it still was a very scary thing to watch!The storytelling might seem slow but it works perfect for the movie and its tension. There are some brilliant moments in the movie that all come together once the ending approaches. The editing and cinematography are perfect as are the performances by the cast.And what is a decent comment without mentioning the famous love scene? Ah yes the love scene it really is one of the best love scene's ever. It is brilliantly filmed and even more brilliantly edited.

	onyx:emotionText "I think it is bad luck that Don't Look Now was released in the same year as The Exorcist or else this might be a better known and more appreciated one of a kind masterpiece.Don't Look Now is an horror movie but not one like you would expect it to be. It isn't a movie that scares you with some scene's it is a movie that gets into you and just won't let go and builds up a nightmare like tension. The atmosphere is fantastic and gives the movie a haunting feeling. Venice really works as the perfect backdrop for this movie. The best movie set in Venice ever? Even though there aren't any scary sequences in the movie the ending is really horrifying it really freaked me out the first time I saw it I think 5 years ago. On my second viewing not too long ago I was prepared for the ending but it still was a very scary thing to watch!The storytelling might seem slow but it works perfect for the movie and its tension.

Its setting in Venice is both beautiful and menacing. Something terrible is always just around the corner from our conscious mind. It is also troubling and as only a good movie can leaves more questions unanswered than resolved. Without a doubt it contains one of the most beautiful loves scenes ever filmed showing scenes of Christie and Sutherland in genuinely erotic by '70's standards lovemaking mixed with scenes of the couple as they dress and prepare for their day the following morning.

	schema:reviewBody "I love it when you come across a film in which you can tell the director is in complete control. Directors like Stanley Kubrick Brian De Palma and Nicolas Roeg are some of the first that come to mind. It seems that so much thought goes into every scene yet the thinking isn't always lateral. They have an ability to make what would otherwise be a completely ordinary scene something utterly unique and thoughtprovoking. The end product is almost always a delight to watch and what Roeg has produced here with 'Don't Look Now' is no exception.There's quite a bizarre feel watching this film. From the rather odd characters not just the small parts either but the lead roles as well the Italian language that is rarely explained to us what is actually being said and an odd story that isn't entirely clear where it is going. If handled wrongly all this could equal an absolute mess of a film. However in the case of 'Don't Look Now' Roeg keeps us convinced that he has some tricks up his sleeve and this makes for a very fun viewing experience trying to work out where exactly this is all headed.Where it is headed is to a quite brilliant ending. I'll admit I had to go back and watch the ending again to make sure I fully understood what I had just witnessed. This only confirmed to me though that it was indeed an ingenious way to finish the film. This is the type of movie that either demands you go back and watch it again or else leaves you thinking about it for days to come.'Don't Look Now' may not be for everyone. I imagine it to be quite a polarising film in that way. If you aren't enjoying it in the early stages chances are you aren't really going to enjoy it at all. I can only assure you that it is worth persisting with and just excepting the oddness that will creep up at times. A really good film that deserves all the recognition it gets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't Look Now is a strange horror film in that it doesn't rely on the usual horror genre staples in order to be successful. Rather than be gratuitous on the gore atmosphere and shocks front Don't Look Now simply presents it's story and the horror almost seems like an afterthought. Usually films like this annoy me because they obviously want to portray the horror but skirt around it in order to not be put in with the less intelligent offerings from the genre but this one clearly cares about it's story and characters and never really sets out to scare. The film therefore comes off as being assured and well handled throughout and even though the plot is slow the film can never be described as boring because there's always enough bubbling under the surface of the immediate goings on in order to keep the viewers' interest. The plot is shrouded with mystery and follows a father who finds his daughter drowned in a nearby lake. He and his wife then move to picturesque Venice but the memory of their daughter cannot be laid to rest after a blind psychic tells the woman that she has seen her daughter may still be alive.I love the horror genre but I admit that a large proportion of it can't be compared among the true classics of cinema due largely to a lack of production values good acting or a decent script that is coherent with the story and characters. Don't Look Now however often appears on film lists amongst the classics because this is one of the films that is strong in those areas. The acting is first rate with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie giving brilliant brooding performances that are in line with their characters and the film's plot. Sutherland can be something of a onenote actor but when a performer is given the right material it allows them to shine and his role in this film fits him like a glove. One of the main compliments that this film gets is the cinematography as the film expertly captures the beauty of it's central location. Venice's canals and dark alleys are as much a part of this film as the plot itself and it is testament to Nicolas Roeg's directorial talent that this has been expertly captured in a way that helps the film. On the whole this is a fine horror film that will be enjoyed by anyone that is willing to put time and effort into it. It's also worth noting that this film pays it's viewers at the climax with one of the best twist endings in the horror genre. Highly recommended!".

So a dwarf hacks Donald Sutherland once in the neck and he dies. Frankly he probably deserved it for subjecting the viewers to his flaccid pale awkward body in a prolonged painful sex scene with costar Julie Christie. Easily the scariest part of the film right there.I was bothered by the 'plot' in Don't Look Now and I use the term plot very loosely because there just isn't much of one. I'll sum it up for you Donald Sutherland and wife lose child in drowning accident. They go to Venice so Sutherland can restore a church. Some boring stuff happens for almost two hours then the Sutherland gets hacked one time by a dwarf in a red coat that looks similar to the one his daughter was wearing. In the end my reaction was WHO CARES? I wanna know about that ugly little dwarf dammit! That would have made for a much better flick than what I just sat through! Don't bother watching this if you haven't seen the 1970's Italian horror films of Argento Fulci Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado first. This one attempts to rob from those films but does so very poorly. To those of us who are seasoned giallo vets this will prove to be a maddening overhyped jumbled mess that cannot hold a candle to the real thing.Scary?

	schema:reviewBody "Horrible muddled adaptation of a compelling short story. Donald Sutherland plays John Baxter who restores old Venetian churches or something like that. Julie Christie plays his wife. Both of them are actually pretty good and close to how Du Maurier wrote the original characters. But soon enough we're subjected to a bizarre extended sex scene that is intercut with footage of the couple getting dressed. Not only does this make absolutely no sense we also have to look at Donald Sutherland's bony ass for six or seven minutes. There's other strange scenes and confusing red herrings thrown in that really do nothing to advance the story including a slightly sinister Catholic bishop who wasn't in the original source material. The religious imagery and aspects to this film keep suggesting that it's about to turn into something like The Omen but it never does which is a shame because even an Omen ripoff would have been more welcome than this thing. The director would have done better to follow the original story a bit closer  if you haven't read it you'll be lost watching this mess and you'll have to be content with enjoying onlocation footage of early 1970s Venice Italy which is one of this film's few redeeming qualities.".

He also had a similar view of Memento which I thought was excellent. Bearing this in mind coupled with the reviews I had read I sat down to watch this with my Brother. I was horrified at the complete nonsense before me. I found the acting from Julie Christie to be incredibly wooden a blank look on her face most of the time Donald Sutherland was slightly better but his ridiculous hairstyle didn't help. The dialogue was totally ridiculous and clichd and the lines were delivered badly. The Sex Scene was absolute nonsense it seemed staged and not natural and was badly shot you could easily tell they were acting or trying to. Admittedly I only watched the first 75 mins but the story pace and intensity did not look like it was getting any better. My Brother and I mutually agreed to turn over to see what else was on as we had reached the same conclusion regarding this film. The Boring attempts to be chilling were very badly done i.e the two old women one with second sight and the poorly staged sance etc.  maybe in the 1970's this may have seemed chilling. But the film certainly does not stand the test of time. There have been far better films of this type made. For Instance this film was not in the class of The Sixth Sense. I am not addicted to Blockbusters and crap like Armageddon and The Fast and the Furious so this is not down to my IQ. I often seek out small low budget films of different genres and appreciate them.".

Oh trust me there's no story at all.  And there's not a trace of suspense or surprise until the very end which comes out of left field and is very silly.  This is the kind of movie where normal everyday events are supposed to be scary merely because a stinger was added to the musical score.  If you watch it with the sound off I guarantee you will fall asleep in minutes! The other really annoying habit of this movie is its tendency to show something innocuous like a broach and zoom in on it as if this is something important that we're supposed to be interested in.  In every single case it turns out to be completely irrelevant.  As a result the viewer is actually conditioned to ignore the movie's details...if the director won't play fair by giving these scenes a payoff why bother paying attention at all?  Overall the only emotion this film can create is confusion and a deep deep desire to shut the damn thing off halfway through.  3 out of 10.".

The movie tries to say things tries to be deep and totally fails at it. The only thing symbolic was the red coat the rest was a lot of nonsense. This is a movie for dumbpretentious people who think they are watching something 'suspenseful and complex' something they can chat at the water cooler about discussing the socalled 'symbolism' or 'layers' this movie has in an attempt to look intelligent maybe... that's the only reason I could think of for someone to call this movie complex. The movie in fact does have layers but none of them are particularly interesting to the viewer. Quality over quantity is something that is forgotten a lot. What good are the layers the suspense the actors the location when the story is just plain absurd and 100 uninteresting. The ending is also ludicrously bad and really brings the whole film down even further. It's honestly laughable to watch this movie knowing that someone has tried to create a mysterious and chilling piece of cinema and has ended up with a pretentious clunky nonentity of a movie. I admit this movie could be worse but it just goes nowhere and in my opinion does not make an entertaining movie. People who like riveting story lines and honestly good movies will be bored. People who like Donald Sutherland naked faux paranormal mumbo jumbo or stupid schlock horror movies may like this. Those people have poor taste.

Aside the beautiful Julie Christie the acting was average with Donald Sutherland looking very unconvincing. I should stress that not an awful lot happens in this film.

Director Nicholas Roeg never met a trendy 1970s film trick that he didn't like and so this movie is full of zooms both in and out jarring camera work and harsh earsplitting sound effects. I guess he's trying for a nervejangling effect but it all seems like a lot of fuss and bother over nothing. This is an assemblage of disconnected scenes badly in need of a story.The most frightening thing about Don't Look Now is the extended lovemaking scene that assaults us with a fully nude Donald Sutherland.

	schema:reviewBody "Don't look now is a true masterpiece. The first time I watched it I went into it assuming I was in for a regular run of the mill ghost story. Oh no. I was very wrong. This movie is far more than just a ghost story actually. The film drops us into the life of a grieving married couple who are played by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie and their performances are wonderful. they have great chemistry. that just lost their daughter. The first question that I as the viewer asked myself was is the ghost of their daughter trying to contact them? If so what for? To warn them? If so of what? Many questions already enter your mind as the film is only just beginning. we are left in the dark for much of the film which is an important aspect in regards to what makes the film so suspenseful and mysterious. the plot is not spoon fed to you and requires you to actually think about the characters and the story. this forces you to get immersed in the film. the movie just keeps us guessing the entire time the story progresses in different directions and creates more questions. Is the figure in the red coat the ghost of the couple's deceased daughter? Is the serial murderer running around Venice supposed to be what their daughter's ghost is attempting to warn them about? that is if she is actually trying to warn them at all. is their daughter's spirit even present. or is it just that the couple are so damaged its all in their heads? The freaky elderly woman foretell a dark future for the couple and tell them to leave Venice before it's to late. All of these questions merge into one huge suspenseful masterwork that has your heart pounding out of your chest by the time the last 20 minutes are before us. The climax of this film literally had my eyes glued to the screen and my teeth clenched as I sat in the dark in pure suspense. I won't reveal anymore about the plot because I feel as if I've already revealed to much. On to the cinematography. The camera work lighting and set design are all TOP notch. Not to mention the score is absolutely pulsepounding. As well on top of all this the acting is superb on everybody's part. We even get a beautiful and intimately filmed sex scene to add to the drama. it is not just there for entertainment. the scene is filmed with such beauty and intimacy that it strengthens your connection with the leads. There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this film. It really is one of the best horror films ever made. Just go watch it right now and be in awe.The verdict 1010 a masterpiece that's so suspenseful you won't even know what to do with yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got to see this film after buying it in Singapore. I had heard very little about it from horror fans so I put the disc in last night and was prepared to be underwhelmed. But from the opening scrawl I was hooked by the atmosphere. The film was really enjoyable to watch and while I had some worries at first about its short runtime about 87 minutes by the climax I had none. As other reviewers out there have said despite its lack of length the film has the feeling of a 2 hour film. This is probably due to its slow burn something that I adore a lot of Asian horror for. The film builds up a strong foreboding atmosphere before descending into one of the more memorable climaxes I have witnessed in the genre.It seems that the film has copped a lot of flak from fans and critics and it is perhaps due to the idea that video game films can't possibly be good. I have never played the games instead just drooling over the cases in shops and admiring the artwork. From what I can gather the film follows the second game in the series and does so pretty closely with of course some inevitable changes that restraints require. Unlike many films adapted from games Siren actually contains some clever plotting and dense atmosphere. Here characters are typically over the top and quirky. In some ways the film reminded me a little of Uzumaki in its offkilter approach though Uzumaki went to an extreme in that. Some may say that one major detail is telegraphed a mile away but unlike another film with a similar idea I don't think that Siren is trying to keep it such a big secret. The fact that knew that something wasn't right from the get go really added to the suspense.Get the R3 the subs are great and the picture quality is quite good and it is anamorphic. The only let down is perhaps going to be inherent in all versions and is that the DVD only has a Dolby Digital 2.0 audio track. I haven't been able to check if the Japanese DVD has DD 5.1 or DTS. However despite the stereo audio I could here some great separation through my speakers and as a Prologic II track it didn't sound so much like one. Other than that there are almost no extras of note in fact there are only 3 versions of the movie trailer and what does one need them for when they have the film? I have never understood the inclusion of trailers as extras for that reason. I would liked to see some SFX reels or even bloopers but perhaps in a film such as this one the budget didn't allow much room for trial and error.In all the film was easy to watch and not too challenging yet still carrying with it an aura of freshness. There are no dark haired ghosts though if it did how could one complain about it when the majority of people living in Japan have such hair and the budget of the film keeps the production honest and small. The film has a slow build up that may dismay viewers of short attention spans or a lust for blood but the climax is quite gripping and helps elevate the film beyond where it may have settled without it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forbidden Siren is based upon the Siren 2 Playstation 2 so many 2s game. Like most video game turned movies I would say the majority don't translate into a different medium really well. And that goes for this one too painfully.There's a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer Leo Morimoto and his children daughter Yuki Yui Ichikawa and son Hideo Jun Nishiyama come to move into. The villagers don't look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing.Naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants. But in truth you will not bother with what's going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more. What was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly illplacedoutofthenorm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until it's explained much later. It's one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered.Despite it clocking in under 90 minutes  I think it's a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark  it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to. Things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but it's a classic case of too little too late.What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end. Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience. It turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as you'll feel cheated somewhat. There are two ways a twist will make you feel  it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling. Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter.The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but I will be that explicit  it's still not worth the time so better to avoid this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forbidden Siren is a mixed bag of a movie. Yes it's another video game movie. But unlike House of the Dead this one is capable of holding your attention and is sufficiently frightening.The story follows a young woman named Yuki who has moved to the island of Yame with her father and little brother. From the getgo things on the island don't seem right. The villagers are strange and unfriendly. Throughout the movie Yuki seems to have a hard time keeping up with her wandering little brother Hideo and has strange encounters with a woman in red. And then she is given an ominous warning never go outside when the siren wails.It's a good premise for a horrorthriller movie. And I must admit that conceptually this film is strong a feature which complements the awesome directing. That's why it's a shame that Forbidden Siren's ending is so poor. This movie excels in almost every area and would have been a great Asian horror if not for the ending. I won't spoil anything but suffice to say that if someone tried to submit a story with a trick ending like we see in Forbidden Siren to any major magazine they would not be published.The ending of any story is crucial and they teach you not to write trick endings because they are deceptive and ultimately let your audience down. Which is what we observe happening in Forbidden Siren. We are built up from the very beginning to believe that something memorable and shocking is coming at the end then it's just a big let down.I was tempted to give this movie a 5 instead of a 6 however I was impressed by the good scares and the originality of the plot even if they could have gone in SO many interesting directions with it. These days it isn't often that you find a good Asian horror film that doesn't center around a vengeful ghost picking off a small group of young adults. So Forbidden Siren gets a 6 out of 10. Watch it and enjoy the creative scares and smart direction then when you get to the climax turn it off and make up your own ending. Trust me you can't do any worse than they did.".

	onyx:emotionText "Forbidden Siren is a mixed bag of a movie. Yes it's another video game movie. But unlike House of the Dead this one is capable of holding your attention and is sufficiently frightening.The story follows a young woman named Yuki who has moved to the island of Yame with her father and little brother. From the getgo things on the island don't seem right. The villagers are strange and unfriendly. Throughout the movie Yuki seems to have a hard time keeping up with her wandering little brother Hideo and has strange encounters with a woman in red. And then she is given an ominous warning never go outside when the siren wails.It's a good premise for a horrorthriller movie.

A cute but slight story worth your time.By the way the Irish priest Arthur Shields might well remind you of Barry Fitzgerald by his look and performance. Well that's because despite the different stage names Shields WAS Barry Fitzgerald's brother! Also while a small role I loved Rudolf Anders' performance later in the film. Seeing this German commander losing his mind was HIGHLY entertaining and his phone conversation was the best part of the film.".

	schema:headline " Nice tongueincheek WW II comedy before the Allies enter Rome";
	schema:reviewBody "The Pigeon That Took Rome is a very entertaining World War II film. Another reviewer stated that Charlton Heston doesn't do well in a comedy role. I think that's probably true generally. But in this film his character is perfect for the plot. This is a tongue incheek comedy about World War II in Rome before the Allies have taken the city. Things weren't very funny to the Italians then  even though they are a people who tend to take things in stride and still see humor in difficult times. There's much more to this but one must save some of the details that new viewers will enjoy more without foreknowledge. Heston's persona fits so well because of the very fact that he doesn't belong doing spy work or undercover work. He tells that to his CO when Col. Harrington sends him on his assignment. Heston protests that he is a line solder who fights and works best with the ranks in the field. So when he gets to Rome through the Italian resistance he clearly doesn't fit in. And that's part of the humor because he and Elsa Martinelli's character Antonella Massimo go at one another often. If that were all there was to this assignment the film indeed would not be that funny. But Harry Guardino is tossed into the pot as Sgt. Joseph Angelico a GI who speaks Italian and he's to help MacDougall. Guardino's character adds a light touch that mellows out the spats and he provides for a nice romantic aspect of the film with Antonella's sister in the film Rosalba played by Gabriella Pallotta. All of the cast are excellent in this film. The head of the Massimo household and the Italian resistance is the widower father Ciccio played superbly by Salvatore Baccoloni. He was an opera singer as well as an occasional movie actor. Heston has a double role as Captain Paul MacDougall and as Benny the Snatch a fictitious member of his squad. Captain MacDougall is the Snatch. And he also narrates the story  after the fact. His tongueincheek is very funny at times. A hilarious scene to me is when he watches as the stolen pigeons which at the time he didn't know were stolen dutifully fly back home right to Nazi headquarters. MacDougall learns that the Allied homing pigeons had been the main course at the dinner to announce the engagement to the Massimo's extended family of daughter Rosalba to Sgt. Angelico. Well all the pigeons but one but MacDougall didn't know that Antonella had spared one for its carrier missions. So with the new knowledge in hand MacDougall sends a message poignantly intended for the Germans. And the German commander's reaction is very funny. Even funnier is that MacDougall and Angaelico watch as the last four pigeons are released and only three of them fly to Nazi headquarters. The other  the last true blue Allied pigeon that Antonella had spared unbeknownst to MacDougall flies south to the Allied lines. And the message intended for the Germans' eyes is such good news to the Allies that they press the attack and quickly push the Germans back and take Rome. This film is just good fun even if the romance of the Heston and Martinelli characters at the end seems a bit contrived considering how much and often they were at each other's throats through much of the film. As one other reviewer noted its best just to disconnect one's brains and sit back to enjoy this film.".

In the 60's these type of films were still made and still are to this day I suppose but the 60's tried to tweak the date war movie by adding comedy along with the love interest and war combat. This one has little war drama little love interest mostly light hearted and sad to say little comedy that works well it was made for its target audience of the day mid aged WW2 vets and their wives and it was probably very well received. I will say that I did chuckle a couple of times so it's not a total loss and everyone seems to act well and it was regarded well in it's time to receive some notice from the Academy these points and with Charlton Heston makes it worth watching for war movie buffs.

True Fernand Gravey was never much of an actor and as has been noted was too old to pass for a student  'mature' students were more or less unknown at the time  but provided you didn't ask him to 'act' anything more demanding than bemusement he could get by. It's also a joy to see Micheline Presle in her prime  she continues to act to this day including small roles in films written and directed by her talented daughter Tonie Marshall  and understand just why she was so prominent among French actresses. Marcel L'Herbier was of course himself a veteran who deserves to be much better remembered than he is and here he turns in a charming melange of comedy drama and fantasy predicated on student Gravey being so worn out from holding down two jobs AND trying to study that he is prone to fall asleep anywhere and dream of a mysterious  but beautiful natch  lady in white which amateur psychologists would say was trying to tell him something about his reallife unfaithful girlfriend. In a masterstroke L'Herbier allows Gravey to 'enter' his dream  paving the way for Cocteau to put spin on the technique in Orphee  and set up a story within a story with more twists than a bag of pretzels. Bernard Blier  who would also father a future director Bertrand  is also on hand to add a little class and Saturnin Fabre chews the scenery to everyone's satisfaction. Overall a fine movie and one I'll be adding to my 'wants' list to France and Norway.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Nuit Fantastique as directed by Marcel l'Herbier... Those who have watched the director's silent classics l'Argent or l'Inhumaine may have their expectations upset by this movie. Stylistically it is poles apart. It is all fun chic and froth nothing much serious going on.The plot is very simple Denis a French arts student tends to fall asleep during his nighttime work at the flower market. He has dreams of a beautiful woman in white and falls in love with her. One night whilst asleep he follows her on a series of fantastic adventures beset by charming villains on all sides. As mentioned elsewhere it is ludicrous to believe that Fernand Gravey is young enough to be a student. On the whole though I thought his performance made him a lot more youthful full of ephebe sensitivity and brass boyish insolence and naivety. As in all art but here particularly disbelief must willingly be suspended and there will be ample reward. Christiane Nre is brilliant as Gravey's waking girlfriendshrew who competes with the dream lady. Saturnin Fabre as Professor Thales hams it up brilliantly with the most superb facial expressions you'll ever see. You'll notice that no place names or dates are given this adds to the intensity of atmosphere. I think it could be quite easy to mistake this movie for an auteur's potboiler. However quite a lot of care obviously went into making this truly escapist fantasy the characters get to play dress up make love on roofs thwart dream plots thumb there noses at suitors sleep in flower markets etc. And in my opinion the craft and the acting are seamless. Quite a lot of shadows in this film probably due to lack of budget but makes for true magic realism.Tale a holiday from yourself a purely ecstatic rollercoaster of dream logic awaits see if you can get your hands on the OOP DVD mine cost a pretty penny. N.B. This movie deserves to win the award for worst opening credits ever truly shocking don't let them put you off.".

It is all fun chic and froth nothing much serious going on.The plot is very simple Denis a French arts student tends to fall asleep during his nighttime work at the flower market. He has dreams of a beautiful woman in white and falls in love with her. One night whilst asleep he follows her on a series of fantastic adventures beset by charming villains on all sides. As mentioned elsewhere it is ludicrous to believe that Fernand Gravey is young enough to be a student. On the whole though I thought his performance made him a lot more youthful full of ephebe sensitivity and brass boyish insolence and naivety. As in all art but here particularly disbelief must willingly be suspended and there will be ample reward. Christiane Nre is brilliant as Gravey's waking girlfriendshrew who competes with the dream lady. Saturnin Fabre as Professor Thales hams it up brilliantly with the most superb facial expressions you'll ever see. You'll notice that no place names or dates are given this adds to the intensity of atmosphere. I think it could be quite easy to mistake this movie for an auteur's potboiler. However quite a lot of care obviously went into making this truly escapist fantasy the characters get to play dress up make love on roofs thwart dream plots thumb there noses at suitors sleep in flower markets etc. And in my opinion the craft and the acting are seamless. Quite a lot of shadows in this film probably due to lack of budget but makes for true magic realism.Tale a holiday from yourself a purely ecstatic rollercoaster of dream logic awaits see if you can get your hands on the OOP DVD mine cost a pretty penny. N.B. This movie deserves to win the award for worst opening credits ever truly shocking don't let them put you off.";

Perhaps not as important or shocking as the 1931 version yes I have seen it but still an interesting film. I especially like the outdoors shots in this film. The scene where Frulein Von Bernburg gives Manuela one of her own shirts is lovely. I understood Romy Schneider was attempting to lose her Sissi image at the time. She succeeded in my opinion. My mum was somewhat surprised after watching it but in the end she decided she liked it after all. So do I. Seven points out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got to know this film through an extract of the famous kiss scene but I felt this short part already so powerful and sensual that I immediately wanted to see all of it.A film should be valued for what it is independently of the fact that is a remake or not. The original Madchen in Uniform was banned and censored for decades most of the copies were even destroyed by Nazis we are not even sure today that the remaining material is fully the original one. Making a remake of it in color with contemporary and appreciated actresses was absolutely topical and courageous and the resulting indignation showed perfectly that the main theme was not only taboo in 1910 and 1931 but still in 1958.For me this film is much more about love than about sexuality between women. In this boarding school where the only man is a small photography in one of the lockers who wouldn't love the only kind and understanding person? At least a loving mother for all the children think about the good night kiss scene but much more for a few of the girls. By nature homosexuality is indeed a logical response to the monosexuality of this place and for Manuela women seem the only gender she has ever known. For Ms. Bernburg young and obviously missing a sentimental relation it's rather the only present gender and Manuela is the first person to declare love to her.Romy Schneider already a star after Sissi's landmark role was brave to opt for such a mature theme and talentrequiring character. Beautiful captivating and at the same time so naturally innocent and childish.Therese Gieshe is gruesomely perfect in her oppressive Prussian headmaster role determined to raise entire generations of tenacious housewifes for the forthcoming days and wars.Lilli Palmer in constant tearing between her institutional teacher and childminder role is simply outstanding. And how not to discern all the little signs of how deeply she is affected? From the closure of her eyes during the kiss to the pauses she has to take her embarrassment in many of the scenes and at the end the sadness in her eyes combined with the slowness she takes to leave but these feelings are not accepted in the school where she is imprisoned too.Original German language adds to the Prussian harshness feeling scenic sequences are followed by ingenious shadows  lights parts but above all it's the eminent acting that enchants the viewer making us completely forget that the often so important soundtrack is simply missing. Take time for the film many sequences are worth watching and analyzing several times. Madchen in Uniform is not only a must see it's a must have!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the endless row of remakes in the 50's of successes of the 20' and 30's this one may have been the oddest. What is basically a harsh sensitive but never sentimental play qualities that remained in the remarkable film version of 1931 has become a trivial drama. It  starts with the credits in it it is stated that the film is based on a play by Winsloe called Rittter Nerestani this original title was already obsolete at the Berlin premiere and changed  into Gestern und Morgen thereby stressing the object of the play a plea for a more liberal society. But in the 50's German society of Adenauer's credo No experiments this plea was not possible.Some odd changes have been made visvis the play and the film version of 1931. The character of Von Kenten symbol of the fear for authority has been replaced by a nondescript character who hates Elisabeth von Bernburg why she hates her is not made clear at all. Frau Oberin was changed from a symbol of Prussian authority into a bitter old lady who is only the way she is because she had some bitter experiences in life. The scandal that arises when Manuela is drunk and speaks out is brought about by petty jealousy of one of the girls Alexandra.  Noteworthy is also that when Ilse is banned from partaking in Romeo and Juliet she cheerfully helps another girl to learn the part in stead of as in the 1931 version  packing her suitcase to leave the institution in other words hardly any rebellion here. The reconciliation near the end is just silly. What this all amounts to is that the play in this adaptation is melodrama. However unlike some critics I do not think the lesbian theme is further toneddown it is simply represented in another way to be acceptable to an 1950's mainstream audience.There is nothing against an stirring melodrama but also in this department the film fails. That is Radvanyi's direction is adequate but without inspiration.  At moments he tries to give scenes extra strength with shadows and light  there is a nice shot of Schneider in the dark on her bed but it is not sufficient. He is  not helped much by the two leading actresses. Romy Schneider has her moments her first serious part after the Sissiseries but in general fails to convey any emotion and she surely plays quite another Manuela than Hertha Thiele in the 1931 version. Lilli Palmer who thought she could do anything is a terrible miscast as Von Bernburg she is not the woman in her mid20's having trouble with her emotions. All scenes between Schneider and Palmer miss spark.".

The original producer who's interviewed  reveals the possibility that Romy and Lillie might have been involved with each other out side camera  maybe?

	schema:reviewBody "Gza von Radvnyi's Mdchen in Uniform or Girls in Uniform is a German 1958 film so this one is soon 60 years old. It is a remake and while the original was made shortly before the Nazi rise to power when this one here was made World War II had already been over for a decade. The main difference is probably that this one here has color. And it also runs for roughly 8 minutes longer. I liked the original and I also like this one. The slight changes for example in the ending with the Oberin being compassionate or the Oberin's assistant were all solid addition that elevated the original material. Still despite Romy Schneider playing the main character this film here is probably still not as famous as the old blackandwhite film. The reason however is not that this one here is worse but that the old film back then was just very brave in terms of the political climate shortly before the Nazis' rise to power.But lets speak a bit more about this one here. The acting was good from everybody involved and I never had a moment during these 90 minutes when I felt bored. Romy Schneider shortly after her Sissi trilogy looks incredibly stunning as always and received a German Film Award performance for her portrayal here. Same goes for her colead Lilli Palmer and Blandine Ebinger who plays the main antagonist in her supporting role here. There were many weak pretty cringeworthy films from Germany in the 1950s but this is certainly not one of them. A really good watch with an interesting story about love comingofage teenage dreams and authority. The movie certainly has a message. I recommend seeing it. Thumbs up for this convincing remake.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot of the movie revolves around the romantic feelings that schoolgirl Manuela develops for her samesex teacher Madame Freulein Elizabeth von Bernburg in 1910 in a catholic boarding school in Prussia. Based on a biographically inspired play by German author Crista Winsloe it is foremost a critic of the old fashioned conservative beliefs that uses the unusual love story as the perfect allinone solution to reveal their ugly face.The schoolgirls their hair tightly restrained are marching in grey uniforms which are a sort of hybrid between a cooking apron and a military uniform. Deprivation from normal size meals and icy toned communication are ways by which the Headmistress wants to achieve zucht ordnung und abhrtung. Discipline order and toughening up. She the Madame Superior is a discipline fanatic that genuinely believes that if she is to fail in maintaining this rigorous regime with the girls Prussia's own integrity will be at stake one day and anarchy will come to rein. Neither Manuela nor Madame von Bernburg adhere to this ideology and so their mutual complicity is born. Manuela the feeble emotional child that griefs over her recently deceased mother is the complete opposite of the expected product from this strict educational style. The authoritarian teacher is expected to produce though but obedient and submissive women which will make good wives and mothers of soldiers! Ironically enough the generation of young women that inspired the original story grew to become mothers of the Nazi soldiers in reality.Madame von Bernburg on the other hand is sensitive to the girls need for compassion and support. She shows affection in order to change the old ways that she was also submitted to when being a schoolgirl herself. In the historical era where this story takes place the Weimar Republic love between two women was unimaginable let alone one between a student and it's teacher. The director Gza von Rdvanyi adds the age difference to this outrageous story by casting Romy Schneider Manuela and Lilli Palmer Elizabeth von Bernburg that have 22 years in between. The kiss the steamy looks and the seemingly wide spread homosexuality subtly implied in most of the conversations between the girls is masterfully disguised as an innocent comingofage story. The attention is mainly put on the internal emotional experiences of Manuela hers head over hills for the teacher the admiration and love that can be divined from her every gesture and word. On the other hand Ms. Von Bernburg character is more reserved and ambiguous. The Script is perfectly fitted with no unnecessary ornaments and actresses are made to act naturally which they do perfectly with no displaced overdone drama that was common for the movies in the 60's.A noticeable decor in the movie are the quotes of famous authors inscribed as a sort of posters on the otherwise quite empty interior walls of the School. An excellent graphical display of the School's principles.People exist on this world not to be happy but to do their duty The School of life has no holydays We are here to become not to be As the effort so the harvestThe only one missing from the walls is Kinder Kirche Kche Child Church Kitchen presented as the correct destiny of women by the Headmistress.This unique film with its humor drama and subtleness criticizes conservative practices homophobia and even nationalism. It is a remarkable piece of art which with its modernity resembles to the contemporary movies in every aspect and seems to have been simply misplaced in time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening sequence was down right awesome. Right away Godzilla is out and about stomping through town. Right off the bat I have found things I liked about this movie. One thing that I liked was the fact that Godzilla spits his blue radioactive breathe instead of the firelike breath scene in Godzilla 2000 or Godzilla X Megaguirus. Godzilla's look also resembles that of the Godzilla 2000 and Godzilla X Megaguirus movies which is a plus in my book. I found it nice that they mention other monsters either then Godzilla like Mothra and Gaira Green Gargantuan in as previous monster attacks against Tokyo.The movie shows some of he science behind the creation of MechaGodzilla instead of say skipping till the end when it is finished or something that some movies do. Other times like Godzilla Vs MechaGodzilla 2 the movie starts with MechaGodzilla already built. This whole thing is another plus for this movie.The storyline is a little better developed then some of the other Godzilla movies. Some of the characters get a little more development at the beginning. Though it is hard to do in relatively short amount of time this movie still gives a nice storyline to go along with the monster aspect.Now onto the monsters. Kiryu or MechaGodzilla is the best version of MechaGodzilla to date. It is equipped with many weapons which include the Absolute Zero Cannon that freezes things instantly. This is a nice touch to the massive MechaGodzilla arsenal. It still has some of the same lasers and missiles as previous versions.In all this MechaGodzilla is my favorite monster aside from Godzilla in the whole Millenium series.As mentioned above Godzilla was given his blue radioactive breathe back he did have it in GMK but still. This time the breath was a combination of the blue and the firelike one. Out of all the looks for Godzilla this is one of my favorites. This movie also has Godzilla get powered by electricity as it did in the Showa series.Favorite part of this movie has to be when Kiryu goes crazy and starts rampaging through the city. The whole triggering of memories because of Godzilla's roar was nice. This is just another good area of the movie. I mean it has the man against machine element brought in here while still having the man against monster element. Which in both cases for this movie it is man against their creations Nuclear weapons made by man created Godzilla. This continues the great storyline of this movie and makes it a little more interesting.The battle between Godzilla and Kiryu was nice. They actually had some physical fighting instead of just having Kiryu blast away at Godzilla the entire time. Both Godzilla and Kiryu got knocked around quite a bit. I mean the movie still has the lasers missiles and radioactive heat beams as all the previous movies which is still good in itself. This epic battle is a great one!!All in all it is an excellent Godzilla movie and should be enjoyed by any Godzilla Fan out there.".

They really took the effort to get the details right on this movie with cool looking cargo planes Shirasagi White Heron to transport Kiryu from its base to battle ground. Yumiko Shaku's performance as Akane Yashiro was engaging and acting was believable. The plot was good and the score which was performed by Moscow International Symphonic Orchestra was in my opinion best of all Godzilla series.This Godzilla was just as entertaining as the original Godzilla of 1954 which it pays homage to. None other Godzilla film even comes close to the quality of finish this movie has except for the 1954 original and for this reason movie scores a high mark.".

Some of you may be thinking well the special effects are good but that is not the most important thing in a film. Well this film had quite a bit of drama which surprisingly was touching and it all mixed in a Godzilla film very well... connecting the theme all together!! The music and acting was excellent as simple as that.. The fight scenes between godzilla and Mechagodzilla were great often having grappling and punching instead of constant beam battles like in the Hesei series. Godzilla's 26th film is one of the greatest Gfilms of all almost beating Godzilla mothra and King Ghidorah!! Director  Mr. Tezuka is directing a sequel to this film which features two mothra larvae one Mothra adult Godzilla Mechagodzilla and the giant turtle Kameba all in an allout war! It will be great and will probably top Shusuke Kaneko's Gamera series as long as Mr. Tezuka uses his creative talent of directing creative camera angles and spectacular Specail FX!!".

It will be great and will probably top Shusuke Kaneko's Gamera series as long as Mr. Tezuka uses his creative talent of directing creative camera angles and spectacular Specail FX!!";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a classic monster movie as it is supposed to be. SFX are definitely 2000ish and show no big shortcomings. As well this movie is about monsters levelling cities or men in suit levelling cartonbox cities puresimple. The character development is left to a minimum but we don't miss it. Other monster movies try to thicken the plot with poor results here they keep it low profile. There are not many subplots unlike say Final Wars  and that makes it less cluttered. Fights are very good and this time Kiryu can actually beat the hell out of Godzilla. Kiryu is no less than some cyborg engineered from the 1954 Godzilla cells  built around that skeleton by a scientist who could syntetize trilobites out of fossil cells i guess. There is the subplot about the scientist  his child daughter still mourning her mother's loss there is the army girl outcast after a mistake of hers triggers the death of other soldiers but it's pretty much all there.".

	schema:headline " Good But Flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "I must admit I had my worries. So many good and bad reviews. First off I just want to say both Godzilla and MechaGodzilla or Kiryu as he's called looked incredible. This has to be one of the fiercest looking Godzilla suits since the Heisei era. My favorite of the Shinsei era. Plus his heat ray was remarkable the way it charges up. Kiryu looks cool as hell and has some of the most impressive weapons yet seen in a robot monster.Anyways Mazakki Tezuka returns to direct and he did an excellent job. Wataru Mimura provides a great screenplay as usual. Akira Nakao returns one of my favorite Gactors. Akane is played by Yumiko Shaku a beautiful actor that gave a very emotional performance. The love story is awkward because there's a huge age difference between her and Dr. Yahara  Shin Takuma but it still works. Sara his daughter was a bit annoying at times but it helps the story along greatly. Godzilla despite this being the shortest Gfilm since the Showa era gets a lot of screen time. The many battles against JSDF are incredibly well done and I love the Maser Tanks!! The battle in the rain looked awesome and I would love to see a monster battle in the rain in the future. Prior to rumor you don't have to wait that long for the title monsters to meet. Unfortunately when they do Godzilla just sits there like a statue not even flinching. Only the hit from the Maser rays in Kiryu's mouth make him wake up and react to what's going on. This was PATHETIC and I don't know what the staff was thinking but they must have been high to think it looked good.Moving on then Kiryu goes on a fantastic rampage that looks badass as hell. The drive of Michuru Oshima's music and sound of explosions combine to make a very cool scene. I love that part of the story Kiryu being part Godzilla part man's machine to destroy him. How he turns evil it's just great. In the end the two meet again after some nicely done rampage scenes. The first battle makes you wonder but Tezuka delivers and Yuichi Kikuchi's SFX really kick ass! The CGI is excellent and MechaG even engages in a physical battle with Godzilla. His best weapon is that electrocuting machete nice. At the climax we finally see a weapon that really wounds Godzilla. I love that scene seeing that bloody crater in his chest.The movie is well done and could've been a ten star film but a few things brought it down all blasting a star off. First off Godzilla being a statue when they first fought and secondly Godzilla isn't exactly what I want him to be. Sure he gets screen time and all but he's hardly ever mentioned in the dialogue. Plus he hardly interacts with the human characters and he seems to be more of a afterthought if you ask me. The sequel Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S.  had the same problem. I don't know what went wrong here because Godzilla vs. Megaguirus was a remarkable achievement and yet I felt Tezuka lacked here. In actuality Kiryu is the main monster not Godzilla. This was kind of a bother to me. He's basically a villain without character. The film is still a very good one but the story should've revolved more around Godzilla. The characters just don't talk about him enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some Spoilers Ahead    Why Toho and Tezuka felt it necessary to revisit and redo Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla' is anyone's guess considering that it has only been nine years since the 1994 movie which was in itself a remake of the 1974 movie.  The Mecha Godzilla or Ki Ryu Mechanical Dragon is quite a different beast from both the 1994 and 1974 versions. In 1974 Mecha G was an alien cyborg creation built to masquerade as Godzilla and be his every equal.  In 1994 Mecha G was built by the Japanese Defense Force GForce using the salvaged remains of one of Mecha King Ghidorah's heads and 23rd Century Technology.  In this version the Japanese Government once again builds Mecha Godzilla but this time using the skeletal remains and DNA information extracted from the 1954 Godzilla 1st Godzilla and then building a mechanical framework over it.  Continuity is thrown out the window as Tezuka's G x MG refuses to acknowledge any of the previous Godzilla movies except the aforementioned original 1954 Godzilla movie although surprisingly G x MG does mention in passing events which took place in Godzilla vs. Mothra' and Sanda Tai Gaira' AKA War of the Gargantuas.Taking a page from Kaneko Shusuke's 2002 All Out Monster Attack' Tezuka infuses G x MG will an abundance of impressive CGI and other digital effects.  Not all the effects are great mind you and some are just embarrassingly bad MG jumps around like Kangaroo Jack' in some points but there are a few cool action scenes.  The model and costume works are good and there are some noticeable improvements especially to Godzilla's look and the various military hardware including the new and improved MASERS.Tezuka also apes Kaneko's use of oneshot and extended cameos for various recognizable TV and Movie stars blink and you could miss cameos from the likes of Suzuki Kenji Tanaka Misato Mizuno Kumi Kamiya Makoto and Yanagisawa Shingo.  And finally Japanese Baseball Superstar and current NY Yankees star Matsui Hideki whose nickname is Gojira' finally gets to appear in a Godzilla Movie as himself.While Tezuka unfortunately does not have Kaneko's fair of drama and visually style he still crafts an enjoyable story similar to his previous work on Godzilla vs. Megaguirus'.  As with G x M Tezuka has another female heroine front and center this time played fairly well by plucky Princess Blade' star Shaku Yuriko.  Shaku basically plays a variation of Sigourney Weaver's Aliens' character Ripley or Linda Hamilton's Sara Conner character in Terminator 2' complete with the muscles.G x MG seems more suited to Anime than film as Mecha Godzilla bears more than some passing resemblance to BandaiSunrise's Gundam' Mecha G's armaments and backpack look like direct rip offs of some of the stuff you'd see in the Gundam Animation Series.  Even the story seems like a variant on Head GearSunrise's fan favorite series Patlabor' with Shaku's character of Yashiro Akane basically playing a live action version of Patlabor's lead female pilot Noa Izumi.  Coincidence?  Perhaps but it's worth noting.While thankfully Baby G doesn't appear in this version M x MG is nonetheless not much of an improvement over its predecessors albeit the digital effects are quite impressive.  Godzilla x Mecha Godzilla is fun entertainment but doesn't really improve upon the franchise at all just follows the standards that were set before it.".

When Godzilla once again threatens her shores Japan's female prime minister Kumi Mizuno calls together her greatest scientific minds including cyberbiologist Tokimitsu Yuhara Shin Takuma whose inclusion in this group gives his precocious daughter Sara Kana Onodera a backstage pass to witness the creation of a new bioweapon developed using the recentlyuncovered original Godzilla bones. The elite JSDF team assembled to pilot the machine is augmented by the lone survivor Akane Yashiro Yumiko Shaku of an eight minute opening Masergun battle with Godzilla her presence made all the more uncomfortable by the vindictive suspicions of a teammate whose brother perished in that disaster. Christened Mechagodzilla this robobeast amounts to the rearming of Japan something the rest of the world finds rather dismaying and when the unit's memories of its demise in 1954 are stirred by Godzilla's roar the battle's a draw the combatants stand down and the Prime Minister's out of a job. When Godzilla returns there's no choice but to reprogram MechaGodzilla and send it back into battle during which not surprisingly Akane herself must take the helm to not only save her country and discourage the naysayers but to prove to herself  and of course to young conveniently motherless Sara  that no life is worthless. Both of the 'final' shots in the movie  take your pick there's a sequence after the closing credits  are fitting.GODZILLA VS. MEGAGUIRUS director Nasaki Tezuka returns to the series with a highly worthy effort finding a pitchperfect blend of suits and CGI in his impressive battle sequences while allowing for reflection as always on Japan's nucleartainted history nodding to the ever increasing empowerment of women in Japanese society though neatly reminding us that they too can fail on a large scale before earning redemption and as in GODZILLA 2000 and many others in the series cleverly constructing a modern family dynamic between the pilot the scientist and his daughter. People groused that Shinsuke Kaneko's GODZILLA MOTHRA KING GHIDORA ALL OUT GIANT MONSTERS ATTACK while simultaneously jump starting a moribund franchise with stillvastlyimproved visual flare lacked the dynamism and realism of his 90's GAMERA trilogy but they were missing the point. Save the first film GODZILLA has always been for kids maybe not as young as the original GAMERA series of the 60's but kids nonetheless. And I suppose kidsatheart. The stories can be pure formula the character dynamics refried from earlier entries in fact many of the most subtle FX in this movie simple dialogue scenes on catwalks around the Mechagodzilla hangar with the behemoth in the background are simply more convincing updates of scenes we saw in the 70's but as long as there's enough razzledazzle and a vicarious pointofentry for the kids the movie's probably a done deal in the eyes of Toho executives. Here the Sara character is our vicarious tour guide to the inner workings of the JSDF and all its stoic patriotism even her friends walking home with her from school are slackjawed at her privileged access to headquarters. Where the GAMERA updates were intended to make full use of the character's added features mainly flight and the advances in modern special effects and highconcept screenplay writing to draw in more savvy audiences the Millennium Godzilla series like those that came before have always retained a comparatively simple modus operandi appeal to the kids and make the adults wish they were still kids. On this level GODZILLA VS. MECHAGODZILLA probably surpasses the previous three entries and at a lean nicely paced 96 minutes 88 in its American incarnation I'm told WHY DO THEY BOTHER! it's certainly the easiest on the behind and quietly sets up the sequel GODZILLA MOTHRA MECHAGODZILLA TOKYO S.O.S. 2003. I give it an 8.".

The special effects were brilliant even though I know for the most part its a man in a suit it doesn't matter. It goes to show that every other country can do it better than Hollywood at the moment.

The BigG is great with his new attitude in the series making the clash between the two monsters very impactive and dramatic. My only complaint is that the film comes off feeling rather short as if there was to be more that somehow got cut from the film.Human actors are their usual uptosnuff quality expected in a Godzilla movie. But if you're anything like me you could care less about the pesky humans and their melodrama it's not called Human Drama and a Monster after all.On the grand scale of all Godzilla movies I rank this one right up at the top.

Mechagodzilla has an impressive design a cool set of weaponry and is actually given something of a personality. Most of the effects and miniatures are excellent and the action scenes are a true delight to watch.The human characters are actually pretty interesting which is something one hardly gets in the Godzilla films. Akane is surprisingly complex and has lots of good emotional qualities. She's kind sympathetic tough and levelheaded which makes her far more superior to the arrogant and vengeful female lead of Godzilla vs Megaguirus. The other characters are good to like Dr. Yuhara and his daughter who befriend Akane. Dialog between the characters is fairly topnotch hardly any exaggeration even in the English dubbing. I just wish that they'd stop calling Mechagodzilla Kiryu. While this movie may leave you wishing for a little more Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla is a satisfying entry in the classic Toho film series. At least it has a sequel Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. unlike the other Millennium films. Overall not bad so check it out. All hail the King of the Monsters.".

	schema:reviewBody "GMK changed gears from the mediocre predecessors that were Godzilla 2000 1999 and GvM 2000. But thankfully Toho didn't allow for there to be just one great G movie in the Millennium series so they launched the Mechagodzilla pair of films this being the first. Remaking a classic monster can be tricky. Toho decided not to revamp the origins of Mechagodzilla this time. The plot is much like 1993's Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla II in that Japan built the giant mech to defend themselves against Godzilla.Actually I'm sorry I even brought the 1993 film up. This one is so much better. Unlike the Heisei series Godzilla the Millennium Godzilla and his foes can actually physically fight and some fun scenes are carried out here. Godzilla looks good his menace toned down just a tad from his previous Millennium suits. They also returned Godzilla's atomic ray back to a blue color whereas Godzilla 2000 and GvM had deviated from the rest of the movies by giving him an orangeish atomic ray. Mechagodzilla looks good far more sleek agile and athletic than the 1993 version and more like the 19741975 MG. Special effects work is also great.There are a few minuses in the film however. Character development was rather lacking and followed Godzilla vs Megaguirus too closely. One strange piece to the film and I don't know if it applies only to the region one release is Mechagodzilla's name. They start out calling it Mechagodzilla but quickly begin calling it Kiryu and keep that name for the duration of the film and in its direct sequel 2003's Tokyo SOS they go back to calling it Mechagodzilla or MechaG. Why they started referring to it as Kiryu is never explained and is a little odd.Nevertheless this is a good film even without the human character strength that was a bit better in GMK that came before it. It's easy to see why Toho decided to keep this universe going with a sequel as opposed to just starting over again like all of the other Millennium series Godzilla films. I rate it 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the third Godzilla film of the Millennium Series. It is made as a direct sequel to the original 1954 Godzilla film and in my opinion is the best film to do so in the Millennium Series. Godzilla's first appearance in this movie has him rising out of the ocean scaring a couple of soldiers and beginning his rampage in Japan. As a result government officials talk about Godzilla's first attack in 1954 and how it was destroyed by the Oxygen Destroyer alarmed that this monster has mysteriously returned. They even referenced the monsters Gaira from War of the Gargantuas 1966 and Mothra from Mothra 1961 as having invaded Tokyo in the years after Godzilla's first attack. In this film we have again a female soldier seeking revenge against Godzilla for killing colleagues of hers. After monsters having appeared in the past the Japanese government salvaged the skeletal remains of the original Godzilla to make a robotic version of the monster called Mechagodzilla. Filled with missiles and stateoftheart weaponry Mechagodzilla is Japan's number one defense against Godzilla. Mechagodzilla was proved to be a tough opponent for Godzilla and in a plot twist it appeared that the original Godzilla's spirit lives in the robot. This added suspense to the story.We get to see a movie with a brilliant score by Michiru shima and great special effects by Yichi Kikuchi. Masaaki Tezuka did OK in the directing however he focused too much on the human characters leaving us limited monster action Godzilla was also portrayed as a little weak. But some of the heroism and sacrifice made by the human characters especially by the antagonist of the film who ended up putting his own life on the line to rescue the female lead were pretty entertaining. I also enjoyed the touching friendship between the little girl and the female soldier adding a nice touch of heartfelt drama. As an added treat Toho brought back veteran actress Kumi Mizuno who played Miss Namikawa in Godzilla vs. Monster Zero 1965 and Daiyo in Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster 1966 and actor Akira Nakao who played Commander Takaki Aso in the Godzilla Heisei films to appear in this movie.Overall this is a wellpaced story with some nice monster action but mostly towards the end.

	schema:headline " Second Best of the Millennium Series!";
	schema:reviewBody "Warning Mild spoilersGodzilla x Mechagodzilla had a tough act to follow the nearly perfect Godzilla Mothra King Ghidorah.  And while good GMK is still the high water mark of the Millennium series probably including the Hesei series as well so expectations and comparisons are hard to ignore.  However director Tezuka definitely picked up a few new tricks since the justokay Godzilla x Megaguirus and follows up GMK excellently.In short like the other Godzilla Millennium series this one starts the G mythos over from square one with only the original binding it.  However unlike many other movies in this one the original Godzilla actually was killed by the Oxygen Destroyer and the current Godzilla is just a new one where he came from however they never reveal a matter I'll discuss later.  So to counter this new threat the AntiMegalosaurus division of the JSDF builds a new weapon named Kiryu nicknamed Mechagodzilla out of the bones and DNA programming of the old Godzilla's bone remains.  It quickly proves itself a match against the new G but later the original G programming in the DNA runs amuck.  But after that's taken care of and Godzilla himself appears on land Mechag is rearmed and ready for a final battle!First the good And get ready 'cause it's a long list.The story dangerously treads ground similar to the stories of the main human protagonists in G 2000 and G x M.  However here they're used in unique and different ways.  The story of Akane the main pilot of MG who messed up an early battle with Godzilla and got several fellow soldiers killed is similar to the one of the main character from G x M.  But instead of out for vengeance against G Akane is out to find a reason to live and prove to herself she can do a good job.  And Professor Yuhura and his daughter are much like the scientist and daughter of G 2000 but don't follow G around. And those three characters interact in interesting ways.  And most importantly the story between them and for each one individually was strong and well acted particularly Yumiko Shaku as Akane who is great in this movie and good looking too.  The supporting characters from the pilot who lost a brother to Akane's mistake to the political leaders do good jobs as well.The story is serious without being too grim although that works really well in GMK and I really felt for the characters.  However they really only started to come together at about the 45 minute mark and could have used a little more closure.  Nevertheless the story and characters are strong especially for a Godzilla movie but don't quite match the drama of GMK. Another interesting fact is that I actually felt for Mechag as a character! Knowing that his history is actually as the resurrected first Godzilla forced to fight against one of his own and eventually having something of a life and working with the distressed and determined Akane made all the cool moves damage and things he does during the final battle make him that much cooler.  He's also I think the bestlooking Mechag to date the personality of the first one only not evil plus the cool weapons of the second one to the tenth power!Also nice about the story is that it fleshes out the new world what with talking about previous monster attacks and giving the new AM division of the JSDF some history as to why they have maser weapons and the technology to develop something like Mechag.And speaking of which the special effects are great.  The suits and models move well the missiles and masers are cool and computer effects are used to enhance reality instead of contrast with the models.  This is also the best incarnation of the Millennium G suit it goes back to black and gray coloring his fire is blue and he's more mobile and shows more expression than ever.  And of course combine all this with great cohesive effects and you get a nearperfect final battle!  This is one of the best most knockdown drag out monster fights of any Kaiju movie ranking up there with Gamera 3 Revenge of Iris but more gratuitous and the final battles in GMK Destroy All Monster and Godzilla vs. Hedorah in my opinion. The great directing cinematography and special effects all combine to form one great fight.And finally Godzilla himself is really good but not great in this movie this will lead into the movie's faults.  As said the new version of the G Millennium suit is the best although the eyes are a little too big.  And it's nice that his colors are back to normal too.  But as many have said G himself is little more than a MacGuffin something the other characters react to in this one.  I have to say that while I do prefer it when G motivates the story the coldness to him kind of works here as it's like he's just an impersonal force of nature they're reacting to.  However that does somewhat reduce the story to nothing more than a reaction.  Plus the people don't react quite emphatically enough to the appearance of a new Godzilla they don't even question where he came from!Also during the first fight with MG and some battle scenes G just stands there when he's getting hit by missiles and weapons like an empty suit! They fix this for the last battle but it's still annoying.  Also the movie does falter a bit as G is much weaker in this movie than he was at the tip top of evilness in GMK.  But Godzilla is far from a pushover.  He takes cheap shots at MG tears up the town and there are some beautiful shots of him in this movie that just capture the essence of what I love about Godzilla.  To me the best of these is when Godzilla has just attacked a squadron of planes and he's walking towards the camera smoke billowing behind him and a piece of debris from a jet falls in front of him hits the ground explodes and lights up beneath him.  G looks so malevolent and powerful...man it's gorgeous!  And the movie is just filled with Woah! moments like that like when Mechag flies in and slams into G.However the movie owes a lot to GMK for some of that because there are some scenes such as the nightvision view of G from the tanks or Godzilla attacking the airplanes that are almost lifted straight out of GMK and are down with less impressive effects and thus feel less powerful although in a nice addition when G blows up the planes he does it from far away and you can see people scurrying in the foreground. Also the ending is kind of sweet and sour because while they do defeat Godzilla he just kind of wanders off like he's tired of fighting.  However that does tell you just how powerful Mechag is!Finally as many have asked why do we need a new Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla when it's been less than ten years since the last one?  I'm afraid they have a point and Toho gets points deducted for not being original.  However this one is so much of an improvement over the previous ones even without secondary monsters including Rodan that I'm willing to excuse a lack of originality in concept for originality and coolness in the final battle.All in all Godzilla x Mechagodzilla is a more gratuitously destructive popcorn movie than GMK and is easily the second best of the Millennium series.  It's not perfect or as dramatic as GMK but is to me the second best of the Millennium series and possibly better than any of the Hesei. An enthusiastic 710!".

	onyx:emotionText "Warning Mild spoilersGodzilla x Mechagodzilla had a tough act to follow the nearly perfect Godzilla Mothra King Ghidorah.  And while good GMK is still the high water mark of the Millennium series probably including the Hesei series as well so expectations and comparisons are hard to ignore.  However director Tezuka definitely picked up a few new tricks since the justokay Godzilla x Megaguirus and follows up GMK excellently.In short like the other Godzilla Millennium series this one starts the G mythos over from square one with only the original binding it.  However unlike many other movies in this one the original Godzilla actually was killed by the Oxygen Destroyer and the current Godzilla is just a new one where he came from however they never reveal a matter I'll discuss later.  So to counter this new threat the AntiMegalosaurus division of the JSDF builds a new weapon named Kiryu nicknamed Mechagodzilla out of the bones and DNA programming of the old Godzilla's bone remains.  It quickly proves itself a match against the new G but later the original G programming in the DNA runs amuck.  But after that's taken care of and Godzilla himself appears on land Mechag is rearmed and ready for a final battle!First the good And get ready 'cause it's a long list.The story dangerously treads ground similar to the stories of the main human protagonists in G 2000 and G x M.  However here they're used in unique and different ways.  The story of Akane the main pilot of MG who messed up an early battle with Godzilla and got several fellow soldiers killed is similar to the one of the main character from G x M.  But instead of out for vengeance against G Akane is out to find a reason to live and prove to herself she can do a good job.  And Professor Yuhura and his daughter are much like the scientist and daughter of G 2000 but don't follow G around. And those three characters interact in interesting ways.  And most importantly the story between them and for each one individually was strong and well acted particularly Yumiko Shaku as Akane who is great in this movie and good looking too.  The supporting characters from the pilot who lost a brother to Akane's mistake to the political leaders do good jobs as well.The story is serious without being too grim although that works really well in GMK and I really felt for the characters.  However they really only started to come together at about the 45 minute mark and could have used a little more closure.  Nevertheless the story and characters are strong especially for a Godzilla movie but don't quite match the drama of GMK. Another interesting fact is that I actually felt for Mechag as a character! Knowing that his history is actually as the resurrected first Godzilla forced to fight against one of his own and eventually having something of a life and working with the distressed and determined Akane made all the cool moves damage and things he does during the final battle make him that much cooler.  He's also I think the bestlooking Mechag to date the personality of the first one only not evil plus the cool weapons of the second one to the tenth power!Also nice about the story is that it fleshes out the new world what with talking about previous monster attacks and giving the new AM division of the JSDF some history as to why they have maser weapons and the technology to develop something like Mechag.And speaking of which the special effects are great.  The suits and models move well the missiles and masers are cool and computer effects are used to enhance reality instead of contrast with the models.  This is also the best incarnation of the Millennium G suit it goes back to black and gray coloring his fire is blue and he's more mobile and shows more expression than ever.  And of course combine all this with great cohesive effects and you get a nearperfect final battle!  This is one of the best most knockdown drag out monster fights of any Kaiju movie ranking up there with Gamera 3 Revenge of Iris but more gratuitous and the final battles in GMK Destroy All Monster and Godzilla vs. Hedorah in my opinion. The great directing cinematography and special effects all combine to form one great fight.And finally Godzilla himself is really good but not great in this movie this will lead into the movie's faults.  As said the new version of the G Millennium suit is the best although the eyes are a little too big.  And it's nice that his colors are back to normal too.  But as many have said G himself is little more than a MacGuffin something the other characters react to in this one.  I have to say that while I do prefer it when G motivates the story the coldness to him kind of works here as it's like he's just an impersonal force of nature they're reacting to.  However that does somewhat reduce the story to nothing more than a reaction.  Plus the people don't react quite emphatically enough to the appearance of a new Godzilla they don't even question where he came from!Also during the first fight with MG and some battle scenes G just stands there when he's getting hit by missiles and weapons like an empty suit! They fix this for the last battle but it's still annoying.  Also the movie does falter a bit as G is much weaker in this movie than he was at the tip top of evilness in GMK.  But Godzilla is far from a pushover.  He takes cheap shots at MG tears up the town and there are some beautiful shots of him in this movie that just capture the essence of what I love about Godzilla.  To me the best of these is when Godzilla has just attacked a squadron of planes and he's walking towards the camera smoke billowing behind him and a piece of debris from a jet falls in front of him hits the ground explodes and lights up beneath him.  G looks so malevolent and powerful...man it's gorgeous!  And the movie is just filled with Woah! moments like that like when Mechag flies in and slams into G.However the movie owes a lot to GMK for some of that because there are some scenes such as the nightvision view of G from the tanks or Godzilla attacking the airplanes that are almost lifted straight out of GMK and are down with less impressive effects and thus feel less powerful although in a nice addition when G blows up the planes he does it from far away and you can see people scurrying in the foreground.

This group was created after the first Godzilla attack in 1954 and was destroyed by the oxygen destroying device.  This group apparently destroyed Mothra though anyone who has seen that movie knows this was not the case and some dumb looking monster I had never seen before.  The new Godzilla however is to powerful.  So they use the skeleton of the old Godzilla of 54 and make a MechaGodzilla weapon they call Kiyru.  MechaGodzilla is my favorite of Godzilla's adversaries so I really enjoyed this movie.  There are some good fights in this one though I do wish Godzilla got in some more hits.  Though there is this one cool scene where Godzilla kicks MechaGodzilla through a building.  Also in this one you are supposed to be pulling for the robot but I always find myself pulling for Godzilla to win.

The fight shows effects that I haven't seen before in these films especially in a sequence where Kiryu boosts towards Godzilla and knocks him through the air.

There was a sequence where Kiryu picked up Godzilla from his tail spun him around and threw him. It was a rather amusing yet pretty cool scene and reminded me of why I watch these films to begin with. The human story is actually rather interesting as well. The characters are all charming and have their own personalities. I won't go any deeper with the story because I think it's something that one should enjoy without knowing anything about it. The soundtrack in this film also really stuck out especially Kiryu's theme. It enhanced the story as well as the monster fights making the movie as a whole a much better experience.

Despite the movie being 11 years old now the special effects have pretty much held up. Green screen effects don't stand out that bad for most of the time but it does briefly a few times. The arsenal of Kiryu are pretty believable special effects including the launching sequence of the absolute zero ray. Godzilla itself looks a lot bulkier than previous versions but pretty realistic.The score of the movie is pretty good but not really memorable. It helped enhance the fight scenes pretty well without overwhelming them.One big problem with the story was as usual for a Godzilla movie the human cast plot lines. We get to see no more than motive to destroy the beast but not much else when it comes to character development. Their interaction with each other is pretty good though but their relationships aren't really expanded on.Godzilla itself never really appeared as a threat to the Japanese population which was nothing more than collateral damage. Godzilla was much more focused on his enemy Kiryu than the people whose nuclear advancements created it. Godzilla basically ignored any part of Japan it stomped through. It also barely put up a fight against Kiryu and appeared fairly weak for the one with top billing.Overall this is not a great Godzilla film but fans of the series will find it no more than acceptable. If you never seen one of the movies don't start with this one.".

They instantly take a liking to one another and their relationship moves pretty quickly into the bedroom. Her sidetracked mind becomes apparent to her ambitious father Sam Neill who can feel his daughter's priorities taking a turn. Meanwhile Lizzie is improving Peter's game by acting as his 'lucky charm'. Now Peter has to ask himself.... can the longshot win the tournament?'Working Title Films' are the same lot who brought us four weddings  a funeral and bridget jones's diary and while they stick to pretty much the same formula with Wimledon it's a formula that works and produces a satisfying romantic comedy. Bumbling charming Brit meets American hotshot. Boy gets girl. Boy loses Girl.... and all the rest.... While this is nothing new essentially it is still a very great movie.Paul Bettany is a gorgeous leading man pulling out all the charms and making himself impossible not to like. Be sure to keep an eye out for Bettany who is more used to taking the backseat supporting role in films A knights tale a beautiful mind etc... but after Wimbledon he has proven himself a more than capable and lovable leadingman.Kirsten delivers a somewhat aggressive performance as Lizzie. Sure she's a headstrong American but couldn't Dunst have made her a likable headstrong American? It's not a bad performance just a little 'off' at times not quite hitting the mark she should have aimed for in this romantic comedy.Jon Favreau plays Peter's manager a typically sleazy businessman... but he does it so well and with such delivery that he's also impossible not to like. Nikolaj CoasterWaldau plays Peter's German friend. It's a small role but my God this guy is a hunk and a half. Sam Neill is pretty forgettable playing a fairly wooden onedimensional character. The other noticeable performance comes from unknown James McAvoy who plays Peter's annoying brother Carl. Great comedic timing and genuinely likable.Wimbledon is filled with quick wit dry English humor fantastic although computergenerated tennis matches and a standout leading man. What's not to like? It's a great film for a good laugh and is a definite pleaser. Gamesetmatch!".

	schema:reviewBody "Straight off I have to make something clear I wasn't really looking forward to watching this. A romantic comedy movie from some of the Working Title team based on Wimbledon didn't exactly set my pulse racing. I did not want another comedy from this stable for me Love Actually had stretched the idea enough for me.So after seeing it I'm very surprised I enjoyed it so much. Despite the romcom badge and the almost unbelievable premise of Wimbledon it's actually very entertaining and the focus is very much on the com side of that genre label.Movie The movie has a lot of style right from the very cool opening credits. The filming of the tennis scenes are well done and keep the flow of the movie going. Imagine showing all the crucial Tennis matches for two players climbing through the stages in Wimbledon without the story going dull and the cinematography going into a standard and repetitive style? Well it doesn't it's almost matrixesue in it's style in fact. For sports and romantic films it certainly breaks the mould.Putting aside the style and the fast paced music what about the story? Well it's actually got a few twists which are quite unexpected and although it does tread typical ground the turns are enough to keep you guessing as to the outcome and keep you hooked.Neat the finals this really does come out and I was very surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat for some of the points and indeed some of the matches.It's very funny too and Paul Bettany shows a particular talent for timing comedy and looks on camera. It's Bettany that really carries this movie backed by strong performances by Kirsten Dunst Sam Neill and some smaller British filled roles for Bettany's characters family.Bettany is totally believable from playing the tennis matches through to the romantic moments. His acting talent shows through amazingly well and is aided by a fantastically written script with some truly funny moments. In particular the self talking moments when we travel inside the head of the tennis player during a match. They seem to capture perfectly the moments of self doubt we all seem to have quite insightful.Sound Presented English  Dolby Digital 5.1 Sporting an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack at times you can hear the ground around you applauding or the sound of a ball going past. When a moment of dialogue appears everything is dialled down and there's no attempt at over use.Picture Presented Widescreen 2.351 Anamorphic Something that struck me was the potential to have the screen be overpowered by the greens of Wimbledon and with the traditional weather there was a thought that the movie would look too dark and dull. Neither is true.The picture is sharp and vibrant through the movie clear and bright and very colour rich it retains this look through even the more complex of special effects match shots.Extras Presented Audio commentary with Richard Loncraine and Paul Bettany 'Welcome To The Club' featurette 'Ball Control' featurette 'Coach A Rising Star' featurette 'Wimbledon A Look Inside' featurette Trailers The featurettes are about how the tennis was filmed how the actors were trained looks inside Wimbledon itself and some further looks into the movie. They are quite short and interesting but they aren't the main draw here they just serve as distractions from the superb audio commentary from Bettany and the director Richard Loncraine.Insightful funny and quite revealing we hear much about the behind the scenes shots that never were and how the actors got on together. This was one of the better commentaries I've heard and well worth listening to. Both Bettany and Loncraine are funny and self depreciating typical British humour.Overall It's a funny and very enjoyable movie actually quite a surprise and in a way actually funnier than Love Actually. It also seems to capture the inner dialogues that people face daily very well as well as some of the other dialogue being nailed rather well. Bettany shines in this film and it shows the huge talent that he has.".

Normally I don't feel compelled to comment on the opening credits but the sequence is so brilliant I have to. As you hear a ball being whacked back and forth the credits start appearing to the far left of the screen then the far right back and forth. Suddenly you realize everyone in the theater is craning their heads back and forth. The film makers have just gotten everyone acting like a tennis crowd. You know right away the film was made by someone who actually watches tennis.The film has a fair amount of amusing comedy such as how no one except for Peter Colt can seem to remember that Peter Colt was once ranked 11th. He's moderately wealthy and he's never been hungry but at 31 he is starting to become a little too old for tennis so he decides it's time to hang up the racket after Wimbledon.The film does a great job of showing the various types of tennis games pro's go through. There's the experienced player versus the rookie. There's the friend versus friend match. There's the game where everyone is cheering for the other guy. And finally there's the game where you play your worst enemy.By the end of the film you will understand why tennis winners usually fall down on the grass and start weeping after they win the title. I have one question though  why the  did they use a rap song at the end of this film?".

	schema:reviewBody "Erm... no offence to Tim Henman and his fans but here's one hell of a sporting fantasy for you a professional British tennis player actually winning Wimbledon. Wow. Well as we all tennis fans know it such a scenario can only happen in the realm of movie magic.Paul Bettany stars as Peter Colt a fading tennis player who is resigned to retiring from the professional circuit with the fact that he'll have nothing to show for it. The only time I've seen Bettany was in A Beautiful Mind which elicited a rather haunting performance from him. And so it was to my delight that he managed to fit into this role with such ease and charm as if he had been doing romantic comedies all his life. He displays the typical British dry wit and slightly dark humour effortlessly almost to a fault excuse the pun. Not the best performance from Kirsten Dunst but she does give a pretty convincing portrayal as the brash American world number one female player.Speaking of brashness it's a pleasant surprise to see the notoriously foulmouthed John McEnroe in a cameo appearance as a commentator giving his twocent's worth during the tennis matches. His presence adds a nice touch giving a certain real tennis feel to the fictitious tennis players in the film.Despite not having real professional tennis players in the acting roles the action sequences in the matches do look very convincing thanks to the amazing cinematography. You certainly realise how far cinematic technology has progressed over the years when you see Bettany and Dunst belt out those groundstrokes and smashes almost as beautifully as the reallife seasoned pros would.All in all an entertaining date flick that holds even more appeal for tennis fans.Who should watch Those who don't mind suspending their belief about British tennis to simply enjoy a lovable romantic comedy.Who shouldn't watch Tim Henman all English tennis players and English tennis fans. They may actually believe they CAN really win a grand slam.Rating 7.5".

Instead there would be the occasional lightweight drama like Players Dean Paul Martin and Ali McGraw which fizzled back in 1980. Wimbledon while a marked improvement over the former does nothing to change the status quo. Primarily a star vehicle for Kirsten Dunst Spiderman Bring It On and rising star Paul Bettany Master and Commander A Beautiful Mind the storyline is the stereotypic budding romance between Dunst who is the up and coming tennis star and Bettany the aging midline star who is trying for one last shot at being champion at Wimbledon. Their romance blossoms much to the consternation of Dunst's father Sam Neill who fears distractions for his daughter. There are a few subplots involving Bettany's quarreling parents his playing partner and his opportunistic agent Jon Favreau. It's not too hard to figure who might winlose or where the romance will lead. Stars Dunst and Bettany are likable and have a nice chemistry but not much script to work with. There are a few nice lines and situations piecemealed throughout but the plot is paper thin and the dialogue is unimaginative. This was from the people who brought us Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral? Ah look at the credits more closely and Richard Curtis is missing not even a Hugh Grant cameo is in sight. Sam Neill Bernard Hill and Eleanor Bron Remember her from the original Bedazzled? are wasted in minor roles. The tennis scenes are somewhat fun with the stars putting their all in the physical matches but the tennis balls are almost too perfect as the special effects become too obvious.Bettany is destined for more substantial roles and Dunst won't be hurt by this lightweight comedydrama. One could only imagine what they could have done with a more lively script and complex characters. Sure it's nice to look at and the stars are a cute couple but this was a squandered opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tennis has not generally been a popular sport with filmmakers. The hero of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train may be a top tennis player but for most of that film he has other matters than sport on his mind like clearing himself of a murder charge. Wimbledon is the first film I can recall in which the game has taken centre stage.It has been compared to a Richard Curtis film and certainly has some similarities to his Notting Hill. Both films are named after districts of London and Hugh Grant the star of Notting Hill was also originally slated for the lead in Wimbledon. Both also both feature a shy nervous selfdeprecating uppermiddleclass Englishman who falls in love with a glamorous American superstar. The twist here of course is that the superstar in question Lizzie Bradbury is not a Hollywood actress but rather a leading professional tennis player. The man who falls for her is another tennis player Peter Colt. Colt is a journeyman professional just outside the game's elite. He was once ranked number eleven in the world but he is now in the twilight of his career and has slipped to 119. He is playing in his last Wimbledon before retirement from the game and wants to go out in style.Apart from Notting Hill there may also be a reallife precedent for the romance of Lizzie and Peter. A generation ago Chris Evert a glamorous American superstar of the game married John Lloyd a journeyman English professional ranked just outside the game's elite. If a cinematic biopic of John and Chrissie were ever to be made Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany might not be bad choices for the leading roles. Of course there are a few differences. Whereas Evert's calm imperturbable demeanour won her the nickname of the Ice Maiden Lizzie is a tempestuous hothead on the lines of John McEnroe. She even gets to repeat one of his lines Chalk flew up!. If Evert and McEnroe really were the inspiration for the character of Lizzie neither of them seem to have minded both appear in the film as commentators. Peter is rather older than Lloyd was at the time of his marriage. And most importantly he manages to do something which neither Lloyd nor any other Englishman has done since Fred Perry in 1936. He wins Wimbledon.That last sentence might give a clue as to the true nature of the film. The British have a curious relationship with the game of tennis. Or to be more accurate they have a curious relationship with the Wimbledon championships. For a fortnight in late June and early July every year the BBC devote several hours a day to showing the matches and the newspapers are full of articles lamenting the fact that Britain has not produced a winner of the men's singles since Perry or of the women's singles since Virginia Wade in 1977. This failure is pronounced a National Disgrace talented players such as Tim Henman or Greg Rusedski are subjected to unfair criticism or even ridicule for failing to win Wimbledon. For the remaining fifty weeks of the year the fever abates and the great majority of the British public take little interest in the sport the other major tennis championships are not normally televised to any extent except on specialist satellite channels. The last British player to win a Grand Slam singles title was not in fact Wade but Sue Barker but because her triumph was achieved at RolandGarros rather than Wimbledon it does not really count in British eyes.The film therefore is less a comedy or a romantic comedy than a patriotic wishfulfilment fantasy. The player whom Colt defeats in the final Jake Hammond is an obnoxious American who fulfils admirably the British stereotype of the vulgar loudmouthed Yankee cut down to size by a quiet but determined Englishman. Hammond's standing in the game is emphasised by the fact that on his way to the final he defeats reallife champions such as Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer Colt's victims by comparison are all fictional characters. The film also refers by name to other reallife tennis players such as Serena Williams and Andy Roddick and there are thinlydisguised portraits of Henman and Amelie Mauresmo.Although the film is billed as a romantic comedy there is not that much humour I suspect that if the script had been written by Richard Curtis it would have been a good deal wittier than it is. Most of the attempts at raising laughs centre upon Peter's difficult younger brother Carl or upon old puns like love means nothing in tennis or the occasional piece of bawdiness. Even the romance often has to take second place to the tennis. It is a standard convention of romcoms that there has to be some obstacle to the love of the young couple and an attempt is made to provide one here in the shape of Lizzie's overprotective father but he proves to be an insufficiently serious obstacle for any real dramatic tension to develop. This is generally a watchable film and Bettany makes a likable hero but there is nothing really deep or memorable about it. 610".

Having picked up on the blatant similarities between Paul Bettany and Hugh Grant as foppish witty Englishmen in Wimbledon it came as no surprise to me to learn that Hugh Grant had originally been considered for the lead role of Peter Colt. If you have ever seen a film starring Hugh Grant as the lead you know now what Wimbledon is essentially like and how it is acted because Paul Bettany's tennisplaying character Peter is exactly like a Hugh Grant characterconfused witty and extremely English. While Bettany does not quite have the the charming part down to perfection yet he is much more attractive than the king of romantic comedies. He is also strangely compatible with Kirsten Dunst and that makes it a nice romance story. While centering the plot around tennis Wimbledon in fact is fairly uncommon this is only a disguise for a genuinely ordinary and wellmilked premise. Man is out of touch and out of luck and meets a wild free girl who will help him awake from his sedated mental state and make him feel alive again. Conflicts inevitably rise because the man and girl are two players in Wimbledon and so there is more at stake than just a love affair they are both competing to win. In the end this film is really quite cute and often at least a little funny but believe me when I say it's nothing you haven't seen before.

There is very little character development and consequently it is difficult to muster any great interest in or sympathy for the protagonists of the piece. The film combines a weak tale of an underdog winning through the tournament and an overly sentimental romance.The film may appeal to hopeless romantics but this is not a work of any depth or substance. The actors do what they can with the screenplay but in truth it smacks of children's TV with a soundtrack. It does contain a brilliant gem in the injured ballboy. I challenge anyone not laugh at this hapless episode in which a tiny kid is poleaxed by the fastest serve ever and yet is still in attendance as lucky mascot in the next match  black eye and all.This is not so much a straight to DVD film as straight in the bin. If you care for such fluff then you're better off watching Henman's annual failure  at least that is free.".

The story was stupidly predictable this is also expected I have come to understand when it comes to seeing romantic comedies. I can't comment on Kirsten Dunst's acting ability because it gets me angry that people still give her starring roles even though she hasn't done a decent job of sincerely portraying a character since she was in An Interview with a Vampire. Paul Bettany was memorable but there was a definite lack of chemistry and also a lack of good material to work with. The story itself was lacking in substance but also just straight laughs... I hate when people say its a perfect date movie....as if people on a date don't want something entertaining...so I think I would say this....this is a good movie to rent when it comes out on DVD and you plan to make out on the couch while you are supposedly watching it.".

Most of the story focuses on Wimbledon and there is a love story weaved into this. I'm not a fan of either genre and I didn't have any expectations. I think the film lacks overall emotion conflict and storyline direction. This is not saying that the director went wrong or the actorsactresses could not act. I feel that the majority of the problem lay within the script itself. I could not place myself in the characters' shoes and the conflicts that did occur throughout seemed to be played down the parents father figure American tennis player who went to the finals. There were a couple of funny bits but nothing is really memorable. Below average rated 2 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think that this film lacked what it needed to really make a great film. Perhaps this is because I am not keen on watching sport itself. Most of the story focuses on Wimbledon and there is a love story weaved into this. I'm not a fan of either genre and I didn't have any expectations. I think the film lacks overall emotion conflict and storyline direction. This is not saying that the director went wrong or the actorsactresses could not act. I feel that the majority of the problem lay within the script itself. I could not place myself in the characters' shoes and the conflicts that did occur throughout seemed to be played down the parents father figure American tennis player who went to the finals. There were a couple of funny bits but nothing is really memorable. Below average rated 2 out of 10.";

The only thing this film served up was bad taste. No doubt it was a big hit with the Titanicloving brigade.

This film makes Jackass look like Shakespeare How this has gotten the score that it has on IMDb I'll never know I guess it must be English people loving all the flag waving during the matchesguys ye have got to stop giving your home grown stuff 10 out of 10 as it then becomes impossible to sort the wheat from the chaff...but I can't be sure.

	schema:reviewBody "Masoom is one of the best Hindi films of the 1980s a decade known to be disastrously terrible for Hindi films. The directorial debut of the supremely talented Shekhar Kapur whose work with amazingly distinct film genres during his career has been striking this one really was a gem. The film is about a happily married couple DK and Indu. They have two girls Pinky and Minni and their life seems to be quite perfect until one day DK informs Indu that he has a little kid from a woman who he had an affair with many years ago and who is no more. He brings the kid named Rahul home and there starts the struggle. His wife is still shocked to know that she was betrayed and the presence of the kid only worsens the situation. While watching the film the viewers may certainly feel pity for the little cute boy who bears the brunt of his father's mistake. He has done nothing wrong and here we see where the film takes its title from.Masoom is moving poignant and involving. The film is beautifully narrated and is extremely fascinating to watch. One must note the brilliant portrayal of the urban India of its times. The lifestyle of modern people in the big city is executed with impressive precision. The characters the dialogues the situations are strikingly realistic and simple. The film never goes overboard it does not have any clichs whatsoever and it is not overly emotional  it is authentic and real. That's what makes the emotional effect on the viewer even more powerful and the story so easy to relate to. Due credit goes to Kapur's amazing direction and Gulzar's brilliant writing which are aided by a great technical crew fantastic acting and a very memorable soundtrack composed by RD Burman. How can one forget such beautiful songs as Tujhse Naraaz Nahin Zindagi and Do Naina Aur Ek Kahani? Soulful earpleasing and classic. Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal of DK a complex role that has a mixture of guilt feelings love regret and responsibility is outstanding. I cannot see another actor playing DK with the sincerity and sensitivity with which he did. Shabana Azmi is exceptional as Indu. Her role requires both toughness and vulnerability and Azmi displays such feelings as anger despair indifference remorse and compassion skillfully. The film is also known for having some of the greatest appearances by child actors and it's easy to see why. Urmila is great as the serious Pinky. One could easily foresee the great actress that she would become while seeing her natural acting here. Aradhana is also adorable as the peppy and bubbly Minny but it is Jugal Hansraj who makes the greatest impact. It may be because the entire story revolves around him but he is just one of the cutest kids I've ever seen in a film. He is supposed to be the 'Innocent' this film deals with and this is perfectly done through his endearingly naive eyes sweet diction and touching simplicity. You really feel for this boy throughout the film.All in all Masoom is a mustwatch and it should provide a treat to anyone. The only regret I had is that there wasn't enough of Indu and Rahul's positive interaction. I wish they had extended more into their relationship after the tearcausing Sorry Aunty which is the film's best moment see the film to understand what I mean. Anyway Masoom is a film that anyone would enjoy watching and many many times. It is both entertaining heartwarming and moving. Whoever and wherever you are if you have not seen it yet I highly recommend you to do so.".

	schema:reviewBody "The script and dialogues my Sampooran Singh Gulzar are just mind blowing. It is truly challenging to present the tensions in the family along with the innocence of the children Gulzar and Sekhar Kapoor the director delve deeply into the psychology of the adults and the children. Urmila excels as a child artist she was barely 10 years old! so did Anuradha and Jugal Hansraj.The camera work in the movie is simple and artistic. Rahul Dev Burman's haunting score couldn't be any more apt. It is really striking he used variations of a single tune as the background score for the entire movie! Wow! That is not the best part you don't notice that! That's the best part.Nasseruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi who are known for their extreme potential and they have played their roles to perfection.I would say this is Sekhar Kapoor's best. There are several scenes in the movie where the characters convey their feeling by a simple act which would otherwise need 1000 words and notneeded melodrama. That is clearly his directorial genius. When the characters actually speak they convey their feelings equally well...Thanks to the genius and maturity of Gulzar and Sekhar Kapoor.The movie is funny beautiful tense moving complex..... However I have one complaint with the script.Warning If you plan to watch the movie do not read beyond this  point!The open question remains as to what is really the punishment to a man who made a mistake as big as adultery. We know the man is good loves his kids and wife and his work. He did make a mistake. The situation in which he made the mistake no matter what cannot be justified. He made a mistake. That's it.The kid has no fault of his and he is lonely and helpless and feels deprived of everything. Does he have to suffer because the adult made a mistake? No. So what is doing justice to this kid? Keeping him along with your kids? If that is the case what is the punishment to the father? If you send him away aspunishment the kids will all be fatherless and the wife will have the burden of taking care of them alone.So as shown in the film...the correct punishment is the one that makes him remorseful and the correct thing to do with the kid is to bring him up along with the others. OK so far so good but this soln. has a problem too. What happens when the kids grow little older. They know their brother made no mistake they will learn that their father...about who they were so proud..has let them down. This will certainly effect them for life! Even if we assume their family friends can forgive his mistake the kids cannot. Not at least these kids.. may be some kids who are in a family that is used to adultery!Well one could argue that the father indeed made a mistake and the kids would have to simply face the truth..there is no other way out so they rather stop worrying about it..and of course they don't to need to worry about punishing his father if the objective is to make him remorseful.".

Their rising popularity means that people who wouldnt have access to watching a bollyowood film or would simply dismiss it as a foreign language film therefore unwatchable are now enjoying the magic and power of bollywood. Recently Channel 4 here in the UK have began to show bollywood films every few nights and sometimes in the day. I have watched many of them but Masoom is by far my favourite. On paper the storyline doesnt sound incredibly exciting or original but what is on screen is purely amazing. The actors portray their characters with such knowledge and ability that you feel you are watching the family's home movie. The basic theme of this film to me seems to be the power of love. GK's love for Rahul battles against his love for the rest of his family. And it is Indu's love for GK and her eventual love and respect for Rahul that keeps the family from being torn apart. It is a film about strength about having the strength to love someone no matter what they have done Shabana Azmi's Indu is both fragile but incredibly strong and dignified. Naseerudin Shah plays GK with such courage but also shows his weak side. This is a film that deeply effected me. The power of its central themes are amazing and shows a side of Bollywood that is largely unheard of.".

Usually I find that most Indian movies have plots that have such one dimensional characters but in this movie you see the evolution of the characters.  For those who watch Indian movies for the lyrics as well and you haven't seen or heard the songs of Masoom then you are truly missing something.  You can't expect anything less than the best in terms of the lyrics from Gulzar.  The music by R.D.Burman is also very touching and appropriate for the scenes.  Kudos to Naseruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi for portraying their characters with such passion.  After watching this movie I felt that it is human to make mistakes and you don't find many movies providing such moral lessons.  Highly recommended to lovers of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably one of the most sensitive films ever made in India. Its sensibility is very contemporary and unaffected by Bollywood. The performances are surprisingly real and one can easily relate to them. Naseer plays the role of DK beautifully I feel its his most sensitive performance till date. DK is a very real character he is a man who is not ashamed to cry. Its very apparent he loves his wife a lot but the emotion he shows for Supriya Pathak the woman he met during the school reunion from whom he has a son but did not know till nowis also very real very real and honest. Even though it has the feel of a one night stand and even DK himself would rather believe and tell his wife that but its pretty clear he liked her when he met her and felt genuine emotion for the girl. Bhavna Supriya Pathak decides to bring up the child alone and not tell DK about it because she knows that he has a family of his own.DK is a very rare character in an Indian film men in Indian films are not sensitive like him they don't break down while talking to their wives they don't show helplessness. DK is so humane that its difficult for him to not touch and affect you in some way. Personally the character that Shabana Azmi Indu  DK's wife does not move me too much. Its probably true that her character gets to grow only towards the end when her love for Bhavna's boyRahul begins to overpower her hatred for the act that her husband had committed years ago. Her hurt also comes from the fact that when DK had this affair with Bhavna she was expecting their first child.Indu is not shown to have any extraordinary characteristics in the beginning. She is just jealous of Rahul's mother and feels disgust for the deeds of her husband. Any one would feel like that. Her character gets some respite when she begins to see the boy Rahul for what he truly is  his mother is dead and he does not know who his father is  he is truly alone and orphaned. Its love and sympathy for him that raises Indu above the normal jealous hurt wife. She is a mother of two girls herself she cannot help but feel motherly love for this boy who is sweet nice natured and so lonely.The kids also act very well Jugal Hansraj is wonderful as Rahul. The film wins in the end it seems because of him you feel so much for this boy. It wins also because of DK Naseer and his surprisingly natural love for his lost so far unknown son. He feels pride when Rahul plays a good ball of cricket and it surprises him. Just goes to show that feelings of love are not conditioned developed they just are. Indu's feelings for the boy can be seen almost visually growing and that is a beautiful thing. She is the one who gets him back home in the end.A must watch for anyone who loves Naseer and Gulzar. It's a film that doesn't disappoint. I have it on DVD and watch it again and again and again!!".

Don't miss this emotional movie that perfectly displays an estranged relationship of father and son. with time length of 140 odd mins this masterpiece depicts various relationships within a family enlightening the relationship among children like how sensitive affectionate and how they grow up with their siblings and puts light into important things for them like birthdays homework competition and attention needed by them from their parents.How in Indian societies hard cold wars between couples prevail how they deal with various issues with their children how they feel for children  but best part to me was how nasseruddin shah deals with shy kid jugal hansraj  how the kid starts feeling for nasseruddin shah. It is a rare Indian movie that breaks a viewer into tears but most importantly you will really feel yourself a kid who will be in search of love. It is a must watch for any Indian as movie perfectly portrays Indian society.I would have rated it 910. But because of the extremely beautifully shot emotional track tujh se naraaz nahin zindagi..... i am going with 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Masoom raises the issue of illegitimate child and presents a touching and inspiring story on childhood innocence and motherhood. It presents a clash between a women ego and motherhood which comes under test when an illegitimate child comes to a happy home blossoming motherhood against a hatred for the illicit relationship the husband was involved in. Storywise the story is said to be loosely based on an English movie Man Woman and Child. If there is any perfect family movie Bollywood has ever made I will undoubtedly name this one. The film has won the heart of every audience in the past and still the film stands a gem. Despite a familiar story the film remains touching sensitive and adorable. The reason is the perfect treatment the film receives. The way the story is mounted the adorable family the film presents the office environment of Naserudin Shah all have a right touch. The performances of Naseruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi were just mesmerizing and spontaneous. The feeling of motherhood affection that raises in Shabana from hatred to the illegitimate son from his husband was the most well realized part of the film. Tanuja and Saeed Jafferey also make a remarkable job in their small roles. The acting of the three child artist remain the soul of the film and depicts the child innocence brilliantly. The songs are just beautiful. Overall the film yet continues to remain close to my heart and every time the film touches you with the wonderful film on childhood innocence and affection the film weaves.Rating 3 stars out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "Masoom is a thoughtful movie directed by one of the noted filmmakers of Bollywood Shekhar Kapur and which stars two solid actors of the 80s's parallel cinema Naseeruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi. The story revolves around DK Shah and Indu Azmi who are happily married and are the proud parents of two lovely girls Pinky and Mini Urmila Matondkar and Aradhana. However their happy married life is cut short by the arrival of a little boy Rahul Jugal Hansraj. Rahul is the product of DK's short illicit affair with his onetime college friend Bhavana Supriya Pathak. Indu shuns the innocent little boy as he adds insult to her injury as she has now learned that DK has cheated on her. You must watch the remaining as to how Indu deals with this sad reality of her life and whether she accepts Rahul to be a part of the family or not. The film is different in its approach and boasts of superlative performances from its lead actors. This is Shekhar Kapur's first directorial venture and he has handled every aspect of this film with great creativity and maturity. R.D. Burman's music is a gem as usual. 'Tujhse Naraz Nahin' beautifully sketches the relationship between a father and his newfound son while 'Do Naina Aur Ek Kahani' speaks about the state of the cheated wife's mind. Naseer and Shabana have easily delivered their career best performances in this movie. However it's Jugal Hansraj whose performance really touches your heart. His one scene that deserves special mention is when he asks Naseer who his father is though the audience gets the dramatic irony. That particular scene melted my heart. Urmila Matondkar and Aradhana are also terrific as the daughters. Overall a movie that deserves a watch. Don't miss it!".

The story unfolds with the discovery of the complex and taboo relationship between this illegitimate son and the father and the resulting tension in the family. The focus of the movie is the emotions of an 8year old who is innocent of the mistake committed by his father and how they and the family deal with it. The filmmaker Shekhar Kapur did best at sensitising how people look down upon forbidden relations and people who engage in it through the difficulty of the couple to come to terms with what happened in the past. The only sore point is that the movie's tone is entirely sympathetic towards the husband making the wife sometimes look completely unreasonable for almost the whole movie.I had watched this movie a long time ago but the impact is still fresh in my mind. It has some very memorable names like Naseeruddin Shahhusband Shabana Azmiwife Urmila and Jugal Hansrajkids in it but watching it you realise why they became so well known for their acting. Both Mr. Shah and Ms Azmi are accurate in their respective portrayals of a loving couple who are torn between the broken sanctity of marriage and their responsibility as a father and mother. Also the kids surely win over the heart through their picture perfect expressions. The eyes of Jugal Hansraj really bring out the innocence and need of a forgone child to be loved so very well that no true father would ever want to let go of their child after watching this.Watching this makes me introspect and analyze my own level of innocence or the lack of it and I realise that although we're never going to get it back we could at least protect it in the eyes of our children.".

Already two of Indias finest actors were cast as leads so most of the job was done and when it came to extraction acting from children  Shekar could not meet up with challenge. Those forced shivering or those bland expressions did not show that the boy was innocent but rather made it artificial.This is not as great as it was told to me all through this years. The subject is beautiful but the depiction could have been far far better.

	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa is one of my very favorite filmmakers. If you search through my reviews I have written about a few The Seven Samurai High and Low Kagemusha and Dreams. I have seen many more Rashomon Ikiru my personal favorite Yojimbo Sanjuro Dersu Uzala and Ran. I have only disliked one High and Low but not one of his films failed to amaze me in some way or other. My initial opinion after seeing Rashomon The Seven Samurai Yojimbo Ran and Kagemusha was that he was an amazing stylist whose films felt slightly impersonal to me. I strongly disagree with that opinion now I expressed it in my review to Kagemusha which I'm surprised hasn't resulted in tons of hate mail.I have just finished watching Kurosawa's second to last film Rhapsody in August. It is not highly regarded usually dismissed as a very minor work in a master's portfolio. This I also discovered about my second favorite of his films Dreams. Well as far as my opinion I think people were dead wrong about both of these films. Rhapsody in August is not a stylistic masterpiece like The Seven Samurai Yojimbo or Ran. Instead only second to Ikiru it is Kurosawa's most humanistic film. I have only seen one film by him although I've read a lot about him but I would compare it more to Yasujiro Ozu's work.This film has a plethora of themes ranging from the effect of the HBomb on both the Japanese and the Americans the generation gaps between the three generations present the matriarch of the family feels separate from her middleaged children but she relates well to her grandchildren who are interested in their country's sorrowful history and the effect of American culture on the Japanese of the present generation. It is quite a handful but everything is handled so subtly that some viewers who don't pick up on it all may easily grow uninterested. In some ways the film feels very didactic in a good way. I can imagine this film being showed to younger children since the four grandchildren at least at the beginning are learning about the history of the bomb and Nagazaki and their grandfather's death. The only weak point of the film is probably the very end which is difficult to understand. I have a feeling that there was some crosscultural barrier preventing my understanding of it so if anyone does get it please contact me. Anyway as I perceived it the film ended kind of randomly. But still what has come before is too good to get too upset by the lack of closure. It deserves a 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Equipped only with a blown out umbrella twisted into the shape of a flower an old lady like some ancient Samurai warrior braves a blinding rainstorm to plea for ending the inhumanity of war. One of his most lyrical and poetic works Akira Kurosawa's second to last film Rhapsody in August is about four young Japanese teenagers who stay with their grandmother one summer near Nagasaki and learn about the atomic destruction of their city on August 9 1945. The film is both a lament for the suffering caused by militarism and an outcry against the world's collective loss of memory.When the children visit their elderly grandmother Kan 86year old Sachiko Murase she tells them that their grandfather died in the atomic bombing of Nagasaki an event in their country's history that they know very little about. Concerned that the teenagers cannot understand the suffering that had occurred and the possibility of such an event occurring again Kan relates personal stories about her experience on that terrible day. Building bridges between generations through her stories she is able to have the children look past the consumerist values instilled in them by their parents and discover both their countries heritage and the values in life that are most important. As the old woman tells each tale the children are both curious and moved by their power and mysticism and visit the sites she describes in her stories.They see the decaying remains of two old trees intertwined forever after a lightning storm. They visit the school yard where their grandfather died and see what is left of a jungle gym now a pile of melted twisted metal that has become a memorial to those children and adults that suffered and died on that day. The film is haunted by Kan's attempt to cope with the emotional consequences of the bombing an event that most are unable to remember but that she is unable to forget. She tells the story of her younger brother a painter who could only paint eyes specifically a large red eye the eye of the flash that signaled the disaster in which 39000 people were killed and an estimated 75000 died years after.The children's parents have gone to visit Kan's brother who emigrated tom Hawaii in 1920 to run a pineapple plantation and married a Caucasian American. One of ten brothers Sujijiro now in failing health wants to see his sister before he dies but she is reluctant to go in spite of the urging of the children who drool over pictures of her brother's affluent surroundings. When the parents return from Hawaii wishing to establish good relations with the wealthy Hawaiian family they try to persuade Kan to go. When Clark Richard Gere Sujijiro's son flies to Nagasaki the parents are sure it is because he wants to end the proposed visit resenting the implication that America caused his Uncle's death.When Clark arrives however the family discovers the opposite. Although Gere does not look the part of a JapaneseAmerican his warmth sincerity and passion for peace more than compensate and his time in the film is one of the highlights. He first expresses his remorse for his uncle's death in the bombing and visits the shrines in Nagasaki with the four children and their parents. Some critics say the film alludes only to the dropping of the atomic bomb and not to any of the events that preceded it including the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. However it is clearly Kurosawa's intention to dramatize the futility of war not the wrongdoing of one country.In a tender conversation with Kan Clark apologizes for what he should have said but Kan repeatedly and simply responds it's all right blame it on the war pointing out that many Americans as well as Japanese died in the fighting. Kan agrees to go to Hawaii but only after joining in a memorial service to the Nagasaki victims repeating the mantra of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva Buddhist deity Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha  gone gone everyone gone to the other shore. One of the loveliest scenes in the film is the sight of a colony of ants climbing the stem of a rose bush a final epiphany suggesting that amidst the destruction beauty and hope survive.".

An old woman who had lost her husband in the atom bomb explosion at Nagasaki discovers that she has a brother who had emigrated to Hawaii seventy years earlier had become an American citizen and had married a woman not of Japanese origin through correspondence that her grandchildren had with their uncle's son Richard Gere.

That minor role mercifully stretches his limited acting talents little..The treatment of Nagasaki as two worlds  one lost one allnew  seems to tell me much about the Japanese at least of the children's generation. Maybe the children can save the memory of the significance of the changes in Japan since 1945 if not the events themselves.The confusing ending prevents me from giving a 1010 rating. Not since the Civil War have any Americans have experienced anything remotely similar to the events in this story in America. It's beautifully done and it is gripping for someone who has no ties to Japan. It reminds me in some respects of Gone With the Wind without the objectionable features of racism catty characters as protagonists or perverse sentimentality of a rotten social order such as the one that Japan had before 1945. If GWTW gets an 8 from me then Rhapsody in August gets a 9.".

As I got into the movie I start to understand what Kurosawa want to say. This movie is about how the younger Japanese are abandon their own culture and at the same timeironically it is the American the one who dropped the atomic bomb in Japanare reviving the Japanese tradition cultureG.Lucus and S.

Also I have very deep sympathy and respect for the 200000 Japanese civilians who were broiled alive when that idiot Truman decided to play boom boom with his new toy. As far as preaching to the choir goes I AM THE CHOIR.But someone has to say it. This movie was awful. It was so clumsy and melodramatic that it made a mockery of both Kurosawa and the atomic tragedy he portrays. Like my title implies it's the ABC afterschool special version of life after the atomic bomb complete with a cast of sappy kids an overlysentimental script amateur editing and a philosophical message so vapid that it wouldn't fill the back of a postcard.Have you ever sat around at Thanksgiving dinner listening to your greatgrandmother ramble incoherently about something of great importance? She repeats herself. She takes 10 minutes to communicate the simplest thought. And when it's all over no one knows or cares what she was talking about because the presentation was so damn irritating. That's what you get here.I'll give you an example of one scene. The scene shows the widowed grandmother praying before some lighted candles. It should be obvious that she's paying respects to her dead husband killed by the bomb. But just in case you didn't catch thatjust in case you thought she was playing bingo or somethinghere's how the script goesKid 1 What's that about?Kid 2 Chanting Buddhist sutras.Kid 3 It's a service for the souls of the departed.Kid 2 It's August. Soon it'll be Atomic Bomb Day.Kid 3 August 9th.Kid 4 The day grandpa died.camera lingers for 5 or 10 secondsOh puhleez. I think we got the message ten minutes ago. What could have been a gripping moment is now just an irritating waste of film and dialogue with bad acting to boot. I could see the audience collectively rolling its eyes and I'm ashamed to admit I was rolling along with them.Don't even get me started on the people in the audience who reacted defensively believing this to be an antiAmerican slam. Obviously it's NOT. But I can understand how people might come away with that impression. Kurosawa lays it on so thick that you can't help but feel like he's pointing the finger of blame. If he HAD made it an antiAmerican film or at least antiidiotTruman then I would have found it much more interesting. But instead it's just an overinflated pity party that never ends. There's no conflict all the characters agree that the bomb sucked. All the characters bow their heads. All the characters feel sorry. For 2 hours it's a oneway ticket to waaah.Save yourself the violin strings. Skip this movie and watch the documentary Nagasaki The Horror and Legacy of Fat Man 1995 which is a gripping testament to the suffering and madness experienced by the Japanese civilians. Or if you want to enjoy a GOOD sentimental film of Kurosawa watch Ikuru 1952. But I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to watch this movie.".

His movies illustrate in a sublime manner the harsh battle for survival of ordinary people against the forces of evil politicians generals robbers or other wicked people. They shine through their sincerity their overwhelming emotions and Kurosawa's brilliant directing cast as well as camera with scenes and images that take the viewer by the throat.This movie is a perfect example of Kurosawa's true craftsmanship. Its theme is nothing less than the effect of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Its effect is that 'angels weep'. They weep because those who are responsible for the launch of the bomb argued that the 'Lightning' was necessary to end the war. But the 'Lightning' continues to kill. It still causes mighty suffering for innocent people and that for the rest of their lives. Moreover those who launched the atomic bomb do not like to remember it. They prefer to forget all the victims also those who survived the 'Lightning'.At the heart of this movie stands a grandmother who lost most of her family in the disaster except among other people a brother who emigrated to the US. She wants to see him before she dies. In the meantime her four grandchildren as well as an American nephew played by Richard Gere pay a visit to her. But the memory of the disaster continues to haunt her. When a violent thunderstorm erupts over her village she believes that a new bomb has fallen on the city of Nagasaki. She runs desperately to the rescue of the 'new victims'. With a courageous Richard Gere in an amazing role this movie is a must for all movie lovers and for all fans of Akira Kurosawa.".

However Kurosawa didn't quite pull off the mood with this one.  The children's acting seems a little stilted almost sitcomish and their flat personalities do not create an appropriate contrast to the welldeveloped character of the grandmother.  In a nutshell the mood is incomplete because of poor acting or an underdeveloped screenplay and I'm not afraid to say so despite the massive undertaking of talking about the atomic bomb.".

	onyx:emotionText "The idea of a film exploring the different generational perceptions and reactions to the atomic bomb in Nagasaki is a noble one and the subject certainly needs exposure.  However Kurosawa didn't quite pull off the mood with this one.  The children's acting seems a little stilted almost sitcomish and their flat personalities do not create an appropriate contrast to the welldeveloped character of the grandmother.  In a nutshell the mood is incomplete because of poor acting or an underdeveloped screenplay and I'm not afraid to say so despite the massive undertaking of talking about the atomic bomb.";

I'm not sure what it is about this movie that makes one want to tell what happens since really not much does. It's an episodic film that is notable not for story but for lovely quiet moments like the survivors of a school carefully tending the twisted jungle gym left as a memorial.Perhaps one wants to tell the story because the movie is made up of little moments like a search for a mysterious tree or ants crawling to a rose that don't on their own seem to mean much and yet in the context of the film are striking.There is something wandering about the movie although since life does wander this may be a feature rather than a bug.

Rhapsody in August explores the psychological impact of AngloJapanese relations in the wake of those who remember the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and to see if there are any wounds within that may manifest once having established a familial bond with an old enemy that is now a friend.The political ramifications are clear and fairly in the viewer's face but I really didn't detect any sort of jab on the part of Kurosawa who himself was opposed to the military regime of Imperial Japan and states in his autobiography that he wished he had been braver to oppose it. But he was a child at the time or at the very least a young man and is perhaps being a little hard on himself with that bit of self admittance.The film and Kurosawa don't take much position on the bombing of Nagasaki other than it was a bad thing. He let's the performers narrate his film as he sets the camera in one place with perfect lighting and lets us witness the story unfold in the form of actors telling their views.In a sense this film is supposed to be a kind of balm for older generations who still remember the second world war and specifically the event of the Nagasaki bombing. It's designed to show the aftermath the perception of how the horrors of war are still with us and the emotional shock it has on a grandmother whose husband was lost possibly vaporized in the bombing. She is scarred for life and much is made of the bombing event. One wonders if she would feel the same way were she living in the middle ages and bandits or samurai from a rival clan came and chopped down her husband with a sword. And that's an important point because even though the younger characters are given the frame of Americans as being callous their prejudice is tempered by the appearance of an American family relation in the form of Richard Gere. Suddenly Americans are real and not some abstract concept that fly high altitude bombers and drop devastating weaponry. Is the psychology of the collective offspring salvaged to see people even Americans as people? You be the judge.I have two personal opinions on this film in regards to the politics of the atomic bombings. I love Japanese culture I love Japanese art anime martial arts I wish we could incorporate aspects of Japanese culture into the United States to reshape and bring back the polite society that we had in this nation at one time. But having said that the best way to prevent Nagasakis and Hiroshimas is to prevent the Pearl Harbors. People get the government they deserve and at the time the samurai class in Japan still had a stranglehold on the nation via the professional army shogunate that had no rival lords to oppose military decisions. The rest as they say is history.A minor gripe about this film is Kurosawa's lack of SFX savvy. I wish the guy would have sprung the extra cash for some much needed miniature work and process shots. The miniature bugs me more by the fact that the shot that's in the film could have easily been substituted with stock footage. Where as the process shot used in the split screen flashback could have used a high end optical printer i.e. ILM where were you when Kurosawa was putting the finishing touches on this thing.All in all a decent film.

	schema:reviewBody "Rhapsody in August 1991 is Akira Kurosawa's next to last film. It belongs to Kurosawa's final period of filmmaking when he moved away from themes such as samurai stories and historic eras of Japan and focused on issues such as the Second World War and its effect on the lives of ordinary people in Japan. The title of this film is a reference to August 9 1945 when the atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki.Rhapsody in August tells the story of four young girls and boys who visit their grandmother in a village near Nagasaki for their summer vacation. She is one of the survivors of the atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki during the war but she lost her husband in the atomic bomb attack. It is through her that her grandchildren learn about the atomic bomb attack and how it killed their grandfather. The children's parents have gone to Hawaii to visit the grandmother's elder brother who had married an American woman and lived there since then.The film shows how the children's indifference and disrespect for their grandmother gradually turns into understanding and respect for the sufferings she has gone through. We are allowed to explore the Nagasaki catastrophe through the grandmother's point of view and its aftermath through the children's view who come to show much more understanding for the catastrophic event than their parents who only seem to care about not raising the issue of the atomic bomb on fear that it might upset their American relatives and deprive them from their enterprise.Although the film in several occasions makes direct criticism against the US over the Nagasaki atomic bomb attack it is mostly through the grandmother's powerful and vivid recollections of the war and the children's understanding of the events that the depth of people's sufferings and the cruelty of the act  the atomic bomb attack  are seen. One great example is when the grandmother compares the mushroom cloud of the atomic bomb to a great eye watching over the city.The grandmother is the living soul of all the pains caused by the atomic bomb and Kurosawa all through the film and particularly in its iconic ending well reminds us that time might not heal all wounds.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rhapsody in August 1991 is Akira Kurosawa's next to last film. It belongs to Kurosawa's final period of filmmaking when he moved away from themes such as samurai stories and historic eras of Japan and focused on issues such as the Second World War and its effect on the lives of ordinary people in Japan. The title of this film is a reference to August 9 1945 when the atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki.Rhapsody in August tells the story of four young girls and boys who visit their grandmother in a village near Nagasaki for their summer vacation. She is one of the survivors of the atomic bomb fell on Nagasaki during the war but she lost her husband in the atomic bomb attack. It is through her that her grandchildren learn about the atomic bomb attack and how it killed their grandfather.

She is a survivor of the bomb in 1945 but her husband a teacher perished that day. The grandmother's children are in Hawaii visiting a relative and her husband who is played by Richard Gere in a fine understated performance. Clark Gere and his wife have her father living with them and they claim he is one of Grandma's brothers but she cannot remember him. The film becomes a mediation on the war specifically the devastating effect on Nagasaki. In one particularly touching scene everyone gathers at the school where Grandpa perished that day in August. There is a monument there built for the children who dies there that day a sculpture of mangled monkey bars. The film is slow moving meditative but moving in its best moments. While not among Kurosawa's best work its virtually impossible to stand up to such greatness this last film of his is a touching tribute to a part of his life and so many others that is both easy to forget but also impossible not to remember. The acting is uniformly very good especially the four children and Grandma. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fairly good movie. It provides a compelling dramatic struggle and captures the paranoia of an era. However like many Hollywood movies it strives more to create a dramatic story than an accurate one.This movie was originally to be based on the life of blacklisted writerdirector Abraham Polonsky Force of Evil Body and Soul. Polonsky was working in France at the time of the HUAC hearings and a friend called to tell him not to come back or he'd be called to testify. He deliberately came back for the express purpose of telling HUAC where they could stick it. This is a good story as an anecdote but not a great story for a movie.The one place in which this movie and many other movies softens the history is by making the protagonist politically neutral. It is certainly true that many people accused were not communists or had only attended a meeting out of curiosity but this is not true for everybody. Many of these people were devout socialists. As Polonsky has said on occasion During the Great Depression anybody with a brain considered Communism. The Capitalist system was BROKE. Communism looked like a smart bet. While many of these people reconsidered as the nation returned to prosperity a large number did not.Most of the famous Hollywood Ten were still believers in socialism when they were blacklisted. There is no evidence that any of them were spies for the Soviet Union many of them had already learned that the USSR was not the socialist paradise they dreamed of but they did believe in the writings of Mark and Engels. It is also true that they placed socialist themes in their films. They created gangsters who only cared about money families screwed over by greedy real estate brokers and poor saps who put it all in the stock market.However none of this was illegal. They had every right to believe in whatever politics they chose to. They had every right to create these films and their movies seemed to have a resonance with the audience. They're lives and careers were destroyed because they held political beliefs that some viewed as threatening.I also want to point out that Elia Kazan was not the model for this film. Elia Kazan has been repeatedly condemned by Polonsky and others who were blacklisted. He chose to name names and to allow the HUAC to bully him. I don't condemn him for this like other people. As this movie shows so much was on the line for people who HUAC sets their sights on. Kazan cracked. He failed to be a hero when the time came. This doesn't mark him a coward merely something less than a hero. On the Waterfront while not a direct explanation of his actions is an excellent look at his state of mind around that time.While yes I have not spent much time reviewing this movie I felt it necessary to set the record straight about history.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1947 the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities began an investigation into Communism in Hollywood. Shortly after this director David Merrill returns from filming abroad. It is not long before he is targeted for having attended a few meetings a few years ago. The approach is softly softly with the committee just wanting Merrill to name some more names for them. When he refuses to help he finds himself gradually cut out of studios and projects with fewer and fewer people willing to take his calls.The period of history around which this film is set is an interesting one and one that is worth knowing about as part of the whole learning from history ideal. However this is not the same as the film itself being good because unfortunately it is not what I would have liked. It relies too heavily on the informative nature of the recreation of the period rather than developing an interesting script with realistic characters. It doesn't help that the film tries to be all very serious and respectful but does rather fail and ends up coming over all earnest and self important. The script also tries not to really upset anyone who didn't take the moral stance of the fictional Merrill by just focusing on him even though it would have been a lot more interesting if it had had outrage bitterness and realism at its heart.Winkler directs without a great deal of style and his courtroom scene is average where it should have been the best scene of the film. De Niro works his material hard and makes for an engaging lead however it is the lack of depth and complexity in his material that limits his performance. This is more or less true of the rest of the cast which although starry doesn't really provide anyone in particular with an opportunity to mark themselves out. Bening Wendt Wettig Wanamaker Sizemore Scorsese Cooper and others are good presences but not much more than that.Overall then an interesting film in so much as it informs about an important period of history. However it is all very earnest and safe and lost a lot of potential for me. The cast is starry but the material is middleoftheroad and didn't give anyone the complexity and outrage that the subject deserved.".

The cast is starry but the material is middleoftheroad and didn't give anyone the complexity and outrage that the subject deserved.";

The trial scene though is a composite of many of the McCarthy HUAC hearings and thus needs to be explained by the teacher. The resemblences of major characters such as David Merill in the movie David Merick in real life are transparent enough to use as fact. Scorsesee and De Niro made a few non gangster movies that were significant and underrated . This is one of them King of Comedy is another. The political tool of intimidation of Hollywood intellectual types depicted in this film is especially relevant today given the climate of Rush Limbaugh and his miinions. The acting soundtrack cinematography are all impeccable. Many of the small parts are played by character actors who will be recognizable to your students. The film also pays careful attention to the sights and sounds of Hollywood in the fifties. As far as the omnipresent issue of Hollywood vs History this film ranks as one of the most fidelitous to history. Use it.".

Kazan could have returned to Broadway where there was no concern over a blacklist the film's protagonist does not have that option  although he considers it and does make an attempt.The film does mix its few historical references  making it appear that Merrill is assigned to High Noon which is referred to as a B film but while that film's screenwriter Carl Foreman was under suspicion he made it to the end of the film. Also quite interesting is the importance made on constant references to Darryl F.Zanuck  this is a Warner Brothers release. Had they checked they might have noticed that it was Jack Warner who named Kazan and Arthur Miller as Broadway subversives with no further elaboration offered or requested in the real hearings. I guess that Warners didn't want to denigrate their own history but did manage to thumb its nose at Zanuck who left Warners back in the early thirties in order to head up what eventually became 20th Century Fox.De Niro gives an excellent performance his soul searching his pain and his final triumph at a price do feel real. Annette Bening is less so but she has much less of a role. Martin Scorsese De Niro's frequent collaborator as his director scores as a fellow director who leaves for England  most likely he is based on Joseph Losey. Their discussion on filmmaking has the ring of truth to it. Shortly after this De Niro made HIS directorial debut so the two got to reverse roles in real life as well.Sam Wanamaker an actor who actually suffered under the blacklist plays an attorney named Graff who is recommended to Merrill and most likely he's based on Martin Gang who served a similar function during the HUAC hearings. He does an admirable job in what came close to a career finish for the actordirector. Chris Cooper and Patricia Wettig also rate in smaller roles as a show biz couple whose life is torn apart by the hearings and which serves as the catalyst for Merrill's own introspection.The subject still warrants a better more accurate treatment but at least this comes closer to truth than the bits covered in The Majestic or in The Way We Were. There are some anachronisms but the period detail of the production design is still admirable. The last quarter hour of the film packs a wallop as it fairly well duplicates the footage of the real events in depicting the misapplication of justice that came as close to being unAmerican as the subversive activities that the Committee was supposed to be investigating.".

He hasn't done many great films in a while but his acting chops speak for themselves. He stars here as David Merrill a blacklisted director in Hollyweird who's basically accused of being a communist and certain government factions want him to name names. His performance although subdued is very solid as he struggles with the decision to either report his friends who are thought to be Communist in order to rescue his once promising career or refuse to give up any names so their lives and careers won't be destroyed also. There's a moving scene between Merrill and congress as they bombard him with questions and accusations. This is probably the most memorable scene but I thought it tries to wrap the film up in a neat little ball as opposed to letting us know exactly what went on in those supposedly communist meetings Merrill was a part of and what was discussed there and who attended these meetings.George Wendt does a commendable job as Bunny Baxter even though it's difficult to see him other than Norm from Cheers but I digress.

	schema:reviewBody "Robert De Niro is a highly successful screenwriter and director in Hollywood of the early 1950s. Twelve years earlier during the Great Depression he attended meetings of communists in the homes of some friends. Now anticommunism is sweeping the country in the wake of the Rosenbergs and De Niro along with many of his friends becomes a person of interest to the FBI and to a congressional committee that wants him to name names as they used to say.Some of his friends who are still communist sympathizers flee to England. The rest are mostly terrified. De Niro's lawyer friend Sam Wanamaker urges him to spill the beans because what the heck it's all going to blow over some day and why should he ruin his life? But De Niro thinks he's above it all too wellknown and too much of a money maker for the studio. He's wrong. Daryl F. Zanuck wants him to continue working but only if he gives up his friends. Real names are sometimes used and historical situations simulated. He loses his livelihood his car his house his friends and his intransigence drives away his estranged wife. Broke he leaves Hollywood for New York but his theater friends won't touch him. Back to Hollywood on a Greyhound bus where he finds a job directing a picture for Monogram but he's fired before he can finish it.De Niro is subpoenaed and appears before the congressional committee whose loudmouthed members browbeat him until he's removed from the room. The ending is ambiguous.It would be easy to dismiss this as some sort of Americabashing on the part of the movie makers and in a way it is since it's a reasonably accurate portrayal of a particularly shameful incident in American history. There were of course communists and socialists around in Hollywood but the hysteria that accompanied this conviction caused more damage than the disease itself.A thought experiment suggests itself. As I write this many Americans support a social and political movement called the Tea Party. Imagine if fifteen or twenty years from now the political climate had shifted dramatically and Tea Party sentiments were widely viewed as treasonable. All of a sudden a lot of people who were caught up in these rallies and picnics are persecuted by the FBI and if defiant get to spend some time in jail. It could happen. It happened to casual supporters of workers' causes during the depression the kind of people that De Niro's character represents. Sociologists call these waves of collective hysteria moral panics. They're not uncommon. We've had witches Satanists preschool child molesters Illuminati Masons and so forth. Common sense gets lost along the way.De Niro is fine as usual. He looks the part of the free thinker. He wears loose and sloppy clothes and has long tousled hair. The period decor is accurate. And some of the incidents such as De Niro's court appearance look overdrawn and yet are very closely modeled on some film clips of the real congressional committee's conduct. Typical communist response. Step away from the table. So why isn't it more successful? Partly because the plot is so mechanical. One thing leads predictably to another. The audience is always far ahead of De Niro's character. We all know pride goeth before a fall and that he's going to wind up in somebody's Fix It Shop on a side street in New York before he bounces back after an infusion of some moral roborant and that he will wind up with his wife again. It's like watching a long and preachy After School Special.Perhaps one of the worst things a message movie can do is overdramatize the problem. Guilty by Suspicion shows us an actress whose life was ruined by the movement committing suicide. Then we get to see the mourners at the funeral. It's too much. We don't need the death. It interferes with our suspension of disbelief. Or  if you insist on killing someone in an attempt to increase the audience's involvement  you'd better do it well and this suicide is sketchy as hell. We've hardly met the woman. We can be grateful that De Niro doesn't pause on the stage and come out with a soliloquy along the lines of I can't give up my friends because it would be an immoral act.... The worst he says is Am I supposed to spend the rest of my life dreaming what I could have been? Most of us do Bobby. That doesn't rob the film of its irony. One of the reasons the committee wants to nail De Niro is that he attended a demonstration that urged an end to nuclear weapons which happened to be one of Ronald Reagan's announced goals towards the end of his administration.".

	schema:reviewBody "A little background to the film's time period may be helpful.It's 1951. Communist Chinese forces have pushed USled UN forces back to the Korean border between North and South. Meanwhile Soviet troops occupy much of Europe following WWII while Soviet scientists explode the first Abomb outside the US. Thus anxiety grips much of America as fears of losing the Cold War heats up. So what are our congressional politicians doing to reverse the tide. That's a question many of the time were understandably asking. In short the country's temperature is rising.For one thing our guardians are zeroing in on high profile Hollywood where many Reds and their sympathizers are known to reside. After all didn't much of the film industry support aid to America's WWII ally the Soviets. Plus much union organizing of actors and crews before the War were led by known communists. Thus studio moneymen had no liking for anticapitalists wherever they resided. In short such a background made the oncoming wave of industry blacklisting much easier. This is not a movie for everyone since the story zeros in on that single time period and the effects of the blacklist on one man movie director Merrill DeNiro. Nonetheless for those with a liking for human interest andor that crucial time period the movie's a rare 105minute eyeopener.Merrill's a highly successful director whose life is torn apart because he refuses to clear himself before HUAC the congressional committee investigating communist influence in the film industry. Seems Merrill attended some party meetings during the war but never joined. Now he's being called forth to name names of those who also attended. As a result they too can then be investigated and possibly lose their livelihoods friends and family. A principled man Merrill refuses to cooperate which means being blacklisted by the studios and a loss of assets including his exwife's Bening and son's house and home. In short acting on conscience is costing him dearly but can he continue to refuse as his life collapses around him. That's the crux of the plot. And it's not just a conflict between principle and success since his wife and child are also suffering because of his persistent refusal.Within limits the movie's very well done. DeNiro refuses to go overthetop in a role that could have easily done so. Still for all the movie's assets especially a willingness to draw in a broad range of showbiz functionaries one crucial compromise occurs that colors the rest. In short Merrill is made a liberal rather than a communist or even an excommunist. Thus deeper more intractable conflicts of a political and ethical nature are avoided. After all if he were even just an exred then questions could arise about his patriotic support for the war in Korea or how he might politically color the films he works on. Then too the film avoids the highly charged Cold War atmosphere of the time such that the basic conflict appears to involve only showbiz and overly ambitious politicos. Thus a crucial concession is made that helps turn the upshot into a 1950'stype happy ending. That may please some audiences but still amounts to a key drawback in the movie's overall slice of historical reality. Nonetheless directorwriter Winkler's film reveals a great deal about how the highly charged period affected lives among even the most significant of Hollywood moviemakers. More importantly it's one that should cause viewers to dig deeper into the overarching issues raised there.".

The movie is one sided because it barely addresses what happens to actual communists it just works with falsely accused communists like the overblown Dorothy character.

If you didn't name names your career was officially over and you were unofficially suspected of being a communist. Merrill refuses to name anybody and his life becomes a nightmare. It also affects his exwife Ruth Annette Bening and friend Bunny Baxter George Wendt.This movie has good intentions and it's great that anybody made a film dealing with the horrendous witch hunts in the 1950sbut this film just doesn't work. It's simplistic to a ridiculous degreeEVERYTHING is dumbed down so anyone can get it. Also the plot is obvious I was always one step ahead of this and the movie is overlong. However the movie looks just great and the music is wonderful. Acting really helps this oneDeNiro is a little subdued but still good Bening is given the thankless exwife role but pulls it off Wendt overdoes it at times but is basically pretty good and Patricia Wettig as a friend who cracks under the strain is WAY over the top to an embarrassing degree. Also it's amusing to see Martin Scorses in a small role as a director. Ultimately the film is too bland to really workbut the courtroom sequence at the end does provide real fireworks. Worth seeing if you know nothing about what happened in Hollywood back then. I can only give it a 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Guilty by Suspicion' is a much needed film about McCarthyism probably the darkest era of modern US history one marked by conscious attempts to terrorize and silence political dissenters. David Merrill Robert De Niro is a relatively successful director who returns to Hollywood from filming in France to find that his political loyalty has been called into question by the infamous House UnAmerican Activities Committee HUAC. Unlike many of his artist friends he decides to stick to his principles and fight the sinister Committee to the end.It is a testament to the film's historical boldness that even professional critics have often found it impossible to evaluate it without digging into their personal political bias. Many see Merrill as the prototype libertarian antihero fighting against repression while most see him as worthy of the fate of a 'communist traitor'. The film makes it quite clear that Merrill who is of course a fictitious character is representative of the vast majority of individuals persecuted by HUAC in that he was as communistic as your average 'Save the Whales' member. His unconventional decision to challenge the Committee comes not from an ideological need to defend his mildly dissenting politics but from his antagonistic frustration against HUAC's Stalinist witch hunt tactics that ruined the lives of many during the early stages of the Cold War. Ultimately the debate about Merrill's character is largely irrelevant because it is actually HUAC's and the FBI's shameful and repulsive character rather than Merrill's eccentric heroics that is the film's central theme. Students of US history will not fail to hear throughout the film echoes of Special Army Attorney Joseph N. Welch's frustrated remarks at long last Sir have you no decency? aimed against a bullying Senator Joe McCarthy shortly before the latter's conclusive political demise.Impressive performances by Robert De Niro and Patricia Wettig as Dorothy Nolan carry the film whose deficient script unfortunately fails to make the most of an interesting and important theme. Equally disappointing is the film's failure to recreate a convincing visual context of late 1940s Hollywood. It is worth noting however that the film's final 12 minutes contain an unparalleled cinematic depiction of HUAC's early hearings which is worth experiencing. Overall a fine effort 5.5 stars out of ten.".

As for the scene where someone writes down the license plate I understand that they did that in real life.This is one part of history that particularly needs to get remembered. When some rightwing ideologue calls for rooting out the other in the name of Americanism it simply means that he wants to stay in power at all costs. It's worth noting that Franklin Roosevelt was negotiating with the Soviet Union to make sure that there would be no more wars once WWII was over but he died and so Truman canceled those plans.

Before he can start directing his next picture however he must first go before the Council and give the names of people who he saw at the 2 or 3 Communist Party meetings he visited. He refuses and pain suffering and FBI agents trailing him ensue. He is finally taken before the council where he must decide what to do.The cast is in fine form here. Robert De Niro plays David a man who has never known being a saint but now must make a decision that will change his life and the lives of his friends. Annette Bening is pretty good as his wife although it is a less important role than you would think. George Wendt TVs Cheers is given a chance to play a character with conflict and succeeds very well. The big surprise is Martin Scorcese in a small supporting role and he steals every scene he is in even from De Niro which is no small task.The only real problem with this film is that it can be quite predictable. When a certain character was going to die I knew it before it happened. When Baxter Wendt goes to testify I knew what was going to happen.Overall this is a solid film about the era of Hollywood blacklisting.

'Trumbo' evokes the ambiance of fear a year or two ago. Dalton Trumbo called those who named names before HUAC in order to save their skins to be stamped approved for work He called them toad meat eaters. And he was right. 'Guilty of Suspicion' stars Robert De Niro as David Merrill a highly talented and successful director who after a time in France returns to a Hollywood that he no longer recognizes. The film opens with a brutal session of HUAC. Larry Nolan Chris Cooper pleads for his decency not to name names. He does weak reed that he is. As such he denounces his wife Dorothy Patricia Wettig and has her branded an unfit mother. Ultimately loss of income and work denied the maternal love of her child she drinks too much drifts and kills herself in a car accident. But her husband who burns his books to cleanse his radical conscience finds work and fulfillment as a result of his betrayal of his friends. Merrill is a fair haired boy of Darryl Zanack. His patron tantalizingly dangle a juicy script only if he satisfies the unsound morality of selling friends for 30 pieces of silver to denounce Communism and serve the corrupt demands of HUAC. And the studios long have acquiesced to HUAC's demands double downed by the witch hunters of McCarthy and his minions the creation of a time of fear and betrayal that drove down deep into the US society and American psyche. Winkler's script was created by Abe Polansky a banded Hollywood 10 writer who knew first hand what he was writing. Originally Merrill was cast as a Communist but Winkler turned him into a 'liberal' who like the Communists suffered as well. Polansky pulled his name but not his contribution to this sober straight forward film. A touch of realism is the presence of Sam Wanamaker who fled the uS for England there he turned his energies to infuse British theater with a creative energy. In 'Guilty by Suspicion' he plays a lawyer who persuades reluctant or hesitant witnesses to swallow his conscience and conquer his fear and confess Party membership and nail names of friends to the door of HUAC. De Niro is a sober actor who although sure of himself wavers a moment after a time without work loss of house and sports car and incessant badgering by the FBI and even if he finds work in a Western reminiscent of 'High Noon' he's fired because the Monogram wont buy the bullet by hiring a blacklisted director. Ultimately appearing before HUAC badgered by the drillmaster of the Committee's counsel and hectored by the cigar smoking chair Wood Merrill will only talk of himself but wont names names. Try as he might to teach the Committee of defending the Constitution he is shouted down to the sharp sound of the gavel denounced for contempt he is removed and might be cited for contempt of Congress a threat that carries a prison sentence. Nonetheless his stand stiffens the moral back bone of his long time friend Bunny Baxter George Wendt Bunny ready to make his peace and fold to the Committee's demands wont and he too will find himself in internal exile without work and no friends who think him a social leper. The version I saw was grainy which somehow heightens the use of black and white. The camera doesn't fade but is focused squarely on the actors. It focuses squarely on the actors as the narrative works itself out. The cast is well chosen and the narrative moves along by the artful selection of the music. Oh Martin Scorsese has a cameo as a Communist film maker who advises De Niro to follow him to Europe where he can live and work. Even the arch conservative Churchill said 'in England we don't believe in blacklists. The toll in lives was widespread and affected every segment of America and the horror turns up even in the 21 century in other forms but as noxious and vindictive without fault.".

	schema:headline " A film that will never age and you will always have a place for in your heart";
	schema:reviewBody "What's Eating Gilbert Grape is one of those little treasures that for the most part most people do know about mainly due to Leonardo DiCaprio's knock out performance as Arnie Grape. But both he and Johnny had this great chemistry together that made what could have been a very boring movie into an extremely touching piece of film that meant more and more to me as I grew up. When I was a kid and watched this film I just loved laughing at all of Arnie's jokes not realizing why he was so silly. As a teenager I could start to relate to having a little more pressure with a job and school. Then as an adult and having my mother become ill I could relate completely to Gilbert in his frustrations of just wanting to be young and enjoy his life. I think that's why this film is special to a lot of people those who have felt the added little pressures in life and makes you think on what's eating at you? This is the story of Gilbert Grape.In the small town of Endora Gilbert Grape is busy caring for his mentally handicapped brother Arnie. His morbidly obese mother Bonnie has done little except eat since her husband died and longs only to see Arnie live to the age of 18. With Bonnie unable to care for her children on her own Gilbert has taken responsibility for repairing the old house and looking after Arnie who has a habit of climbing the town water tower while his sisters Amy and Ellen do the rest. The relationship between the brothers is of both care and protection as Gilbert continually enforces the 'nobody touches Arnie' policy. A new Foodland supermarket has opened threatening the small Lamson's Grocery where Gilbert works. In addition Gilbert is having an affair with a married woman Betty Carver. The family is looking forward to Arnie's 18th birthday. A young woman named Becky and her grandmother are stuck in town when their car breaks down. Gilbert's unusual life circumstances threaten to get in the way of their possible romance. His affair with Mrs Carver ends when she leaves town in search of a new life following her husbands death. Becky becomes close to both Gilbert and Arnie and as she talks to Gilbert she begins to unlock some buried hopes dreams and happiness. Later on Arnie tries to run away yet again from his bath and in his frustration Gilbert finally snaps hitting Arnie several times. Guilty and appalled at himself Gilbert takes the car and runs out without another word fearing that he is leaving his family just like his father and brother did.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just an incredibly beautiful and touching movie that will always have a special place in my heart. It makes you laugh cry and think about how precious life is. All the characters are relatable or likable in some way. Even in the smallest of all towns where it seems like it's just dead there is life. That's what this movie is about to me everyone has a story and everyone has an experience to share. This is just a terrific film quality acting and a heart felt story I very much recommend that if you get the chance to watch it. If anything for Leonardo DiCaprio's incredible performance and Johnny Depp singing to him Match in the gas tank boom boom!.1010".

The biggest surprise was Leo DiCaprio as Arnie. Amazing and he was only 19 when the film was released. He gave an amazing portrayal of a boy who goes in and out of his own world. Juliette Lewis was a quiet storm in this film she gave Gilbert an anchor of solid acceptance when the pain of his life almost got the best of him. The casting worked perfectly to create family dynamics that were so very real that they did not even seem brandable as dysfunctional. I appreciated that the mother was never portrayed as less intelligent simply because she was overweight. I loved that the kids did everything they could to protect their mother and their disturbed brother from outside influences and hurt feelings. They stuck together until the end which actually became the beginning. A hopeful and joyous film.".

A lot of things the characters say and do seem superficial but actually aren't meaningless as they lead to other events in the story. And the arrival of Becky Juliette Lewis and her mother make things interesting for Gilbert. The ending is unexpected very solid and sad.

	schema:headline " Trapped";
	schema:reviewBody "Small American towns nurture kindness and big hearts as personified by Gilbert Grape Johnny Depp a twenty year old guy who heads a loving but difficult family of two younger sisters a mentally retarded younger brother named Arnie Leonardo DiCaprio and their obese momma Darlene Cates. These are humble unpretentious common folks who do the best they can. But life in a small town in Iowa is hard and it can be frustrating and confining. At times you can feel ... trapped.The film's theme is explicit. Gilbert is trapped in a vexing family. Arnie is trapped in a body with a flawed brain. Momma is trapped in an obese body. A local woman named Betty Mary Steenburgen is trapped in an unsatisfying marriage. A young woman named Becky Juliette Lewis is trapped with her grandmother in the town by an RV that has broken down while passing through. Even a grasshopper gets trapped in Arnie's mischievous hands.Seeing good people trapped in difficult situations is poignant. The film really tugs at your heartstrings. In one sequence momma must face gawkers as she leaves the courthouse. Her response is inspiring and majestic. Darlene Cates does a wonderful job in this role.Gilbert and his family live in a modest house. Its interior reminds me of the grim depressing house in the movie Silkwood 1983. The dinner table must be moved each meal to wherever momma is sitting. And typical family conversation centers on preparation for Arnie's birthday party and debate over ways to cook bacon.A friend helps Gilbert reinforce the wood floor under Gilbert's house so that the floor won't collapse under the weight of momma. Gilbert is kind and has a big heart. And he is very protective of Arnie who has a habit of climbing up the town's water tower.The townsfolk are satisfied with fulfilling small dreams like getting a job at the new burger barn or getting an ice cream snack at the local Dairy Dreme. Small American towns ... life is familial and loving but it can also be confining. And this film reminds me a lot of The Last Picture Show 1971.The acting in What's Eating Gilbert Grape is very good as is the color cinematography and production design. I did find the Arnie character to be a bit grating at times. The film's plot is slightly repetitive. And I don't care for the film's title. But these are minor issues.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a heartfelt story about life in a small American town with all its kindness big hearts and familial love despite the hardships. The film is worth a serious look for its thematic depth for its acting and for its attention to detail in sets and production design.".

	onyx:emotionText "Small American towns nurture kindness and big hearts as personified by Gilbert Grape Johnny Depp a twenty year old guy who heads a loving but difficult family of two younger sisters a mentally retarded younger brother named Arnie Leonardo DiCaprio and their obese momma Darlene Cates. These are humble unpretentious common folks who do the best they can. But life in a small town in Iowa is hard and it can be frustrating and confining. At times you can feel ... trapped.The film's theme is explicit. Gilbert is trapped in a vexing family. Arnie is trapped in a body with a flawed brain. Momma is trapped in an obese body. A local woman named Betty Mary Steenburgen is trapped in an unsatisfying marriage. A young woman named Becky Juliette Lewis is trapped with her grandmother in the town by an RV that has broken down while passing through. Even a grasshopper gets trapped in Arnie's mischievous hands.Seeing good people trapped in difficult situations is poignant. The film really tugs at your heartstrings. In one sequence momma must face gawkers as she leaves the courthouse. Her response is inspiring and majestic. Darlene Cates does a wonderful job in this role.Gilbert and his family live in a modest house. Its interior reminds me of the grim depressing house in the movie Silkwood 1983. The dinner table must be moved each meal to wherever momma is sitting. And typical family conversation centers on preparation for Arnie's birthday party and debate over ways to cook bacon.A friend helps Gilbert reinforce the wood floor under Gilbert's house so that the floor won't collapse under the weight of momma. Gilbert is kind and has a big heart. And he is very protective of Arnie who has a habit of climbing up the town's water tower.The townsfolk are satisfied with fulfilling small dreams like getting a job at the new burger barn or getting an ice cream snack at the local Dairy Dreme.

	schema:reviewBody "I thought I wouldn't like this. I decided to see it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp who appeared in some of my favorite movies  Edward Scissorhands Benny and Joon etc.  I knew what the plot was a guy who lives with his 15 year old sister his 18 year old mentally disabled brother who could die at any time and his morbidly obese mother always has to do everything for his family and something happens that changes his life. It sounded like it was a typical sappy drama. I usually hate dramas like that. Movies in which the only point is to feel bad for the characters. But this one was quite different. The plot in this movie is unclear which makes it appealing in my opinion. There isn't a lot of events in the movie really. It all revolves around Arnie's birthday and Gilbert's meeting with the new girl. The movie is very slow paced and doesn't rely on action and shock to catch his viewer's attentions. It's moving but the dialogues are also very simple. You might expect this movie to be overdramatic but it's everything but that. The situation and story are extremely sad but I never felt overwhelmed by this. Keep in mind that I can't usually handle dramas very well.The movie is about partly about Gilbert but it also describes life in this town very well. Gilbert's family often has a big impact on the other people in this town so it's natural that they would be the family that the movie is about. What's also really nice is that Gilbert isn't portrayed as a hero in this movie. He has flaws and he can make mistakes even if he's taking care of everyone. He is not the typical goodhearted young adult or teenager who's taking care of everyone and wants to give everything for his family. He actually has feelings of his own and he is trying to find himself. The whole movie is about his quest to find who he really is if he isn't Gilbert Grape the guy who's always running after his brother Arnie.Another good point about this movie is the way it was filmed. The visuals are great and the way the movie was made makes us feel like we're seeing life in a different way than usual.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently stumbled upon the last half of one of those Top 50 Child Stars TV shows which had a segment on Leonardo DiCaprio showing interviews with him when he first started acting and would make jokes about how famous and rich he was having had no way of knowing how astronomically rich and famous he would go on to be. Anyway the show described his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape as one of his most charming which turned out to be a tremendous understatement.The film takes place in the motionless town of Endora Iowa and concerns the world of Gilbert Grape whose life is in a constant state of turmoil. He works for a tiny local general store that has come under the competitive strain of a massive supermarket which has opened just outside of town. Needless to say the store is a major topic of conversation among the local townspeople because a big store in a town like Endora is big news. I think the real charm of the movie lies in the fact that it is able to portray what you normally might consider to be a highly dysfunctional family and make them charming and in the context of the town and world they live in lovable. All of the problems that the family suffers on a daily basis are right at the forefront throughout the film but no one ever really seems unhappy except for the mother and we get the feeling that her unhappiness is both the cause and the result of her morbid obesity. We get a brief explanation of how she came to be so heavy but not really much more than I wasn't always like this. Gilbert is about 21 and seems to be the only one mature and mentally and physically able enough to hold the family together and the majority of the movie focuses on his struggles to do that in normal life. He is in charge of his mentally retarded brother Arnie DiCaprio has to periodically subdue his intolerably obnoxious sister who looks like she belongs in a different family and a different society and she believes that too while at the same time getting to work on time hanging out at coffee shops with his similarly offbeat friends talking about the undertaking business. In between all of this a local desperate housewife periodically orders groceries for delivery from the general store where he works and she tends to be a little less desperate after he leaves.It seems that all of this normality charming in both its daily routine and its total difference from the daily monotony that the majority of us are used to is presented to us so that we can get to know Gilbert his daily life and his family as they are before the cataclysmic arrival of Becky Juliette Lewis. Becky is on a vacation of sorts with her mother and stops in Endora long enough for her and Gilbert to develop a romantic interest in each other and she thereby breaks the series of monotonies which the first part of the movie introduced us to. Monotonies which may have continued forever had she not arrived. There are a series of events that take place after Becky arrives as Gilbert tries to assimilate her into his wellestablished life testing the waters and taking new risks that he would never have even considered before and learning something about himself from the results as we all do. The Grapes are a family that would very likely knock you off your feet if you were to run into almost any of them in person but the movie is so good at treating them as humans that they are not a spectacle at all even when Arnie is repeatedly climbing the local water tower much to the chagrin of the local police force who have been promised repeatedly that this is the last time. It never is and when we see Arnie up there on the tower we cheer for him and the reason we cheer for him is the same reason why the movie is so effective.We don't cheer for him because we identify with his struggle against a couple of grumpy cops but as though he has made an accomplishment because in his mind he has.".

Also Juliette Lewis gives a truly remarkable performance as the vulnerable Becky.There are also many heartbreaking moments in this movie but I will only mention the ones who where the most special to be. The scene where the mother goes to the police office herself to get her son was really moving. When she returns to the car and all the people are staring at here children are laughing there's even a guy who's taking a picture... when I saw this I could only feel very sorry for her. Another great scene is when they put the house on fire when their mother died. The meaning of that is very beautiful and sad at the same time it's the only way her funeral can be a bit respectful and she won't be seen as a joke it's literally what she said she wanted I'm a big fan of Lasse Hallstrm. Every time he makes a movie he succeeds in delivering a wonderful a touching piece of art with actors who give the best of them. This movie isn't an exception it is as beautiful as The Cider House Rules Chocolat and The Shipping News.Wonderful story great acting...what more should a movie have?

	schema:reviewBody "'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' a film by Lasse Hallstrm is not your average movie. There are no stunning visual effects no mindblowing stuntwork and even the film setting is somewhat dull and lifeless. However the movie is a very good one for it is driven by its diverse range of characters.Gilbert Grape played by Johnny Depp Edward Scissorhands Pirates Of The Caribbean does not think much of his home town. He describes Endora population 1091 as a place he sorely wishes not to be like dancing with no music. About 21 years of age Gilbert became the fatherly figure in the somewhat dysfunctional household after his father committed suicide some years ago. Alongside his work at a struggling local grocery store Gilbert has a very difficult personal life. Between caring for his intellectually disabled brother Leonardo DiCaprio Titanic Catch Me If You Can and his dangerously obese mother Darlene Cates Gilbert is trapped in a very intimate relationship with Betty Carver Mary Steenburgen a lonesome housewife to whom Gilbert makes frequent deliveries. However everything that Gilbert believes about life suddenly changes with the arrival of Becky Juliette Lewis a stranded camper who shows Gilbert to look at the bigger picture rather than focus on the negatives.The acting performances are generally superb. Depp who mastered the role of a quiet outsider in 'Edward Scissorhands' steps painlessly into the role of Gilbert Grape a man confused by his own emotions and the sudden changes happening in his life. However the highlight of the film is without a doubt the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. In a both funny and convincing role that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination and displayed the greatness that he would later achieve DiCaprio portrays Gilbert's intellectually disabled brother Arnie who is currently ecstatic about his coming 18th birthday party and occupies himself by climbing the town water tower and forgetting how to get down.'What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a great film with a warm heart. Its characters are convincingly portrayed and easy to relate to and the story brings the drama to great levels. Perhaps the only flaw I found with the film was that there was much of the same throughout and the dry Iowa setting was not very appealing to the eye. However this somewhat dull repetitiveness also serves to convey the monotony of Gilbert's life a routine that is suddenly plunged into chaos with each unforeseen change.".

Depp manages to capture every emotion perfectly in an nonshowy role he pulls you in and makes you believe.Ultimately this is a simple story man struggles then finds love but it's so much more the relationships of the family Grape are very well observed from the mother hugely overweight causing the structure of the house to crumble to the growing pains of the sisters. Where this story strikes gold is with Arnie I remember when I first saw this film I had no idea who Di Caprio was I actually thought they had used a disabled actor to play the part when watching that year's Oscars and seeing him nominated for the role I was amazed. I have watched many films and his performance is one of the best I have ever seen. Remarkable in it's accuracy and so moving when we find him sitting in cold bath water having been told not to move hours earlier well it breaks your heart and Gilbert's rage demonstrating his frustration not really at Arnie but at life just brilliant.So this is a film that you should see if only for Di Caprio but it has much more than that.".

An interesting metaphor used several times is him starting a fire lighting a match only to blow it out again which kind of summarizes his existence starting something and then changing his mind at least until the end of the film.This film deals with the kind of gutlevel emotions that we all have but would rather not acknowledge very much like 'The Cider House Rules' by the same director.

The majority of the movies he's made have been subpar and he tends to rely on his seemingly badboy hearthrob image through most of his movies gag. However in Gilbert Grape we saw the very essence of DiCaprio's talent and if it weren't for him I daresay this movie would not be worth watching.  In fact for me the only reason I continued to watch was because I was drawn to his character.Some people believe it is easy to play a mentally deficient person.  I disagree.  Actors run the risk of appearing as if they are merely making fun of a mentally challenged person rather than depicting one.  Often times the portrayal is a complete flop leaving the viewer disgusted and annoyed I am Sam.  Such is not the case for DiCaprio's Arnie in Gilbert Grape.  Having worked with the disabled for over 10 years I have to say his portrayal was on the spot and certainly not overdone.  From the constant repitition of various phrases the contorting of his fingers to the throaty squeaky laugh DiCaprio hits the nail square on the head.  So you might be wondering why this seems like a DiCaprio review rather than a Gilbert Grape review.  Basically that's what this movie turns into...a DiCaprio film...because the viewer can't help but to totally focus on his character and set aside all the others.But since this is supposed to be about the film itself here goes Johnny Depp was extremely flat throughout this film citing lines with the utmost of monotony.  Darlene Cates although not really an actress just a pick from a daytime talk tv show was really only picked due to her size since the few lines she had were so poorly acted.  Personally I find that insulting To only be picked for a movie because you are obese.  Juliette Lewis is her typical self and although I like most of her work in Gilbert Grape she just appears typical.  The storyline could have been compelling enough but the deep points of the movie were never really captured nor expanded upon leaving the movie to be another runofthemill tugontheheartstrings big budgeted movie that was meant to be made for tv. So we get back to DiCaprio who really was the only big budget performance of the bunch.If you're suffering from insomnia it's 1am and this movie happens to be playing then watch it.  Or if you're interested in single performances rather than the movie as a whole then watch this one...you'll enjoy the scenes with Arnie.  However if you're looking for something interesting provoking or even entertaining choose another.".

Stretched out under the bright sun he closes his eyes and begins to think deeply. House...I want a new house for the family. His dreamlike expression softens. I want Mama to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie. What do you want for you she asks just for you? The shadow of a smile drifts across his face and he replies without hesitation I want to be a good person. Gilbert Grape is a good person he just doesn't realize it yet. Johnny Depp portrays the twentysomething Gilbert in Endora Iowa Pop. 1091 as a young man asleep at the wheel of his life. As he narrates his story we learn his older sister Amy is a mother type figure and a decent cook only she has a tendency to accidentally start fires like the one that burned down the elementary school she used to work at. Ellen his younger sister is a preening pubescent teen who has an opinion on everything  and it isn't a very good opinion either. Kids from around town come peeking through windows of the ramshackle Grape house to catch a glimpse of his 500pound mother who cannot come to the dinner table or hardly go anywhere for that matter so the dinner table comes to her. And then there's Arnie. Arnie Grape in an Oscarnominated performance by Leonardo DiCaprio is about to turn eighteen in a few days and suffers from severe mental retardation. His favorite pastime is to climb up the water tower in the middle of town but climbing down is a different story. He is unable to dress or bathe himself. He likes to find inventive ways to decapitate grasshoppers but cries when he realizes he has killed them. As the doctors have warned  and Arnie often cheerfully reminds everyone  he can go at any time. Gilbert puts it this way Some days you want him to live...some days you don't.Just passing through this offbeat atmosphere is a curiously wise yet enigmatic young stranger named Becky Juliette Lewis. Everyone else in the sleepy town sees Gilbert as a carbon copy of his father who committed suicide fifteen years earlier. They see someone going nowhere and in a sense he already is nowhere. But Becky sees more. She sees more than Gilbert can see in himself and she sees that his circumstances have made him afraid to feel anything.What's Eating Gilbert Grape is the fine product of director Lasse Hallstrom. Just as in one of his later efforts Chocolat Hallstrom has created here a small world where stagnant lives hide under a blanket of tranquility and a mysterious young woman blows in and changes everything. Beyond the perfect cast of supporting characters played brilliantly by Mary Steenburgen John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover on the surface this could seem like a sentimental teen chickflick dramedy but it is nothing of the sort. Because in this film Gilbert finds more than just love...for the first time ever he finds himself he discovers life he even discovers death. He finds freedom and through that freedom he is able to save his family from themselves.Do not miss this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tell me what you want as fast as it comes to you says Becky to Gilbert as they relax in the thick brown grass beside the pond. Stretched out under the bright sun he closes his eyes and begins to think deeply. House...I want a new house for the family. His dreamlike expression softens. I want Mama to take aerobics classes. I want Ellen to grow up. I want a new brain for Arnie. What do you want for you she asks just for you? The shadow of a smile drifts across his face and he replies without hesitation I want to be a good person. Gilbert Grape is a good person he just doesn't realize it yet. Johnny Depp portrays the twentysomething Gilbert in Endora Iowa Pop. 1091 as a young man asleep at the wheel of his life. As he narrates his story we learn his older sister Amy is a mother type figure and a decent cook only she has a tendency to accidentally start fires like the one that burned down the elementary school she used to work at. Ellen his younger sister is a preening pubescent teen who has an opinion on everything  and it isn't a very good opinion either.

If you sense something unsettling about this perfection that's only appropriate. Blue Velvet is a David Lynch film you see and it won't be long at all before a cleancut college student comes across a rotting ear in an open field.Jeffrey Beaumont Kyle MacLachlan is the boy who finds the ear and Sandy Williams Laura Dern is the blonde policeman's daughter who assists Jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery.

As Jeffrey becomes sexually entangled with Dorothy we can only cast similar doubt.It's true that Blue Velvet's dark mysteries have the power to repulse. Voyeurism rape torture and murder are all key to the plot. Yet the film is also spellbinding in its beauty. Vibrant colors and ominous shadows offer gorgeous contrast  call it Technicolor noir  and the film is rife with unforgettable imagery. Moments big and small from MacLachlan playing with a child's birthday hat to Dean Stockwell's showstopping lipsynch of Roy Orbison's In Dreams are as haunting as anything you will see at the movies anywhere.The acting is topnotch. MacLachlan is just right as the lost innocent Jeffrey and Hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint Frank. Rossellini's performance as Dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous this is her defining moment as an actress.Blue Velvet is perhaps the quintesstential David Lynch film. His strange humor and painterly gift for creating stunning images are prominently on display and the film illustrates Lynch's contradictory impulses toward unbridled nastiness and awshucks sweetness like no other has. After all these years Blue Velvet is still a shocker and deciding how one feels about it is still a challenge. It is a film to be considered and then reconsidered visited and revisited the kind of film that will never fade away. For serious cinephiles then Blue Velvet is a film to be cherished.".

Soon he's in love with a detective's daughter Laura Dern and mixed up in a mystery involving Dorothy Valdes Isabella Rossellinni and psycho Frank Booth Dennis Hopper.Probably David Lynch's best film. The story has gaps in logic but it's secondary to some incredible wide screen imagery this has to be seen letterboxed...no two ways about it. Lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie. You can tell...things that make no sense at first gradually make sense later on. This movie also demands multiple viewings...I was so shocked the first time I saw it I couldn't concentrate on it...it took THREE viewings to finally get it. As to what the movie is about...it depends who you ask. Some people said it's the Hardy Boys on drugs...others say it's about a boy's sexual awakening...others see it as good vs. evil...each one is a valid statement! To me that's a true art film...one that means multiple things all at once.The performances are topnotch. This film made MacLachlan...him and Laura Dern work well together and give nice lowkey performances. Dern is just great...but she does look pretty silly when she tries to cry. Rossellinni is nowhere near as good as her mother Ingrid Bergman was but she deserves credit for taking such a risky role. She's pretty good. Hopper is WAYYYYYYY over the top as Booth...he's both horrifying and hilarious...a great performance. And let's not forget Dean Stockwell as suave Ben. His performance of In Dreams is a definite highlight.Be warnedthe film is very extreme. There's explicit violence plenty of nudity sex and tons of profanity. Not for the squeamish.

	schema:reviewBody "This has always been a unique crime movie like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.This movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen Frank Booth played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here Dorothy Vallens played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.Kyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy lateteen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.In a movie that features strange characters the strangest scene of them  and there are a number  is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lipsynching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake though as bizarre as this film can get it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the fword in about every sentence. He is so overthetop though that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts. Visually and audibly this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs and a bunch of bizarre noises sound effects. From discussions I've had this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much nicer films such as The Straight Story crazier films Wild At Heart Eraserhead and classier movies The Elephant Man but this will be his trademark film the one above others he will be remembered for good or bad.".

The darkness is therefore accessible to all but is laced with just enough weirdness to disturb  my favourite scene is where Frank takes Jeffrey to see Ben it is just a little unsettling.  In hand with this is the fact that it is easily one of his most optimistic films the good angel in Jeffrey's life is a strong character and the ending is one of certainty rather than open to interpretation  that robin has about a clear a meaning as it can.MacLachlan is well used as Jeffrey.  He is wide eyed and innocent even when being sucked into the underworld.  Dern plays allAmerican' well but doesn't have the complexity of MacLachlan in the script.  Rossellini has a challenging role and carries it off quite well  I didn't fully understand her character but I don't know if that was my fault or hers.  Of course the film belongs to Hopper who is terrifyingly unstable.  Without a doubt he is a monster and you never are left in any doubt as to his state of mind.  For an example of his work here watch the scene where Stockwell in a wonderfully weird cameo sings and Hopper clearly falls to pieces.Although I prefer Fire Walk With Me I do think that this is Lynch's best film.  It is weird without going totally overboard and it allows us to sink into the underworld gradually without sudden falls.  Hopper controls every scene he is in but the meeting of wholesome and weird is perfectly delivered and is trademark Lynch.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful strange dark film";
	schema:reviewBody "Title Blue Velvet 1986Director David Lynch Cast Isabella Rosellini Kyle Mac Lachlan Dennis Hopper Laura Dern Review David Lynch films are paintings come to life this has very much to do with the fact that Lynch himself is a painter and he brings that artistic point of view to his film making. Like a good painting his movies tell a story which much like an abstract painting is not always easy to figure out. But what a treat it is to try.Blue Velvet is a story about a young man returning to his hometown to visit his father who is sick in the hospital. Upon his return he stumbles upon a frightening discovery a human ear lying on the grass as he walks through the forest behind his parents home. He then takes it upon himself to discover where this ear came from and discovers that that ear will be the reason why he discovers that this is in fact a very strange and dangerous world in which we live in.Lynch is synonymous with the strange and unusual and Blue Velvet is a good example of this. For those who have ventured into Lynchian territory with films like Mullholland Dr. or Lost Highway get ready for some more crazy imagery and messed up situations. But Ill be honest this time around even though the situations and images are very very surreal and strange the story itself is pretty easy to understand. Lost Highway remains a total mystery to me to this day Mullholland Dr. I had to watch about 6 times to figure out....but Blue Velvet though equally as strange and fascinating as those films mentioned is actually easy to follow and understand.I loved Kyle MacLachlans character and it was very interesting to see him go through the changes he goes through after he makes his discoveries. He isn't quite the same anymore after he sees the things he sees and does the things he does. Loved that scene in which Laura Dern tries to let him see that even though there's some crazy things in this world there's some good bound to show up sooner or later. Laura Derns character was beautiful and innocent the one thing that could bring balance to MacLachlans character. By far the most interesting and memorable thing in this film is Dennis Hoppers character yes my friends I'm talking about that crazy demented sexcrazed freak known as Frank Booth.Frank Booth is one of those characters that just oozes with evil. You don't feel like its this actor playing some villain when that happens you totally stop believing that said villain is dangerous. Not so here. Hopper looks breaths and speaks pure evil! Your kind of scared that there might actually be people like him out in the real world. His scenes and dialog is truly disturbing stuff.....Ill fC anything that moooves! I loved the visual aspect of the film which was as is usual in a Lynch film extremely beautiful. We may be looking at sliced human ears and demented sex freaks...but everything is photographed within the context of beautiful haunting colors exotic plays of shadows and lights. Great visuals. The music is incredible as well. Lynch seems to be fond of lounge singers cause very much like he did in Mullholland Drive in Club Silencio we get another sequence much like that one with Isabella Rosellini singing us Blue Velvet the title song. And there's also a sequence which is very very humorous yet strange and alluring....Dean Stockwell singing Roy Orbinsons In Dreams. Awesome sequence one of the most memorable sequences on this film or any other Lynch film. When that scene comes on you'll be transported to another time and place. What time and place it is Ill leave it up to you.All in all a great Lynch film not to be missed. A masterpiece that lets me know why Lynch is one of the greatest American directors ever to be in the business of making bizarro beautiful cinema.Rating 5 out of 5 and very very much so!".

Blue Velvet may indeed be better I wouldn't want to say but in no respect is it the same kind of thing.

It's hard to avoid the feeling that something supernatural is somehow involved although it isn't and we know that it isn't. It looks and feels as though we're watching the world through a special enchanted or cursed prism the image has been pulled apart ALMOST into two distinct images with the elements of pure evil and pure wholesomeness now distinct from one another sitting just millimetres apart.Unrelated to this but still contributing to the intense suspense and the overall creepiness is Lynch's ability to make us familiar with a few ordinary locations which grow more sinister  or at least more meaningful  every time we see them until the sight of a simple concrete stairwell in the dark is enough to make us start to panic.".

It just doesn't work.'Blue Velvet' is an example of our world's disarray.  This film is VERY genius in its portrayal.  We see a hokey innocent town that yields a dark secret.The symbolism is great.  White picket fences waving fireman hokey acting and a sunny day show the apparent innocence.  But a stroke black insects a candle getting blown out etc. show us something else.I love how when we see the innocence everything is hokey.  The music acting dialogue... everything.  But when the darkness appears everything becomes serious.  The script improves the acting is better... everything. That's something that was missed by most viewers.David Lynch is brilliant but he also has a great sense of humor.  Jokes aren't funny... absurdity is funny.Lightness and darkness seemingly coexist in this lumber town... each in their own place.  When a curious fellow returns home he disrupts the balance and the two forces go to war.  Yet we don't really even know which side he's on.  I love how Jeffrey always wears black and white.  I love all the symbology of this film.If you haven't seen this yet break away from the Hollywood cookie cutter movies and prepare to have your mind challenged and entertained.Makes a fun party movie too.   o1010".

	schema:headline " A mesmerizing piece of cinema with element of masterpiece...";
	schema:reviewBody "The sexual revolution in film came some ten years after the label's coinage in the late Sixties. It probably began with Last Tango in Paris. Directed by the acclaimed Bernardo Bertolucci Last Tango is notorious for a sex scene involving Marlon and roughly a third of a stick of butter. Theretofore sex in film could potentially be used as a means of revealing the lightest or the darkest character's traits primarily vulnerability instinct sadism and impulse. Blue Velvet is a good example of a movie using such a dynamic. Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated. Likewise it is not a film that is easily forgotten. It is a timeless controversy and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise. Set in a small American town Blue Velvet is a dark sensuous mystery involving the intertwining lives of four very different individuals. The film's painful realism reminds us that we are not immune to the disturbing events which transpire in Blue Velvet's sleepy community. There is a darker side of life waiting for us all. And as a critic said 'you either think it's dementedly wild at heart or a lost highway to nowhere'. Even some eighteen years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime but none as dangerously imposing as this. Why is that so? If Blue Velvet might not be labeled as a masterpiece one has to acknowledge that there are in this movie a lot of so called 'masterpiece element' and if Blue Velvet will never be considered as Mr. Lynch best feature I personally can see a lot of David Lynch's genius flowing in that movie.First of all the way David Lynch makes Blue Velvet increasingly disturbing is a perfect example of how pristine the dynamics of weirdness and tension are built remember Eraserhead and Elephant Man. Through this process Mr. Lynch indeed deconstructs the audience expectations. The film setting and mood are introduced in an exposition lifted directly from older films there are numerous references to It's A Wonderful Life. In result the film is initially expected to follow a particular path. The way Mr. Lynch associate elements of classic narrative methodology and 'his dynamics of noir' previously explained appears to be original at worst 'avant gardiste' at best. Second of all the opposition between the creepiness of the plot and the setting of it is definitely for me a masterpiece element. The film is set in Lumberton. This does not represent a quaint small town by similarity it is one. Lumberton is filled with characters that are completely typical. I can almost see the cops eating doughnuts in the coffee shop and the local football star dating the head cheerleader. This typicality is definitely not out of coincidence but of intention. In fact these characters function to punctuate the story not to distinguish it. The 'infamous' individuality of Lynch's vision is established in the darker side of Lumberton. Our perspective throughout the film is fixed on Jeffery and is deliberately biased by his good nature. Jeffery is portrayed with great subtlety by Kyle MacLachlan FBI agent from Twin Peaks. He is paired with Sandy Laura Dern the daughter of a neighborhood investigator who epitomizes to perfection the 'girlnextdoor' in Blue Velvet it is her literal function. Completing this diverse list of roles is a haunting and brief performance by Dean Stockwell as well as Dennis Hopper who creates a flabbergasting portrait of unrepentant and irredeemable evil. The confrontation or those characters or the collision among themselves makes for a mesmerizing experience. Once again Mr. Lynch succeeds in the masterful exercise of controlling the audience's attention. Most of us will not quite know what to make of it and we can disagree on the value of such a cinematic experience. However audacious erotic disturbing haunting are adjectives that will always be linked with Blue Velvet. The 'Thriller' has just been reinvented by Mr. Lynch right in front of our eyes.".

	schema:headline " What a wonderful film. Looks incredible on Blu Ray";
	schema:reviewBody "I just want to say that I fell in love with this film after seeing the 25th anniversary edition blu ray. It looks beautiful. Having only seen it in the early 90s on a runofthemill videotape that was probably pan and scan and full of color and toning problems it truly is a different experience on blu ray.The brutally honest performances visionary aesthetic and the beautiful style make Blue Velvet an absolutely unmissable film and a wonderful addition to Blu Ray. Despite the films fame and notoriety all these years later the film still seems completely original invigorating and unsurpassed. Everyone assumes that Blue Velvet opens with the infamous earinthegrass scene but the film's opening is even more disturbing than that. A suburban fantasia of white picket fences bloodred roses waving fireman happy children and a man watering his lawn gives way to the disturbing moment when the watering man collapses and the camera pans down to dirt level where a number of horrific insects are scrabbling in the dirt at the base of the lawn. The soundtrack changes from Leave It to Beaverstyle music to the loud gnawing electric sawlike noises emitted by the creatures. Only subsequent to this scene does Jeffrey Beaumont a wideeyed snoopy Kyle MacLachlan find the ear in a field of overgrown weeds. The ear leads Jeffrey through a sordid underworld involving kidnapping masochism drug dealing and murder. But while there's a whole lot of plot in Blue Velvet Lynch's more elemental concern is with unearthing the truth behind the facade i.e. showing what lurks under the lawn. Even the blue velvet dress that chanteuse Dorothy Valens Isabella Rossellini wears hides a secret  namely the bruises on her body which are delivered by the vile Frank Booth Dennis Hopper in the role that brought him back to the limelight. When Jeffrey asks the naive Sandy Laura Dern the prim girl on whom he has a crush why there is so much trouble in the world the answer is clear  without it our lives would be far duller. Jeffrey himself admits that he loves a mystery and the curiosity that his desire entails is the same one that fuels Lynch's own vision. When Frank says to Jeffrey You're like me it could be Lynch speaking to the audience. We want to know more even if what we find out hurts or is ugly. Like the scene of an accident we cannot look away. Fueled by a vibrant and alwayssurprising dream like surrealism Blue Velvet reminds us that the dreams and fantasies of our subconscious are dangerous and thrilling it's surface reality that is superficial and mundane. This is definitely a film worth watching multiple times. It gets better and better on every viewing. There are so many questions and at the same time so many answers which seem to bring up more questions. Blue Velvet is a timeless film and it looks absolutely superb on Blu Ray. I will happily get lost in this film from time and time again it's absolutely remarkable. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "I just want to say that I fell in love with this film after seeing the 25th anniversary edition blu ray. It looks beautiful. Having only seen it in the early 90s on a runofthemill videotape that was probably pan and scan and full of color and toning problems it truly is a different experience on blu ray.The brutally honest performances visionary aesthetic and the beautiful style make Blue Velvet an absolutely unmissable film and a wonderful addition to Blu Ray. Despite the films fame and notoriety all these years later the film still seems completely original invigorating and unsurpassed. Everyone assumes that Blue Velvet opens with the infamous earinthegrass scene but the film's opening is even more disturbing than that. A suburban fantasia of white picket fences bloodred roses waving fireman happy children and a man watering his lawn gives way to the disturbing moment when the watering man collapses and the camera pans down to dirt level where a number of horrific insects are scrabbling in the dirt at the base of the lawn. The soundtrack changes from Leave It to Beaverstyle music to the loud gnawing electric sawlike noises emitted by the creatures. Only subsequent to this scene does Jeffrey Beaumont a wideeyed snoopy Kyle MacLachlan find the ear in a field of overgrown weeds. The ear leads Jeffrey through a sordid underworld involving kidnapping masochism drug dealing and murder. But while there's a whole lot of plot in Blue Velvet Lynch's more elemental concern is with unearthing the truth behind the facade i.e. showing what lurks under the lawn. Even the blue velvet dress that chanteuse Dorothy Valens Isabella Rossellini wears hides a secret  namely the bruises on her body which are delivered by the vile Frank Booth Dennis Hopper in the role that brought him back to the limelight. When Jeffrey asks the naive Sandy Laura Dern the prim girl on whom he has a crush why there is so much trouble in the world the answer is clear  without it our lives would be far duller. Jeffrey himself admits that he loves a mystery and the curiosity that his desire entails is the same one that fuels Lynch's own vision. When Frank says to Jeffrey You're like me it could be Lynch speaking to the audience. We want to know more even if what we find out hurts or is ugly. Like the scene of an accident we cannot look away. Fueled by a vibrant and alwayssurprising dream like surrealism Blue Velvet reminds us that the dreams and fantasies of our subconscious are dangerous and thrilling it's surface reality that is superficial and mundane. This is definitely a film worth watching multiple times. It gets better and better on every viewing. There are so many questions and at the same time so many answers which seem to bring up more questions. Blue Velvet is a timeless film and it looks absolutely superb on Blu Ray. I will happily get lost in this film from time and time again it's absolutely remarkable. 1010";

As somebody who loves Lynch and a lot of his filmsthe only one I've disliked is Dune Blue Velvet is up there at the top. The Elephant Mannever has there been a film that moved me more may be my personal favourite but Blue Velvet is quite possibly Lynch's masterpiece. Loved Mulholland Drive as well but it is not as accessible as Elephant Man or Blue Velvet films that even those who aren't fans of Lynch are likely to love and is his most polarising most likely.Blue Velvet is an incrediblelooking film. All of Lynch's films are beautifully shot and that is true of Blue Velvet as well and the imagery is both hauntingly surreal and beautiful all the different colours really popping out at you. The music is hypnotic with a very haunting undercurrent and really adds to the story's strangeness and mystery elements. The script is thoughtful and cohesive with a dose of weird but subtle humour as well as some deliberately not so subtle partsespecially with villain Frank Booth. The atmosphere created is the very meaning of scintillating and suspense levels are to the maximum. The story one of the most coherent and accessible of any Lynch film is always interesting and entertaining the detective story elements are genuinely suspenseful and at times scary Lynch has never directed a tenser scene than the climax here.Lynch's direction is superb along with Mulholland Drive it contains some of his best. The characters all serve a point to the story and they are very interestingly written in the case of Frank Booth one of the most evil and fascinating villains on films iconic. The acting is superb as well especially with Dennis Hopper who's terrifyingly sadistic and sometimes hilarious he is very over the top but in a gleefully enjoyable way. Kyle MacLachlan has never been in a better film or given a better performance than here he's certainly not had a character as interesting either Laura Dern is great and sensual Isabella Rossellini has a challenging role that she plays to truly devastating effect. Look out for an oddball but memorable appearance from Dean Stockwell as well. Overall a strange but utterly mesmerising masterpiece. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "With Blue Velvet David Lynch made a film that was so pure to his original vision that it would become the archetype of his work for the next fifteen years.  Here Lynch cast his ever probing surrealist gaze upon small town middle America and for the first time in a US film showed the audience the darker side to what was often depicted as nothing more than the birth place of apple pie. We are drawn into the story almost immediately with what would seem like a simple depiction of small town life but the use of slowmotion hints that there is something not quite right with what we are looking at.  So by the time Lynch has pushed his camera through the soft green grass of a regular front lawn only to show us the slithering insects that hide in the darkness we know that we are about to enter a very dark world.Blue Velvet is a world filled with not only darkness but also ambiguity. The characters of this world are constantly hiding behind some kind of faade be it the wardrobe doors that practicing teenage voyeur Jeffrey peers from behind as he watches Dorothy and Frank interact or something as simple as the makeup worn by Ben.  Everything suggests to us that these characters inhabit a world at night a world away from the life they live in the day.  As the film moves closer and closer to the climax Jeffrey begins to feel more of a connection with Frank having to go to some very dark places within his psyche.  However Lynch's message that underneath the normal persona of a regular human being is a repressed pervert laying in wait or whatever point he is making doesn't really translate well.  Not least to today's audience.  Blue Velvet is very much a film of its time that time being the mideighties with aids paranoia everywhere it's easy to see this metaphor for the dangers of sex and love within the films turgid dreamscapes.  But beneath this message hides a strong detective story a modern day neonoir that delivers interesting twists and a controversial payoff with it's almost fairytale climax.  This is the film David Lynch got right proceeding to make great films that where all personal but completely different in terms of style and substance from one another.  Blue Velvet is a great film with some fine albeit bizarre performances still challenging to this day If only Lynch hadn't gone on to spend the rest of his career remaking it.".

The director is either denying the strength of his material or trying to defuse it by pretending it's all part of a campy injoke.It begins impressively with excellent cinematic technique and symbolism but as soon as the first words are spoken the film begins to sag with ridiculous predictable and juvenile dialogue. The plot itself is tediously linear and simple like an average Hardy Boys episode high school kids take on the criminal underworld!But oh this is no Hardy Boys episode. Director David Lynch made sure of that by injecting plenty of profanity gore and nudity. And just as an aside to all you drooling fans of Isabella Rosselini... TRUST me she  her beerbelly look awful in this movie! Save yourselves the shattered fantasies.The scenes are extremely clumsy and overt as if Lynch doesn't give us enough credit for figuring it out ourselves. I'll give you one example In one scene Laura Dern and Dune Boy forgot his name are sitting in a car in front of a church. Laura starts talking about her dream of God. The music switches to a church pipe organ. Then they drive off and the camera zooms in on the church and holds the frame for 3 full seconds. ...hmmm d'ya git the feelin he's atrying to tell us sumthin? I dunno Vern. Lez rewind it and watch it again.True compared to the Hollywood tripe that was the standard in 1986 Blue Velvet is unique. But that doesn't mean it's good. I would advise you to watch Lynch's 1990 film Wild at Heart in which he achieved a greater degree poetry having refined his style somewhat. Well you have been warned!".

The film certainly makes sense in comparison with a quest narrative such as Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown and in light of Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self. It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work notably Vertigo Rear Window and Psycho in its preoccupation with spectator psychology and voyeurism.Basically Blue Velvet is about the rites of passage of a young man after a descent into the underworld of his hometown. However the man emerges from his experience neither sadder nor wiser. Instead Lynch cynically reprises the film's innocent opening with its hopelessly artificial Pollyannish postcard pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer. At the same time he preserves the tenuousness of such a naive vision with the shot of a deliberately artificial insect impaled on a robin's beak and with a soundtrack that subjects the theme song to a disturbing treatment out of some internal subterranean sound studio.This film has so many meanings it would be exhausting to write even half. People especially the detractors of the film should give up on saying that there is nothing at the center of the film and that it is merely pretentious art. Like I said it has so many meanings that it would take me forever to write even a few with the limited amount of paragraph space I have. Jeffrey our hero confronts at first mortality his father stricken by a lifethreatening stroke then a severed decaying human ear in a field. The ear the organ of hearing is also the sense that fully awakens only in the dark granting access to the Dionysian deep intuitive wellsprings of the self. But the ear we see on screen has become a diseased useless instrument in a sunny culture whose idea of music is Bobby Vinton's version of Blue Velvet. The ear is Jeffrey's passage into the underworld. Thus as he sees the ear before he enters the underworld the camera zooms into the ear. At the end of the film when Jeffrey has confronted his demons and been through the ordeal within the underworld the camera zooms out of the ear to represent what has happened.Blue Velvet is David Lynch's magnumopus. Dennis Hopper once said that it was America's first surrealist film however I'd give his earlier more unknown work Eraserhead this title. Blue Velvet is probably however the most famous example. I highly recommend this film whether or not your going to enjoy it is completely out of the question as long as you see this. It's a life changing experience and a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a lot of respect for David Lynch. The man gets a lot of flack for being too weird but I don't know when that became a derogatory comment. Weird in the film industry often translates to originality. Blue Velvet is not at all lacking in originality. This isn't your typical mysterythriller. In fact its genre is a bit hard to define. It has moments of dramatic intensity as well as scenes that contain biting humorous undertones. It's safe to say this was controversial in the 80s as it still holds a bit of shock factor in retrospect. Blue Velvet is an accomplishment of a lifetime. Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead are often referred to as Lynch's masterpieces but to me Blue Velvet defines Lynch's career.In one of the best openings I've ever seen Blue Velvet begins by showing us a typical suburban neighborhood white picket fences beautiful gardens nice houses. Immediately following we're shown what's below the surface the ground is being overtaken by bugs that resemble cockroaches. This simple scene foreshadows the rest of the film. What we're shown here is a simple little town seemingly happy on the outside. However when you probe below the surface of anything good you may find something you didn't expect.After his father collapses with what I assume was a heart attack Jeffrey Beaumont Kyle MacLachlan returns to Lumberton from college. Jeffrey is your typical young man he's a nice kid fairly nave. As he walks through an empty field he finds something strange. On the ground he discovers a severed human ear. He brings it into a detective he is familiar with. The detective is the father of Sandy Laura Dern a high school senior who Jeffrey knew from school. The two of them are curious about the ear. After overhearing her father's discussion with a coworker Sandy informs Jeffrey that the investigation led them to a woman named Dorothy Vallens Isabella Rossellini. Jeffrey and Sandy search further and eventually find out where Dorothy's apartment is located. Sandy is unsure but Jeffrey is determined to crack the case. At his insistence Sandy helps Jeffrey devise a plan to break into Dorothy's apartment. What they didn't expect was for Jeffrey to find himself locked in Dorothy's closet in a scene that has been given countless homage. This is where Jeffrey uncovers more information Dorothy is being controlled mentally and sexually by a sadistic man named Frank Booth Dennis Hopper who has kidnapped her husband and child.Dennis Hopper's entrance into Blue Velvet is intense and his character is among the most terrifying in film history. This is where the entire mood of the film changes. No longer is this a simple detective story about two kids trying to crack a case. As Jeffrey watches Frank's power over Dorothy he becomes sucked in. Eventually he becomes personally involved with the two. Insanity ensues. As Jeffrey's world view changes his actions become more and more like Frank's. This transformation is well conceived and believable.As far as acting is concerned Blue Velvet contains some top notch performances mostly by actors who never really got their due. Kyle MacLachlan is perfect as Jeffrey. He has that golden boy look that makes his innocent naivety believable but he's not too square that his transformation is not believable. I truly believe that Kyle was gypped out of a great career. With this Twin Peaks and The Hidden the man should have ended up with better. Either way this is a career defining performance one that any actor should be proud of. Isabella Rossellini is just as good. It's truly impossible to not feel anything for this character a woman whose life is truly out of her hands. The movie wouldn't have been what it was without Dennis Hopper whose perfect portrayal of Frank Booth is like evil personified. He's wonderful in this role truly someone to be afraid of but with some lines that are strangely amusing. Laura Dern is very believable as innocent young Sandy. She adds a little something to the film showing the contrast between true innocence and depravity.Another thing I love about Blue Velvet is as I mentioned before the genre bending. Although I'd call this a drama above all it is impossible to ignore the comedy. Among the funniest scene is near the beginning when Jeffrey brings the ear to the detective at which point the detective proclaims Yep that's a human ear all right. Equally funny is the background radio announcer Logs logs logs. It's 130 as the tree falls here in Lumberton. David Lynch's strange sense of humor is another reason why this film is what it is. There are elements of a thriller. Frank is a terrifying character he's a person whose actions are impossible to predict. The majority of the violence occurs off screen but this does not make it any less intense. Blue Velvet also strangely has elements of romance. It is like most Lynch films impossible to place into one distinct category.I have few problems with this film. The only thing I can really complain about is the fact that it moved pretty fast sometimes not allowing for enough characterization before certain events transpire. With a running length of around two hours Blue Velvet feels a little short. I've read that the original cut was nearly four hours so it's very likely that a lot was lost in the editing process. I have to wonder if it would have been even more amazing if Lynch had left it in its full four hour form.Even with it's few problems Blue Velvet is an astonishingly beautiful completely coherent film. Nearly perfect filmmaking it is chilling funny and bittersweet at the end. Blue Velvet is an enduring film and one of my personal favorites.1010 my 7 of all time".

	onyx:emotionText "I have a lot of respect for David Lynch. The man gets a lot of flack for being too weird but I don't know when that became a derogatory comment. Weird in the film industry often translates to originality. Blue Velvet is not at all lacking in originality. This isn't your typical mysterythriller. In fact its genre is a bit hard to define. It has moments of dramatic intensity as well as scenes that contain biting humorous undertones. It's safe to say this was controversial in the 80s as it still holds a bit of shock factor in retrospect. Blue Velvet is an accomplishment of a lifetime. Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead are often referred to as Lynch's masterpieces but to me Blue Velvet defines Lynch's career.In one of the best openings I've ever seen Blue Velvet begins by showing us a typical suburban neighborhood white picket fences beautiful gardens nice houses. Immediately following we're shown what's below the surface the ground is being overtaken by bugs that resemble cockroaches. This simple scene foreshadows the rest of the film.

I have seen MANY erotic thrillers none have been as selfserious and pretentious as this. Adding complicated but meaningless symbolism into a film does not make it any more complex let alone save the film from being softcore porn. You still have the sex the degrading excessive nudity especially on poor Isabella Rossellini's behalf. Heck this has 7.8 and an arithmetic mean of 7.9 Basic Instinct has a lot in common with this. They are both infamous and wellrecognized films thanks to their graphic sex that really don't deserve half the attention they receive. However Basic Instinct has a more deserving but still disappointingly high rating of 6.8If your tastes are morose and perverse Blue Velvet is for you. But don't take it as the classic many people and to my shock and horror established critics make it out as today. This may be unforgettable but this does not secure the fact that its good. Its unforgettable in a bad way which is probably why so many people know if it today very similar to the previously mentioned Basic Instinct. A major waste of talent time and critical support this is. If you want to see Lynch see my personal favourite Lost Highway Eraserhead or view Twin Peaks. These works are far more intellectually fitting and there sole purpose isn't to shock there viewers.".

I just don't want it.The story begins when naive college boy finds a human ear in a grownover abandoned lot near his father's home puts it in a bag and takes it to the police station where his discovery is greeted with a diffident Yup that's a human ear alright. A conversation with the town sheriff's teenage daughter reveals that it might have something to do with a mysterious and glamorous lounge singer. So Jeffrey does what anyone would do break into her apartment and spy on her of course. And finding him hiding in her closet listening to her phone conversations and watch her undress the lounge singer Dorothy does what any woman would do under the circumstances give him oral sex of course! It practically goes without saying! The two of them embark on a lopsided affair that never fully blossoms while Jeffrey woos sweet teenage Sandy on the side. Meanwhile wrapped up in unstable Dorothy's sexual psychodrama Jeffrey plays some cross between detective and knight and shining armor to a damsel in distress and revels in Dorothy's codependent clinging all the while knowing that this affair could get him killed.Dorothy's loverstalkertormentor is a ragingly nuts repulsively perverted mafia ahole named Frank in the most disgustingly creepy role in Dennis Hopper's proud legacy of playing scary nutbag freaks. Frank's infantileyetviolent jack rabbit dryhumping perversion not to mention his obliviousness to how obnoxious and repugnant it is is enough to make you never want to have sex again. Yet Frank and Dorothy are both quite obviously insane what's Jeffrey's excuse for his bizarre irrational choices? The fact that he is apparently sane and fairly intelligent makes it all the more annoying. Every single character in the film is so annoying to me that I want to smack 'em upside the head but the two women in the story are just plain pitiful.Sandy and Dorothy are sort of a Betty and Veronicarose whiterose red case. Dorothy is an older glamorous beautiful brunette while Sandy is a younger pretty virginal blonde. Sandy is the least stupid and irritating character in the beginning but I lost patience with her after she immediately forgave Jeffrey for his affair with Dorothy with very little explanation or effort from Jeffrey then continually pins the blame on herself for dragging him into this when the situation is quite the opposite. Sandy puts herself in harm's way for Jeffrey even though he has lied to her and at the close of the film is in the kitchen happily making him lunch while he lounges around in the back yard. For his part Jeffrey just seems like a melodramatic sap who's in love with whoever's there at the moment. You really can't tell if his feelings for either Dorothy or Sandy have any depth to them.What really works my nerves though is the woefully corny dialog with absurdly overearnest lines like Why is there so much trouble in the world?!?! and You're my special friend! Not to mention I looked for you in the closet last night. Granted all these lines are kinda funny but are they supposed to be? And who's the joke on the characters or the viewer. Either way if it weren't for my roommate being there to mock it with me I would have turned this movie off about 15 minutes into it.How movies like this gain backing let alone a cult following I'll never know. But when it comes to satirizing suburbia though give me John Waters any day.".

Kyle MacLachlan is as bad in this film as he was in Dune 1984. He's bland lacks suitable expressiveness and is annoyingly nerdy. If he were any stiffer he could pass for a mannequin. I don't know who was worse dull MacLachlan or farcical Dennis Hopper. Rossellini tries to act but her performance comes across as comically melodramatic which when combined with Hopper's histrionics renders scenes that are unintentionally funny.The film's moody atmosphere makes for suitable cinematic style. But the script the direction the casting and the acting are so bad that the end result is a cartoon for spacedout adults.

	schema:headline " Meaningless emptiness portrayed in a meaningless empty way.";
	schema:reviewBody "How does a superb talent produce great meaningladen art when the true world is a small irrational nothingness?  That is David Lynch's great dilemma. He himself has said as much People can't accept the meaninglessness of life. But how can one become a great painter when the only color is black and everyone is blind?Fortunately for Lynch he's wrong about people. The great tragedy of our days is that so many people DO accept that life is meaningless. So his attempted rebellions against the ordinary become instead financially successful critically acclaimed icons of our empty lives. Poor David instead of a starving tortured Van Gogh he becomes the popular Norman Rockwell of nihilism the central freak in our favorite sideshow of moral dwarves and genetically defective imaginations.... all the way to the bank.As a result there is an essentially pornographic character to his films especially this one. No not the sex or even the sexual perversion. But the evil.Many years ago a young homosexual told me he saw gays as divided into two groups fairies and queers. The fairies were homosexual because they were attracted to men. The queers were attracted to men because they were attracted to homosexuality  it was perverse. This is the universal attraction of the pornographic as opposed to the erotic. The excitement of the forbidden the abnormal the hidden. The Queer.In Blue Velvet David Lynch's favorite Queer is evil and he treats us to two hours of figurative strip tease with her. This is the dilemma of the conventional nihilist He is repelled by evil because of his normal upbringing and yet his convictions tell him there is no good or evil. There is no valid reason to be repelled by this Queer because there is really no valid reason for anything. Yet he is repelled but also attracted. He must come back to watch her strip again and again.In the end twentiethcentury nihilists such as Lynch and his fans cannot successfully suppress their moral imagination and their demand for meaning in life just as nineteenthcentury Victorians could not suppress their sexuality and passion. Any vision or program based upon such fundamental misunderstandings of human nature is doomed to failure. Reality leaks through the facade. Then the culture's most popular pornography points to its biggest lies.Thus 1886 gave us The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and 1986 gave us Blue Velvet.  The difference seems to be that R.L. Stevenson knew what he was doing consciously portraying the neuroses of his time while Lynch appears to be without a clue. As a result in 2086 Jekyll and Hyde will still be read as literature but Blue Velvet will only be studied as a cultural artifact of the 20th century not as art.So do you want to see this movie? Ask yourself these questions1 Do I suffer from major depression bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?If yes avoid this movie and under no circumstances watch it alone. This is NOT a joke it is medical advice. I myself take medication for recurring major depression. Suicide is permanent.2 A Am I embarrassed for the President when he simplistically calls the 911 terrorists evildoers without trying to understand their grievances and culture?If yes  BUY a copy of this movie. You'll watch it again and again.If no  ask yourself2 B Would I like to watch a talented actor Dennis Hopper give a spellbinding portrayal of a truly evil human being?If yes you may want to watch this. Just realize that like most rape victims you'll want to spend an hour in the shower afterwards.  I recommend that instead you watch the massively underrated Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear 1962 or The Night of the Hunter 1955.Regardless of your answers above if you're intellectually curious if you'd like to know what Lynch is really trying to say borrow this movie for free from somewhere and watch it until the shot of the bugs. Then turn it off. You'll have gotten his point. You'll only have invested a few minutes of your time. And you won't have to wash your hands afterwards.Finally if you want a better understanding of the cultural neuroses that produced this movie I recommend two surprisingly unrelated books both by undisputed masters of English prose.  The first The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis is an essay on human nature masquerading as a treatise on the philosophy of education. It's a much lighter and more entertaining read than that capsule summary sounds. The second Witness by Whittaker Chambers is formally the story of his life his work as a spy his break with the Communist Party and his exposure of his fellow spies. But the book is actually an impassioned memoir of his own spiritual struggles against 20th century moral nihilism.All scholars of all political stripes agree that archives declassified since the end of the Cold War conclusively show that Chambers was telling the truth about himself Hiss and the other Communist spies. So we can now read Witness without worrying about who was really lying. We know Hiss was lying.My rating 3 out of 10. Dennis Hopper 8 of 10.   David Lynch on a scale of 0 to 10 5".

This is the dilemma of the conventional nihilist He is repelled by evil because of his normal upbringing and yet his convictions tell him there is no good or evil. There is no valid reason to be repelled by this Queer because there is really no valid reason for anything. Yet he is repelled but also attracted. He must come back to watch her strip again and again.In the end twentiethcentury nihilists such as Lynch and his fans cannot successfully suppress their moral imagination and their demand for meaning in life just as nineteenthcentury Victorians could not suppress their sexuality and passion. Any vision or program based upon such fundamental misunderstandings of human nature is doomed to failure. Reality leaks through the facade. Then the culture's most popular pornography points to its biggest lies.Thus 1886 gave us The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and 1986 gave us Blue Velvet.  The difference seems to be that R.L. Stevenson knew what he was doing consciously portraying the neuroses of his time while Lynch appears to be without a clue. As a result in 2086 Jekyll and Hyde will still be read as literature but Blue Velvet will only be studied as a cultural artifact of the 20th century not as art.So do you want to see this movie? Ask yourself these questions1 Do I suffer from major depression bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?If yes avoid this movie and under no circumstances watch it alone. This is NOT a joke it is medical advice. I myself take medication for recurring major depression. Suicide is permanent.2 A Am I embarrassed for the President when he simplistically calls the 911 terrorists evildoers without trying to understand their grievances and culture?If yes  BUY a copy of this movie. You'll watch it again and again.If no  ask yourself2 B Would I like to watch a talented actor Dennis Hopper give a spellbinding portrayal of a truly evil human being?If yes you may want to watch this. Just realize that like most rape victims you'll want to spend an hour in the shower afterwards.  I recommend that instead you watch the massively underrated Robert Mitchum in Cape Fear 1962 or The Night of the Hunter 1955.Regardless of your answers above if you're intellectually curious if you'd like to know what Lynch is really trying to say borrow this movie for free from somewhere and watch it until the shot of the bugs. Then turn it off. You'll have gotten his point. You'll only have invested a few minutes of your time. And you won't have to wash your hands afterwards.Finally if you want a better understanding of the cultural neuroses that produced this movie I recommend two surprisingly unrelated books both by undisputed masters of English prose.  The first The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis is an essay on human nature masquerading as a treatise on the philosophy of education. It's a much lighter and more entertaining read than that capsule summary sounds. The second Witness by Whittaker Chambers is formally the story of his life his work as a spy his break with the Communist Party and his exposure of his fellow spies. But the book is actually an impassioned memoir of his own spiritual struggles against 20th century moral nihilism.All scholars of all political stripes agree that archives declassified since the end of the Cold War conclusively show that Chambers was telling the truth about himself Hiss and the other Communist spies. So we can now read Witness without worrying about who was really lying. We know Hiss was lying.My rating 3 out of 10. Dennis Hopper 8 of 10.   David Lynch on a scale of 0 to 10 5";

This is a surreal moment and maybe the whole idea should have been executed in this fashion. On the other hand where did I see this before? John Cleese as Hitler on the balcony of a house in an English suburb Ernst Lubitsch and Jack Benny?It seems to me that MllerStahl had a hunch at a possible idea but forgot to make it into a solid subject for a film that would have some meaning.

Eminem would be proud. I thought to myself oh no here we go to one dimensional city....But after a while these characters became very likable. These are REAL characters living a really dangerous life style. The effect is similar in Goodfellas... they're so bad so annoying but fascinating and free in ways ordinary people aren't. They do what they want when they want and give you a bloody nose if you try and stop them.There's a mood an energy a style that Cassavettes was able to capture and portray that made this film so far removed from any clichd studio product geared toward teenyboppers. The film feels honest and genuine and that's the difference.At a certain point after all the partying and boozing and drugging the film takes a turn for the worse and climaxes into a gut wrenching horrible tragedy that left me and the audience stunned.Overall it's an extremely well crafted film definitely worth seeing.And I almost forgot to mention the biggest surprise of all... Justin Timberlake. Forget what you know forget N'SYNC this guy is a real actor. I almost feel strange saying this but it's true... He was stunning almost stole the movie crackled whenever he was on screen. He has all the right ingredients for a stellar acting career charisma screen presence that separates him from the pretty faced phonies clogging the movie screens.

	onyx:emotionText "I got a chance to see a screening of this at Sundance.This movie sucks you in seduces you entrances you then whacks you over the head with a baseball bat.It starts off fairly annoying... bunch of pimplyfaced white wannabe's spouting rapid fire ghetto speak with rap music blaring in the background. Eminem would be proud. I thought to myself oh no here we go to one dimensional city....But after a while these characters became very likable. These are REAL characters living a really dangerous life style. The effect is similar in Goodfellas... they're so bad so annoying but fascinating and free in ways ordinary people aren't. They do what they want when they want and give you a bloody nose if you try and stop them.There's a mood an energy a style that Cassavettes was able to capture and portray that made this film so far removed from any clichd studio product geared toward teenyboppers. The film feels honest and genuine and that's the difference.At a certain point after all the partying and boozing and drugging the film takes a turn for the worse and climaxes into a gut wrenching horrible tragedy that left me and the audience stunned.Overall it's an extremely well crafted film definitely worth seeing.And I almost forgot to mention the biggest surprise of all... Justin Timberlake. Forget what you know forget N'SYNC this guy is a real actor. I almost feel strange saying this but it's true... He was stunning almost stole the movie crackled whenever he was on screen. He has all the right ingredients for a stellar acting career charisma screen presence that separates him from the pretty faced phonies clogging the movie screens. Every moment he was on screen he was doing something that worked and he makes it look easy the most important trait a great actor has. I'll definitely be watching his acting career very closely from now on.";

Yes there is a lot of cussing but the movie is rated R so it's lot as though it came as a surprise. These characters are freaking drug dealing gang members for crying out loudwhat else would one expect? The acting was excellent with Justin Timberlake surprising me the most. I didn't think I'd be able to take him seriously but his performance really was the standout of the film. The characters for the most part aren't likable but very realistic and wellplayed.The premise of course is based on a true story but in my opinion was very well puttogether so that it wasn't dull in any way shape or form. To me it felt like a betterquality more entertaining version of films like Bully and Havoc.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes truecrime dramas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having learned about the Jesse James Hollywood case during my junior year in high school I'll admit that I was actually extremely disappointed to find out that a film was being made depicting the events that had happened. However I can now say I think differently.The basic premise without giving too much away involves a drug deal gone awry. Someone isn't paying Johnny Truelove and that someone just so happens to have a little brother. A naive fifteen year old little brother played powerfully by Anton Yelchin who just wants to live his life. The boy is kidnapped and held as a sort of ransom until Jonny gets his money from boy's brother. Johnny's friends become attached to the boy and eventually the boy learns a life lesson.It may all sound played out and done before but this film is electrifying in every sense of the word. It's hardcore. It's raw. It's at times gritty. I felt some vibes from the Larry Clark film Bully with the whole kidsdoingwhattheywantanytimeanywhere thing. You feel as though you're watching these people's lives just crumble before them making it all the more worse is the grim reality that's stuck in the back of your mind reminding you that this is all true. Nick Cassavetes has created such a truetolife depiction of what happened that it's almost frightening. You won't want to look away.There are a few downsides however one being the running time either the movie was too dragged out or was just moving too slow. To me I felt as though it could have ended fifteen minutes earlier. There's also a lot of partying however this being a depiction of a real life set of teenagers' lives I can see why it was so vital towards the film. These kids have parents who do as much as they do. The parents don't care what happens to these kids which makes it all the more terrifying. These kids are on their own. They have nowhere to run and no one to turn to for help.With an allstar cast and top performances all around not a fan of Justin Timberlake? You will be after this film. Trust me this film is one not to be missed. The ending is so shocking that it's a wonder I didn't expect it early on. 'Alpha Dog' is an emotional roller coaster that will have you glued to the screen right from the emotional opening credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although many of the actual names and locations have been changed for the movie Nick Cassavetes' Alpha Dog tells the largely factbased story of a particularly heinous homicide that took place in Southern California in the summer of 2000 changed to the fall of 1999 for the film. The crime involved a group of young drug dealers who kidnapped then eventually murdered the 15yearold brother of a fellow drug dealer who owed the ringleader money and who largely out of stubbornness and pride refused to pay up the debt. After the discovery of the body most of the perpetrators were convicted and sent to prison but the mastermind Jesse James Hollywood called Johnny Truelove in the movie managed to flee to South America where in 2005 he was eventually arrested and sent back to the States to face trial on the charge of murderinthefirstdegree.Alpha Dog provides a grim depressing look at the dark underbelly of American society where amoral disenfranchised and disaffected youth play lifeanddeath games with drugs and guns often with tragic consequences. In the case of this story what begins almost as a spontaneous lark suddenly turns into deadly serious business as events begin to spiral further and further out of control as the story races ever more rapidly to its preordained and inexorably tragic conclusion. Cassavetes has written a tight script that captures the fastpaced drugsoaked milieu in which these young people do their business. Yet even though a number of the boys display a callous disregard for life there are others who see the wrongness of what they are doing but who through fear or misplaced loyalty or simply a belief that things would never really go that far fail to put the brakes on the whole sordid affair before it is too late. It is in that context that Truelove relinquishes his role as the main focal point of the film in favor of Frankie Ballenbacher a cheerfully sardonic wise guy whose job it is to watch over the boy while Johnny figures out what next to do with him. As Frankie becomes more and more attached to the kid it becomes harder and harder for him to comply with Johnny's ultimate order of liquidating him. Frankie thus becomes the emotional buyin point for the audience even more so than the kidnapped boy himself.There are fine performances by Emile Hirsch Shawn Hatosy Ben Foster Six Feet Under Bruce Willis Harry Dean Stanton and Sharon Stone among others but it is Justin Timberlake as the highstrung but basically goodhearted Frankie who walks off with the film. In his every moment on screen the charismatic Timberlake brings an intensity shrewdness and liveliness to his performance that bodes well for his future career in movies.In his direction Cassavetes generates a starkness of vision and moodiness of tone that are greatly enhanced by the brooding darklylit camerawork of French cinematographer Robert Fraisse.The movie has a few weaknesses. The fauxinterview scenes which Cassavetes periodically interjects into the film don't do much to enhance the storyline and succeed only in confusing the audience and interrupting the action. Moreover the ending comes upon us much too abruptly depriving us of a sense of completion and catharsis particularly in regards to Frankie's apprehension and feelings of remorse over what he did as well as the older brother's reaction to the discovery of his sibling's body. And there are sporadic rare moments mainly in the early part of the film where one gets the sense that the cast members are playacting rather than truly inhabiting their parts. But these impressions are few and very fleeting and for the most part the actors do an admirable job of conveying the downanddirty reality of the life they are portraying.Alpha Dog turns the spotlight on a subset of society we may not want to admit is there but which nonetheless exerts a tremendous negative influence on all our lives. The film serves as an alarm signal and a wakeup call that we ignore at our own peril.".

This is a story about spoiled misguided teenagers who do nothing but smoke pot drink and party. Understandably all of the teenager characters act in accordance with this carefree life style. So you should expect this sort of behavior from them a lot of cursing violence sex drug usage etc.. I think the director did a terrific job of portraying the setting for this type of life style.There are two rival parties of youngsters and one guy Jake Mazursky owes some money to another guy Johnny Truelove. Jake is a typical unruly teenager but his younger brother Zack is a nice kid who seems to have a brighter future than his older brother. But when Jake refuses to pay off his debt to Johnny Truelove they kidnap his younger brother Zack as a hostage. Surprisingly Zack develops a nice rapport with his kidnappers being a nice kid he easily connects even with the unruly kind. He doesn't even seem to be willing to escape from his kidnappers.This is an excellent film showing the extend of damage that can be caused by the misguided youngsters. They live in a world where even the most stupid acts can be accepted as being cool or desirable. Too much pot smoking and drugs not enough oxygen in the brain cells. Are these kids really that stupid or are they stupefied by all the drugs they take? I think this is a movie all parents should watch and they should watch it really carefully before things are too late.".

However when their leader Johnny Truelove Emile Hirsch decides to kidnap the brother Anton Yelchin of a man Ben Foster who owes him drug money their perfect world begins to shatter as they realize that their mindless prank has become a situation that could get them stuck in jail for the rest of their lives.The acting is pretty good considering the cast is mostly young men with little to no experience. First you have Anton Yelchin whom the plot centers around. He is the young man trying to grow up and finds a real sense of comfort in his captors as weird as it sounds. He does a great job building a likable yet flawed character. The film definitely displays likable characters but the audience has to remember that these characters are not good people. Ben Foster has always been around in my eyes and he delivers his most intense role yet as the scary and sadistic Jake Mazursky. Very good job. Emile Hirsch is steadily developing into a good leading man after nice turns in Lords of Dogtown and The Girl Next Door. He's the leader of the group and he has a certain presence despite his small size that reminds the viewer who's in command. Sharon Stone continues to defy my expectations of her after watching her in Bobby and this film. Very intense and powerful performance which is very heartfelt at the end of the film. However none of these performances stack up close to that of GASP Justin Timberlake. Timberlake really stood out to me in the film as Frankie Johnny's best friend. He develops a strong friendship with Yelchin's character and Timberlake really steals the show the whole time. His character is the most believable and likable of the bunch. Bruce Willis and Shawn Hatosy are also good in limited screen time I don't think I've seen Willis have this much hair in a long time.Nick Cassavetes does a good job as director giving us the exact opposite of his most famous work to date The Notebook. He delivers the gritty and realistic feel of 1999 Southern California and gets great performances out of actors who you don't really expect it from. The film definitely was better than I expected because of Justin Timberlake. I thought he would make the film worse but he made it better. It has some sex scenes and nudity not to mention a lot of language so Alpha Dog isn't really appropriate for anyone under 16 or 17. With a good ensemble cast a good script good direction and a heart wrenching climax Alpha Dog is a good movie to watch.810 spy".

He is so wonderful in his role and captures the innocence of a 15 year old and his final horrifying scenes are ones to remember. And Ben Foster as Zack's brother is sensational in a role that is both powerful and frightening at the same time.

	schema:headline " Alpha Dog";
	schema:reviewBody "Alpha Dog is inspired by actual events and is about a drug dealer named Johnny Truelove who is owed money by an acquaintance of his named Jake. Seeing as Jake is not paying up Johnny and his gang of friends decide to kidnap Jake's younger brother Zack and hold him until Jake pays. At first Zack is getting along really well with the people who kidnapped him and basically they just party and have fun all the time and Zack is not concerned at all. When Zack's parents and Jake become suspicious of who abducted him Johnny makes a plan with his friends as to what to do and things take a turn for the worst. Alpha Dog has good direction a good script and good performances by the entire cast. After I left Alpha Dog I realized just how impressed I was with it. Director and writer Nick Cassavetes does a great job of writing these teenage characters and just showing how they live their day to day lives. There is a certain authentic touch he gives these characters that makes the film all the more real and believable. The performances he gets out of these actors is also really impressive because everyone in this film shines. Near the end of the film the suspense builds up and the tension is delivered well and after the movie I could really feel the power of this film and it really made an impact on me. This is a type of film that left an impact on me that only truly great and powerfully made and delivered films will do. A lot of the film is just these teenage characters hanging out partying and getting into trouble but because it felt so real and genuine it was fascinating to watch. The scenes leading up to the powerful conclusion are also well written and I liked how the film looked at times like a documentary and at other times like a regular docudrama. The seediness and gritty nature of these characters and how they live and interact with each other is really showcased very well here and I don't think a film about teenagers and their lives has had such an impact on me since Larry Clark's Kids and Bully. This film is very similar to those films in a lot of ways and at times even borrows in their technique. However seeing as how I loved Kids and Bully this wasn't a problem for me at all and it just added to my love and admiration for this film. For a truly powerful and captivating motion picture that is a genuine and realistic slice of life which really had an impact on me I highly recommend this film. This is also the first film I have seen of 2007 and if there are more films with this kind of style power and energy this year then 2007 will be a great year for movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I just had to wait too long for this one to finally come out. I have never been a Justin Timberlake fan but he was one of the best things about this movie. You cannot dislike him in this. He does a good job of showing us the moral dilemma he is twisting in. I always love Emile Hirsch but found this character a little one dimensional. Gone were the moments where you can see everything he thinks and feels on his face as when he portrays Zboy Jay Adams or as Tim Travis in Imaginary Heroes. He is supposed to be the heartless bad guy in this and since he is portraying a real person perhaps the flatness of this character is due to an accurate depiction of real life Jesse James Hollywood. What this character lacks in emotion others such as Susan and Keith give us a bit more to watch. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone are believable most of the time but some moments feel incongruent Stones final scene for example was over the top and in such a bad way. Likewise Ben Foster's Jake Mazursky is all over the place as a strung outstressed out loser that starts the whole mess. He has moments of brilliance but otherwise he's just too much. The movie is way too long and tries to focus on every player in this truly tragic story. I would have liked more of Anton Yelchin's Zach and more of the emotional battles of the key characters and far less of the get high and blast out violent rap while insulting our sex partners in front of the whole gang. The story itself is captivating but the movie tries too hard to do too much and gets in its own way. Yet I don't feel cheated out of the ticket price.".

One fine day the leader of this group of morons decides on the spur of the moment to kidnap somebody. These idiots probably couldn't pull off shoplifting a pack of gum so it is safe to say that kidnapping proves well beyond their criminal capabilities. Things spiral out of control. None of the morons knows what to do so they just run around saying bleep this bleep that bleep everything. If you take out all uses of a certain fourletter word which starts with f and ends with k this would essentially be a silent movie. What we have here is a bunch of moronic degenerate lowlifes in a rather moronic movie.The characters are completely distasteful but that doesn't necessarily doom the movie to failure. Amateurish acting directing writing and photography...that's the combination which sinks the movie. Then when you add in the fact that you'll inevitably hate every significant character save one what you end up with is one terrible depressing movie. The only actor to come out of this mess with any kind of credit is Anton Yelchin who plays the young kidnapping victim. He gives a believable endearing performance. Others are not so fortunate. Emile Hirsch makes hardly any impression at all as the gang leader. Which is better than can be said for the actors playing the rest of the bad guys. They're all rather terrible. Shawn Hatosy is entirely unconvincing in his part. Ben Foster goes ridiculously over the top in playing a strungout Jewish guy...with a swastika tattoo. Then there's Justin Timberlake. He actually has one scene near the end in which he's quite good. It's as if an acting coach suddenly turned up on the set that day. Other than that? Dear Lord is he bad. The girls in the movie...Olivia Wilde Amanda Seyfried Amber Heard Dominique Swain...seem to be there for purely decorative purposes. You also get Sharon Stone who at one point dons the most ridiculous looking fatsuit you've ever seen. And Bruce Willis is in the movie too. I have no idea why. Perhaps he lost a bar bet with the director. The movie is pretty much a failure all the way around. Terribly written terribly acted terribly paced...mindnumbingly boring at times. It's a sad story about one poor boy surrounded by a bunch of reprehensible losers. The saddest thing of all is that the movie is based on a true story. This actually happened. These miserably stupid vile disgusting people actually exist in this world. Makes you lose a little faith in humanity.".

	schema:headline " Timberlake Surprises";
	schema:reviewBody "Taking place in southern California 'Alpha Dog' is based on the 1999 kidnapping and murder of Nicholas Markowitz here named Zack Mazursky. Not only does director Nick Cassavetes focus on the obvious ripped from the headlines story he also zooms in and sheds light on another aspect. That of which being not all gangsters or wannabe gangsters in this case are masterminds. Sometimes the alpha dog is actually the least intelligent member of the pack.Addict Jake Mazursky owes a debt of 1200 to drug dealer Johnny Trulove. Convinced he will never pay up Johnny and some of his lackeys kidnap Jake's 15yearold brother Zack. What at first is just a simple prank swiftly becomes a serious situation. Johnny and lackey Frankie played by Justin Timberlake soon find out they could receive a sentence of life in jail for their little prank. Now in a state of worry they begin to consider their options. Fear of Zack spilling the beans in the end overtakes them and leads to what they believe to be the only solution murdering the young teen.Opening with an odd montage of old family footage set to 'Over the Rainbow' may leave those who don't know the events the film is based on confused. The confusion only grows as the film finally starts and looks as if to be going nowhere. It's not until Zack's kidnapping everything comes together and the plot is revealed. From here on out the film goes into cruise control keeping almost the same feel up until just before the murder.The main problem though in 'Alpha Dog' lies within its length. It's not really long to begin at one hour and fortynine minutes. It looks though like there's a lot of idle time. Most of it is taken up by drinking and smoking. The conclusion is even unnecessary. The mockinterview with Zack's mother Olivia played by Sharon Stone should have been where the film ends. That would have given the film the power and oomph it aims for but never quite reaches.As far as the acting seen goes Justin Timberlake steals the show. At first it's a little hard to accept him as a the suburban thug he's playing. It doesn't take long though before the Frankie's true character comes out showing he's actually a softy who doesn't want anything bad to happen to Zack. He even tries a few times to let him get away but Zack doesn't take him up on the offer. This side of the role is much more fitting for Timberlake seeing as he doesn't exactly give off the tough guy vibe.Going into seeing 'Alpha Dog' I didn't expect it to be anything special. The fact it stars Justin Timberlake kind of turned me off to it a little. The fact he turned out to be the only real actor to shine in it really surprised me. He's not the only upside to the film though. Cassavetes presents just enough suspense and emotional distress to make it all work. There's something else too that I can't quite put my finger on that made it appealing. Possibly because even though I knew Zack was going to die I still held a little bit of hope that he'd live. I really felt bad for Yelchin's character. The lines he gives on the way up the mountain to where his murder takes place all make you want this poor kid to survive the inevitable even more. With that I'll end with saying out of all the films released in 2007 that I've seen so far 'Alpha Dog' is the best.".

It is through his short experiences with all these unique characters that kept me asking for more. Yes the parties are over dramatic but everything else was done ever so perfectly. Every actoractress played their part well. Anton Yelchin played a convincing portrayal of the innocence of a 15 year old. Justin Timberlake? Wow. I could not believe his acting he started weak but after that he just blew me away. I think because he was in it I had first avoided this movie until now. Also Ben Foster played a gripping character as Zack's older brotherJake. All the Aclass stars played their short but impacting roles as parents.In the end it left my heart heavy and pounding. A MUST SEE MOVIE that starts slow but picks up the pace so fast. I would rate this movie a 8 but because of so many PITIFUL LOW STARS I have to give it a 10.

Nothing NOTHING prepares you for the climax of the film. And what's absolutely amazing is that being based on a true story we already know going in how it ends. Can you imagine what an amazing feat of filmmaking that is? To make a movie where many KNOW the ending going in and yet walk away feeling so emotionally devastated and drained that it's hard to talk about afterward?I was blown away. Absolutely blown away. Even knowing all that I knew the story the actors the characters even knowing all that the emotional wave that takes over and propels the film through its last act is just beyond any words. I can truly say that I will remember the ending of this film for the rest of my life. Throw away everything you THINK this film is about. Because it is not. I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen to me emotionally and I was absolutely devastated. This film MUST be seen.My biggest fear is that people won't go to see this film because of preconceived notions about what it involves. The other is that they won't stay with it long enough to see the real story develop. In my opinion this is not about drug dealers or white suburban kids acting tough or sex or drugs or a gang that lived lives of excessive behavior. This is not an Rrated Afterschool Special on the dangers of spoiled youth running wild. Or a bunch of kids who went bad. Yes all these elements are there and play a part. But anyone who thinks that's the essence of the story and doesn't give it a chance will miss out on what I believe is one of the most moving and powerful sequences ever captured on film.I'll tell you right now that I was not expecting this film to turn out the way it did. I don't want to give too much away but director Nick Cassavetes has described it as an ensemble cast and I agree somewhat. Nobody is really the star of the film. If we break it down into 3 acts here is how I would describe it if I absolutely had to answer that question.ACT 1 Emile Hirsch  the story centers on him to some extent.ACT 2 Justin Timberlake  the story moves to his character. I was actually surprised at how his role begins to grow as Emile's diminishes. Although remember these are just very rough opinions on my part.ACT 3 And THIS was the big surprise for me  Anton Yelchin. At one point I actually heard myself saying in my head that he is the star of this movie if there is one.I could go on...Ben Foster Shawn Hatosy Chris Marquette Sharon Stone Amanda Seyfried Dominique Swain Olivia Wilde Bruce Willis...I put them in alphabetical order because it wouldn't be fair to rank them. All turn in shockingly powerful performances. But the story is not about Emile's character. It's not about Justin's character. It is about Anton's character. That was the biggest surprise for me and I was not prepared for how emotional the film would get towards the end. As director Nick Cassavetes himself said in the QA after the screening Anton is the heart and soul of the film. Just a warning...it is very hard to watch in parts. The bottom line is this the first act of the film sets the scene for what these guys' lives were like. The language the violence the drugs the sex they were all a part of their lifestyle and it is not sugarcoated. But more importantly it is an assault on the senses because without it the rest of the film  and the emotional impact it has  wouldn't be as believable. You have to experience how sick these guys' behavior was on a daily basis to appreciate and understand how sick were the actions they take later in the film. And it's the actions that they take later in the film that are at the heart of what the movie is about.The first half of the film is hard to sit through. But the second half makes it all worth it. You cannot get the goose bumps and feel the emotions and the heartbreak of their crime without knowing how depraved these guys were. It is a film with one of those moments  about halfway through the film just when you think you know what it's about just when maybe you're starting to wonder if it's really going to be worth watching that feeling begins to come over you. That feeling that says ohhh wait a minute. NOW I see what's going on here. Then the tears start to well up as you begin to realize what this is really all about.Once the real story starts to unfold you forget about the language and the violence and the drugs and the sex. Because now you have entered their world and the emotional impact of what comes later is just heart wrenching. This is one of those rare films that deserve the label important. It is polarizing to be sure. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But if you keep an open mind and are willing to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours although ironically this is based on a true story you will be moved you will be affected and you will be changed. Alpha Dog will do that and that's a rare feat of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alpha Dog tells an impulsive thoughtless act. Based on the true story of the Jesse James Hollywood story Johnny Truelove Emile Hirsch and his cronies don't know what to do with their new charge one moment they stuff him in the closet and duct tape his mouth and the next he and Truelove's de facto secondincommand Frankie Justin Timberlake are playing XBox. Zack is unfazed  on one level he's enjoying the adventure in what must ultimately be Alpha Dog's saddest moment he asserts that he sees it as just another story to tell his grandkids Anton Yelchin virtually runs away with the film. Director Nick Cassavetes throws Zack into an exaggerated flamboyant universe his brother Jake is unaware that he's taken hostage by a bunch of wannabe Tony Montanas. Yelchin is remarkable in the way he grounds Alpha Dog in reality. Certain scenes stand entirely alone. Zack's encounter with his parents on the stairs the subtlety of their interaction his fully believable and familiar frustration. There's nothing else like it in the movie. Late in the film Yelchin is given a hugely difficult scene where Zack's fantasy abruptly becomes a nightmare and he nails it converting Zack's ordinariness from something faintly amusing to something powerful and terrifying. Justin Timberlake is also very impressive in this scene. This also works because of the extent to which Zack is the story's moral compass. For as long as he likes and trusts his new friends the kidnapping really does seem like fun and games and the tone of the film shifts along with his perceptions. From this perspective his relationship with Frankie while touching in its way is the ultimate betrayal and his desperate appeals to his friend in the scene I mentioned earlier are one part of Alpha Dog I can't seem to get out of my mind.The other half of the film as you may have guessed focuses on the misadventures of the kidnappers and here Cassavetes runs into some problems. To his great credit his screenplay takes some real stabs at complexity though seeming every bit the amateur gangstas Johnny Truelove and Co. openly mock a gangsta rap music video despite the casual misogyny constantly bandied about Truelove himself is portrayed early on and somewhat bizarrely as a staunch monogamist. Then there's the issue of the parents who are either corrupt debauched or clueless Cassavetes seems to blame them for allowing this to happen and that seems about right.In the end though it's not quite convincing. Truelove is simply vile a coward and a liar. He's not allowed to function as a villain and Emile Hirsch doesn't have much to work with. The film resists the inevitable conclusion that these guys are just losers insisting on a view of their activities that's much more exotic than they merit and at a certain point threatening to seem silly. Including a lot of coarse language and some frightening scenes of violence Alpha Dog can give you a sense of disturbance once completed watching the film.".

I recorded it off of the TV because it said it had Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone in it little did I know that they had very small parts.The movie is a drama about a group of 20 something's all running around in gangs smoking pot causing trouble and waving guns around. A rival starts up between Johnny Truelove and Jake Mazursky over an unpaid debt The rivalry really takes a nasty turn when Johnny kidnaps Jakes brother. All of a sudden this group of guys has a hostage that actually enjoys hanging out with them. This group are completely useless and have no experience in this kind of thing. It all gets out of control.The story is based on actual events. We all know that this means that there are a few real parts but the rest has been completely made up. But either way this film is very well put together. It is a very interesting story. It is a shame that these guys lives were ruined by something so stupid. It felt like this was an on the spot decision that they will regret for the rest of their lives. It is a sad film in places. You grow to actually like a couple of these guys but you also really hate a couple of them. It is also very annoying when a character who is the leader of a gang is actually gutless. He lies to his gang to make himself look like the big hard leader but in reality he hides when there is trouble.The casting was very good. The actors were Emile Hirsch Ben Foster Justin Timberlake Vincent Kartheiser Shawn Hatosy Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone. There was not one bad actor in this film. They all did great jobs.The drama was very gripping in this. You really want this film to have a happy ending but you don't know what is going to happen until you see it. It keeps you hanging really well.It is not the best drama I have ever seen but it is still very good.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Dude this shirt is f cool Bob Marley is cool you guys think the kidnapping is cool?For more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

That's all fine and dandy but I believe that if the writer would have followed reality more closely he would have ended up with a better movie.The movie is laden with profanity. Now I have an extremely high tolerance for swearing and other vulgarities but this movie made me spill my beans. The wordsphrases fck motherfcker cck suck my dck ashole fck you are used what felt like several thousand times. Most of the dialogue consists of these words in addition to dude yo and man. In a sense I felt that the writer created an original script with dialogue but later when Mr. Timberlake was added to the cast that dialogue was rewritten to try to shift Mr. Timberlake's image from the good boy to a much more streetcredible badass.The movie begins with a bunch of wannabegangsters listening to rap and acting like thugs. Keep in mind that these are high middleclass white boys and girls. How the directorwriter ever felt anybody would feel anything but pity for such onedimensional characters is a true mystery that will possibly never be solved. As the pedestrian dialogue started pouring from my speakers I immediately believed this to be a moodsetting element which would then calm down as the plot thickened and got more serious. I kept hoping but by the 40minute mark I realized it was not to be. The crudeness of the script radiated through all elements of the movie. The writerdirector even managed to slip in a female line Let me suck your dick please. Hands up who has heard that? More earthy dialogue and acting follows ad nauseam until the nonsensical ending.Speaking of events the movie has no tangible plot. It mostly follows these white suburbian kids as they perform various activities smoke weed get drunk fornicate fight andor threaten their parents. I've seen some bad movies having a personal collection of over 350 most not bad however but I have never seen a worse film than Alpha Dog. Here's to hoping that the creator of this movie Nick Cassavetes never gets funding to create another monster.".

The parties they organize are not a lot different from the ones I go to sometimes everything stays in control but other times it gets out of our hands.When we first see a frame in Alpha Dog it's Bruce Willis sitting on a chair being irreverent as only he can be while he answers some questions about his son. This is when we realize that something happened and we're going to experience itThe camera welcomes us to the world of Johnny Truelove played by Emile Hirsch as if he doesn't care about anything and as if he knows it all. He doesn't but he bosses his friends around mostly Elvis Shawn Hatosy who does everything Truelove asks him to do.The thing is Truelove has the drugs so Truelove has the power. Everybody comes to ask him for more merchandise he goes to his father the Willis character. Everybody owes him cash but Jake Mazursky owes him big time. Mazursky is portrayed perfectly by Ben Foster another solid actor in a cast of young talents. Foster may not have worked as much as his peers but he definitely made the right choices he costarred with Hirsch in The Mudge Boy the chemistry is visible here he surpassed himself with his comedic lead in Get over it and he amazed everyone with his turn in Mystic River among other things.We meet Jake entering his family house where his father David Thornton lives with a new woman Olivia Sharon Stone who gave birth to his brother Zack Anton Yelchin. It seems that Jake comes and goes as he pleases grabs some food and asks his father for money which is a problem for Olivia who knows the boy is on drugs his father also knows but appears to be more understanding.Mazursky does not get the money and what happens because of it consist in the development of the film that unexpectedly starts putting titles on screen as 'Day One' '915 a.m.'. From the beginning Nick Cassavetes imposes his style to the picture. Taking a complete turn from The Notebook the writerdirector chooses a camera with a small amount of light the man Robert Fraisse that doesn't let us see important things at times. Uncertain and personal he divides the screen in two at the most surprising moments.His screenplay inspired by true events must have also had something of his own life. I'm not saying he was on drugs but the way the characters talk is annoying nevertheless true and accurate. But something fails in the story maybe it's too long and it doesn't move on. It seems like an eternity and it looses focus. Anyway Cassavetes' best achievement with Alpha Dog is unquestionably the direction of actors. An ensemble with Alist stars and independent greats a big cast to handleA lot of young actors.The O.C's Olivia Wilde Chris Marquette from The Girl Next Door Amanda Seyfried from Mean Girls an unrecognizable Harry Dean Stanton the inconstant but good Dominique Swain and Justin Timberlake. As Truelove's right hand Frankie Timberlake gets the best performance of the cast. Forget N'sync forget his music just watching constructing his character and making it a human being.

There is so much that is good about this film that it is hard to know where to begin. You can start with the characters. There is quite a range of socioeconomic backgrounds converging here in comfortable laid back sleaziness out of which comes the interaction of characters with a range of family values. There are the second and third generation sleazeballs played by Bruce Willis and Harry Dean Stanton. There are parents like the mother played by Sharon Stone who wants to raise happy healthy decent children. Kids who are essentially vicious and stupid hang with those who won't put common sense and decency in their back pockets and a mix of those in between. We see the initial corruption of the innocent as well as the easy descent of the aimless. This is not just another teen crime movie or the umpteenth hostage flick. It is also a story that is rife for reductionistic moralizing my preemptive strike on one Jesus H. Christ. I don't what is responsible for the dumpage on this movie but I think it will find the large audience it deserves.".

The trailer made to promote Alpha Dog is amazing please don't let it fool you. My first problem was that it had too much detail revealed in the dialogue subtitles which were never necessary to the plot and too many characters to keep up with making the film so long. I highly doubt the theatrical release will have the same time frame as it did in Park City. Mr. Cassevetes was trying to shock and touch an audience at the same timewhich doesn't work in my opinion. All the characters in the story cuss like gangsters leaving little room for characters' individuality. Especially when Anton Yelchin's character is supposed to be a juxtapose of the corrupt druggies that surround him. He looks different but talks exactly like them. His parents speak like this as well. Another writing problem is the lack of depth that is explored here there are too many party scenes and not enough character developing ones. Justin Timberlake's character is the only one that slightly develops. The acting is directed to be too overthetop and comes across as very unbelievable. All the actors freak out continuously throughout the film for various reasons screaming their lungs out like children. It becomes aggravating. In fact at the screening I was in the audience would laugh at parts like this because it seemed way too ridiculous. I won't give it away for those who care but know that whether some plot elements are based on fact or creativity there are many areas which are unbelievable and overemphasized. There is however some entertainment value to it I'll give the film thatthe relationship between Anton and Justin's roles is very special but overall Alpha Dog did not belong at the Sundance Film Festival. It was very outofplace there and you'd know what I mean if you've ever seen a Sundance film or have been to the festival before. Please don't give in to the hype that is about to come....".

	schema:reviewBody "I had a chance to catch this at the International House in Philadelphia and even had the luck of meeting the directorwriter Mr. Nick Cassavetes afterward. He seemed like an intelligent man and had no difficulty answering the questions by the audience particularly when I told him that I hated it and thought the film condoned the same sort of behavior it attempted at first to portray negatively. He thanked me for being honest and seemed like an intelligent man whose views I will incorporate into this review.Before saying anything else if you've seen the trailer you've seen the entire movie no exaggeration. Alpha Dog is more or less the story of a young boy Zach Mazursky caught up in the rich white gangster lifestyle of middle California in the late 90s. As a sort of ransom for rivaling parties he is held hostage until his brother pays a debt of 2500 to boss Johnny Truelove. However he develops a bizarre case of Stockholm Syndrome and begins to identify with the lifestyle of his captors not wanting to go home to his overprotective Conservative family.From the beginning of the film you may want to start counting fbombs because this could seriously be a rival for the top 10 if not the top 25 mostused list. The film is filled with different sorts of flashy editing particularly a lot of awkward splitscreening for no particular reason other than to maintain the audience's interest. The dialogue feels extremely unnatural even for kids who normally have no sense of English a lot of the stereotypical screaming women are very over the top and many of the actors behave like they've never even been drunk or high much less seen a real gangster or even a poser gangster before except perhaps Ben Foster and Sharon Stone who both have at least one very competent scene.Mr. Cassavetes seemed to disagree with me particularly with regards to Justin Timberlake. On that note it is surprising that this is such a lowbudget movie in light of his other works The Notebook John Q and contains so many wellknown actors. For achieving his artistic dream in the face of a small budget and little production sponsorship I will give him credit but back to the movie itself.Early on we see a heavily exaggerated archetype of a rap music video that one might find on MTV or BET these days that is being viewed at a party. Everyone is drunk high and either having sex or wanting to showing in a rather obvious if not efforted fashion that the film disagrees with this lifestyle. Throughout the movie the people at the screening who came for the free show laughed at the violence and the stupidity of some of the characters' dialogue not because of irony but because it seemed funny almost normal. The message was not being made especially in the very overthetop scene where Zack gets in a swimming pool with two very attractive ladies who find it hot that he's been abducted.Practically the entire lifestyle away from Zach's overprotected parents is glorified in the babes booze and pot. On one very unexplained level it attempts to say that this lifestyle is stupid and too many kids are leading it and it should be dealt with. On another it's saying that this is a dreamcometrue for Zach a way for him to rebel and that this is a positive thing that he was abducted. Further on in a situation I will not reveal he suddenly comes to an almost laughable epiphany in the process of thanking his captors and stating how he should all of a sudden be better to his mom because she's his best friend or do something productive like learn guitar. This is a revelation you get from boozing it up and enjoying it!?What do I think? I think the movie needed a whole different viewpoint and marketing. The audience it is intended to reach will not understand anything except the futility of the real life story itself. They will not understand No this is a stupid way for a person to live and this is what happens they will merely find something comical to enjoy while the characters are wasted out of their skulls condoning and laughing at it rather than being affected by it. There are far better movies that have presented these types of negative lifestyle's asis see Kids Gummo American History X Trainspotting Finding Forrester etc. as well as ones that have come off relatively preachy On The Waterfront Requiem For A Dream Blow Leaving Las Vegas etc. but still manage to have a consistent vision.Many audience members will be affected by the fact that this film is a true story. I am a firm believer in the fact that this should not change one's attitude toward its artistic quality. This film while an interesting true story needed to be manipulated as a work of fiction more. No matter the outcome this is merely another tragic and stupid story of what happens with kids with too much free time and too much of their parents' money had the main character not been on the FBI's Most Wanted list for 5 years or rather had the victim not been white rich and in a suburban setting this story would've never caught anyone's attention. It is for this among other reasons that I find it to be a rather selfundoing movie one whose purpose may at the core be divine and intelligent but whose writing and overall execution was as nebulous as a train wreck.Mr. Cassavetes you seem like an intelligent man and I apologize for not enjoying your film.".

The dialogue feels extremely unnatural even for kids who normally have no sense of English a lot of the stereotypical screaming women are very over the top and many of the actors behave like they've never even been drunk or high much less seen a real gangster or even a poser gangster before except perhaps Ben Foster and Sharon Stone who both have at least one very competent scene.Mr. Cassavetes seemed to disagree with me particularly with regards to Justin Timberlake. On that note it is surprising that this is such a lowbudget movie in light of his other works The Notebook John Q and contains so many wellknown actors. For achieving his artistic dream in the face of a small budget and little production sponsorship I will give him credit but back to the movie itself.Early on we see a heavily exaggerated archetype of a rap music video that one might find on MTV or BET these days that is being viewed at a party. Everyone is drunk high and either having sex or wanting to showing in a rather obvious if not efforted fashion that the film disagrees with this lifestyle. Throughout the movie the people at the screening who came for the free show laughed at the violence and the stupidity of some of the characters' dialogue not because of irony but because it seemed funny almost normal. The message was not being made especially in the very overthetop scene where Zack gets in a swimming pool with two very attractive ladies who find it hot that he's been abducted.Practically the entire lifestyle away from Zach's overprotected parents is glorified in the babes booze and pot. On one very unexplained level it attempts to say that this lifestyle is stupid and too many kids are leading it and it should be dealt with. On another it's saying that this is a dreamcometrue for Zach a way for him to rebel and that this is a positive thing that he was abducted. Further on in a situation I will not reveal he suddenly comes to an almost laughable epiphany in the process of thanking his captors and stating how he should all of a sudden be better to his mom because she's his best friend or do something productive like learn guitar. This is a revelation you get from boozing it up and enjoying it!?What do I think? I think the movie needed a whole different viewpoint and marketing. The audience it is intended to reach will not understand anything except the futility of the real life story itself. They will not understand No this is a stupid way for a person to live and this is what happens they will merely find something comical to enjoy while the characters are wasted out of their skulls condoning and laughing at it rather than being affected by it. There are far better movies that have presented these types of negative lifestyle's asis see Kids Gummo American History X Trainspotting Finding Forrester etc. as well as ones that have come off relatively preachy On The Waterfront Requiem For A Dream Blow Leaving Las Vegas etc. but still manage to have a consistent vision.Many audience members will be affected by the fact that this film is a true story. I am a firm believer in the fact that this should not change one's attitude toward its artistic quality. This film while an interesting true story needed to be manipulated as a work of fiction more. No matter the outcome this is merely another tragic and stupid story of what happens with kids with too much free time and too much of their parents' money had the main character not been on the FBI's Most Wanted list for 5 years or rather had the victim not been white rich and in a suburban setting this story would've never caught anyone's attention. It is for this among other reasons that I find it to be a rather selfundoing movie one whose purpose may at the core be divine and intelligent but whose writing and overall execution was as nebulous as a train wreck.Mr. Cassavetes you seem like an intelligent man and I apologize for not enjoying your film.";

Charles Ryder in his civilian life rose out of his middle class London background which includes being an atheist and having a distant relationship with his eccentric father to become an up and coming artist. He is currently an army officer who is stationed at a makeshift camp set up at Brideshead estate before imminently getting shipped into battle. The locale which is not unfamiliar to him makes him reminisce about what ended up being his doomed relationship with Brideshead's owners the Flytes an ostentatiously wealthy family. Charles first met Sebastian Flyte when they both were students at Oxford where Sebastian surprisingly welcomed Charles into his circle of equally wealthy somewhat stuck up and flamboyant friends. Charles ended up getting caught up in Sebastian's family struggles where Sebastian used excessive alcohol to deal with the pain resulting from his family relationships.

	schema:reviewBody "Those who have not seen the 1981 Granada television miniseries about the aristocratic English Catholic Marchmain family their spiritual torments and their conflicted friend Charles Ryder may be at an advantage in watching this new adaptation. That series was superb and took the time to do more than justice to the satirical Evelyn Waugh's uncharacteristically solemn and lengthy 1945 novel. This film version much briefer than the miniseries but not exactly short at 135 minutes has one advantage it shows off the plot in sharp outline.The miniseries may actually blur that basic element. It was hypnotic rolling on from week to week for those who first saw it gathering an accumulation of nostalgia and melancholy beautifully mounted and graced by the likes of John Gielgud Laurence Olivier Claire Bloom and Stphane Audran. It also put Jeremy Irons on the map in the central role of Charles and by his own admission made him fall out of love with jeans through wearing the elegant clothes of a wellturnedout young man of the 1920's. The miniseries can take the time to develop important minor characters. The book is an elaborate portrait of a generation and an era. Waugh wrote short witty novels mostly. But this time writing about wealth and grandeur and Catholicism he waxes poetic and goes into nearProustian detail.Sebastian's grand family draws the awestruck middleclass Charles in and eventually spits him out leaving him shattered but lastingly impressed by the power of the Marchmains' Catholic faith. As the tale opens in all versions he's reminiscing about it all much later as an army officer at the end of World War II ironically posted at Brideshead the glorious estate where Sebastian grew upa place Charles came to know intimately even though it was never fully accessible to him.Maybe Waugh in his novel was more concerned with the nostalgia for a prewar life he imagined as splendid and carefree for a class to which he aspired and more selfconsciously dwelling on his infatuation with Catholicism to which he was a convert. But the story as we see in this new film turns on a kind of love triangleone heavyladen with sexual and spiritual conflict.Charles Ryder Matthew Goode and Sebastian Ben Whishaw enter into an intense romantic and alcoholic friendship when Charles comes for his first year at Oxford. The film carries this a bit further than either the novel or the TV version showing the two handsome young men not only often affectionately and playfully arm in arm but in an intimate bathroom scene and once anyway sharing a lingering drunken kiss. This despite the fact that a relative sternly warned Charles to avoid sodomites when he first arrived at university. Whishaw of 'Perfume' and 'I'm Not There' has a touching wispy vulnerable quality that distinguishes him from the TV Anthony Andrews whose Sebastian is more brassy slick confident and social. When Charles meets Sebastian's sister Julia Hayley Atwall in the film the impossibly elegant Diana Quick in the miniseries and lights a cigarette for her in a car he immediately hears in the words of the novel echoed in the TV narration a thin bat's squeak of sexuality and the equation changes. He begins to desire Julia. Apart from her unmistakable allure she's a way for Charles to possess the Marchmain world more completely. This especially in the film immediately clouds the relationship with Sebastian who grows cold and simultaneously sinks deeper into dipsomania.In the miniseries there is more time for Charles's profound infatuation with his aristocratic young Catholic friend and his magnificent world to sink in and for Sebastian's decline into alcoholism to unwind with slow horrible inevitability. The latter is memorably described in the book repeated in the TV narration as feeling like a blow expected repeated falling on a bruise with no smart or shock of surprise only a dull and sickening pain and the doubt whether another one like it could be borne. It has to be rushed a bit in the film. But the process isn't falsified only made more clear.Their mother Lady Marchmain film Emma Thompson TV Claire Bloom at first finds Charles sensible and polite a good influence for the dissolute and sexually wayward Sebastian. But she can't bend Charles to her will. It emerges that Lord Marchmain film Michael Gambon TV Laurence Olivier has long ago fled from his wife's control to Venice and lives with a mistress Cara film Greta Schacchi TV Stphane Audran. A visit to Venice leads to kisses with Julia and also introduces Charles to another equally intoxicating kind of beautybesides which in Italy everybody's Catholic but as Cara points out of a more relaxed sort than the cloying Lady Marchmain's. Charles can't have Julia as long as Lady Marchmain is around. As circumstances turn out their idyll is brief and happens after Charles is married and a successful painter. Sebastian has wound up with a weak German man in Morocco in terrible health a saintly drunkard. Julia and Lord Marchmain have last minute returns to their faith and Charles is left out in the cold.Viewing all three versions book TV screen one sees the story isn't about Charles or about anybody really. It's about temptation. It's about the world between the wars through eyes clouded by longing. The adaptation is very creditable. It shows the appeal of the story. Those who are entranced by it ought to read Waugh's book and rent DVD's of the Granada miniserieswhich was about the best thing ever done for television. It delivers long passages from the book verbatim. Waugh was best in his short witty early satires but he turns many a good phrase in this his most popular and for a while his own favorite book. Then he rejected it and one can see why. Its sentimentality is so unlike him at his best. But it adapts well.".

The religious aspect is dealt with almost incidentally.Second Lady Marchmain as played by Emma Thompson is a very grim person with total emotional control over her children and whose particular Christian beliefs means that she is indifferent to their suffering as to her this life is a mere precursor to the glorious afterlife  the same attitude as a 911 hijacker in fact. She has none of the sweetness that Claire Bloom brought to the 1981 TV series.Third some of the performances owe a good deal to those in the TV series especially Matthew Goode as Charles who has an uncanny likeness to Jeremy Irons. And of course Castle Howard reprises its role as Brideshead. Some characters were reduced to ciphers for example Bridey who played by Simon Jones stole several scenes in 1981 but the part is reduced to a nonentity here. Michael Gambon a consummate actor gives us a new take on Lord Marchmain to compare with Lawrence Olivier's earlier version.Overall though I was left with the impression this film has not much to say which is new. Like the recent feature film version of Pride and Prejudice it gives a broad outline of the story but misses out much of the rich context provided by the minor characters.

	schema:headline " An Unbiased Review of Brideshead";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never read the book or seen the miniseries so my experience wasn't clouded by already existing expectations and assumptions of the characters. Instead I was awaiting a first and therefore unbiased look into the world of Brideshead. As a film it is okay bordering on good and solid. The performances are strong enough to keep the audience interested but they do not keep us enthralled. The leads are savvy and sexy in their own rights but they lack true appeal as performers. They can come off as rather dull in certain scenes but in others they pull out a subtle presence that is called for in intimate or more emotion scenes. This inconsistence was bothersome and hindered the overall telling of the story. The one presence that is felt but is far too short is that of Emma Thompson. As the matriarchal head of the family she is brutal and works well with the one dimensional writing she was given. If they had focused more on her we would have been able to understand the tortured minds of Julia and Sebastian better. Instead they have Julia and Sebastian describe her to the audience which keeps us from getting close enough to realize what deformed her mind to begin with.Charles is at times to weak and unsure to be accepted as someone we want to see happy. We end up being unsure of his character's intention and not in a mysterious purposeful way but in a the filmmaking is too unclear way. Is Charles just a social climber whose dreams are dashed by his wants and Atheist ways? Or is he a moral soul lost in the pull of Brideshead's condemning Catholic trappings? This is the major flaw to the film Charles is never exposed.Small framing problems and outofstyle shots hampered the visual appeal but with that aside the visuals are very lush and the score complements some well placed montages to give the viewer a true sense of the desired neverending summer Charles and Sebastian so desperately dream after.If you like British tales of class and religion or period films this one is not a letdown. It is nothing new but nothing terrible either. I recommend it if this is your sort of thing I was not disappointed but I wasn't blown away.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have never read the book or seen the miniseries so my experience wasn't clouded by already existing expectations and assumptions of the characters. Instead I was awaiting a first and therefore unbiased look into the world of Brideshead. As a film it is okay bordering on good and solid. The performances are strong enough to keep the audience interested but they do not keep us enthralled. The leads are savvy and sexy in their own rights but they lack true appeal as performers. They can come off as rather dull in certain scenes but in others they pull out a subtle presence that is called for in intimate or more emotion scenes. This inconsistence was bothersome and hindered the overall telling of the story. The one presence that is felt but is far too short is that of Emma Thompson. As the matriarchal head of the family she is brutal and works well with the one dimensional writing she was given. If they had focused more on her we would have been able to understand the tortured minds of Julia and Sebastian better. Instead they have Julia and Sebastian describe her to the audience which keeps us from getting close enough to realize what deformed her mind to begin with.Charles is at times to weak and unsure to be accepted as someone we want to see happy. We end up being unsure of his character's intention and not in a mysterious purposeful way but in a the filmmaking is too unclear way. Is Charles just a social climber whose dreams are dashed by his wants and Atheist ways? Or is he a moral soul lost in the pull of Brideshead's condemning Catholic trappings? This is the major flaw to the film Charles is never exposed.Small framing problems and outofstyle shots hampered the visual appeal but with that aside the visuals are very lush and the score complements some well placed montages to give the viewer a true sense of the desired neverending summer Charles and Sebastian so desperately dream after.If you like British tales of class and religion or period films this one is not a letdown. It is nothing new but nothing terrible either. I recommend it if this is your sort of thing I was not disappointed but I wasn't blown away.";

It succeeded in this but only just due to superb direction photography and script which even in its sparseness only just allowed the successful transition to film. The problem with anything shorter is that if it took Mortimer so many episodes to get it right then there are very few writers who could even get near in under 4 hours if that. So lets stop beating about the bush. This is a sound reproduction of the calender plot but after that it is not Brideshead Revisited. Call it by another name and I will laud it. It brings in a strong homosexual element and a early sexual attraction between Charles Ryder and Miss Flyte. With that everything becomes unbalanced. Motivations change. The beauty of the original is that it hinted at ????something a je ne sais quoi and it was that and the ever strengthening Catholic awareness of family that made this film so fascinating. The original's masterpiece was the script supported by the cine photography. That has been lost.

	schema:headline " Be a good boy. For God. And for Mummy...";
	schema:reviewBody "That infantalizing line spoken by the staunchly Catholic Lady Marchmain Emma Thompson to her grown son Sebastian Ben Wishaw pretty much sums up what is at the heart of this film. Lady Marchmain hovers like a dark cloud of oppression over Brideshead Manor. It is still the 15th Century and she is leading the Crusades. Everyone in her wake will suffer. She is a woman without a soul and she has filled that emptiness with equal amounts of religion and oblivion. Too late she will realize that her children have grown to hate her. Too late for her and too late for them. Emma Thompson plays Lady Marchmane with a placid beauty underneath which are rivulets of ice cold water. She never says or does anything outwardly horrible. She doesn't have to. She can kill with kindness the most insidious weapon of all.Her son Sebastian bears the scars of her mothering from the first time we see him. He is a vomitous drunk at Cambridge and probably not even yet 20. It is there away from her and the prison that was his family home that he meets a fellow student Charles Ryder played by Matthew Goode. When Charles tells Sebastian that he is an aspiring artist Sebastian's response without hesitation is Would you like to paint me? It is a slightly selfcentered but disarmingly innocent reaction. Charles's answer Why yes is equally charming and oddly compliant. With this simple exchange we know fully who these two individuals are and of the limitations that will strain their relationship to its breaking point. I don't think you could distill this expansive story down to twoplus hours any better than what is done here. The screenplay is well crafted and does justice to its original source material. Director Julian Jarrold floats the story wistfully through a haze of remembrance. It is sentimental with all of the best possible implications that word entails. The performances by Wishaw Goode and Thompson are without equal. The cinematography is grand scintillating and necessarily oppressive at times. The score is sweeping when we caper upon Oxford for the first time endearing when Sebastian looks longingly at Charles and gets out of the way completely when silence is the louder and more necessarily personal underlying voice. But the honest adaptation of Waugh's famous novel is perhaps the most compelling. We are guided through the experiences of the incompletely formed Charles Ryder as he is drawn into the world of Brideshead Manor the Flyte family and a love triangle that will engulf him. It is a love triangle where no one in the triangle is in love with anyone in the triangle and will render him emotionally destitute for life. As a person he is so blank that he can be anything or nothing to anyone. And in the end that makes him nobody the least desired outcome of all for him. Charles's first love unrequited by him is Sebastian Flyte. Sebastian is the youngest of three and a selfimposed outcast. Wishaw gives us a Sebastian who is purposeful but frail. He creates a character more vivid than the one written in Waugh's novel with more childishness and petulance. For all of his flaws though his willfulness his alcoholism his self absorption he is above all sympathetic. The damage done to him by his mothers faith is apparent from his first appearance on screen. She has religiously and spiritually eviscerated him from the moment that as a child she first suspected he might turn out to be gay. And it is between he and Charles that occurs what I would call the most painful screen kiss of all time. You almost need to look away. This is the crystalline moment that reveals the yawning abyss inside of one man and the awkward superficiality of the other. They will know one another uncomfortably forever. Ben Wishaw as Sebastian Matthew Goode as Charles Ryder and Emma Thompson as Lady Marchmain create a triangulation of love control and antagonism who's tension is felt throughout this film. And it is Lady Marchmain who cleaves a swath of unexamined Catholisism through the lives of all those around her. Consequences be damned. I had never heard of Ben Wishaw when I saw this film in 2008. He is a once in a lifetime actor. What he has done since then and his Sebastian here speak for themselves. Matthew Goode is equally brilliant in a role with a more confined range. He is the innocent bystander by the wreck that is Brideshead Manor and the Marchmain family. It is a more difficult character to develop who's only function is to bear witness to those around you with barely one foot in the story line. But he does it to great effect with accommodation and restraint. These are amazing performances but not the kind that get Oscar attention. They're too good. This big screen version of Waugh's novel is truly breathtaking. This cast of Wishaw Goode and Thompson I could watch over and over again. The comic relationship between Charles and his emotionally sterile father is just enough of a breather to be able to get through the turbulence at Brideshead Manor. Centuries of emotional decay lead to sad and unfulfilling lives. Saddest among them is Sebastian's. His salvation comes with his decent into alcoholism where no one can reach him. They no longer try to help and he therefore can no longer fail them. Between he Lady Marchmain his sister and Charles he may actually have made out better. It is not a happy story but rather one of reluctant acceptance like all acceptance is.I don't believe that comparisons between this feature length film and the 13 hour mini series from the early 80's are useful. The only question is whether or not it is true to Waugh's novel. It is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Naturally comparisons to the classic 1981 miniseries are unavoidable. Because of the choice to use the same location Castle Howard for Brideshead in the film as the mini they become even more obvious.With just over two hours a lot of the story gets chopped out along with a lot of the minor characters. In fact the film is basically about a fifteen year long love triangle Sebastian Charles and Julia. All of the aspects of the Flytes as a dying class replaced by the Rex Mottrams of the world and the Catholic themes are practically written out.Perhaps the single most pernicious edit was the fact that Charles' conversion to Catholicism was edited from the film. Without that conversion the whole Catholic element becomes just an impediment to the CharlesJulia relationship. Possibly the worst effect coming from this choice is that the film kind of drifts to a close without any closure when it returns Charles to Brideshead in 1944.On the plus side Emma Thompson is appropriately manipulative and domineering as Lady Marchmain. Also the cinematography is topnotch. Curiously enough however there is far less star power in the film than in the miniseries. Granada TV was supposedly using the miniseries to flagship their quality programming right before a license renewal and they got some names John Gielgud Lawrence Olivier Jeremy Irons. The new film has Emma Thompson.Another problem with the short time involved is that the characters are not allowed to develop the same way they were in the 1981 mini. The character who suffers most from this is Sebastian. Anthony Andrews' Sebastian was a brat who got away with being a brat because he could turn on the charm and make anybody love him at least in the beginning. Ben Whitshaw's Sebastian is still a brat but he is not shown as the great charmer. The funny thing is sometimes when they say the same lines Andrews came off as witty Whitshaw comes off as whiny.Along those lines Bridey is essentially a noncharacter. Simon Arthur Dent Jones' magnificently understated performance as an upperclass twit is sorely missed.Also in the miniseries it is obvious that Charles falls first for Sebastian and then for the entire Flyte family except Bridey. In the film one could get the impression that Charles is more in love with the building than either Julia or Sebastian.This isn't to say that Brideshead Revisited was a bad film it was a good but not great film. However not unlike film versions of Pride and Prejudice there is too much Waugh for 135 minutes. In the case of this film dropping both the class and Catholicism aspects in large part makes a good film but not necessarily one fully in touch with Waugh's themes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's attributed to just about everybody  from Ginger Rogers to Milan Kundera  and it sounds so right There are no small parts only small actors. If you want proof and a real understanding of the adage revisit Brideshead Revisited and behold the miracle of Emma Thompson's Lady Marchmain sucking the life out of anything and anybody she touches and Michael Gambon's delightfully dissolute Lord Marchmain. She has about 10 minutes on the screen he perhaps four and yet their characters will follow you out of the theater and stay with you at length. Thompson's work is especially dazzling because the mean sanctimonious character is so clearly alien to the actress in fact I suspected miscasting when I first heard of her assignment and also as the character is so exaggerated almost a caricature. And yet Thompson gives the challenge her all and walks away with it the performance has Best Supporting Actress written all over it. It's difficult to believe that the man you see as Marchmain is the same actor who was the Singing Detective of the superb BBC series not the Robert Downey Jr. mishap. Gambon has a range as wide as all outdoors and you never ever see effort in the performance. His amiable Marchmain  subtly hinting at a complex character under the surface  has a physical similarity to Gambon's Uncle Vanya on the London stage but otherwise it's a unique creation. What else is there to this new edition of Brideshead? A great deal but only if you're among those who missed both Evelyn Waugh's novel and the wonderful Granada TV realization 27 long years ago  Irons! Gielgud! Olivier!  how can you compete with that? So if it's a firsttime visit see the movie by all means if you can recite lines from the book or the TV series you can survive without the new version. In 135 minutes the film is handling well what the TV series did so completely in  yes  13 HOURS. Obviously except for the basic story line script by Jeremy Brock of The Last King of Scotland this is a different kind of animal still leisurely enough but unable to luxuriate in the smallest details as the series did. The director is Julian Jarrold and he is doing far better than in his recent Becoming Jane keeps the story moving in a smooth fashion. As to the leading roles in the film they are all well acted but without great impact. Matthew Goode is Charles Ryder the focal character Ben Whishaw is the slightly overflamboyant Sebastian Flyte who needs understating more than exaggerating  Anthony Andrews' performance in the TV series was exactly right Hayley Atwell is Sebastian's sister and rival for Charles' affection. One amazing thing about Brideshead is how this story from a different time about characters from a different world remains interesting and meaningful. It's almost as if Waugh's work was bulletproof  not that these filmmakers were less than respectful to the author. A better test would be a Eurotrash opera version heaven forfend.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's attributed to just about everybody  from Ginger Rogers to Milan Kundera  and it sounds so right There are no small parts only small actors. If you want proof and a real understanding of the adage revisit Brideshead Revisited and behold the miracle of Emma Thompson's Lady Marchmain sucking the life out of anything and anybody she touches and Michael Gambon's delightfully dissolute Lord Marchmain. She has about 10 minutes on the screen he perhaps four and yet their characters will follow you out of the theater and stay with you at length. Thompson's work is especially dazzling because the mean sanctimonious character is so clearly alien to the actress in fact I suspected miscasting when I first heard of her assignment and also as the character is so exaggerated almost a caricature. And yet Thompson gives the challenge her all and walks away with it the performance has Best Supporting Actress written all over it.

The crime is that the Waugh estate allowed this piece of tripe to be released under the name Brideshead Revisited. How far does this thing go from the original? Well let's see. Waugh wrote a profound meditation on the power of memory the inevitable tragedies of life and love and the mystery of faith. Jarrold gives us a notverytitillating bisexual love triangle with a pasted on last reel reveal of the main character's shallow motivation. Waugh's characters were rich multilayered creations. Jarrold's are plasticine clichs with no depth no recognizable motivation and no growth . . . hell they don't even age. In the 15 or so years in which Jarrold sets his story his characters look EXACTLY the same at the end as they did at the beginning.One has to wonder what Jarrold was thinking If he didn't want to make something even remotely resembling Waugh's work why use its title and steal a handful of its scenes? Was it just that he didn't think he could sell Last Love Triangle in 1920s Venice?".

	schema:headline " Nice try but some originals can never be equaled let alone surpassed";
	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a few decades something like Brideshead comes along. No wonder anyone would want to try to relive that magic! So now there is Brideshead the movie. That means the director had to grasp the original TV show in two hours so no other choice than a 'The Best Of' compilation remains it seems.The disadvantage of it is that what is left out suddenly becomes painfully missing. All of us who have watched the TV series know it is virtually impossible to surpass it in film or TV production. Nevertheless I tried to watch it without prejudice. Overall not a bad movie but no not the magical resonance the original had. All I can do is summarize in details the pluses and minuses of the film versus the TV production so here it goesThe fathers from original were two of the best actors of the century John Geilgud Shakespeare and the incomparable Laurence Olivier. Geilgud plays brilliantly the teasing but not totally indifferent father who seems stop Charles from the insipid surroundings in the summer but finally lets him go. In the TV series the actor is more serious and the fun is not there. Laurence had probably one of the best performances of all and clearly echoes his naughtiness as he portrayed in A Little Romance then a few years earlier. His unpredictability which finally makes him decide for his daughter is well done especially considered his playground was virtually no more than a static death bed! And then the scene where he is offered a ride in a car down the steps which he refuses since he doesn't want to admit it might be his last. Matthew Goode does quite a good job as a substitute of Jeremy Irons. I like especially his ambivalent apparition homosexual heterosexual both or doesn't it matter?. But he lacks the wonderful narrating voice of Irons which research has shown to be one of the best around. In the film the romance between Charles and Sebastian's sister is elaborated much more. Partially I agree with this choice. In the original not enough scenes were implanted for credibility except probably the scene where Charles lights her cigarette. They were virtually strangers meeting again on the cruiser years later and nevertheless they seemed to suddenly hit it off. The sister was not what stood Charles' and Sebastian's friendship in the way. The filmmakers choose for more stress on their impending romance. I think the TV original did this better it was the family that Charles became part of and Sebastian's indifference to love that became unsurpassable problems. In original the mother was almost invisible with the exception of some quotes on her son like 'I don't understand it' which summed it all up. We do not need the dialog in the film where she explains herself and wonders why her kids hate her. Understatement is much more powerful also in the scene 'I'll say no more' between Charles and Julia in which it becomes clear religion has driven them apart. One sentence can be enough. All this was at the cost of stress Sebastian could have had and got in the TV original. Most of the magic of Brideshead was simply Anthony Andrews' performance. Worse the movie clearly alludes to a homosexual relationship which it did not need to be. Sebastian was a love object and could be loved by anyone in any way. But then again it might be hard finding someone that could deliver the line about Sebastian as Irons narrated 'his beauty arresting'. Charm was the problem the danger. That missed in this film. It was charm that nearly got Charles astray as told by the queer friend years later in his atelier. The film omitted this important scene where that friend tried to warn Charles for Sebastian. At the time we all thought it was a nasty remark but later on he seemed to be right. Or was the charm not an illusion after all? The film simply did not have enough time to build up the charm Sebastian surely had in the TV original. In the TV series Charles was shown first with boring friends and it then became shortly a coming of age story where he got introduced in a more fun crowd with Sebastian. This phase delivered some of the best scenes of the story with his queer friend talking loud over the campus or Sebastian dressing up as a man with mustache. Sebastian showed Charles other worlds which real or not were unforgettable. The film had to rush this too much and therefore the introduction scene with the spring eggs lost its magic.One of the few pluses was much less stress on Cordelia the little girl. But the minus was she acted as an indirect narrator of the importance of religion. Now it had to be compensated for in dialog with the mother and Julia which was in TV better since there meaning came out of things not said.Many things I missed but you can not cram all in two hours. But lines like 'I would like to remember Sebastian how he were that summer when we walked through the enchanted place' should have been told again. The end was nicely done with Charles finally not pinching candlelight symbolic for the charm of that family that was still alive in him. I liked there the Irons narrative though 'Was it all vanity? Etc.' I would say it was a brave attempt something like making a remake of 2001 or Casablanca or Breakfast at Tiffany's and the acting was all well done. Also camera work and story adaptation. But who can surpass Anthony Andrews or Jeremy Irons or Gielgud or Olivier?".

	schema:reviewBody "Among many of the most prestigious literature selections not to mention miniseries Brideshead Revisited not only wasn't on my radar I didn't even know if it would be the kind of wellregarded literature or miniseries I intended to watch. But as this newly revised picture now a mere 136 minutes vs 10 hours it looked interesting if only as a kind of handsomely made picture you know the kind along the lines of Atonement for recent comparison. I was also intrigued by the allure of a huge sprawling mansion here called Brideshead as it reminded me of Alain Resnais's film Last Year at Marienbad and how memories and recollections and lost love and hope is explored in the spaces of this dark cold region of exquisite luxury. Some of that is explored in this film and some of it... isn't.It's for the most part a fairly tragic story of a young man Charles Matthew Goode charming and suave but also subtle and downbeat a really fine turn who enrolls at Oxford and meets a meek'fey' guy named Sebastian and through him he's introduced reluctantly in point of fact to Sebastian's family including his sister Julia and his very cold and strident mother Emma Thompson. Sebastian really wants Charles all for himself  it's a friendship that goes just a nosehair's length into admitting homosexuality but never really goes that far despite all appearances to the contrary  but he becomes apart of the fold and as well falling deeply in love with Julia against 'other' wishes mostly the matriarch's over Charles's religion.There's a lot of the fragility of the bourgeois on display here the arrogance and detachment that's shown very closely by the director for maximum effect. Unlike a Resnais he's not about to get too experimental with the camera he's a careful craftsman more often than not allowing for just enough wonderment of the whole Brideshead atmosphere to really sink into how it could be a doubleedged sword of perception. And as is bound to happen with material this sprawling at one point time jumps back 10 years then ahead 4 years until we kind of know where we are a lot seems to be cut out. While it altogether makes a coherent and entertaining enough picture I wonder how much more of a benefit this would make as an epic where we are absorbed more fully with the Oxford school or Charles and Sebastian or even the parents who thankfully are played wonderfully here by coldasice Thompson and fascinatingly guiltridden and subtle Michael Gambon or how the wealth structure even works here.Indeed I found myself not so much involved with the CharlesSebastian stuff even as it's fairly wellacted and wellshot enough as I was with the themes of religion raised in the picture. This caught me off guard and hinted at something deeper being expounded upon. Yet again we get just tastes of what's offered more than likely in the original text tastes that are powerful like a 'lastrites' argument and the tortured state of being raised from the cradle with an intense overbearing Catholic conscience.".

	schema:headline " My First Taste of Brideshead Revisited  and Definitely Not Something I'd Go Back To";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen any other adaptation for 'Brideshed Revisted' let alone read the book but if this film is a sign of what to expect from the other versions then I most certainly will not be revisiting Brideshead.The only reason I did give it 4 stars actually was because for the first third or so I was actually really enjoying myself. The tale of Charles Ryder caught between the brother and sister of the incredibly powerful rich and catholic Flyte family ticked all the boxes I had for an enjoyable period drama  yet all of a sudden something happen to the film and it turned into one of the most painful experiences of my life THE most painful will always go to 'Bablyon AD' however. The moment Charles and Julia finally get together almost 10 years after first meeting the film lost all it's magic. The main character all of a sudden became a personalityless uncaring unpleasant man who cared so little for his wife he was willing to drop her at the drop of a hat to carry out his desires for Julia from years back not even a second thought to the woman he married. Then when he finally does have Julia all to himself he doesn't want her either because she is still tied too strongly to her Catholic faith. Talk about having your cake and eating it. In fact the only character I actually cared about AT ALL in this snoozefest was Sebastian Flyte who transformed himself from a character that seemed ludicrously ridiculous to begin with Quail eggs? to someone who the viewer really cared about. I wanted to see Sebastain happy I wanted him to sort out his life and make himself into someone to break free from all the chains his 'mummy' enforced on him many many years ago. But no instead you never even find out what happens to the poor guy and for the last 3rd of the film he doesn't even feature at all  instead you're forced to sit and watch the completely insufferable Charles and Julia and their incredibly awkward relationship were they meant to be that awkward or did the actors honestly have no chemistry at all!?.I guess I've got to give this film some credit though. Visually it was stunning the house of Brideshead was beautiful the scenes at oxford wonderfully shot and the atmosphere of Venice captured perfectly. Even some of the acting was rather good  I am a HUGE fan of Ben Wishaw and thought his transformation into Sebastain Flyte incredible  Wishaw has the skill to really draw the viewer onto his side make us understand what his character is going through invoking in us all the emotions Sebastian must be feeling. Similarly I was very impressed by Michael Gambon's portrayal of Lord Marchmain and of course Emma Thompson is always spectacular in her roles yet this definitely isn't the best I've seen her in. The one bad performance I'd like to pick out is that of Matthew Good as Charles Ryder. The guy cannot convey any emotion at all  I don't know whether Ryder is supposed to be portrayed as some emotionless completely unsympathetic unpleasant man but that's all I was getting from Mr Good which was only ever saved by the brilliant script that once in a while forced some form of emotion into his completely wooden acting. Very very bast casting which is a shame because it might have just ruined the film completely.Brideshead Revisited isn't one of those films that I would want to see again but I was glad I saw it once purely because of the character of Sebesatian. That is one person in this mess at least that was written and acted very well and I hope at least Wishaw gets the recognition he deserves from this performance and doesn't instead get sunk with this ship.".

That is one person in this mess at least that was written and acted very well and I hope at least Wishaw gets the recognition he deserves from this performance and doesn't instead get sunk with this ship.";

That is what seems to be the predicament in Evelyn Waugh's novel now adapted into a stagnant film in which one is not invited to feel or react due to its own lack of feeling or solidly portrayed consequence.This film version focuses on forbidden love and the death of purity set before WWII. Matthew Goode who was excellent as the villain in The Lookout becomes spellbound with a noble family first because of his friendship with a charming provocative apparently homosexual contemporary and then his sister. The fluctuation of Goode's obsessions suggest the decay of a selfindulgent upper crust in England flanked by the two World Wars related in the course of his recurring stays at the Brideshead estate. What's more fundamental to Waugh's story is the harsh Catholicism of the family as imposed by their matriarch played by Emma Thompson the high point of the film by far. Their religious beliefs are confronted by the son's homosexuality the daughter's adulterous liaison with Goode and Goode's atheism.There are two curious fathers in the film. Michael Gambon is one still legitimately married sure enough but is ostracized living in a Venetian palazzo with his mistress Greta Scacchi in an unexpected comeback. Goode's father is a definite oddball who lives enclosed in a London house and seemingly favors playing chess with himself to talking to his son.The main character is a penniless virtually parentless youth drifting through an alien social system. Goode plays him featurelessly really a nondescript motor for the other characters. Ben Whishaw steals all of his scenes as the gay son. The daughter could definitely have been portrayed more warily. The actress Hayley Atwell makes the most of her I suppose but why would she marry the revolting and unbearable suitor instead of Goode?I am sure that the reason this film is not very effective at all is because so much background and source material is condensed and maybe sacrificed into such a shorter running time. But why are so many other adaptations effective in spite of this factor?".

	schema:reviewBody "I suspect that doing justice to the movie Brideshead Revisited without having read Evelyn Waugh's book is just about as impossible as enjoying that first taste of grouse that has been hanging to ripen longer than we'd like to know. I haven't read the book and while I have the television series on DVD I've never gotten around to watching it. Still I enjoy watching movies and reading critical opinions of great literature...it's so much less demanding than reading the originals. For my money the movie of Brideshead Revisited is a gallant and conscientious...not failure exactly but at least a strangely uninvolving beautifully mounted melodrama set amongst the tiresomely wealthy and privileged English very upper class. The failure in the movie in my opinion was the failure to establish just how obsessed Charles Ryder Matthew Goode became with the building that was Brideshead and then the life of beauty and casual privileged style that it represented. Without that obsession how else to explain a continuing friendly sexual relationship with Sebastian Flyte Ben Whishaw a scrawny drunken self pitying twig from the Marchmain family tree and a continuing friendly sexual relationship with the twig's cool sister Julia Flyte Hayley Atwell a woman whom many would consider without the prospects of a fortune attached to her not worth the effort. Whishaw and Atwell did fine work but physically for me lacked the attractiveness and charisma that might have made them interesting even if they had been a banker's assistant and a tea room waitress. That leaves us with Lady Marchmain with Emma Thompson and with Lady Marchmain's fearful brand of righteous piety. Thompson gives a performance that justifies the movie. Lady Marchmain is a woman totally secure in her position and in her Catholic faith. That she is ruining the lives of her children is not something she is aware of she is saving their souls by saving their faith for them. Her certitude and gimlet faith would give respectability to an Inquisition judge or a sweating television evangelist. Yet in this movie the contest between Lady Marchmain's rigid faith and Charles Ryder's atheism is not much more than mildly interesting. There's just not enough time in my opinion to dwell on this essential fact of life in Brideshead Revisited. What time there is however helps make sense of the movie because of Emma Thompson's wonderful performance. I left Brideshead Revisited still clutching my love of Britain exemplified by its history by Masterpiece Theatre by Inspector Morse and by those wonderfully made umbrellas that cost a small fortune to buy in London. My encounter with Charles Ryder who in my view is essentially an opportunist left mixed feelings. My encounter with the Marchmain clan left me impatient and a little contemptuous. Waugh is supposed to have said that he doubted if six Americans could understand Brideshead Revisited. He just may be right. I think the movie is worth seeing because it's such a serious effort. Trying to cram Waugh's point of view into little more than two hours was probably too ambitious. However I left the theater determined to read the book.".

It's shallow and squalid because Waugh subtitled his book 'The Sacred And Profane Memories Of Captain Charles Ryder' but this movie gives us only the Profane ones yet it descends further as it misapprehends and profanes even Ryder's Profane recollections while giving what its makers probably liked to imagine was a fitting rude digital gesture towards Catholicism and Catholics. This misbegotten twisted movie utterly lacks depth sensibility and believable characterizations it desecrates Waugh's book and its profound theme. Its cast are not to be blamed for their having been given such thin gruel to have to try to chew on.Finally this execrable production comes nowhere near to the superlative 1981 TV miniseries which is arguably the finest film adaptation not just of Waugh's novel but of any book.".

	onyx:emotionText "Saucershallow and squalid 2008 production misdirected by Julian Jarrold of 'Brideshead Revisited.' It's shallow and squalid because Waugh subtitled his book 'The Sacred And Profane Memories Of Captain Charles Ryder' but this movie gives us only the Profane ones yet it descends further as it misapprehends and profanes even Ryder's Profane recollections while giving what its makers probably liked to imagine was a fitting rude digital gesture towards Catholicism and Catholics. This misbegotten twisted movie utterly lacks depth sensibility and believable characterizations it desecrates Waugh's book and its profound theme. Its cast are not to be blamed for their having been given such thin gruel to have to try to chew on.Finally this execrable production comes nowhere near to the superlative 1981 TV miniseries which is arguably the finest film adaptation not just of Waugh's novel but of any book.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was extremely disappointed with this film. It does not deserve to carry the same name as the novel by Evelyn Waugh!As an avid reader of the book  and as someone who has seen the 1981 television series countless times  I was very much looking forward to a cinematic take on the story. I thought the opportunity would allow the director to make the most of costumes sets and characters. And this is true in the film. I do not blame actors set designers or indeed the production team in general for any of the catastrophic mistakes in this production  I think they have all done a laudable job within their domains. In fact I would go as far as to say that the casting team in this film remedied one of the very few misgivings about the television production with a more suitable choice for the character of Antony Blanche. But despite such good choices it is sad that the production team and the actors were given a script that inexcusably butchered Waugh's storyline to begin with.The beautifully nuanced relationship between Charles and Sebastian from the book and television series is here transformed into a bizarre utilitarian and senseless association. The original story captured my imagination years before the movie due to parallels between the storyline and a relationship of my own at a very similar age to that of Charles and Sebastian at the beginning of the novel. I have never come across any other book that captures so compellingly the multilayered feelings bonds attractions and nature of this kind of relationship. The book contains multiple insinuations that refer to a deeply romantic attachment between these two characters. The attraction is mutual emotional and physical. The book's use of language allows for an interpretation of their love as a platonic bond or as an increasingly sexual relationship depending on the willingness of the reader to dwell on the analogical passages within the story. Waugh's delivery of a love story between two men is in tune with the historical time of the events  a time in which homosexuality was illegal in the United Kingdom. It is the story of a love that dare not speak its name to quote Alfred Douglas. In the film the nuances are completely thrown out of the window. Sebastian is now a needy weak character. Charles is a gold digger mesmerised by Sebastian's wealth and family but never really attracted or attached to him as a person. The captivating love story that Waugh develops in multiple stages and locations Brideshead Oxford Venice etc is all reduced in the movie to a pathetic and uninspired kiss that Sebastian steals from Charles after a drunken evening. The inclusion of Julia in the trip to Venice is absurd! In the novel this is where the relationship between Charles and Sebastian reaches maturity with Byronian echoes. All in all the film never gets close to telling the story of Charles and Sebastian. It destroys the characters twists the narrative and unforgivably uses the name Brideshead Revisited to tell a different story. The scriptwriters should be ashamed of themselves!".

Obviously the movie doesn't lack ironical humor when the king asks to a courtier I hope it's not a pun and the courtier replies no Sir it's a play on words.

	schema:reviewBody "This reminds me a lot of Dangerous Liaisons 1988 and Valmont 1989 in its cynicism and sharp wit. Set in France during the same time period the eve of the French Revolutionthat's the eighteenth century reviewers Ridicule concentrates not so much on sexual intrigues although there is plenty of that but on cynical wit as though in homage to Voltaire France's master of satire whose spirit is suffused throughout.First a warning. Don't let the rather gross crudity of the opening scene mislead you. That is meant merely as satire not as a presaging of further crudities to come. It is also meant as a kind of cinematic joke since there is no comparable female nudity in the entire film. Indeed there is no comparable shall we say expression anywhere in legitimate filmdom that I am aware of. So let it pass or close your eyes.Charles Berling stars as Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy a country engineer who comes to Versailles to get financial backing to drain a swamp to save the peasants who are dying of mosquitoborne disease. Peasants feed aristocrats as well as mosquitos. He discovers very quickly that a way to an audience with Louis XVI is through gaining a reputation as a clever courtier. Guided by M. Bellegarde Jean Rochefort a retired courtier himself Ponceludon quickly picks up the games of wit and ridicule that reign at court. His quick and clever mind and youthful good looks gain the attention of the king's mistress Madame de Blayac Fanny Ardant who demonstrates how access to the king can come through her bedroom. Ponceludon is sincere only in his desire to drain the swamp and so readily allows himself to become another of Blayac's lovers in exchange for a chance to present his program to Louis XVI.At the same time he meets Bellegarde's daughter Mathide Judith Godrche an idealistic beauty with a scientific bent who is betrothed to a dying old man of wealth and position. They fall in love but their differing agendas keep them apart.What makes this film such a delight is the delicious way it satirizes the decadent court of Louis XVI. The dramatic irony is superb and absolute in the sense that at no time does director Patrice Leconte give even the slightest hint that any of the byzantine sycophants at court are aware that Danton and the Terror await them. Throw in the impending Industrial and scientific Revolution symbolized in the form of Ponceludon and Mathide and the ancien rgime with its antiquated feudal titles and corrupt privilege is seen for what it was a parasitic anachronism ripe to rot for destruction.The sets the direction and especially the acting are excellent. Veteran Rochefort is particularly good in a part that depends on a directive and expressive face amid the whispers at court. Berling is smooth and believable as a man with a noble mission adroit at repartee love and dueling a modest and earnest hero.Godrche is good but seems a little restrained here. She is an impossibly healthy handsome beauty no man could resist. I first saw her as a 17yearold in The Disenchanted 1990 where her adolescent charm was carefully and craftily displayed by director Benot Jacquot. Here Leconte concentrates on her strength of character.Fanny Ardant's Madame de Blayac is a Machiavellian mistress of love's duplicity very much like the Marquise de Merteuil from Dangerous Liaisons and Valmont. Her performance compares favorably with that of Glenn Close and Annette Bening respectively although there is an earthy quality to Ardant that seems most realistic. Her character is also more vulnerable.The sets are sumptuous without being artificially showy. The gray hightopped wigs and the beakednosed masks at ball are charming and along with the gilded attire the caked makeup etc. somehow suggest the true state of costume and personal hygiene circa 1784 reminding me that in those days people did not generally wear underpants or take showers.Some bon motsThe soul of wit is to know one's place.When asked by the king to say something witty about the king himself Ponceludon returns The king is not a subject. The king asks if this is not a lowly pun but is assured that it is a play on words.When Blayac discerns that Ponceludon is not entirely smitten with her she responds Learn to hide your insincerity so that I may yield without dishonor.The film closes with a scene in England on a cliff overlooking the English channel. Bellegarde and another reflect on the changes after the revolution Wit was the very air we breathed. Now the bloated rhetoric of Danton rules in place of wit. Bellegarde's hat is blown off by the wind. His companion remarks Better your hat than your head.By the way the subtitles and this is usually not the case are excellent inventive and faithful enough while comfortably brief to have been done by a professional translator instead of by someone handy who is passably bilingual.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Ponceludon is sincere only in his desire to drain the swamp and so readily allows himself to become another of Blayac's lovers in exchange for a chance to present his program to Louis XVI.At the same time he meets Bellegarde's daughter Mathide Judith Godrche an idealistic beauty with a scientific bent who is betrothed to a dying old man of wealth and position. They fall in love but their differing agendas keep them apart.What makes this film such a delight is the delicious way it satirizes the decadent court of Louis XVI. The dramatic irony is superb and absolute in the sense that at no time does director Patrice Leconte give even the slightest hint that any of the byzantine sycophants at court are aware that Danton and the Terror await them. Throw in the impending Industrial and scientific Revolution symbolized in the form of Ponceludon and Mathide and the ancien rgime with its antiquated feudal titles and corrupt privilege is seen for what it was a parasitic anachronism ripe to rot for destruction.The sets the direction and especially the acting are excellent. Veteran Rochefort is particularly good in a part that depends on a directive and expressive face amid the whispers at court. Berling is smooth and believable as a man with a noble mission adroit at repartee love and dueling a modest and earnest hero.Godrche is good but seems a little restrained here. She is an impossibly healthy handsome beauty no man could resist. I first saw her as a 17yearold in The Disenchanted 1990 where her adolescent charm was carefully and craftily displayed by director Benot Jacquot. Here Leconte concentrates on her strength of character.Fanny Ardant's Madame de Blayac is a Machiavellian mistress of love's duplicity very much like the Marquise de Merteuil from Dangerous Liaisons and Valmont. Her performance compares favorably with that of Glenn Close and Annette Bening respectively although there is an earthy quality to Ardant that seems most realistic. Her character is also more vulnerable.The sets are sumptuous without being artificially showy. The gray hightopped wigs and the beakednosed masks at ball are charming and along with the gilded attire the caked makeup etc. somehow suggest the true state of costume and personal hygiene circa 1784 reminding me that in those days people did not generally wear underpants or take showers.Some bon motsThe soul of wit is to know one's place.When asked by the king to say something witty about the king himself Ponceludon returns The king is not a subject. The king asks if this is not a lowly pun but is assured that it is a play on words.When Blayac discerns that Ponceludon is not entirely smitten with her she responds Learn to hide your insincerity so that I may yield without dishonor.The film closes with a scene in England on a cliff overlooking the English channel. Bellegarde and another reflect on the changes after the revolution Wit was the very air we breathed. Now the bloated rhetoric of Danton rules in place of wit. Bellegarde's hat is blown off by the wind. His companion remarks Better your hat than your head.By the way the subtitles and this is usually not the case are excellent inventive and faithful enough while comfortably brief to have been done by a professional translator instead of by someone handy who is passably bilingual.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

No review was specific as to answering my questions so my husband and I watched it alone. Here is what that one scene is A rather graphic scene zoomed in and lasting a couple of seconds of a nobleman's genitalia as he is urinating on an aged disabled nobleman who had ridiculed him some 30 years earlier. Perhaps the outrage shock and disgust felt by these male reviewers was due to the fact that instead of the typical female nudity we see everywhere in movies for once we saw graphic male nudity. Who would've thought men to be so prudish? Now before all you men out there attempt to perform your own version of witty repartee' and strike back at these comments allow me to add that yes while this one scene was graphic and shocking that it was not done for the sake of shock but rather to show what lengths people in positions of power went to in order to protect their own positions and sabotage that of others ranging from ridicule and humiliation to violence and death. While I do not condone gratuitous nudity for the sake of pornography I do feel this one scene accurately sets the tone of the tale and has meaning in it's ending.For some time I could not understand how the plight of so many French citizens could be so desperate and full of starvation and death while the wealthy did not suffer the same fate and why nobody did anything to change this. If the portrayal of those in positions of power and wealth in this movie was depicted accurately it is easy to understand how a once great country failed it's citizens when power and choice was held by those who were selfish lazy and possibly worse  silly. King Louis XVI has been written to be by many accounts a man not able to rule passive indifferent to those around him near and far and unable to repair the damage done by his predecessors especially King Louis XIV when also abandonment of reason and over indulgence were the rule of the day.Along with the beautiful countryside architecture and decor costumes couldn't they give poor Mathilde more than two dresses to wear during the entire film? and great depiction of human nature and our inherent weaknesses this movie was very entertaining and for me much more enjoyable than ValmontDangerous Liaisons to which it has been compared.

Charles Berling's performance as Ponceledon the rustic nobleman trying to bring his petition to drain the diseaseinfested swamps of his region before the King of France is in a word superb... Fanny Ardant is also a wellcast Madame de Blayac the dexterously duplicitous countess who appears disposed towards aiding Ponceledon in his suit.  Ridicule is a genuinely delightful comedy.

Rhythm is fast and the movie is served by a wonderful cast many actors are among the best stage actors in France notably main character Charles Berling and Bernard Gireaudeau's abbe de Villecourt. Jean Rochefort's supporting performance is outstanding as is the impersonation of a Versailles court's bird of prey by Fanny Ardant. All in all i.m.h.o. one of the best French movies of the 90s.";

	schema:reviewBody "If life in high school was set in the 18th century French court we would have Ridicule a movie about Gregoire Ponceludon Charles Berling who realizes that the best way to drain the swamps on his estate is not to ingratiate himself with the courtiers but to insult them with one witticism after the other. Wit a friend the Marquis de Bellegarde Jean Rochefort tells young Ponceludon opens all doors and can win King Louis XVI's favor and once you have the king's favor he will give you whatever you want. Indeed one comes away with the impression that the king's generosity towards the witty is so boundless that he seems oblivious to the reality that he is spending money that the state does not have. Only the finance minister knows how bad things are and he grumbles to Ponceludon that perhaps he could convince the king to stop spending so much money on his courtiers for the dignity of France. Well as far as Louis XVI Urbain Cancelier is concerned dignity can go to hell.Like all high schools the French court is artificial cruel witty and a haven for endless sex. The courtiers subjected to ridicule are weak insecure and tend articulate themselves rather badly. They could be popular courtiers who have misspoken thereby providing an ambitious courtier with the opportunity to ridicule them. The women don't believe in love. They will have sex with any man who happens to be the most popular at any given time. When Abbe de Vilecourt Bernard Giraudeau falls into disfavor Madame de Blayac Fanny Ardant turns to Ponceludon. She then finds another lover when Ponceludon inadvertently ridicules her.Now all of this may seem very predictable unless you were home schooled during your high school years but it is entertaining most of the time in wicked sort of way. We enjoy hearing the witticism we enjoy even more seeing people insulted especially when it is the vile de Vilecourt. But this film also has a serious and a profound side as well. On being ridiculed Ponceludon condemns the world of the courtier as a farce. It is not a witty remark. But Madame de Blayac realizes he is right. She realizes that she has been duped because all her life was wasted on an endless struggle trying to be popular pretty and charming. A life without love and indeed without meaning. It was not too late for Ponceludon because he was still young and had only stayed in court for a few months. But it was too late for Madame de Blayac because she had nothing else apart from that pointless life. Perhaps that explains her tears when in her moment of victory Ponceludon leaves the court for good and the dancing resumes.I could go on about the film. At times it is boring but on the whole director Patrice LeConte does an excellent job in maintaining our interest. The performances are good too especially the one given by Fanny Ardant. Finally the film has a brilliant baroque score which creates the atmosphere of a ruthless and uncompromising court. The sets and costumes are beautiful too but what is decisive in films like these is excellent direction a good screenplay and brilliant performances this film has all three.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ridicule deals with the consequences of a monarch or ruler running his empire according to his own personal interests rather than concern for the greater good of the people. There were also a couple of underlying themes such as the distribution of social classes overall and the ignorance of the upper classes as well as the human suffering that comes as a result of arrogance ego and social status. A romantic conflict was a significant part of the story dealing with the pain and guilt that someone may feel from seducing one person for manipulative purposes and actually being in love with a different person. The story is of a man named Ponceludon de Malavoy who needs to drain a mosquito and disease infested swamp but he needs King Louis XVI's help to do it. He travels to Versailles but finds that he needs to have the sharpest of all wits in order for the king to recognize his problem at all. He finds himself in a society driven almost exclusively by the measure of each person's wit or hewmah' as they heard it was called in English and the seriousness of Ponceludon's plight was second to this point if it is noticed at all.  It was more important to King Louis XVI to be entertained than it was to drain a swamp that was causing sickness and death even among children.  One scene in particular was very effective in demonstrating the ignorance of the upper class. There was a boy named Paul who was a deafmute and seen as a halfwit' by the upper class people. Obviously in this society this is the last thing that anyone wants to be. He is exiled from the kingdom sent to live with other halfwits' only to return later with several other deafmutes after having learned to communicate using sign language. They are introduced to the upper class members who are skeptical about the worth of the halfwits' lives. When they see that these kids are able to communicate they are noticeably impressed. They even give them a standing applaud when one of them manages to make a play on signs.'  They see that these kids are not only intelligent enough to communicate but can even be witty using sign language and this completely changes their view. They had always seen people like Paul as less important simply because they are not able to speak or hear which is clearly a symptom of classical ignorance.Ridicule is a period film and it was very effective in illustrating the differences between elements of society today and of the society of 1793. Obviously honesty is very highly valued today. A recent survey showed that honesty is the third thing that women truly desire in a relationship preceded by affection at No.1 and conversation at No.2. The same survey showed sex to be Number one on men's importance list and this completes one of the sharpest contrasts seen in Ridicule. Ponceludon de Malavoy the man seeking to have his swamp drained is engaging in a sexual relationship with Marquis de Bellegarde an attractive older woman of much higher social status !!. When he informs her of his lack of emotional feelings for her she responds in a way that in my opinion is exactly the opposite of the way a woman today would respond by literally telling him to lie to her. She tells him Learn to hide your insincerity so that I can yield without dishonor.' Aside from the fact that this shows that she would rather be bedded than loved at least by Ponceludon it also enhances the drama caused by his love for someone else and his obvious feelings of guilt about sleeping with another woman. Ponceludon does not love her but knows that she is capable of improving his chances of getting help from the king.Ponceludon despite having sexual relations with Marquis de Bellegarde the older upper class woman is in love with a simpler poorer woman named Mathilde. She develops very strong feelings for him as well but she is engaged to a very old very rich man. She is determined to remain engaged to him even though he is currently married to another woman so that he may finance her scuba diving interests. The fact that Ponceludon and Mathilde are both engaged in strikingly similar manipulative relationships makes their love for each other even more effective. There were dancing scenes later in the film where everyone wears masks and huge elaborate wigs which demonstrated a dire need to be accepted. The fact that all of the wigs and masks worn in this scene were strikingly similar suggested that these people desired to be as much like everyone else as possible and that individuality is discouraged. The men wore white powder on their faces blush on their cheeks and even distinct amounts of lipstick. Aside from being another way of illustrating conformity it also poses a huge difference between then and now. In today's society men who wear that much makeup are most often the ones who are actually trying NOT to fit in with the general population.One other thing that is worth mentioning is the fact that the exact words or topics spoken in the film are far less important than the way that they are said. Body language as well as things like costuming and makeup are far more important than the exact subjects that were spoken of. This was most effectively communicated to the audience by the fact that there were a few scenes where the French conversation was not subtitled. This forced the audience particularly the English speaking audience to focus more on the way the characters were speaking to each other rather than what exactly they were saying. This is very unusual but is also noteworthy because it successfully furthers the meaning delivered by the film.".

	schema:headline " Unique story but not very involving";
	schema:reviewBody "While I did admire many things about this French film I came away thinking that it was strangely uninvolving. Story is about a landowner who wants to start a project in his precinct where the local swamps and canals would be drained so that they can keep the mosquito population down because many people are getting sick and dying. Ponceludon Charles Berling heads to Versailles to see Louis XVI and ask him for a grant to pay for the project but Louis XVI is only interested in people with very sharp wit. The society in that area thrives on wit as much as money has value. An older man named Bellegarde Jean Rochefort takes him under his wing and advises him on how to use wit. Much to everyone's surprise Ponceludon is very good with wit and he gets to socialize with those near Louis XVI. Ponceludon falls in love with Bellegarde's daughter Mathilde Judith Godreche who is young and pretty and bosomy and is conducting research with a diving suit. Ponceludon seduces Madame de Blayac Fanny Ardant who knows his intentions but she uses him as well. Film is directed by Patrice Leconte who has always shown great sets and locations and this is a very impressive looking film. The performances are top notch and Rochefort seems born to play these types of roles. The best shot in the film comes near the end with Ardant who has been spurned by her lover even though he killed her previous suitor in a duel. The look of hurt and embarrassment on her face was the strongest in the film. Ardant despite her age is still easily one of the most beautiful women in the world. She exudes tremendous sexiness and the scene where she plays footsy under the table is a very sexy scene. But the film maintains its distance emotionally and it really doesn't allow the viewer to gather up any connection with it. One of the plot lines that should have had more impact is the romance between Berling and Godreche. Her breasts are practically falling out of her dress and he usually just stands there and tells her to be careful with her research. The romance between them just doesn't take off. It's not a bad film in fact its pretty interesting but when its over you get the feeling that this film should have roped its viewers in better emotionally. All the ingredients are there. Good director excellent actors great locations and sets but something was lacking in the way the story was told.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to says whoever lived by the word would perish by the word' but among the many lessons Patrice Leconte's Ridicule taught me is that pun is regarded as the death of wit.WIT ELUDES US SOMETIMES In French there are two kinds of wit the repartee and the 'stairs' wit. One is the ability to come up with the right witty remark as selfdefense while the other always comes to mind when we're 'going down the stairs' and then the flash of wit blinds us damn that's what I should have said. The thrilling aspect of Ridicule is that it turns a rather benign theme into a lifeanddeath situation when the hero's mission depends on his wit and being ridiculed would be his failure.PEASANTS NOT ONLY FEED MOSQUITOES BUT ARISTOCRATS The tagline of Patrice Leconte's masterpiece magnificently contradicts a famous French saying by stating that 'Ridicule can kill' literally and symbolically. Literally because some remarks can knock down any person and follow him the rest of his life while symbolically it can make a social status collapse and undermine the realization of subsequent projects no matter how noble and thoughtful they are. And the project in Ridicule belongs to a rural aristocrat Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy more than a gifted engineer a decent man who cares for peasants victims of mosquitoesinfested swamps in his region the Dombes. Ponceludon needs money to drain the swamps a costly project that only the King fond on scientific innovations can fund. The peasants' lives depend on Gregoire's ability to make his place in Versailles in the King's Court such a morally corrupted words that the stinks of the swamps seem more breathable.I NEVER LIVED IT DOWN To understand the violent nature inherent to this world where the word can be mightier than the sword the film opens with quite a spectacular scene. A man comes to visit an elderly dying aristocrat Mr. de Bleyac confined in a chair and then urinates on him a late reply to a humiliating 'bon mot' uttered in the past. Ridicule is indeed the worst curse that can ever strike an aristocrat in Versailles.

The film is set in 1783 6 years before French Revolution when the liberal ideas of Voltaire and Montesquieu were on march it's ironic that the very minds who were praising them couldn't see their own ends coming.

Gregoire embodies this new generation and it's not a hazard that he's befriended by Bellegarde the doctor who doesn't just admire the different uses of wit quips wordplays retorts paradoxes but also honesty and decency. He plays a central role in the film as he both teaches Gregoire and the viewers about the Courts' etiquette the do's and don'ts like never laughing to one's own joke and never making puns. Bellegarde's moralilty affected the education of his own daughter the beautiful Mathilde Judith Godreche a freespirited woman fond of scientific experimentations and avoiding by any means the corruption of Versailles court. She's the total opposite of Mme de Bleyac and the mirror of Ponceludon's corrupting process.WE'RE JUDGED BY THE COMPANY WE KEEP A MISJUDGEMENT JUDAS KEPT EXCELLENT COMPANY Under the mentorship of Bellegarde Ponceludon reveals himself a most witty mind and an excellent match to the wittiest of all L'Abb de Villecourt a corrupted abbot and protg of Madame de Bleyac Bernard Gireaudeau in a scenestealing performance. Beware of the abbot warns Bellegarde He's a snake. He watches in silence. When he speaks it's too late. Indeed an insult can take you at anytime and sometimes in the field of verbal sparring the best defense is still the attack. Ridicule on that level provides an abundance of verbal confrontations reaching their pinnacle during a magnificent 'tournament of wit' meant to ridicule Ponceludon. One might lose a battle but not the war especially if he still has the last word.THE SOUL OF WIT IS TO KNOW ONE'S PLACE And this is only one of the layers that contribute to the film's greatness with an extraordinary respect for the intelligence's viewer Ridicule never takes its wit for granted but uses it to speak much more truthful statements about the way one conducts his own life. We can be our own enemies as sometimes a beautiful moment in the sun can turn into a stormy disaster simply with one unfortunate word. Any word said can be hold against its author and some will learn this lesson the hard way.VOLTAIRE WOULD HAVE WEPT The film provides other unforgettable moments deaf people proving that even the language of hands can make witty gestures a suspenseful duel and a splendid climax. To Historical movie buffs and to French Language lovers Ridicule is a mustsee a modern classic that deserved the Best Film Csar in 1996 and is so magnificently written that the fact that it didn't win a Cesar for Best Screenplay sadly fits the title.".

	onyx:emotionText "I wanted to says whoever lived by the word would perish by the word' but among the many lessons Patrice Leconte's Ridicule taught me is that pun is regarded as the death of wit.WIT ELUDES US SOMETIMES In French there are two kinds of wit the repartee and the 'stairs' wit. One is the ability to come up with the right witty remark as selfdefense while the other always comes to mind when we're 'going down the stairs' and then the flash of wit blinds us damn that's what I should have said. The thrilling aspect of Ridicule is that it turns a rather benign theme into a lifeanddeath situation when the hero's mission depends on his wit and being ridiculed would be his failure.PEASANTS NOT ONLY FEED MOSQUITOES BUT ARISTOCRATS The tagline of Patrice Leconte's masterpiece magnificently contradicts a famous French saying by stating that 'Ridicule can kill' literally and symbolically. Literally because some remarks can knock down any person and follow him the rest of his life while symbolically it can make a social status collapse and undermine the realization of subsequent projects no matter how noble and thoughtful they are. And the project in Ridicule belongs to a rural aristocrat Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy more than a gifted engineer a decent man who cares for peasants victims of mosquitoesinfested swamps in his region the Dombes. Ponceludon needs money to drain the swamps a costly project that only the King fond on scientific innovations can fund. The peasants' lives depend on Gregoire's ability to make his place in Versailles in the King's Court such a morally corrupted words that the stinks of the swamps seem more breathable.I NEVER LIVED IT DOWN To understand the violent nature inherent to this world where the word can be mightier than the sword the film opens with quite a spectacular scene. A man comes to visit an elderly dying aristocrat Mr. de Bleyac confined in a chair and then urinates on him a late reply to a humiliating 'bon mot' uttered in the past. Ridicule is indeed the worst curse that can ever strike an aristocrat in Versailles. Bleyac happened to be Ponceludon's contact in Versailles You'll recognize him by his widow. said the Marquis de Bellegarde Jean Rochefort a doctor and eternal admirer and not bad practicer of wit and humor and the widow is Fanny Ardant magnificent as ever as Madame de Bleyac the powerful woman who can use her wits and charms to make any social ascension possible or not.

Splendid costumes gorgeous Versaillais architecture and painting and a pretty historically accurate portrayal of the absurdity and the confusion playing out at the Versailles court on the eve of the Revolution on the one hand they will all maintain that they are devout Catholics on the other hand they court libertine philosophers and more or less openly engage in grotesquely immoraloften sexually chargedwar games of wit. The premise is interesting the acting is grand and the atmosphere is terrific.Where the movie loses points is in its philosophical moralizing. The film does not make it a point to distinguish the character of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from that of their courtiers. Although the film does not actually portray them doing anything they would not actually have done they were indeed deeply ingrained into the life of their court by not holding them out the film does give us the impression that they were every bit as trashy and apathetic as the courtiers in fact they were most certainly not and that they deserved their ultimate lot in the French Revolution and any historian even slightly to the right of Karl Marx agrees that they most certainly did not.Near the end of the film the protagonist the Marquis de Malavoy countryside aristocrat who has learned the court games simply in an attempt to petition Louis XVI for help with his land and for his feudal tenants castigates the courtiers for their hypocrisy. He cites their invocation of Voltaire a man filled with compassion! as evidence. But anyone who knows anything about Voltaire knows that he was quite the snob himself.Moreover the ending which implies that Malavoy the compassionate aristocrat now lives well in Revolutionary France gives the false impression that it was his openness to liberalism that had permitted him to stay rather than go into exile. In actuality it was precisely in places such as Malavoy's holdings where feudal ties were strongest and aristocrats remained landed rather than absentee that resistance to the revolution was also the strongestand most tragic. Anyone ever hear of a place called Vende? The people there stood in defense of their patriarchs their Church and the House of Bourbonand hundreds of thousands paid the ultimate price for not wanting to recognize a Parisian regime they regarded as criminal as having the right to unilaterally redo the physiognomy of their sociopolitical landscape.And speaking of physiognomy let me just comment on the... ugly faces. I don't know whether it's the makeup but Fanny Ardent looks as though her face might kill as humiliatingly as ridicule does. The court of Versailles must have been teaming with fresh flesh and I'm not at all convinced a priest would break his vow of celibacy for the likes of her. And My bedroom is known to lead to the throne room? Uh... yeah THAT line really makes up in charm what she lacks in looks. Uhhuh. And Judith Godrche who is normally quite lovely is done up just horribly... her face and hairdo are so tomboyish that it's a wonder she survives at a place like Versailles. And while the makeup on the men may be historically accurate it is not applied in a very charismatic fashion as though the filmmakers were trying to give us something to laugh at.The ambiance is good but the script is disappointing and nauseating. I think one can do better for a quiet evening alone.".

We're agreed the setup was rotten what else is there to say ? Capitalism continues though its frivolous depravity is not quite so public. The best review comes from a Frenchman from Paris who points out that in many ways the movie is just not historically correct. Somebody also writes that the connection between mosquitos and malaria was not discovered until 50 years later. It was worth seeing for the general ambiance and the fancy clothes just but it'll be a long time before I watch it again. A lot of effort clearly went into it.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the eyepopping opening sequence one could misinterpret Ridicule as a joke and maybe even a satire thankfully that's not the case. The opening scene has a tone that differs from the film itself to catch our eye or to draw our interests in a particular direction as long as you keep your head above the spice of two minute experience you will adjust to the rest of the film with ease.The lack of focus and direction is the problem with the first half of Ridicule. The film has trouble identifying its plot and characters to the audience not artistically introducing them or having significant meaning underneath the miseenscene but in the simpler ways of tell the story itself to the viewer. The jumbled editing mixed with the fast pace directing leaves the viewer in ambiguous territory. Ridicule does redeem itself in its second half by continuing to grow and play with its characters. The characters are well penned as are the ideas of the story. To comprehend the absurdity of the film's context is to understand French culture at the time Ridicule takes place and the upper class's failure to conjure up a meaning of life other than trying to defame other people of stature. I enjoyed Ridicule and respect it more as I think back on everything that went into making the film. The sets and costumes fit the time well it's a pleasant film to look at and the acting though nothing sterling meets the requirements of the script. Take your time have patience and Ridicule could be a respectable film. Rating 7Grade B".

Taking place at a restaurant in which Albert and Georgina Spica expertly played by Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren dine day in day out always accompanied by Spica's entourage of yesmen among them a young Tim Roth Albert indulges in the excesses of food and berates everyone around him including his mutely suffering wife.The first scene  as a matter of fact  establishes the entire mood of the film. Albert Spica is seen outrageously humiliating a naked man outside the restaurant as the overwhelming stench of decay and the presence of wild dogs linger on. Employees from the restaurant shortly come and hose the man from the excrement he has been slathered in. What it is saying is we are entering a world of moral and spiritual decay in which Those In Power abuse their positions to the extreme as the observers only stand by and go on with their business.These bystanders are the people who work at the restaurant. Among them is the Cook played by Richard Bohringer who faithfully serves Spica and his yesmen meal after meal and makes no opinion as they loudly banter about the difference between this dish and that dish  essentially saying nothing worthwhile  while all the time Georgina silently eats on almost like a nonentity. That is until she notices a quiet intellectuallooking man reading a book. This man is Michael the Lover played by Alan Howard a man who does not talk but oozes intelligence. And it's this element which attracts Georgina's eye... and then more.It's clear where Peter Greenaway is going to take us the viewer. The scenes involving the urgent dangerous lovemaking between Michael and Georgina are unspeakably intense even in later scenes when they meet in the kitchen among the everpresent cooks and are getting more comfortable with themselves. Greenway's Spica becomes so completely menacing his presence overflows the screen. He commits acts of intolerable cruelty against anyone who stands in his way  he is the Terror during the French Revolution the Dictator from every country who has had one who will torture those who give of even a slight resistance. And once Georgina's and Michael's clandestine affair is brought to light needless to say all hell breaks loose and Greenway sets the stage for his horrific stomachturning denouement.In Georgina Helen Mirren has created a character that is deeply suffering infinitely patient... and that makes her the more dangerous. That she has to go through so much pain and humiliation to make a 180 degree turn to cold ruthless avenger makes her the ultimate heroine. Her foil to Albert  an essentially onenote role  also serves his undoing. Alan Howard communicates so much as well in his almost silent role and in a revelatory note I'll say this their nude scene is one that is rife in sensuality and proves that one doesn't need Hollywood hardbodies to make an erotic scene work.THE COOK THE THIEF HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER is not a movie for all tastes  pun intended. However it's one of the most avantgarde intelligent stories that demands to be seen numerous times. I admire the lavish scenery Greenaway created for each area of the restaurant because it gives this extremely modern film a Renaissance feel and elevates its inherent symbolism. Grotesque but beautiful at the same time it has a powerful cinematic language that has a style all its own.".

Helen Mirren's Georgina is a truly heartwrenching character especially in the face of Gambon's portrayal of Albert Spica a poor excuse for a human being and one of cinema's cruelest villains. The cook and lover are merely catalysts serving to instigate the final act that is the undoing of Albert's overreaching tyranny.I suppose the antiThatcher sentiment is highly applicable to this film but since I am not a British citizen I feel that I cannot comment on this. However I think the film's allegory can also be applied to other scenarios where a brutish figure uses violence and exploitation as a way to control others whose primary fault is only residing in the same physicalsociallegal domain as the brute.In short a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "One can probably assume from the film 'The Cook the thief his wife and her lover' that director Peter Greenaway has a rather warped view of humanity he is nihilistic about society's future abhorrent of Thatcher's regime and furiously condescending of the entrepreneurial upper classes and their exploitation of the workers. This anger manifests itself in the shocking scenes of violence and depravity contained in the film which earned the film an X certificate back in 1989 and surprisingly resulted in the film reaching a larger audience than anyone anticipated the film grossed over 7 million in the USA and proved that there is more weight to the old adage 'no publicity is bad publicity' than one might expect. However it should not be forgotten that the film received almost unanimously euphoric reviews from film critics or at least from those that didn't flee from the cinema and is indeed one of the most brilliant visceral imaginative and unique pieces of cinema. It's not for all tastes but those who can stomach it will be rewarded with a slice of delectable cinematic cuisine of the highest order.The film's central locale is 'Le Hollondais' a restaurant of the most impeccable quality in every aspect. Night after night the restaurant is attended not only by an assortment of wealthy and decadent noveau riche but also by lowlevel gangster Albert Spica Michael Gambon accompanied by his tormented wife Georgina Helen Mirren and a consortium of pimps hitmen and psychopaths. Each evening Albert treats the dining area of the restaurant like his court spewing out vile speeches of ignorance and bigotry making unqualified criticisms of the cuisine and assaulting any of the other diners if they object to his hoglike behaviour. The chef Richard Bohringer despises Albert but presents a faade of obedience and servitude to avoid any maltreatment from Albert and his cronies much like the other dining guests who exhibit remarkable patience with the revolting Albert. Georgina seems resigned to marital martyrdom but also sees the ridiculousness of Albert's arrogance and pomposity though she rarely contradicts him he hits her with the exquisitely calligraphic menu when she does. However one night her eyes meet Michael's Alan Howard an intellectual who sits quietly in the corner of the restaurant delicately eating his meal whilst engrossed in his book seemingly oblivious to Albert's loud displays of crudeness. Lightning proverbially strikes and with little hesitation the two make for the Ladies toilet where they engage in a passionate tryst in one of the cubicles. And thus the cycle begins each night Albert continues his rants and consumption of excessive amounts of food whilst the cook assists Georgina in finding hiding places for her and Michael to make love. However the naturally distrustful Albert soon realises he is a cuckold and orders that lover be killed by having each page of his book thrust down his throat with a sharp spindle. Georgina however is able to turn the tables on Albert which leads to the films shocking denouement where the thief receives his just desserts in a manner best described as poetic justice.So what is the film about? Is it a darkly humorous political satire on our materialistic times? Is it exploitative pornography coupled with scenes of unnecessary brutality? Or is it simply a story about a cook a thief his wife and her lover? This is not an easy question to answer the film's political undercurrents are intentionally enigmatic and vague Greenaway certainly isn't handing us the answers on a silver platter in interviews he refuses to talk about his film's subliminal meanings and we are left to our own devices to discern the films message if indeed it possesses one. Whilst one could simply accept the film as an updated Jacobean tragedy mingled with the savagery of a Charles Bronson revenge flick this would rob the film of its allegorical significance which the film most certainly possesses in a strangely subversive way. I personally tend towards the argument that 'The Cook the thief his wife and her lover' is Greenaway's manifesto for his disgust at Britain's social hierarchy the excesses of the wealthy their subjugation of the workers and their insatiable desire for as Dickens's Oliver would put it 'more'.The quartet of main actors give performances of uninhibited power they must metaphorically and in the case of Helen Mirren and Michael Howard literally bare all. Each inhabits their character perfectly the dour soft spoken Richard who subversively undermines Albert's authority by assisting Georgina in her sexual caprices is played with model restraint and calm by Richard Bohringer although his thick French accent is sometimes hard to comprehend. The part of Lover is less straightforward he says nothing for the film's first 40 minutes but Michael Howard acquits himself well to a rather limited role the real tour de force performances however are delivered by Mirren and Gambon. Georgina's transformation from abused wife to daring lover to seeker of vengeance is perfectly portrayed by Mirren she is the film's defiant heroine and earns our sympathies for her desperate plight. As Roger Ebert surmised so aptly 'Gambon plays Albert as the kind of bully you can only look at in wonder that God does not strike him dead' he is the epitome of excess gastronomically egotistically financially etc. and lacks any redeeming features but Gambon also has the talent to give a performance that makes us realise what a pathetic and surprisingly vulnerable character he is though he's still utterly loathsome.Upon its release many saw the film as a political allegory with the thief representing the tyrannical Thatcher who subjugates the dutiful workers the cook whilst ruining Britannia the wife. This behaviour is all ineffectually opposed by left wing intellectuals the lover. Whether or not this is true indeed whether or not you love or loathe this film it is a powerful experience that will linger with you for quite some time.My Score 9 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "One can probably assume from the film 'The Cook the thief his wife and her lover' that director Peter Greenaway has a rather warped view of humanity he is nihilistic about society's future abhorrent of Thatcher's regime and furiously condescending of the entrepreneurial upper classes and their exploitation of the workers. This anger manifests itself in the shocking scenes of violence and depravity contained in the film which earned the film an X certificate back in 1989 and surprisingly resulted in the film reaching a larger audience than anyone anticipated the film grossed over 7 million in the USA and proved that there is more weight to the old adage 'no publicity is bad publicity' than one might expect. However it should not be forgotten that the film received almost unanimously euphoric reviews from film critics or at least from those that didn't flee from the cinema and is indeed one of the most brilliant visceral imaginative and unique pieces of cinema. It's not for all tastes but those who can stomach it will be rewarded with a slice of delectable cinematic cuisine of the highest order.The film's central locale is 'Le Hollondais' a restaurant of the most impeccable quality in every aspect. Night after night the restaurant is attended not only by an assortment of wealthy and decadent noveau riche but also by lowlevel gangster Albert Spica Michael Gambon accompanied by his tormented wife Georgina Helen Mirren and a consortium of pimps hitmen and psychopaths. Each evening Albert treats the dining area of the restaurant like his court spewing out vile speeches of ignorance and bigotry making unqualified criticisms of the cuisine and assaulting any of the other diners if they object to his hoglike behaviour. The chef Richard Bohringer despises Albert but presents a faade of obedience and servitude to avoid any maltreatment from Albert and his cronies much like the other dining guests who exhibit remarkable patience with the revolting Albert. Georgina seems resigned to marital martyrdom but also sees the ridiculousness of Albert's arrogance and pomposity though she rarely contradicts him he hits her with the exquisitely calligraphic menu when she does. However one night her eyes meet Michael's Alan Howard an intellectual who sits quietly in the corner of the restaurant delicately eating his meal whilst engrossed in his book seemingly oblivious to Albert's loud displays of crudeness. Lightning proverbially strikes and with little hesitation the two make for the Ladies toilet where they engage in a passionate tryst in one of the cubicles. And thus the cycle begins each night Albert continues his rants and consumption of excessive amounts of food whilst the cook assists Georgina in finding hiding places for her and Michael to make love. However the naturally distrustful Albert soon realises he is a cuckold and orders that lover be killed by having each page of his book thrust down his throat with a sharp spindle. Georgina however is able to turn the tables on Albert which leads to the films shocking denouement where the thief receives his just desserts in a manner best described as poetic justice.So what is the film about? Is it a darkly humorous political satire on our materialistic times? Is it exploitative pornography coupled with scenes of unnecessary brutality? Or is it simply a story about a cook a thief his wife and her lover? This is not an easy question to answer the film's political undercurrents are intentionally enigmatic and vague Greenaway certainly isn't handing us the answers on a silver platter in interviews he refuses to talk about his film's subliminal meanings and we are left to our own devices to discern the films message if indeed it possesses one.

	schema:reviewBody "Let's say that you're an avid filmgoer and you want to test your level of tolerance in terms of the type of bad taste vile and disgusting screen images you can bear. Certain people would direct you to the zombiecannibal movies made in Italy in the 1970s and if you took their advice you would indeed find yourself faced with some pretty unpleasant viewing material. However such films are also very poorly made with an emphasis on exploitation and somewhat shaky and grainy camera work. For an equally vile and disturbing film made with considerably more skill and elegance not to mention aspects of a Jacobean revenge play to please the intelligensia look no further than The Cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover. This movie is just as outrageous nauseating and horrific as any Italian cannibal flick but in a breathtakingly artistic way. Michael Gambon gives a menacing portrayal as a vulgar gangster with a penchant for rich food. He is a regular customer at an elegant restaurant where he and his cronies and his unhappy wife wine and dine while exchanging tales of crime and debauchery. One evening his wife claps eyes on a rather geeky librarian at a nearby table she fancies him immediately and before you know it the pair are embarking on a torrid sexual affair. Gambon discovers that his wife is having this affair so he has the librarian killed but his wife teams up with a cook from the restaurant to come up with a terrifying revenge plot. It's impossible to reveal the details of the revenge plot without spoiling the film but suffice to say that it is unforgettable revolting and ingenious. Greenaway directs the film in his customary unique visual style but the narrative is more viewerfriendly than usual in his films making this one of his more watchable and entertaining offerings. The actors give great performances brave performances too considering the explicit full frontal nudity they are asked to do. The music richly complements the scenes on screen. This film is remarkable on many levels but it's definitely adultsonly stuff and even then it's not for all tastes. However if you want something a little different and you're not afraid to be seriously disturbed this will do nicely.".

There is a full frontal nude scene of the wife and her lover where he is clearly more relaxed than he should have been at that moment. I'm a bit disappointed in Greenaway for not showing him at attention as he would have been in real life. But then I guess he would have been accused of making porn. Whatever. This film is not for everyone. My wife didn't see it. I'm sure she would have hated it if she had. For that matter I can't actually say I liked it although I consider it a masterwork.

There is a full frontal nude scene of the wife and her lover where he is clearly more relaxed than he should have been at that moment. I'm a bit disappointed in Greenaway for not showing him at attention as he would have been in real life. But then I guess he would have been accused of making porn. Whatever. This film is not for everyone. My wife didn't see it. I'm sure she would have hated it if she had. For that matter I can't actually say I liked it although I consider it a masterwork. But I'm glad I saw it. I'll probably see it again but not until I can see it on HDTV. Plain old DVD couldn't possibly do it justice. An amazing movie.";

	schema:headline " Greenaway's elaborate and ornate revenger's tragedy  a must see film!";
	schema:reviewBody "With the Cook the Thief his Wife and her Lover Greenaway creates a selfcontained world that is both a fabrication and abstraction of reality but also an extremist reflection nee microcosm of British society in the nineteeneighties. The characters that he chooses to put forward to the audience as protagonists are archetypes of social and political caricatures that we would find in that particular decade but heightened to conform to the overthetop opulencepestilence found central to the plot. His ability to craft characters and situations that resonate beyond the context of a particular scenario coupled with his bitterness and unwillingness to conform is what sets him up as a satirist of serious note. He also elevates the film beyond the realms of mere arthouse experimentation by fashioning a seriously funny script which has ample opportunities for central character Albert Spica to prove himself the ultimate charismatic bully  part cockney hard man part pantomime villain  who is never less than compulsively terrifying.The plot is a simple construct centred on the theme of revenge and the need for personal freedom. This is mixed in with the sociopolitical undertones as well as Greenaway's many references to art theatre film and literature. It is also elevated by the impeccable cinematic qualities that we hold synonymous with the director's work. Everything here is about pushing things beyond the reasonable limitations so we have a stunningly intricate set that is both theatrically simplistic but also as otherworldly as anything from the work of say Gilliam or Jeunet. The costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier scream overthetop chic whilst often mirroring the use of colour employed by the production designers. Greenaway even breaks continuity by having Helen Mirren's costumes change colour as she moves through each room of the restaurant so that we have a green dress in the kitchen a red dress in the dinning area inspired by Hitchcock's vertigo no less and a white dress in the lavatory. It's an audacious move but one that pays off in the creation of a completely selfcontained world something that is further established by Sacha Vierny's sumptuous cinematography and the wonderfully bombastic music of the everexcellent Michael Nyman.Some have clearly found the film's various abstractions problematic yes it is theatrical yes it is occasionally shocking and yes it does evolve in a world of its own ostentatious creation. But it's also as artistic a film as you can get a fact that some here have disputed. The reason that some define this as artistic refers to the use of colour light and composition. The architecture of the sets too and the way in which the production designers have chosen to dress them also adds to the artistic stylisation of the film. These factors are important to the narrative as they are symbolic to what Greenaway is trying to convey as well as what the characters are all about. Because of this the design of the film becomes AS important as the framework if not more so. But this film is more than a mere arty exploration it's funny and intelligent and features a slew of great performances from a wonderfully eclectic cast. Michael Gambon as the thief Spica gives a grandstand performance to rival his own Phillip Marlow from The Singing Detective hamming things up spectacularly but still retaining that much needed sense of humanity. The same can be said of the other principals too.Mirren as the wife exudes a quite and restrained sexuality in what must be her best performance whist Richard Bohringer as the cook is in some represents the linchpincatalyst for the film. Elsewhere we find everyone from Tim Roth to Ian Dury popping up to give the film some added character and easily furthering the film's already cult appeal. This was a turning point for Greenaway a move towards the more expressive elaborate and selfcontained style of filmmaking found in films like Prospero's Books and the Baby of Maon and away from the more easy to digest classics like the Draughtsman's Contract Drowning by Numbers and A Zed and Two Noughts.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Cook the Thief His Wife  Her Lover' is a film about politics cannibalism vomit love death betrayal and torture. 'The Cook the Thief His Wife  Her Lover' is part black comedy part crime thriller part horror part filmnoir. It is about about four twisted characters and a series of events that play out over an entire week. The owner of a French restaurant Albert Spicathe thief occupies it daily in order to stuff his face and beat on the innocent bystanders that surround him and cannot touch him. The owner of the restaurantthe cook constantly watches in awe as Albert Spica humiliates everyone and talks and talks and talks yet says nothing. The thief's wife Georginahis wife is beaten raped and humiliated every day by the thief. She falls in love with another man at another table Michaelher lover and begins to have a rather passionate affair with him. What results is one of the most outrageous and bizarre films I've ever seen. Peter Greenaway has created a film that is unlike anything that has ever been made before. It is a film that is so disgusting and dark and tasteless and yet so beautiful and intelligent and fresh that it must be seen to be believed. All of the performances are unforgettable especially Helen Mirren as the wife in a heart wrenching performance. Michael Gambon is absolutely terrifying as the thief. People can discuss the political implications that the film implies all they want. I really don't care about that stuff though. Even if that's what the film is about it isn't why I love it. I love it because it challenges me and a way a challenging film should. The attention to detail in the setpieces depict the one pertaining to the outrageous and decadent nature of our time and the times in which we live where the thief consumes everything and is wasteful. As a result there is a genuine sense of true horror throughout the film. The graphic violence and sex only add the the dark nature of the depiction of a world long destroyed by the greedy punks that have overrun the world. The punks in this film are much older than the ones that are usually depicted and we the postapocalyptic world outside for many brief glimpses in which there is a lot of fog smoke grime and filth. We really get a sense that the world that is depicted in this film was once truly beautiful and open to possibility and the fact that it is a world that is long gone makes the film far more tragic than we would usually expect especially one with such grand texture and such a dark sense of humor.This is the kind of film that reminds me that people in the film industry can still make intelligent smart and brilliant films without having to pile on the excess. The film works because it is not only effective but it is also original storytelling. The film's use of it's set design only amplifies the way it is presents and gives the film even more meaning with it's vibrant colors and the way that each set piece in the entire film represents a different color of the rainbow. The music by Michael Nyman is simply one of the most chilling and unforgettable scores I've heard in a film. It only enhances the beauty of the film though. While the film is certainly not for everyone especially childrenalthough it won't be easy for them to view it given it's NC17 rating this film is for the kind of adult audience who likes to think and not just be shown something that will waste their time. The content is really tame compared the garbage that is allowed to be played on public television these days anyway. For people who want to be challenged and shown a film that will make them think about the world in a different way than they normally do It's a must see. This is one of my personal favorite films.".

The film's use of it's set design only amplifies the way it is presents and gives the film even more meaning with it's vibrant colors and the way that each set piece in the entire film represents a different color of the rainbow. The music by Michael Nyman is simply one of the most chilling and unforgettable scores I've heard in a film. It only enhances the beauty of the film though. While the film is certainly not for everyone especially childrenalthough it won't be easy for them to view it given it's NC17 rating this film is for the kind of adult audience who likes to think and not just be shown something that will waste their time. The content is really tame compared the garbage that is allowed to be played on public television these days anyway. For people who want to be challenged and shown a film that will make them think about the world in a different way than they normally do It's a must see. This is one of my personal favorite films.";

Art films don't have to be jarringly stilted but this one groans under the weight of Peter Greenaway's constant reminders that he is AVANT GARDE. It's the film equivalent of a dinner party guest who spends the evening spitting in your food to show that he is free from the constraints of social norms.There are elements  the class observations long panning shots and colour changes from room to room to name three  that show Greenaway's unusual talent but they are overwhelmed by a tide of gratuitous overacting overlong scenes and functionless dialogue. The film is an extended metaphor for Margaret Thatcher's thuggish reign as Prime Minister of Britain and the subject seems to have thrown Greenaway into such a frothing rage that he was unable to concentate on anything but the metaphysical.Some people believe that the film succeeds because of its anarchic freewheeling nature but I think that is precisely its failure. Greenaway's reluctance to rein in the more selfindulgent parts of the film smacks of laziness and an inability to distinguish the benefits of experimentation from the dross it inevitably throws up.It is as if he is saying Who am I to intervene in art? Well Peter you are the director. You are perfectly placed to do so and we really wouldn't hold it against you.".

If mere technique and visual panache are supposed to impress us then by extension scales and exercises could be great music and crossword puzzles great literature.I can appreciate that others may not agree with me but I found no redeeming value in this movie.

I think a movie that attempts to be artful ought to have meaning on a subtler level.  But the symbolism in this movie was thrown out at your face a lot like a forcefeeding.  All the value that this movie contains can be had within the first twenty minutes i.e. the use of colors and costume.  As for the rest  I think the director takes himself way too seriously.  My friends and I couldn't help laughing at the scenes that were meant to express the greatest pathos.  The ending scenes were so ridiculous such a bombast that I had to leave the movie.  After it was over my friends and I really felt offended that we had been subjected to so much pretentious and I think false  art.".

I think a movie that attempts to be artful ought to have meaning on a subtler level.  But the symbolism in this movie was thrown out at your face a lot like a forcefeeding.  All the value that this movie contains can be had within the first twenty minutes i.e. the use of colors and costume.  As for the rest  I think the director takes himself way too seriously.  My friends and I couldn't help laughing at the scenes that were meant to express the greatest pathos.  The ending scenes were so ridiculous such a bombast that I had to leave the movie.  After it was over my friends and I really felt offended that we had been subjected to so much pretentious and I think false  art.";

A fearful stranger Onimaru Heathcliff tries to intrude into the central community with a tabooed and profane woman Kinu Catherine. Influenced by George Bataille's argument that the sacred and the profane are ultimately never in contradiction Yoshida allows Kinu and Onimaru to consummate and sublimate their union through their marginality and profaneness.

	schema:reviewBody "Wuthering Heights was made under French sponsors and entered the 1988 Cannes competition same as Yoshida's earlier film A Promise. This is an adaptation of Emily Bront's classic novel of the same name and transports the setting from 19th century Yorkshire moors to a medieval Japanese foggy volcanic setting. Because of this some people may draw parallels with two Shakespeare adaptations by Akira Kurosawa Throne of Blood and Ran also set in medieval Japan but really Yoshida's work has nothing in common with Kurosawa's in terms of style storytelling and general feel. Apparently he made it because he felt dissatisfied with the romanticism of the 1929 version.The role of Heathcliff here called Onimaru meaning demon is played by Yusaku Matsuda sadly in one of his last roles due to his premature death while Cathy Kinu meaning silk is played by Yuko Tanaka. Both of them do a great job although this style of acting may not be to everyone's taste because it's heavily influenced by the Noh theatre traditions. In fact Yoshida had the actors perform Noh exercises each day under the guidance of a professional instructor. There are no ghosts in this adaptation as they are replaced with Shinto references which are very likely to fly over your head as they did over mine. Some Shintoistic symbols and elements have major roles like the long streak of white arches in the middle of nowhere or Kinu's mirror possibly a reference to Amaterasu? These are just wild guesses....There are few different locations  the two Houses on the mountain the nearby town and the deserted foggy outback and that's it. One of the rare writeups on this film that I've read connects the isolated setting to Japan itself but you can really never know what Yoshida's films are about because there are almost no interviews and a few articlesreviewstexts in general on his work. Shinichiro Ikebe's music fits the dark sometimes morbid imagery well. Some of Yoshida's trademark visual touches are present such as focusing on the characters behind various objects in closeup such as hand fans. Some locations are colorcoded such as the Forbidden Chamber which is all in yellow to accompany the outbursts of passion that occur within its walls. As is the case with any other Yoshida film this masterpiece is worth seeing even for the visuals alone.".

Though lowbudget at least in the look of the production...I'm sure Leslie Neilson wasn't cheap there is a certain attention to detail that I really like. i.e. when Robert Stack's character is discussing the gig with Chuckie and recountering his army story you can hear a snap of a pencil or something as he grabs Chucks shirt stating i snapped his neck and again later when he makes a fist. I love these small details and find it hilarious in these particular situation. though there are a few plot points that are weak ie in the end spoiler alert it is not very clear as why Shawn keeps the Porsche even though it has been made clear that it was stolen and rightfully belongs to Mr Face. or why Chuckie is ok w it considering it would be a big stain or his and his father's rep. These little flaws add to the true nature of 80's film.

	schema:headline " Fun and bemusing Spanish comedy with a stellar duo and a large support cast";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't Tempt Me is a very pleasant action comedy plenty of humor  surrealist dialogs  emotion  spectacular scenes and mayhem . Heaven and hell send their best agents to Earth  and they're wearing heels . Two angels are on Earth  one named Lola Victoria Abril from the heaven and one named Carmen Penelope Cruz from the hell come to save a boxer named Many Damian Bichir who finds his soul to be the object of a metaphysical fight. This exciting film results to be a surrealist comedyactiondramathriller and displays an all Spanish starcast. The singer played by Victoria Abril and the former mobster performed by Penelope Cruz star this dark story of redemption about heaven and hell  both of whom have a violent confrontation to accomplish their objectives . Rightly enjoyable and funfilled  milestone comedy which neatly combines humor  mirth  entertaining situations and amusement . The funny screenplay manages a lot of laughs from the audience and twisted elements that you never loose your attention from the film . The only flaw I can find is that some of the story lines are overwhelmingly absurd and some character arcs end up being implausible . Some situations are laugh out loud ridiculous and the story proceeds at a breakneck speed that never falls flat .Pay attention as one couple of younger actors very well played by Victoria Abril and Penelope Cruz alternate with the other pair of older players perfectly performed by Fanny Ardant and Emilio Gutierrez Caba . I liked everyone in the excellent cast and the male and female actors  they were all very attractive . Flawless and fantastic story full of twists and turns with a duo of sensational protagonists  including an unforgettable Penelope Cruz  she parades and dances sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Penelope who gives one of the best screen acting . The support cast is topnotch as Elsa Pataky  Luis Tosar  Gael Garcia Bernal  Gemma Jones  Cristina Marcos  Elena Anaya  Bruno Bichir  Juan Echanove and many others . And cameos by Javier Bardem in the closing credits as we learn that Penlope Cruz was changed back into a man in the afterlife  then we see the man's photo  it is Javier Bardem  furthermore  the photo Victoria Abril puts into the album shows the mother of Manny  the woman in this photo is the actress Pilar Bardem . Atmospheric and appropriate musical score by the recently deceased Bernardo Bonezzi . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Paco Femenia . Agustin Diaz Yanes' return to top form  with an intelligent and engaging script which uses amusing situations to give us a good movie in fast pace  entertaining events  plot twists and that kept me entertained for the almost two hours of duration . Diaz Yanes is a fine craftsman  thanks to his reputation as screenwriter and the support of Victoria Abril he was able to set up his first film as director Nobody Will Speak of Us When We're Dead  that became the greatest hit of Spanish cinema at its release in 1995 and the Festival San Sebastian  including best actress to Victoria Abril . Yanes subsequently directed the successful Alatriste and Solo Quiero Caminar that failed at Spanish box office .".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the most enjoyable film experiences I have had this year. I saw the film at the AFI festival in Los Angeles it is going to be released in the US in April under the title Don't Tempt Me.Cruz devil and Abril angel are cast against type and it works very well Cruz giving one of her best performances.  Bernal is also memorable as a very likeable devil and Birchir is completely convincing as the frustrated boxer whose soul hangs in the balance.The film starts out with an amazing bit of philosophical exposition a shock for anyone who is used to watching Hollywood fare.  You can't imagine dialogue like this is a Hollywood film yet it is funny captivating brilliant.  The humor in the film is by American standards sophisticated and intelligent yet the film is full of sexual imagery and violence nothing extreme but energizing to the story and is highly accessible. It should appeal to a fairly wide audience especially since there are so many Spanish speakers in the US.It's a superb and entertaining morality play with the action drama and comedy tightly interwoven with a political subtext that itself is the driving force behind the film.Hell is portrayed as an English speaking corporation in the American style although staffed with Europeans and Heaven mostly takes place in a Frenchspeaking Parisian nightclub.  The Earth scenes are in Spain and the meetings between angels and devils in Latin.  This all works very well and the subtitles are easy to follow.The soundtrack begins with a Dylan song I hadn't heard before too.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant! Abril and Cruz are dynamite!";
	schema:reviewBody "Many observers have noted that at first glance on paper one might think this is a Pedro Almodovar film what with Victoria Abril cast in it among other things. Well I haven't seen too much of Almodovar's work and I knew nothing about director Augustin Diaz Yanes when I entered the theatre to see this film. But I wonder did Almodovar show such promise so early in his career? From the first few minutes I was captivated by the movie and I stayed enthralled throughout. By the time Penelope Cruz was dancing around to Kung Fu Fighting I knew this was a rare film indeed and no it's no ripoff of 'Pulp Fiction' either!For all it's audaciousness the premise has been used many times before. Like 'Paradise Lost' the battlefield is Heaven Hell and Earth. But the specifics are a little more prosaic angels from Heaven and Hell fight for their survival over the soul of a rather ordinary mortal a nottobright or personable boxer. Heaven and Hell are presented as distinctly mortallike placesHeaven is nice but hardly the celestial paradise we envision and Hell is unpleasant but nothing nearly as bad as Dante imagined. The two places are run like competing businesses it would seem and the CEO God and presumably Satan in his own realm is AWOLapparently he's too tired or disinterested to bother with the details of running the place leaving that task up to lesser creatures. Right now Hell seems to have the upper hand. Heaven is somehow almost bankrupt and may well go under if they can't snag this one earthbound soul the aforementioned boxer who fate has cast in some great future role that we never fully understand. But there's trouble brewing in Hell too and even though they've got the advantage over Heaven at the moment there are internecine power struggles to worry about there. So each each side dispatches an agent to try to win over Manny this boxer who unwittingly holds the fate of this world and those beyond in his hands.That's where Abril and Cruz come in and they are just a joy to watch for the almost two hours this flick runs. Abril is Lola the heavenly angel who ingratiates herself in Manny's life as his wife and Cruz is Carmen who poses as his longlost cousin Manny isn't the brightest crayon in the box so he can be convinced that all of a sudden he has a fiveyear marriage he doesn't remember. Lola and Carmen thrust and parry throughout the film but on a surprisingly cordial levelCarmen isn't as bad as one would expect a denizen of Hell to be and neither woman seems possessed of any otherworldly powers they go about their business in a very earthly way. You combine a great script two outstanding performances and excellent direction and not surprisingly you get a firstrate film as good as any I've seen this year. This is not quite Orson Welles and 'Citizen Kane' here but it put me in mind of it it's that good.".

With an original and amusing premise and strong writing it is a fun ride all the way. I haven't seen anything like it. The humour is a good mix of quirkiness dryness and sarcasm that works on multiple levels. It's funny how a black and white 50's French setting is chosen to depict heaven while a dirty perhaps South American prison setting is chosen to portray hell. Similarly language selection is interesting as French is spoken in heaven English is spoken in hell and Spanish on Earth.Heaven is shown as a very romantic classy and glamorous place to be at a bit like the romanticized image one sees in classic French films while hell is quite the opposite. Fanny Ardant and Gemma Jones play the leaders of the respective places and they're both terrific. Their character recruit Carmen and Lola to conquer fallen boxer Manny's soul. Of course battle ensues when the two recruits come face to face but not the way you think.Yanes assembles a n enviable cast that includes Penelope Cruz Victoroia Abril Gemma Jones Gael Garcia Bernal Elena Anaya Elsa Pataky Fanny Ardant Demin Bichir Cristina Marcos Peter McDonald Luis Tosar and more. All the actors do a great job. Abril sure is stunning and she sure can sing. Her rendition of 'I Want To Be Evil' is a mustsee. Penelope Cruz has a tricky role and she does full justice to it. She is sexy spunky streetsmart and not to be messed with but at the same time she's just 'like one of the guys'. Saying more would be revealing too much.On the technical side it's a very well made film. Colour is used very effectively. The cinematography is first rate. I especially enjoyed the long single shots. And of course the soundtrack is magic.'Sin Noticias de Dios' is one of a kind. I'm surprised it's received so little recognition but it's a thrill ride all the way.".

The idea of an outdated black  white French Heaven and an English speaking hell run by Brits with a sick sense of humor and a corrupt Mexican manager with a Swiss passport is brilliant. The use of Latin as the lingua franca between devils and saints is absolutely comic. Even if the screenplay has some loopholes and flaws the dialogue was hilarious the acting in most cases very good and it has some unforgettable characters like the the corrupt woman cop capable of punching the devil himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this movie at the Miami Film Festival and I can't recommend it enough. It has an original premise great characters portrayed by strong actors a good script and a refreshingly creative way of telling the story. The story centers on the at times friendly competition between heaven and hell for the soul of a boxer Demian Bichirwho's really not worth saving. Heaven sends an angel Victoria Abril and hell sends a waitressdark angel Penlope Cruz to persuade him.  Heaven is portrayed as a blackandwhite 1950s Paris and hell looks an awful lot like America but sounds a lot like Britain.  One of the most creative aspects of this film is the use of language.  When the story is taking place in Heaven French is spoken.  In hell it's English and in the real world it's Spanish.  The use of language is much more than aesthetics it is definitely a commentary.  The actors flow from one language to another with grace.  Speaking of the actors Abril is absolutely exciting as she brings natural oldfashioned glamour back to the screen and Cruz is simply brilliant in this film.  Other performances by Gael Garcia Bernal as the CEO of hell and Cristina Marcos as a rogue cop are outstanding.  Really see it for yourself...you'll be so happy you did.".

So Cruz pretending to be a man at heart who is awkwardly trying to pretend to be a woman creates a magnificent offkilter dark comedy.

An angel from heaven Victoria Abril and an angel from hell some Spanish chick named Penlope Cruz...lol! fight over the soul of a brutish boxer Demin Bichir. The way the plot develops is predictable as is the ending. But there are laughs around the way most of them provided by Cruz. I can't begin to comprehend why she's such a dull tedious unconvincing actress in American films when she's proved to be such a vibrant energetic and entertaining actress in Spanish films. And while she's made better films BELLE EPOQUE JAMON JAMON LIVE FLESH ABRE LOS OJOS and even the American ABRE remake VANILLA SKY I think this is definitely her best performance yet. Her character is the most interesting and entertaining figure during the entire duration of the film and one of the reasons she gets the biggest laughs is because the screenwriter gave her most of the best lines. The ridiculously talented and versatile Gael Garcia Bernal is a total hoot as a top CEO in hell who's a mix of Spike from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and Tony Shalhoub's eccentric shyster in THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. He's so much fun that the movie is hurt because he's a supporting character who only appears in a few scenes and so many of the lead characters are so onenote and tiring we keep waiting for him to show up more to liven things up. Anyways this isn't a very good film certainly one you may not remember for a long but the good aspects in it kept me entertained...most of the time. B".

Basically Penelope Cruz and Victoria Abril are two angles sent from opposite teams if you know what I mean to compete for the soul of Manny.  My biggest problem with the story is that we never give a hoot about Manny and his boxing or his wife abuse or his extortion.  He is not a likable guy or even really a dislikable guy. So this leaves us to decide between the two teams and their angels.  Cruz is wonderful as the quite manly angel from hell.  Her mannerisms are right on and make her character someone we want to know more about.  Her adversary Lola played by Victoria Abril is much less defined and somewhat boring for most of the movie.  The interesting premise although never really explained is that Manny's soul is a crucial one for heaven which faces bankruptcy and possibly even a liquidation sale.  Much more could have been done with this.  WriterDirector Agustin Diaz Yanis may have potential but did very little to make this one work.  The other performance that jumps off the screen comes from Gael Garcia Bernal who is on quite the roll with the recent Crimes of Father Amaro and Y Tu Mama Tambien.  He is electric on the screen.  Definitely worth seeing but a bit frustrating with the missed opportunities.".

In case you are in any doubt Mediterraneo ranks in my best three ever  a magnificent film. If you never see it part of your life will have been unlived.Mediterraneo epitomises the difference between Hollywood and the demands of a largely US audience and the subtler approach of the European directorwriter who seeks simply to express himherself through the medium. I read two reviews in the Washington Post both of which managed to misunderstand the film completely one going so far as to characterise the cast as Marx Brothers. In fact they are probably the finest ensemble of characters I have ever seen in film  a completely disparate group of individuals who nearly all manage to find spiritual and sexual fulfulment in the sensuality of Aegean island life.The film is multilayered and the more obvious ones such as the powerful antiwar message and the venality of postFascist Italy are often mentioned. But noone has ever picked up on the phrase una face una race which is repeated throughout the film.  This is the nostrum that Italians and Greeks have a common Mediterranean heritage come on Washington Post hacks  didn't the title give you a clue? and that there is an enormous irony in the Italians  who rightly pride themselves on the antiquity of their civilisation  seeking to subdue another culture whose origins are 2000 years older.This is underlined by the easy participation of the soldiers in both high and low Greek culture .....the painting of the frescoes in the church n.b. the Orthodox Church predating the Holy Roman Empire by centuries  clever eh! and the wonderful unifying theme of football which only a European or South American viewer could truly appreciate.The group's ambivalent attitude to sexual mores adds to the sense of the place as essentially a home for GrecoRoman sensuality  a fact which is gloriously exposed with the later juxtaposition of our band of heroes with the starched British Royal Navy officers who arrive to remove them from the island.I have not seen any mention in other reviews of the beautiful cadence of the Italian dialogue  as lilting as the bazouki music which accompanies much of the film.The sense of disillusionment that takes over the film at the end is very powerful and it is no accident that Salvatore shows us the Lieutenant returning to the island on a ferry full of burntpink tourists.This is a film that can only truly be appreciated if you have a feeling for and understanding of European culture. This is a film for grownups.Mediterraneo demonstrates that though boxoffice grosses for European films are small unless it is something produced explicity for a US audience like the truly dreadful Four Weddings our directors have managed to stay true to their craft.If there are not enough car chases or shoot outs for you look out for the fivestar ratings in the Washington Post.Fact 1 Only 10 of Americans possess a passport Fact 2 None of them review for the Washington Post.".

Actually the island isn't deserted and when the Greeks understand that those Italians are harmless they came out of their hiding places in the mountains and continue their peaceful lives. Soon the soldiers discover that being left behind in a Godforgotten Greek island isn't such a bad thing after all...The film won the Oscar for Best Foreign film in 1991 and I'm pretty sure this wasn't the best foreign film of that year but I can understand why it won. The film captures something I think many people can relate to or understand...escape. These soldiers find an escape from the war. Which is something anybody who has been in a war can relate to. And the film also captures the freedom these men have. For the moment they're at the island they can also escape from their everyday responsibilities and do what they like best. That's something most people want. For instance the lieutenant enjoys painting and at the island he gets the opportunity to paint the church. Instead of fighting a war or worrying about how to pay the bills he is doing what he enjoys best painting. The film may not be the best foreign film of 1991 but it is a very warmhearted film that you will enjoy.3  out of ".

The film captures something I think many people can relate to or understand...escape. These soldiers find an escape from the war. Which is something anybody who has been in a war can relate to. And the film also captures the freedom these men have. For the moment they're at the island they can also escape from their everyday responsibilities and do what they like best. That's something most people want. For instance the lieutenant enjoys painting and at the island he gets the opportunity to paint the church. Instead of fighting a war or worrying about how to pay the bills he is doing what he enjoys best painting. The film may not be the best foreign film of 1991 but it is a very warmhearted film that you will enjoy.3  out of ";

	schema:reviewBody "Mediterraneo which we saw during its debut run locally has stayed fresh as when we first saw it. This small endearing film has a lot going for it. In fact it makes a perfect statement against WWII or any war for that matter without being in one's face. The subtlety of this film stays long in the viewer's mind.We are presented a group of Italian soldiers on a mission to set a base in a small and apparently uninhabited island in the Aegean Sea not too far from Italy but millions of years away in the way it has stayed primitive enough to offer anything to these men. As soldiers under the command of Raffaelle these are not the typical professional soldiers. In fact these men discover themselves and a world they didn't know existed during their time in the island.What surprises the soldiers is not to encounter anyone living in the village facing the sea where they disembark. It becomes clear everyone is hiding from them. When the populace discover these men are harmless they return and embrace the invaders with open arms. After all they feel the Italians share a lot in common with them.The men obviously abandoned and lacking means of transportation get stuck in the island. In fact they don't realize but when the Italian aviator arrives in his one engine plane he is amazed how many years have passed since they arrived at that remote spot.This small film is a delight to watch. Diego Abatantuono makes a great Lorusso. Claudio Bigati is Raffaele the man with an artistic eye who sees the beauty of the classical Greek design. Vanna Barba plays Vassilessa the local whore who falls in love with the shy FarinaGiuseppe Cederna. The rest of the cast does a good job under Mr. Salvatores' direction.Watch this film as it will delight fans of Mr. Salvatores and the Italian cinema.".

The two movies have in my opinion much the same chemistry though altogether different physics.The movie is replete with life and beauty. It is blessed with the rhythm of an enthralling sea the almost ripplefree life of a village like town the heat of day and the quiet of night. And above all this is housefull of noises noises made by people young people at war and in love.What really touched me about this film was the fact that every body apparently gets what he had missed. The letterwriter does get a chance to escape. Cpatain busies himself in decorating the local church. Lorusso is happy with his extrovert style of life. And so is Farina only he is introvert. Likewise other men find ways to satisfy themselves. Last and probably the least the followers of Saint Balthasar make their own contribution towards fun chaos and misery that other more selfimportant members of this nomission task force are going through. It is fantastic to see how these tense woebefallen warladen become gradually satisfied with themselves and at ease with their surroundings. Whom other than themselves were they ever at war with?Again it is wonderful to watch them both anxious and worried simultaneously at the very prospect of retuning to peace and quiet of home i.e. when the man in the helicopter brings the news of lost causes and changed times. A new world order awaits them on the other shore to which they are later obliged to migrate only to suffer ridicule confusion and disillusionment. Only one man stays behind. Antonio Farina who with his humble beginnings and meager infatuations showed no promise at all in the outset yet in the long run emerges as the most powerful most memorable character of them all. From Italy's point of view he is a runaway. From island's point of view he is the one who stayed. Madly in love with the exprostitute of town he hides himself in one of the barrels used for storing olives. For one spare moment he resembles the Baroninthetrees Italo Calvino's hero in the second part of his Our Ancestors trilogy.All this happens during the course of this film. And yet there always is this almost magical aura of nothing happening at all and a foreboding of what is going to happen something wicked coming this way.But there is more to this movie than what first meets the eye.With its simplicity aimed at nothing in particular Mediterraneo manages to achieve more than many films laden with heavy messages. The film raises difficult questions in an easy manner more like a curious youth rather than an adult raging with anger. Like the see itself it knows a deep lot which it lets us steal a glimpse of only to fathom at what wonders and monsters lie beneath surface. The film becomes all the more effective in spite of and due to its fuzziness. Mediterrraneo blurs the boundaries of war and peace plays with the concepts of comradeship and loyalty blends us with them reveals certains to be mere perhaps compares being to nothingness.

	schema:reviewBody "Italian cinematography always had interesting and beside all great movies. Mediterraneo is definitely one of them with strong antiwar message. A movie that Americans cannot make cause they haven't experienced wars like the ones that were led on European ground.Story starts when Italian ship leaves a handful of soldiers in a little Greek island during World War II. Italian soldiers must hold that island by any cost. Island seems to be deserted and when their sheep gets destroyed by enemies soldiers must find a way to live on that island. Soon they found out that the island is not deserted when Greeks came out of their hiding places in the mountains. All of the inhabitants are women children and old men so soldiers began to relax and finally live their lives.Gabriele Salvatores made a movie situated during a war without any war scene presenting the Greek island as heaven on Earth for those untypical soldiers. All of them have their dreams and desires but as time pasts by only one soldier always tries to leave at all cost he wants to come home to his wife. Antonio Farina falls in love with prostitute Vassilissa gorgeus Vanna Barba and they even stopped counting days on that island so they don't know what is happening in the war or in outside world. This island present oasis imaginary world where everyone is happy. Like some sort of utopia. So from the first to last scene Salvatores directs this movie with no mistakes cause he had great scenario actors and he found beautiful location in Greece. I specially liked Diego Abatantuono in role of Nicola Lorusso but I must also mention Claudio Bigagli and Giuseppe Cederna. Every single person who worked on this drama with elements of comedy created a movie that we all can watch whenever we want to escape from to real world. But is there a place like this on Earth? Yes I think there are plenty of places like this but we have to look for them cause nothing good comes easy.".

The story of a small group of Italian soldiers they're not actually very soldierlike stranded on a beautiful Greek island during Second World War is very nicely depicted by director Gabriele Salvatores. The characters of Nicola Lorusso Raffaele Montini and the soldier in love with Vassilisa are great. The island itself is beautiful which calls to some incredible cinematography. The musical score is spectacular a delicious medley of Italian and Greek folkloric music. My verdict 10  10".

As such it could not be greater escapism for all of us watching the only way would be to travel to Greece ourselves!Mediterraneo is one of those films that can only make its audience think laugh reflect on deeper questions despite the fact that the actual storyline therein is quite simplistic indeed. A number of Italian soldiers stranded on a Greek island miss out on the end of World War II  such is the premise here and just like that this could have been quite the runofthemill umpteenth boring war film if done in a certain more marketable way... But it was done the European way exploring the thoughts aspirations even a hint of the souls of these soldiers rather than their militaristic exploits. And it was done in a lyrical way even I dare say! This movie delves into what every single soldier truly aspires to even in the midst of war  and that is peace and love of course. And where better than a paradisaical Greek island to find such a thing hmm?Even if time does not allow for much exploration the ensemble cast is welldefined and each soldier is given such endearing personality traits through the characters as they were written as much as through the fine performances by each and everyone in the cast. They are funny witty and ohsoItaliano while the ladies they meet on the island are voluptuous and strong and ohsoGreek too...! Beyond boundaries and borders we are all the same and this film underlines that in many ways. There is another phrase that will stay with you after all this if you are either nationality or belong to any other in the vicinity of the Mediterranean sea and it is one race one face. Or the later amusing version of it as the secondincommand makes it up as he is indulging in all the good food that is so plentiful there one race one stomach.The scenery is stunning the music is haunting  I cannot say enough or more than has already been said about the intrinsic qualities of this production. It is a feast for all the sense  and for the soul as well.Above all the entire exercise reminds us of this too life is so short. Enjoy it while you can. Find that place where you can finally stop running away.".

And it was done in a lyrical way even I dare say! This movie delves into what every single soldier truly aspires to even in the midst of war  and that is peace and love of course. And where better than a paradisaical Greek island to find such a thing hmm?Even if time does not allow for much exploration the ensemble cast is welldefined and each soldier is given such endearing personality traits through the characters as they were written as much as through the fine performances by each and everyone in the cast. They are funny witty and ohsoItaliano while the ladies they meet on the island are voluptuous and strong and ohsoGreek too...! Beyond boundaries and borders we are all the same and this film underlines that in many ways. There is another phrase that will stay with you after all this if you are either nationality or belong to any other in the vicinity of the Mediterranean sea and it is one race one face. Or the later amusing version of it as the secondincommand makes it up as he is indulging in all the good food that is so plentiful there one race one stomach.The scenery is stunning the music is haunting  I cannot say enough or more than has already been said about the intrinsic qualities of this production. It is a feast for all the sense  and for the soul as well.Above all the entire exercise reminds us of this too life is so short. Enjoy it while you can. Find that place where you can finally stop running away.";

Our cinema is far less shiny but more downtoEarth. The director through the words of the character of Lt.

So it appears pretty credible what happened in the movie between acts of humanity friendship inner struggles. Of Course there are typical elements of Italian culture throughout the plot as the soccer matches the highly informal language the warm friendship and of course to whom is totally unaware of Italian culture these can appear as childish and pretty silly. But if you look deeply into that if you leave all prejudices aside you will discover a beautiful postcard which paints a wonderful small Greek island in which Italian and Greek people rediscover their common cultural origins. With the WW2 as background but there are no fights at all. All in all reading about American reviews about this movie in which the writers looked at this movie with a smile of superiority it reminded me about the part in which the two British sailors came to rescue the marooned soldiers point at them with a sort of disgust and justify their feelings with Italians.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film story is culturally valuable because of the ways in which it contradicts itself. The film's credits say that it is Dedicated to all those who are running away. A line of dialog reinforces this idea. Lorusso says In times like these escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming. And yet at the end of the film Antonio Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture a place or a people to move them there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them. When Lorusso returns to the island many years after he says of Italy They didn't let us change anything. His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence where people can grow and change and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in wartorn Italy he escaped once again to the island where he had been happy.The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers the Sergeant admits early on are a platoon of misfits a Bacchuslike Russian a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife a pair of goatherding brothers from the mountains a weak and feminine but everloyal Antonio a man in love with Lorusso and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly and their nationalistic feelings if they ever had any quickly wane. I feel abandoned one of the men comments. Lorusso says They left us here and here we'll stay. Staying on the island early in the story doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since Greece is the Tomb of Italians is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns as the characters do that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers their senses are our senses their feelings our feelings because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the poets philosophers warriors and goddesses from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warriorlike tendencies towards compassionate means such as protecting his friends. The story by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.".

There are many twists and turns to the story well written subplots and unexpected coincidences all populated with a very strong cast of capable actors.

	schema:headline " Powerful and unnerving";
	schema:reviewBody "Julien Vincent Lindon is an unprepossessing French teacher happily married to Lisa Diane Kruger a wife he deeply loves. Their idyllic suburban life is rudely interrupted however when the police shockingly crash their home and arrest Lisa on suspicion of the brutal murder of her boss. With Lisa's fingerprints on the weapon and the victim's blood on her jacket she is found guilty and sentenced to twenty years in prison. If you like your suspense powerful and unnerving do not hesitate to seek out Anything For Her Pour Elle the debut effort of French director Fred Cavay an enormously entertaining thriller that delivers a high level of satisfaction.Imprisoned for a crime she probably did not commit the director offers two possible scenarios but it is clear which one is the more likely Lisa still proclaiming her innocence faces long dark days ahead without her husband and their young son Oscar Lancelot Roch. Overwhelmed with sadness Julien becomes singleminded in his drive to reunite the family. After three years when his attorney tells him that Lisa stands no chance before the Appeals Court and Lisa becomes suicidal refusing to take her insulin shots Julien knows that he must take matters into his own hands and will stop at nothing to accomplish his goal.Locating an excon who has written books about his attempts to break out of jail Julien convinces him to tutor him on the do's and don'ts of prison escape telling the excon that he wants to teach the author's experience to his students. His ultimate plan though is not revealed either to Lisa Julien's parents Liliane Rovere and Olivier Perrier or to the audience which serves to greatly enhance the suspense. To save the woman he loves from certain death in prison however Julien must transform himself from laidback school teacher to action hero pushing himself far beyond the limits of what is reasonable. While attempting to obtain false papers and new identities he comes into contact with some very unpleasant local criminal types and finds himself no longer reluctant to use violence to accomplish his ends.Supported by an excellent script by the director outstanding cinematography by Alain Duplaintier and a moody score by Klaus Badelt Anything For Her is entertaining riveting and ultimately a very moving love story. None of it would be very convincing however if not for the outstanding performances of Lindon and Kruger especially Lindon whose sudden personality change requires great skill to pull off. Lindon's eyes convey powerful emotion that is not desperation but a strong and unyielding determination that serves as a catalyst for the events that build to the film's heart pounding climax. Although Anything For Her has been criticized for being implausible when an individual's every act is consumed with passion and overwhelming intention then the implausible will most certainly become the expected.".

	onyx:emotionText "Julien Vincent Lindon is an unprepossessing French teacher happily married to Lisa Diane Kruger a wife he deeply loves. Their idyllic suburban life is rudely interrupted however when the police shockingly crash their home and arrest Lisa on suspicion of the brutal murder of her boss. With Lisa's fingerprints on the weapon and the victim's blood on her jacket she is found guilty and sentenced to twenty years in prison. If you like your suspense powerful and unnerving do not hesitate to seek out Anything For Her Pour Elle the debut effort of French director Fred Cavay an enormously entertaining thriller that delivers a high level of satisfaction.Imprisoned for a crime she probably did not commit the director offers two possible scenarios but it is clear which one is the more likely Lisa still proclaiming her innocence faces long dark days ahead without her husband and their young son Oscar Lancelot Roch. Overwhelmed with sadness Julien becomes singleminded in his drive to reunite the family. After three years when his attorney tells him that Lisa stands no chance before the Appeals Court and Lisa becomes suicidal refusing to take her insulin shots Julien knows that he must take matters into his own hands and will stop at nothing to accomplish his goal.Locating an excon who has written books about his attempts to break out of jail Julien convinces him to tutor him on the do's and don'ts of prison escape telling the excon that he wants to teach the author's experience to his students. His ultimate plan though is not revealed either to Lisa Julien's parents Liliane Rovere and Olivier Perrier or to the audience which serves to greatly enhance the suspense. To save the woman he loves from certain death in prison however Julien must transform himself from laidback school teacher to action hero pushing himself far beyond the limits of what is reasonable. While attempting to obtain false papers and new identities he comes into contact with some very unpleasant local criminal types and finds himself no longer reluctant to use violence to accomplish his ends.Supported by an excellent script by the director outstanding cinematography by Alain Duplaintier and a moody score by Klaus Badelt Anything For Her is entertaining riveting and ultimately a very moving love story. None of it would be very convincing however if not for the outstanding performances of Lindon and Kruger especially Lindon whose sudden personality change requires great skill to pull off. Lindon's eyes convey powerful emotion that is not desperation but a strong and unyielding determination that serves as a catalyst for the events that build to the film's heart pounding climax.

	schema:reviewBody "Pour Elle is the most recent highprofile French thriller to receive a limited cinematic release on British shores. With superior acting from Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger as strong sympathetic leading characters and a good conundrumdriven plot line there is every reason to expect a gripping experience along the lines of Tell No One  a comparison emphasised by the advertisers.Unfortunately although in acting a dialogue there is a lot to recommend here the film does not form as exciting a package as Tell No One.But first the good as with many French movies the representations of family life and the everyday interactions between spouses or parents with children are represented with a care and accuracy that is simply not found in most English language films. France seems to have a surfeit of fantastic child actors and directors who know how to use them. Similarly the quality of the acting amongst the cast as a whole is superb hitting the right note of realism without slipping into the cartoonishly grim and dour found in many British films.The problems with the movie are largely related to the fact that the story is somewhat simplistic for a thriller with no real twists or anything to engage the intellect as well as the fact that the constant emphasis of the hardship and injustice faced by the family as a result of the wife's wrongful imprisonment simply makes the movie difficult to actually enjoy watching.I found myself becoming increasingly depressed at the wife's prospect of spending the next 20 years trying to ward off suicide in a prison cell knowing that she was innocent. A fact that was driven home often enough that the ending did provide enough catharsis to warrant the misery of the first hour.Although the point is made that this is the story of an ordinary man trying to perform an act that as the multipleescapist at the beginning of the film assures us can only be done by a born criminal the film seems to present the escape as surprisingly easy to plan. There is very little attempt to guide us through the process  with much of the interesting intricate work presented in montage. Rather than focusing on the nuts and bolts of the escape plan as we would expect from a thriller these are passed through in a cursory manner as the tension is built around the increasing strain placed on the characters. Although there is nothing wrong with this approach it doesn't entirely sit at ease with the rushed escape that ends the film although the ending does involve the cleverest moment in the story involving an internet carshare website.Although far from a bad film Pour Elle is an uneasy mix of personal drama and thriller which achieves much more as the former than the latter. As someone expecting a movie more like Tell No One I can't say I enjoyed the film as much I could have.".

	schema:reviewBody "A stylish  complex movie driven by character  dealing with a high school teacher with no legal means left to him  as he devises a daring plan to rescue his wrongfully imprisoned wife from jail . Based on the original idea by Guillaume Lemans  this is a perfect thriller being starred by an allstarcast as the French Vincent Lindon and German Diane Kruger . Being remade in American version 2010 by Paul Haggis with Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks . A teacher named Julien Vincent Lindon  in American version played by Russell Crowe is happily married to his sweetheart wife  Lisa Diane Kruger  she spent several months developing the character which had a significantly smaller role in the original draft. When her despised chief is murdered she is the main suspect . Then  a clear evidence convicts Lara Brennan of killing . Lisa is sentenced to 20 years of jail for murder charges. While she's in prison  her husband cares for their young son and plots a twisted plan  as he decides to break her out. Julien consults a successful escape artist turned author and he starts planning and decides to carry out his scheme . He'll need to disrupt jail routine obtain IDs and passports know how to escape a dragnet find a new place to live  and squirrel away cash  as he spends the next few years trying to get her released . The essential question that lies in the film is the following  How far would you go for the one you love ?This exciting film contains action  violence  thrills  suspense and plot twists . Excellent thriller in which nothing is the way it seems  the atmosphere is already tense and the twists and turns are the best part of this movie . In other ways it feels like a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock full of attractive characters and edgeofyourseat intrigue . The film was noteworthy for casting some of the finest actors in France including Vincent Lindon as a husband whose life is turned upside down when his wife is accused of a murder  along with Olivier Marchal  an actordirector who has directed sensational Fench thrillers  just like 36th Precinct  Mr73 as good as this Anything for her . And  of course  a gorgeous as well as good actress Diane Kruger as the woman wrongfully condemned  in fact Fred Cavay chose Diane Kruger for her radiant beauty as it would make her character's ordeal all the more powerful .All the prison scenes and the studio interiors were shot in chronological order as Fred Cavay felt it would be important for the actors and the evolution of their characters. Good production design  the prison seen in the film is actually a combination of three filming locations the exteriors are that of the Meaux prison some 40 kilometers east of Paris the entrance corridors are part of the Bibliothque Nationale De France in Paris and the other interiors . The picture achieved big success and was Nominated Csar Best First Film 2009 and considered to be the best thriller of the year in which you'll leave the cinema shaken and moved . Excellent soundtrack by Klaus Badlet  it was recorded at London's Abbey Road Studios that elevate the emotion and the intensity of the scenes to new heights .Fred Cavall did a formidable job with Pour elle France original title or Anything for Her  International title and filming lasted eleven weeks. Fred was immediately impressed with writer Guillaume Lemans's passion for the story and his vision stating that he understood that the novel was a love story first  and a thriller second . The idea for the film came from Guillaume Lemans  once Fred Cavay got involved the two men started out by working on the film separately before sharing their ideas  Cavay then wrote the first draft of the screenplay himself and so on. Cavall is a notorious writerdirector and he formerly was a fashion and advertising photographer . He has only directed three films The Players with Oscar winner Jean Dujardin and another phenomenal thriller titled Point blank  with Gilles Lellouche  Grard Lanvin and Elena Anaya . Eclectic and moving Cavall is a successful filmmaker .".

	schema:reviewBody "Please do not read this if you haven't seen the movie.I was extremely disappointed in this movie. It is well made has great actors and a great beginning but it goes absolutely nowhere. It completely failed in achieving its potential. It does not tell the real story. It feels like just half a movie.The movie concentrates on his effort to free his wife but that is not the real story. The real story revolves around whether she did it or not and whether once they are free she is either absolved or exposed. That is interesting. The mechanics of engineering an escape are boring and his descent into robbery and murder to free his wife are not interesting because we do not follow his journey into anguish and despair. The emotional journey is not there. The film makers have made it hard on themselves by having the couple have a young son. His presence forces the father to keep his act together and act normal. Without him the actor could have given his anguish much more exposure.I would like to have seen the first half of this movie showing the murder her capture their escape to a foreign country always keeping her guilt ambiguous and the second half the cop who is a strong charismatic character hunt them down and finally capture them. He could become convinced of her innocence and they would only receive a light sentence for running away but you would always suspect she was really guilty and that he was duped. Or perhaps he is fixated on her guilt and hunts them down and captures them but in the ensuing court case she is proved innocent. However years later he discovers he was right after all. Or perhaps he never finds them but years later he runs into their grown son and finally discovers the truth about what she did.This movie is extremely frustrating because so much potential was lost.".

This one is more gritty and more harsh than the updated version. I knew the outcome of the story but i still wanted to rent the original amazon prime video have it available and i don't regret spending money on it.Both movies are just as good as each other there is one thing that stands out which is the escape scene in this original version there are aspects mainly at the beginning of the escape scene before they enter the apartment where it is very edge of your seat thrilling  more thrilling than the remake beginning escape scene however the second half of the escape scene is not as thrilling as the second half of the escape scene from the remake version.Overall Pour Elle is a mustwatch.

	schema:reviewBody "Julien and Lisa are a happy loving couple living quiet ordinary lives in their quiet ordinary apartment with their baby son Oscar. Then one evening the doorbell rings Julien opens the door and their lives are thrown into chaos. Police swarm into the apartment pounce on Lisa and arrest her for the murder of her boss. Three years later Lisa has lost her last appeal against her 20 year jail term and is finally giving up hope  and giving up on life. She stops taking insulin trying to slowly commit suicide. Julien is a desperate man. He tracks down a notorious criminal who has written a bestselling book on his several successful escapes from prison. And so his plan begins. 'Anything For her' is a typical solid French thriller. There are no sudden twists or turns in a plot that relies on the natural tension of the situation to keep it going. The meticulous planning of the jailbreak is compelling as you watch Julien turn his apartment into effectively an operations room. The walls are lined with maps and photographs with graphs and plane schedules and with heavily underlined questions such as Escape Route? He tells Lisa nothing about what he's doing and begs her to just hang on. He intends to sell her mother's house to raise the money they'll need to start a new life but then Lisa is told she is to be transferred to another prison and so Julien must speed up his plans and raise the money somewhere else. The tension and the pressure of it on Julien is almost unbearable and never lets up. The director is determined that there be no distraction from this his main focus of the film and quickly shows practically at the start what actually happened to Lisa's boss so that that whole aspect of the story is quickly dismissed and forgotten about. It's not an allout masterpiece by any means but it is a very entertaining at times gripping film that does exactly what it says on the tin. Vincent Lindon is practically a veteran of these things and forces you to feel real empathy for Julien while Diane Kruger does well with what is really a much smaller part fully conveying the nightmare of prison life and the physical decline it brings.".

Contrast this film with something like 'The shawshank redemption'. With minimal physical action the latter convinces us that it is actually possible to escape from shawshank. Nowhere in the film I felt like the hero has really outperformed the authority.The plot seemed to be confused at best. This is an escape plot shot like a rescue film. It wastes too much time trying to answer why and in the end fails there too. The narrative pace never fully takes off and just when I thought its pacing up the film ended abruptly. What I want to see in a rescue film is how where the film falls flat on its face.Very little effort has been made to explain why would the guy want to break her out of prison what convinces him that she is innocent? I know that she's his wife but she's not our wife  and in the end what matters is why WE want to see her out of prison. Do we sympathize with the victim? I couldn't. She is probably going nuts in her cell but we never get to see what she is actually going through inside the prison. Being gorgeous is not enough to relate with the audience.I gave it four points for the craftsmanship behind the film  good cinematography and great editing. I hear Hollywood is getting it's own version of the film. I believe that film will benefit from cranking up the action slightly and tension a lot.".

The film calls to mind recent French films Irrversible and The Beat That my Heart Skipped in its attention to the study of the male putting themselves through Hell for sake of family memberscomeloved ones but Anything for Her carries a fast loose aesthetic which additionally calls to mind something like Distrcit 13 or any other recently produced Luc Besson feature thus placing it tantalisingly on the line between these two 'types'.In fact the film provides that somewhat amusing Bmovie inspired typically selfaware sensibility going into it. The cover for the film is a gruff looking and gunwielding individual named Julien Lindon standing along side his wife Lisa Kruger complete with the tagline cue cheesy American voiceover trailer voice How far would you go for the one you loved? slapped to the side of it all. The film does not hang around with an extended point of attack and it isn't long before the premise of trying to get one's wife out of prison by whichever way possible is kickstarted into action. Overall I think the film wants us to enjoy Julien's striving to rescue his beloved wife from the system which has imprisoned her after society put her in enjoy it moreso than feel absolutely terrible and really humbled al the aforementioned examples as this man is put through some pretty harsh paces. If this sensation does wash over us at whatever point during the film it might be because the couple have a young son whom the film through the editing often breaks off to encompass  just to make sure we're definitely on this guy's side.Criticisms aside I bought into it by the end. There can be no doubt that most will get their kicks out of the film by way of the rock 'emsock'em approach it has but the film was more of a character piece than I expected it to be with Julien being transformed from a seemingly upstanding family man whom teaches at his local school. Indeed the recognition Julien is deservedly given towards the end in regards to his shift is duly delivered when in an ironic manner certain individuals stare at some of his plans from earlier and exclaim that he was 'just an average guy' before being forced to come to terms with what has transpired.The film sees police barge into the family's home and arrest wife Lisa rather horrifically whilst she's discovering blood on her clothes in the bathroom. The police's grounds for arrest is based on a murder Lisa supposedly committed that she argued with her boss waited for them to travel to a car park bludgeoned them to death with a fire extinguisher what is is with the French and fire extinguishers as murder weapons in films? before casually driving off home. Later on we get a 'true' depiction of what happened when Lisa flashes back to the events in which it turns out someone else did what was pinned on her. Regardless we're told she's innocent rather than going through the motions of finding out that she actually is  the film is not of the detective variety but of the jailbreak variety.Julien begins his transformation when it appears Lisa's mental condition is worsening in prison and thus begins to reject her insulin dosages in an attempt to take one's life. With a child a few years older than what he was when Lisa was taken and desperation settling in when it emerges he may loose Lisa a second time Julien springs into action. As a boxer boxing above his weight as an individual completely out of his depth and as a fish nowhere near any water he is an initial failure at his attempts to do what's right. By seeing him ambushed and beaten by two people he attempts to obtain fake passports from the crashing reality that the road is long and hard hits home. But he climbs his way back up by way of ambushing drug dealers and shoving his way into people's houses at gunpoint this before we feel a transition of sorts is in progress. This is a transition the film remember wants you to recall is driven by pure love for another human being as well as the supposed false imprisonment of said human being so it's all perfectly fine and all right to root for this guy and his actions correct? That is if you buy into what the film offers in this sense.So the film is an amusing trawl through France's underworld as con artists escape artists counterfeiters and gangsters all make separate appearances. To the film's credit director Fred Cavay knows how to shift from horror and terror to thrills and spills to sheer suspense in equal measure. His film delivers on a visceral level of such a premise being executed in the manner it is with a series of scenes that exist to evoke such extreme reactions of pity sorrow and willing. All this while its lead practically the only real 'character' in the entire film goes through a transition which offers a backbone to all the mayhem.

For being this dumb she winds up in the slammer and ordinary teacher husband Lindon spends the bulk of the film devising a plan to spring her. It's something of a novelty to see Lindon a fine actor in something as close to a caper movie as this but he acquits himself well and there is an element of suspense right until the last moment.

There are enough subtle clues in the film for us to be certain of her innocence. Indeed the murder was really committed by another woman whom we actually glimpse. Creepily this same woman sits beside the wife in the park and they chat. But this film lets us down. Surely everyone who writes thrillers knows that people want to know whodunit. In this film the question of what really happened is ignored and the entire story is based upon the husband Vincent Lindon's efforts to bust his wife out of jail. Really that is not the way thrillers are supposed to work. Fred Cavay wrote and directed this film and we should take him over our knee and give him a good spanking. It may be very watchable but he shattered the canon of the thriller by allowing a mystery to go unsolved. You can't do that and get away with it!".

Diane Kruger has little to say but her french is really good and she is convincing in her role.Of course it would have been great to see more of the main character but since most of the time what he does is an inner thing this might work better as a book. Still there is a second woman who almost comes into his life well she kinda tries though it might seem halfhearted for most of the viewers and while his relationship with his relatives is quite good you could ask why Diane's character did not get a similar treatment. Of course if she had gotten somebody else too she wouldn't seem so isolated plus it would take quite some time to establish new characters.A good little thriller with quite some personal touches very well played and nicely shot then.".

Some might be offended by the fact that Griffen's character is in the filmic sense a coon.  Although nowhere near as good a comedy as Blazing Saddles it is comparable in certain aspects.  Double Take could be considered racist but like Blazing Saddles it uses racial stereotypes to emphasize the stupidity of their existence. Here instead of black vs. white we see upperclass AfricanAmericans ashamed of the Sambo stereotype and thus not associating with other AfricanAmericans with lower social status.  I'm not sure if this message was intentional in Double Take but it was there nonetheless.  Orlando Jones had a pretty good performance and Griffen was a convincing character some might say he was overthetop but again I'd say this was essential.  One problem was that the movie quite suddenly switched gears from a comedy to a somewhat serious actionsuspense flick.  I felt the heavy emphasis upon the latter took away from its comic moral message and made the movie shallower. So it had potential.  They could have recruited a few more writers to add in funnier jokes.  All in all a 6 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently some people DIDN'T like this movie but its hard to see why. While certainly not destined to become a film classic the miscellaneous plot holes are CERTAINLY no worse than most Hollywood fare and as an overall movie I think rates a whole lot better than a lot of what's cranked out these days 2006. I REALLY enjoyed this movie as did most of the other people who I have persuaded to watch the DVD which I purchased after seeing the movie in the theater. JOnes and Griffin are both in great form with the edge definitely going to Griffin's thoroughly brilliant comedy throughout. A great buddy movie with great performances and production values thoroughly entertaining and very very funny. If you don't mind a movie that's not too cerebral doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't aspire to be anything more than a thoroughly enjoyable comedic romp with more than a few twists and a fair amount of action along the way then you'll appreciate this. I don't think Mr. Gallo was aiming for an Oscar with this one but it was completely satisfying for what it was. Incidentally the music score and soundtrack were also remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "What it is jive turkey?!I don't think I've ever seen a movie that could include so many different film genres in a little less than 1 hour and 30 minutes. It has humor action a little drama and with all those emus.horror not to mention the freaky guy with the marble for an eye. Personally even though the movie got confusing at times I liked this movie with the exception of the fact I went with a friend who laughed through just about the whole thing and made me miss  of the dialogue. I guess being a younger person I caught a lot of the stuff that some adults just didn't get. In the end the whole movie made sense to me to a lot of other people it didn't it was just funny. Any ways since this is a review it looks like I better summarize what the whole thing is about for youThe movie's main characters are two guys that are like night and day and pretty much seem to dislike each other through most of the movie. First there's Daryl Chase played by Orlando Jones yes that's the guy in the 7Up commercials OMG who will be playing a drag queen named Miss Coco in an upcoming movie! the sophisticated goodlooking' as you can see that's not my personal opinion I just picked it up from another review Harvard graduate who is a New York investment banker. Second you have Freddy Tiffany played by Eddie Griffin he stars is Master P's Foolish' yeah you can call me a fool but you can't fool me. You know that song.maybe. who is a fasttalking street hustler with a mess of hair and a gold chain and oh.how can we forget his dog Delores played by Willow Stars. Like I said before they have basically nothing in common. Well blah de blah I can't tell you the whole thing they meet each other under weird circumstances then Daryl finds himself is big trouble because he is framed for something and soon he and Freddy switch places and head off to the wonderful place called Mexico. Needless to say many weird and strange things happen on their way to Mexico and even when they get there. We even get to see a smelly emu ranch called El Emu Ranch' which has a 20foot emu structure. After all this happens you may be confused or this all might make total sense to you it depends on you.Out of a 10 I give this movie a 9. It was confusing and will be confusing to many people which is why I took a point off because I personally found it VERY amusing. It's not every day you see a sophisticated well educated guy using some type of ghetto voice shouting about how there's no Schiltz malt 'licka' right? Or we can't forget the adorable and funny dog Delores who's right up there with the adorable dog from As Good As It Gets' but I forgot that dog's name. Then there's all those funny lines which I won't share you can find out for yourself because most of them aren't in any of the previews. ANY WAYS this pretty much concludes my review of Double Take' I will end it with a somewhat simple question to you.WTF is a jive turkey?!".

If you like the humor of the classic 1987 movie Real Men movie with Ritter and Belushi and if you liked the comic attitude found in Blue Streak then this is definitely a movie you will like. With the two actors Orlando and Eddie not being known as an infamous comic duo I certainly would have thought after seeing this movie that they have done this together before. I found many possibly subtle parodic similarities to movies like The Silver Streak and Stir Crazy which although you might think im out of the ballpark on this one I couldnt help but to laugh my butt off! The directing was professionally witty and the writing was smarter than most any movie that is currently available for rent. I can only say that there is a bright future not only for these actors in comedy roles and that I am astonished that this movie has been created out of a 1957 screenplay. It definitely has been perfectly formulated to work in the current setting in which it was portrayed. Bottom line is that I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a sleeper comedy mixed with some well thought up schemes. Maybe those of you who are fans of violent humor in the the britishheist movies such as Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels will relate to the mixture of violence and comedy as well here. And I want to know if anyone else caught the clear irony between the pen scene in this movie and the pen scene in the movie Real Men. Tell me that wasnt inspired by a great movie! Watch this movie! If you pay attention.. you will laugh!".

The acting could be more convincing but the story itself is not convincing so it's hard to condemn the film for that. You have to go into the plot with a willingness to suspend disbelief but it doesn't fit into the same bracket as films like Joe Dirt as far as humor is concerned. Other than some potentially objectionable language I think this film is a great bet especially if you need a good laugh. It should also be noted that the people that I know personally who did not enjoy this film went into it with more serious expectations. It is important to realize before you watch that the plot does not center around the action so much as it does the humor. I have owned it since it came out and rarely do I enjoy a film more than twice but this is one I have watched twice a week on occasions when I have needed cheering up! Obviously rent before you purchase. Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffin both do an incredible job and I can't even imagine what the outtakes would be like. That would be something to see!".

I thought the plot was very good although somewhat confusing. As far as comparisons with other movies I would compare it to Rush Hour and Blue Streak with it being slightly better than Blue Streak and not quite as good as Rush Hour. But don't take my word for it go out and see it for yourself I think you'll like it but pay attention it gets confusing.";

For example here is a plot summary there is a good guy Orlando Jones and a bad guy Eddie Griffin who has a dog that hates the good guy but then the good guy is framed by apparently the bad guys using what is called a Double Take but was he really framed by the good guys imitating the bad guys? So then the bad guy Griffin changes places with the good guy Jones. Only to have Jones become a bad guy in another country where the now goodbadguy Griffin killed a really bad guy and stole his dog for evidence only no wait he didn't really kill him either probably another double take i dont remember who really killed him I think it was a bad guy.So then wait Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a  double take on the real bad guys only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad but the undercover cops are good but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good but only until he is bad again.And then.....Well if you made it this far and really want to know watch the movie.It has a few nice points mainly around a beginning that references The Godfather look for oranges which signify death. The bit about Slitz malt liquor is good too.But that is about it a few good quotes does not a good movie make and Double Take gives you the fealing of Heah maybe I can throw a good idea or a zillion at you. One of them has got to stick.The problem is that with so many ideas and concepts and bads and goods and mechanical pen gismos used to call in the national guard Double Take ain't kepn it Real. It sure isn't representing the original 1957 movie idea.Viewed in theatres 35mm Rated1".

	schema:reviewBody "Daryl Chase is a sharp successful businessman and has done nothing but gone up since finishing at Harvard. Freddy Tiffany is a ghetto hustler who talks loud and takes fast. When Freddy hustles Daryl the two become inseparable  even if Daryl would like to get rid of Freddy. When Daryl highlights some inconsistencies in a new account he is targeted and nearly killed however the CIA rescue him at the last minute and tell him he is being watched and protected. However when Daryl finds his secretary murdered the police suspect him and he isn't helped by the fact that he is mistaken for a cop killer and suspect number 1 in the murder of a Mexican politician to boot. On the advice of the CIA Daryl goes on the run to Mexico with Freddy in tow.If my plot summary sounds a little convoluted then maybe you should avoid this film because in the place of a plot the film just keeps on switching around the characters. The plot twists and turns in a very unconvincing fashion and it is a major problem because it is practically impossible to actually care about simply because none of it actually makes any sense. So as far as plot logic goes this is a nonevent and there are only a few redeeming factors that make it worth a look in you're in an undemanding mood. The main factor is the smartmouthed comedy that is delivered with energy by the lead actors it may not be that good but it has some funny scenes and the delivery makes it feel energetic even though you're not laughing that much. Jones is pretty good and makes fun of the ghetto clichs in one of the film's better scenes ordered food on the train but other than that he has the drier role of the two. Griffin is hardly a good actor and he squeezes every drop out of an average urban clich and has the energy to cover for the weak material. I enjoyed his performance even though the script didn't give me much to laugh about.Outside of the scattermouth comedy the film just piles in the usual eye candy to provide distraction if not actual entertainment. In line with the 'excesses over substance' approach of the script the film throws gorgeous black women at us like they were going out of fashion and let me assure you that they are not. In the opening five minutes we have a party at an underwear show for no real reason at which we find that the beautiful Garcelle Beauvais is one of the main models and spends her first scenes in very little clothes. I have no problem with this whatsoever but I did feel bad for Beauvais  NYPD Blue has shown me she is a good actress but this and other films generally use her for her body and nothing else. Likewise we have Eskra wheeled out and a mystifyingly small role for Vivica Fox that made me wonder why she bothered. On top of the sex appeal the film throws on silly action scenes that are never really exciting but do manage to at least be noisy I suppose  again in the absence of actual substance just make sure lots of stuff is going on!Overall this is not a terrible film it is just not a good one. The plot tries to cover for itself by just having illogical twist after illogical twist to the point where I was beaten into submission and just decided to accept whatever it told me and try to let it wash over me! Outside of this we have excesses thrown at us in the form of the energetic delivery that is never hilarious but does throw up the odd good moment while keeping the film moving excesses of eye candy including Beauvais put in underwear and displayed for no other reason that to keep the male audience happy and excesses in action where gunplay is silly and lacking tension but perhaps befitting the rest of the film. Watchable and fun if not actually that funny but many viewers will not be able to enjoy a film that rides on energy and energy alone.".

Whatever the genre of the movie he writes crime action comedy in most cases he masters making it through 2 guys who their differences annoy each other producing a running irony that proves nothing but the fact of the opposite attracts or  most importantly  that 2 incomplete people separately may mean complete one together. Wise Guys  1986 Midnight Run  1988 Trapped in Paradise  1994 with a buddy divided into 2 Bad Boys  1995 which he wrote only its story and Double Take  2001 are examples from Gallo's career. According to that list it's clear that he loves the formula and he's good at it too.Although this round it sounds like a mix of Midnight Run with the insane talkative cop of Bad Boys let alone that there are many knownbyheart tricks framing the good guy chasing him kidnapping the girl dirty cops and the happy end but eventually it managed to score high as original action comedy.The ironic differences between the 2 leads enjoyed me very as one urbane sophisticated rich and one vulgar wild streethustler. The character of Eddie Griffin was fresh it remained unpredictable in a lovely way. Switching characters was creative. And the dog touch was cute. The events were unpredictable too especially the whole second act in the desert and the couple of twists near the end. I liked moments like the dancing match between the 2 leads and the last scene with the Bond's devise used wrongly. The action scenes have been done perfectly. The image was hot exactly like the pace. And it's wonderful to know that it's directed by the scriptwriter Gallo himself. It seems that he can be notable action director.I'm not fond of Griffin he's always loud with heavy profanity and hence he made the matter of being undercover brother totally unconvincing So how about turning into James Bond at the end as well ?!. Yet I must admit he  despite all of that  was relatively funny and with vague always surprising character there was even more fun. I have always believed that Orlando Jones is whether underrated actor or the unluckiest of them all. He can play comedy stealing the lights from everybody as he did in Evolution  2001. And he can play the serious part with mimicking its opposite finely as in here. So why he isn't a star yet cashing millions as Tom Cruse for low instance ?! It's your typical delicious sandwich however from another restaurant. And the result is nearly the same ingredients a bit different taste with the same treat. Here's the professor of the course teaches us how to remake the same with new plot and different characters and be fresh and entertaining well that's the craft's creativity. It just kills me that his next script for the same formula would be The Whole Ten Yards  2004 where he lost being entertaining rather bearable !".

Eddie Griffin and Orlando Jones such great actors who put up one hell of a performance. They became their respective characters which is why the movie turned out to be great. Every part of the movie is a double take something's going on and you mightmay not miss it or you wouldn't know whom to believe. So you clearly experience what Daryl Chase Orlando Jones is going through. Over all the movie is brilliant if you are looking for quality action and comedy then this is a must own DVD or you can always rent it but the movie deserves a lot better than a rent. I have the DVD since 2004. And been watching it often till today.George Gallo is awesome incarnate. This man is the brainchild behind some of the massive actioncomedyadventurecrimethriller genre movies. MIDNIGHT RUN and BAD BOYS to mention.".

There is something to be said for rinks that have chain link fencing in stead of glass every tryout has one or two guys that trip over the blue line untouched fighting at tryouts and yes there are Canadian towns which are old and run down.  The social aspects of the movie are definately true the woman that every guy has been with the initiating of the rookie silly girls at the local bar and of course the unruley fans.

	schema:reviewBody "...what Youngblood attempts which is to tell the story of an up and coming star at a crucial point in his hockey career.  Of all the hockey movies I've seen including Slap Shot The Mighty Ducks movies The Cutting Edge which focuses on hockey for only the beginning of the film and the VanDamme actionfilm Sudden Death which in my opinion is the absolute worst hockeyrelated movie ever made the plot of Youngblood is the most reasonable to me.  I have not seen Mystery Alaska but from a friend of mine's description it sounds quite farfetched.  although I suppose a group of Alaskans probably would have a chance against the Rangers I was born late in 1979 and first saw Youngblood when I was quite young. In fact it was the first hockey movie I ever saw and to date the only one I own.  Part of my fascination with this film resulted from my passion for the sport of ice hockey which I began playing at the age of 4 and maintained competitively through the collegiate level.What I like most about Youngblood is that the story is centered around one player Dean and his struggles to advance his career despite his talent. The obstacles he faces in the film lack of toughness and clashing with the coach and knowing his chances to go pro are running slim are typical themes hockey players share as they advance toward the ultimate goal of one day playing in the NHL.  While Slapshot is hockey's cult classic it is more like Animal House on Ice than a realistic attempt to portray ice hockey which Youngblood attempts and quite honestly a film of such nature should be produced for the avid hockey fans around the world.Without a doubt Youngblood fails to portray skillful hockey and the office action only mildly captures the life of a junior hockey player but had the proper research been done and certain changes made preproduction Youngblood could have joined Slapshot in hockey fans' movie collections. The games needed to be faster the dialogue snappier especially the Keanu Reeves brainbusters and the Rockyish training diminished the quality of the film because not only would Dean not go from being the weakest in the league to kicking the toughest guy's butt in a week but most wannabe professionals and junior teams have regimented training programs to follow on a regular basis and do not begin two days before the championship game of the league they're in.Cutting that scene could have made room for a far more realistic side of the game such as Dean being contacted by prospective coaches agents and other interested parties to notify him they'd be coming to watch his games. like most prospects with hopes of going pro have to deal withDean simply mentions that he wants to go pro and needs to play juniors if he's going to get a contract but that is the last we hear about him playing pro aside from mentioning it to Jessie coach Chadwick's sexy daughter and Dean's love interest.  From my experiences any player in junior hockey who did not receive a fair amount of attention from scouts was quite likely not going anywhere so there should have been some effort to include them to advance the plot of his odds of making it because scouts would have certainly had more influence on Dean playing tougher than anyone in the film does although in reality his teammates should have been getting on him too.As for character interplay Dean's relationship with Chadwick's daughter is entertaining if farfetched.  Perhaps the most realistic relationship between characters in the film is the one between Sutton and Youngblood as the top talents of hockey teams often have an appreciation for one another and palup off the ice.  Not to mention the Hollywood impact on the film is the only logical explanation for Youngblood leaving the team after Sutton's injury.  In all my years as a player I'd never heard of that one although I suppose it just explains Dean's irrational behavior resulting from his conflicts with coach Chadwick and his nemesis Racki.On the whole I appreciate this movie but I certainly wish it had more of an advanced pace and that it better explored and explained some of the typical stereotypes of hockey players that it shows star player chases and gets the girl everyone wants the bar scene the initiation the opposing team's heckling fans etc.As a longtime hockey player and fan who now studies Scriptwriting at Ithaca College I feel somewhat obligated to pen a truetolife hockey film for the diehard lovers of the game out there.  Somebody needs to!!  Youngblood if nothing else at least will make a decent reference.".

The romance between Dean and Jessie actually doesn't seem forced the two of them have a certain chemistry that is quite obvious to viewers like myself. Cynthia Gibb is allnatural in her role as Jessie and Patrick Swayze evokes empathy in the viewer as the highschool dropout who is this close to being a pro hockey player.

Since Slap Shot an undoubtedly awesome classic to all hockey fans around the world there had not been an attempt at a movie that mainly focused on hockey.  The makers of this movie had to be creative to attract attention for the sport.  For example the stick fight the constant beautiful goals the way he won the fight.  It had some reality to it like the jokes played on the rookie in the bar and when they shave him you know down there. The way he was put up in someones house.  The most impressive thing about the movie was the beginning and how it set up the rest of the movie.  It starts with a home video of DeanRob Lowe when he was very young playing with his older brother and their friends.  It shows how clearly dominant he was and that leads into the present time with him saying I've been offered a tryout with the Hamilton Mustangs.   And to Canadians who feel like this movie disrespected your great sport yes i mean GREAT sport remember this.  When they are on their way to Canada Deans older brother who is driving him says you are gonna have to learn Oh Canada and also when Dean says They'll never catch me showing cockiness like he's superior to anyone in the league his brother says Oh they'll catch you.

It is the best Ice Hockey movie i have ever seen and he also gets a hot babe in the film too. When he is taught how to fight u know its a  predictable ending but at the same time u just really want to see him kick that bad guys ass.My advice is watch it enjoy it and as long as u dont over hype it the film will be most enjoyable".

	schema:reviewBody "I know nothing about hockey but managed to learn a few things from watching this formulaic sports story.One is that a goalie has to be extremely supple. He must be able to do splits comfortably. And there is an unsettling scene towards the end just before Rob Lowe's penalty shot when the goalie of the enemy team that's the proper term extends one ugly padded leg in one direction and kneels on the other then slithers slowly back and forth in front of the net like a dangerous eel or serpent. He also apparently gets to wear a mask as threatening as he likes  skulls a mass of stitches any design will do.Another thing I learned is that hockey isn't all speed and skill with the stick. The teams the referees the coaches the fans are all allowed to stand back and not interfere with two players who have decided to duke it out first with sticks like Medieval jousters then with bare fists like kids in a junior high school playground. The fight can last a long time until one of the combatants hits the dirt or rather the ice.There's nothing much new about the plot. Lowe is a natural talent on the ice but must quit for a time during his rise to celebrity in order to overcome some personal demons and then return to become the star he was always destined to be.He's only seventeen years old and gets hazed when he joins the Mustangs. But he makes a friend too Patrick Swayze who tells him that nothing absolutely nothing compares to playing in the rink. I figured Swayze at once for a paralyzing Cspine injury that would turn him into a mummy from the neck down. I almost got it right.Then there's Racki an ugly name for a gargantuan enemy player given to smashing members of the other team and playing dirty. I figured Lowe would wind up beating him to a pulp. Bingo.Then there's Cynthia Gibb as the daughter of Lowe's manager Ed Lauter. Lauter doesn't like the team even looking at her. But how could anyone not? She was a model at fourteen and is now the cutest cleanest face on the screen since Sandra Dee but less debauched than Sandra Dee always appeared what with her Bayonne accent.Gibbs' Dad and Gibbs' own reluctance to have her date a team member are soon overcome. The obstacle is perfunctory. We've already seen Lowe's manly chest and buns of steel which are pretty revolting but we get the merest glimpse of Cynthia Gibbs' far more graceful nudity. She can't act but it doesn't matter because Lowe can't act either. That doesn't stop them from being beautiful people.Patrick Swayze on the other hand gives a convincing performance as an experienced player. I've always admired Swayze a dancer singersongwriter horse breeder who trained at the Joffrey Ballet  and was from Texas. Died a way we don't want to die.Best performance award goes to  envelope please  Eric Nesterenko as Lowe's Dad. It's not a bravura performance. It's a reassuring one. He has the same sympatico quality on screen that Richard Farnsworth once had or that Werner Herzog has now. If I were to spill the beans to someone I wouldn't mind if the listener were someone like Nesterenko. Of course that's his screen persona. In real life he may get his kicks pulling the wings off flies.This isn't any masterpiece of film making. You can pretty readily call the shots. But it's better than I'd expected it to be which may or may not be saying much since my expectations were pretty low to begin with.".

In fact that's the story of Youngblood that of a player who values his looks a lot more than mixing it up on the ice to help win a game.Try as I might I just can't see Rob Lowe as a hockey player even one who won't get down and dirty. He's a speedy fellow on the ice and it's his speed that gets him a berth on a Canadian minor league hockey team on which he has teammates like Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves. The best scene in the film is where Rob Lowe gets literally raped by the unofficial landlady of the team Fionula Flannagan. Apparently she gets first dibs on all the new hockey players in helping them keep their equipment in working order. Considering before Lowe she had both Swayze and Reeves I'd say she's quite the mechanic.Rob has a more serious involvement with Cynthia Gibb who is the daughter of Coach Ed Lauter. But she's also daddy's little girl which doesn't help matters.Our Canadian reviewers say that Youngblood is a gross distortion of Canadian hockey. I'm in no position to comment but I've seen enough to know that it's a sport where violence is the norm and if you can't mix it up and are not willing to risk your good looks you won't last too long.Youngblood is now 23 years old and assuming Rob Lowe's character had a decent sized playing career I guarantee that Rob today would not look like the fellow who worked for President Martin Sheen in the West Wing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1986 prior to the opening of this film some press was spilt about the level of dedication pretty boy actor Rob Lowe was going to for the title role such as bulking up a bit for the role and the extensive training to make the hockey scenes as authentic as possible. After all that preparation it seems a shame that the end result is a predictable largely generic feelgood sports film set on the ice. Lowe is the title character who in a whirlwind of activity becomes a force to be reckoned with on the ice. And I mean whirlwind  in the space of 2448 hours Lowe leaves home arrives in the city is seduced by his mature landlady gets on the wrong side of a brutal hockey player wins a spot on the team gets caught with his pants down by the coach's daughter Cynthia Gibb subsequently starts a flirtation with her is hazed by the team members in a rather humiliating fashion and wins the respect of veteran player Patrick Swayze. One can accuse the film of much but being boring is certainly not one of them. There are things that work well in the film. The hockey scenes seem authentic and rousing even though there is rarely ever any doubt about where the film is headed. Lowe and Gibb share a certain amount of chemistry and the camaraderie among the teammates including an unknown at the time Keanu Reeves feels accurate. Swayze is also fairly solid in a typical role of semimentor. Unfortunately the film is hampered by its formula. There are certain steps that it needs to hit by rote and it is at best moderately enjoyable to see it hit them. Part of the problem rests with the leading man. At the time Lowe was dismissed as little better than a Teen Beat sensation which is a bit unfair. However even his most ardent Fans must admit that Lowe fares much better in ensemble pieces The West Wing The Stand Brothers and Sisters where his shortcomings can be muted than he does as a leading man where his lack of charisma starts to come into play. Despite his hard work Lowe never seems completely believable or at ease in the central role which has a tendency to throw the film off its stride. Yet there are still reasons to watch. Hockey fans will enjoy the onice action romance fans will probably find something to like in the relationship between Lowe and Gibb and Lowe fans will have the guilty pleasure of seeing him in what has become his essential nude scene  embarrassed and trapped in a public hallway in a filled to capacity jockstrap while being ogled by Gibb. Any of those aspects are certainly worth a painless couple of hours to take in the film.".

Even though we shouldn't know what hockey is about.  When I find a hockey game in cable TV I want to see it. Rob Lowe portrays a hockey ace in advance.  His father is a farmer who works with his older brother a former player.  Youngblood wants to play in New York but first he must increase his level of hockey and personality because hockey is a rude sport.  He falls in love with the coach's daughter and tries to get the friendship of the star of the team name is Derek Sutton Patrick Swayze. We are not naive he'll be a star I wonder if he'll play in Madison Square Garden scoring a hattrick in the final game. I liked both performances Lowe and Swayze but I recognized a great work of Cinthia Gibb as Youngblood's girl.  Like Maradona in soccer from a simple home to a star.  I liked this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "As a Canadian and a hockey fan I was insulted by the style of this movie and how poorly our Canadian game was potrayed.  I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone however it is 15 years old  fairly predictable. So we have an American teenager who is a complete wuss playing in a nothing hocky league who goes to Canada to play junior.  He manages to play well score with the coaches daughter leave his team because his friendteamate gets severely injured comes back for the big game  scores a hat trick 3 goals no less to win it.  Then he fights the toughfest goon in the league in a stick fight???  And wins???  That whole scenario actually happening is as about as believable as Keanu Reeves French Canadian accent and Patrick Swayze as some hard core hockey player.  Albeit junior hockey is pretty rough there are more fights however I do not believe there is such a thing as a stick fight nor do you ever see a coach jump into the stands  fight with a fanand it is a rarity to see a skilled player who is not a fighter engage in a fight with a total goon and win.  Hockey wise this movie blows.  And as for the love story what can I say accept that it is fromage 80's.  This movie is watchable but you can't help but feel embarassed for the people who are in this movie.".

So we have an American teenager who is a complete wuss playing in a nothing hocky league who goes to Canada to play junior.  He manages to play well score with the coaches daughter leave his team because his friendteamate gets severely injured comes back for the big game  scores a hat trick 3 goals no less to win it.  Then he fights the toughfest goon in the league in a stick fight???  And wins???  That whole scenario actually happening is as about as believable as Keanu Reeves French Canadian accent and Patrick Swayze as some hard core hockey player.  Albeit junior hockey is pretty rough there are more fights however I do not believe there is such a thing as a stick fight nor do you ever see a coach jump into the stands  fight with a fanand it is a rarity to see a skilled player who is not a fighter engage in a fight with a total goon and win.  Hockey wise this movie blows.  And as for the love story what can I say accept that it is fromage 80's.  This movie is watchable but you can't help but feel embarassed for the people who are in this movie.";

You never saw John Wayne hockeying on ice nor James Dean. Rob Lowe is actually pretty good and the film is made with the absolute maximum amount of seriousness available which seems to be a lot. Everyone seems to be into Ice Hockey its just that also assume their audience is too. There's not a single bit of effort put into making us like or appreciate the sport. Its more played as a human drama with the sport and its coaches providing tension for the protagonist. Its like the real bad guy is the sport itself. Its pretty funny. I know I said Rob Lowe was pretty good but the other funny thing about this movie is when Rob Lowe is called upon to act tough. Rob Lowe can be privileged a prettyboy a flirt witty charming maybe creepy or dangerous... But tough? I had to laugh. There's not a tough bone in his body yet here he is getting physical with some dudes and the second half of the movie is mainly concerned with him winning a physical fight. I just you know don't get it. Also the movie is pretty of its time very 80's soundtrack so if that's what you're after help yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was with some trepidation that I watched this movie I loved it as a kid like I did Crocodile Dundee and it's sequel both of which disappointed me upon rewatching them recently. Plot In A Paragraph Dean Youngblood Rob Lowe a 17yearold farmhand from New York has dreams of playing in the National Hockey League. He is granted the chance to travel to Canada to try out for the Hamilton Mustangs. At the tryouts Youngblood displays the talent which got him 92 goals in the New York League but also displays a lack of physical toughness that is so prized in Canadian hockey. This weakness is pounced upon by a brutish player Carl Racki George J. Finn who is also trying out for the team and engages him in a fight. Youngblood quickly learns that flashiness and pure athletic ability will not be enough to be successful in this league. Despite being beat up by by Racki the coach opts to select Youngblood for a spot on the team. He ingratiates himself to the other players and particularly Captain Derek Sutton Patrick Swayze and the coach's daughter Jessie Cynthia Gibb its not long before Racki reappears playing for a rival team. Rob Lowe is good as Dean Youngblood he is pretty enough for the pretty boy tag and looks in good shape. Cynthia Gibb is very attractive as Jessie Chadwick and what an ass she has!! I loved it!! Ed Lauter is a lot of fun as Coach Murray Chadwick and George J. Finn is imposing and does a good job as Carl Racki. However Patrick Swayze steals this movie yes even away from Cynthia Gibb's wonderful ass as Derek Sutton. He is brilliant and a reminder of what a talent we have lost. Keanu Reeves had a small role as Heaver one of Lowe and Swayze's team mates.".

It's about Ice Hockey alwasys a good start and an up and coming US player who goes over the border to Canada to play having been scouted in the hope of making a career for himself. Starring Rob Lowe as the titular Dean Youngblood Patrick Swayze as Derek Sutton the Team Captain and Cythia Gibb as the love interest it's a typical 80's star vehicle when Rob Lowe as a member of the Brat Pack and seemed to be in everything The Outsiders St Elmo's Fire About Last Night etc. Everything about it screams 80s and I'm not entirely sure it's aged well it's shot very simply but some nice set pieces such as Lowe working out or skatetraining sessions. The chemistry between Lowe and Swayze is brotherly a bromance after the initiation at least and they had played brothers only a few years before in The Outsiders  Darry and Sodapop Curtis.Whilst this is a an underdogdoesgood sports film it isn't so Hollywood and without drama and it's not a typical happy ending. The skating scenes are really good Swayze throws himself into the physicality of the role in typical fashion. I'm sure some stunt skaters were used but possibly the actors were icefamiliar anyway. Keanu Reeves has a minor comedic and with some great one liners role and was a goalie at school and he plays Heaver the goalie with the Mustangs. Much of the story is predictable but there's also a few twists and whilst the acting isn't stunning Gibb is the weakest link the skating and the comedy makes this a fab film  especially the bar scene when Dean first joins the team. The love scene is a little cringeworthy more so when I first saw this especially in connection with the wonderful Miss McGill Fionnula Flanagan. I guarantee you'll never hear the phrase Room Service? without smiling and you'll never look at a cup of tea the same way again. LOL.".

The Hockey action is exciting and intense and George J. Finn is fantastic as dirty goon Racki you will hate him for the stuff he pulls plus I loved the opening with YoungbloodLowe strutting His stuff with Hockey skills and I loved all the neat tricks he did. Sure it may look a little cheap at times but it didn't bother me a bit and some people complained the story was dull and boring but I found it to be very engaging and interesting plus it has one funny moment where Ed Lauter Coach Chadwick catches Lowe with a Nympho Book. You will love the end cause it's a great underdog story and The Hockey scenes felt very realistic plus watch out for Keanu Reeves who plays the Goalie!. Overall This is an awesome Hockey film and I say it's an absolute must see!.  out of 5The Acting is great!. Rob Lowe does a terrific job here as Dean Youngblood he had great Hockey skills and while he may have looked a little stiff at times he really came through in most of the scenes and you will especially feel for him near the end with what happened to Swayze's character I feel this may be his best role!. Patrick Swayze is very good here in his role as Sutton he's cocky but lovable and cracked me up a couple of times I just wished he had more screen time. Cynthia Gibb is not bad as Chadwick's daughter she shared good chemistry with Lowe and was a Cutie to boot!. Ed Lauter is good as the strict yet likable coach he cracked me up as well. Jim Youngs does a good job as Lowe's brother. Eric Nesterenko does alright as the Father considering he was a famous Hockey player!. George J. Finn is fantastic as Racki you will hate his guts as he actually made me think he was a despicable goon. Keanu Reeves is OK as the the goalie he was a bit goofy for my tastes I dig the guy but it's not one of his better roles loll.".

I don't want to give away too much but I do want to say that the last scene of the movie will leave you speechless. It had me thinking OMG that was AMAZING how they came up with that twist. One last thing I loved about this movie was that it was well planned out and thought of unlike the forth movie which was a joke and in my opinion shouldn't have never been made. The deaths weren't rushed as opposed to the deaths in the forth movie and it gave more screen time to introduce us to the characters. Note I will say that there is one death scene in the movie that I didn't see coming besides the ending. I recommend you see this movie. It might have the same theme as the first four movies but unlike the first four it's on a much higher scale.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death is just as omnipresent as ever and is unleashed after one man's premonition saves a group of coworkers from a terrifying suspension bridge collapse. But this group of unsuspecting souls was never supposed to survive and in a terrifying race against time the illfated group frantically tries to discover a way to escape Death's sinister agenda.   C Warner Bros If you're going in to see FD5 it's because you know what you're expecting. Although I'm a fan of the series I'll admit it did show its staleness after FD2 which is arguably the series' high point. As expected the formula hasn't changed although there are a few new tweaks here the main one including the addition that the survivors can now kill someone to take their life and maybe just maybe escape Death's clutches. It's interesting to note that this new twist is the opposite of what was offered in FD2 in which new life can defeat Death but taking life is much more readily apparent and dramatic than creating new life. Not only do they have to worry about Death but they also have to worry about what they are willing to do to survive which provides some very tense external conflict between the characters. As you guys might have figured out from the above yes FD5 has a plot this time around. There's also an unexpected ending that you will make you go OMG or WTF if it isn't already spoiled to you of course. It's also good to know that Eric Heisserer's tight script devotes some time to the survivors that are getting picked off. You start to feel for them as they are about to die. As much as I'm thankful for this it's obvious that people still see these films for the opening disaster and death sequences and they do not disappoint. Without spoiling anything the opening bridge disaster is a nasty piece of work utilizing the 3D to the fullest extent. I'm a huge horror fan but even I found it very hard to watch jerking my hands back as each character is killed off in grisly ways. Without a doubt it's the best opening disaster since FD2. And the death scenes. Wow. They are disturbing funny and shocking and sometimes all at the same time. This is because newcomer director Steven Quale plays with the audience's expectations. He lays out so many things that can kill off a character in a certain scene and when you think this sharp object will impale them they die in a completely different way. The build up is what makes these films fun to watch apart from the last one. I also liked the fact that this film returned to the original film's serious roots which isn't to say that it takes itself too seriously because there's an underlying sense of dark humor that's strangely entertaining and selfaware of itself. The ensemble cast is a mixed bag for sure. Our protagonist Nicholas D'Agosto doesn't really live up to his character's dramatic arc. He seems to overact his lines although he was much better in the second half. Emma Bell is a bit better although she wasn't as good as she was in FROZEN. Miles Fisher also doesn't live up to his character's internal struggle when giving off a whiny performance. However the other supporting castmembers are quite good including Ellen Wroe Jacqueline MacInnes Wood and Arlen Escarpeta. P.J. Byrne in particular is someone you should look out for providing some of the film's biggest laughs playing a character you just love to hate. David Koechner also provides some great laughs. I was disappointed with Courtney B. Vance though because he had little to do. Tony Todd is back since he was last seen in FD2 and he's like the American version of Snape from Harry Potter. I love the way he delivers his lines with one...word...at...a...time. Visually the film has some above average production values. As said before the bridge sequence is like something from a 100 million budgeted action flick. The 3D is the best that has been offered so far this year which comes to no surprise seeing that Quale has worked with James Cameron on AVATAR. Even from the film's ingenious and original opening credits we have shards of glass knives bodies and blood flying at us in amazing sharpness. Yet the 3D gimmick can only go so far and Quale knows that so he doesn't overdo it by providing us with scenes of depth. Honestly it's the best of both worlds. The soundtrack by Brian Tyler is great as well and is definitely different from the previous entries. All in all FD5 brings unexpected new life to the dying franchise. The plot is handled well and most of the performances are good. If anything this sequel proves that with new blood working behind the scenes can come a refreshing film. If you want to see the film by all means see it in 3D because it is worth every penny. FD5 is shocking entertaining suspenseful funny disturbing and is probably as good as FD2. It seems to be a good year for 5's FAST FIVE included.".

However after hearing a lot of negative feedback on the 4th FD I decided not to watch it and hung my head in disappointment. I genuinely thought my favorite deadly franchise had finally bit the dust itself and in a bad way. But when I heard about this fifth and final Final Destination I decided to give it one more chance. Because hey I hadn't been to the theater in awhile and if it sucked I'd at least have a good laugh. But I am very happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by Final Destination 5.The story as other reviewers have mentioned really sets FD5 up to good prospects. It feels a lot more like the first FD much darker without being too complex. I honestly liked the 2nd and 3rd ones a lot but they were missing the creepy factor that the first installment had. This fifth episode really brings it back. The characters are surprisingly believable. Granted you have the gratuitous hot chick and ladies man but the characters never feel contrived or forced. Kudos to the actors for keeping this from being a 5bin campy horror film.The effects even in 2D were just as I think a film's effects should be realistic enough to avoid the fakefactor but not so excessive that they drown out everything else in the film. Yes one could argue that these movies are all about death but what always made them different for me from other horrors was the focus on buildup. The FD franchise has it's fans trained to watch for every little thing in a scene that could cause someone's demise until your skin crawlsand FD5 gives the audience this detective feeling perfectly.To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of this movie. However from the very beginning I was impressed. A few points of warning it is very graphic but anyone who has seen any of the other FD films should know that already. Also you will not enjoy this film as much if you haven't watched at least the 1st FD if not the 2nd and 3rd as well. When you factor in the story and characters the death and mayhem we've all come to love and one of the best plot twists I've seen this year FD5 is very worth watching. Go on have some fun.But you all just be careful now. ".

And if you are then know that my review is based on my fandom and in relation to the series itself. Therefore it will be in the context of horror films slasher films and more importantly the series itself. With that out of the way who would have though the fifth film would be the one. Ever since the original the series has sort of meandered around trying to recapture the initial wonder of death playing the part of a slasher and killing off a group of people. Yes Final Destination 5 is truly the best sequel since the first. There hasn't been this much tension and creativity since the original and practically every scene is filled with an uncomfortable level of anxiety. This is what the film has truly been missing whether spoiled by the trailers before it or just a lack of creativity. For the most part Final Destination 3 and 4 TFD lacked the necessary level of creativity and menace that was present in the first film and even in the second. However we have plenty of that here and a few nice twists as well. While the kills are also pretty ridiculous most are plausible and unlike TFD should please fans with their level of gore and brutality.The filmmaking qualities here reach above the standard the film has set. It looks great with plenty of swift and enticing editing that will make your skin crawl with anticipation. The acting while still not of any award winning caliber or even really all that great is decent enough here. The portrayals are more realistic this time around. While the film had though to settle into the Ifoundtheanswersontheinternet routine here we have a smooth flow in which characters sort of lose their mind trying to figure things out. And while some might have called the main couple's relationship cringe worthy I actually found it to be quite well played out as the couple has real issues they work through on top of everything that's going on. Suffice to say it's nice to see the FD series making better attempts at developing it's characters. Still not great but better.With that said this is Final Destination and problems persist. Despite better attempts at character development the majority still play fodder for death's machinations. Sure we learn a little about them but it's not any more than the bare minimum this guys a jerk that girls wild etc etc. There is also one kill in particular that while brutal defies logic. Sure it's FD but there is a certain point of ridiculousness where the line is drawn. The characters trying to figure out what's going on is also getting old. There's certainly a reason here which I won't spoil why our characters don't know about what is happening in the same way characters from previous films know. But this leads to the problem of it being explained too quickly. This might contradict what I said above but what I mean is that Tony Todd's character if far too quick to reveal information and the new twist. In comparison to FD1 where things had a slow natural pacing here we get a couple death scenes and explanation and then more death scenes. The progression is better but still not as good as the first two films. Fans will truly enjoy this solid sequel. There are a couple twists and the final scene will blow everyone away. It's beyond what you would expect and very nearly worth seeing the film alone. But with a handful of creative and brutal twists and a decently put together film this should certainly warrant a decent box office and maybe unfortunately another sequel or two.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning spoilers MIGHT be ahead. The Final Destination franchise began going downhill rapidly from the third movie. But will the fifth movie help the franchise go back up or will it continue going downhill fast? I saw this movie about a month ago and I must say that in my opinion this is the most brutal the most gruesome and the most clever movie of the entire franchise. It has many wellthought out death scenes and one death scene in the movie made me cringe and look away and trust me I watched A LOT of slashergornography films. One of the most famous scene is the lasik surgery which I thought was pretty good. I'm not going to spoil it for you. First off this movie has a very interesting plot line. As you heard from the trailer you know the new death rule and I think it is pretty clever. But why didn't Bludworth tell it to the others? Hmmm...? Second of all the characters are very very relatable. You can actually tell if one hates the other and one is friends with the other for a long time. Plus you will also feel bad if one character dies. You will actually say Oh why did heshe die? NOOO! Not just a typical Oh heshe died. Who's next?. The acting is very impressive hence the professional and experienced actors. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie made it to my highest rank of the Final Destination franchise. Third what is this franchise famous of? Exactly the unique death scenes that happens from the materialsplaces we seego to everyday. There are some death scenes here that are very gruesome that if I picture it I either cringe or smile on how good the death scenes are. One death scene made it to my top 15 most brutal death scenes I have ever seen. Some of you might know it some of you might not. One thing for sure is you will know it when you see the movie in August. Lastly the ending of the whole movie. The ending that made me gasp and left my jaw dropped open for the rest of the movie. It is a pity that many people know it already and spoiled it for everyone because thy will not be as surprised as everybody on the screening when we reached the ending of the movie. All I gotta tell you is rewatch the whole franchise and soak in every scene you see..  So this review might not be as long as you want it or as detailed as you hoped for. But all I have to say is watch the movie. It is way worth your money and your time.".

Very much improved visual  effects here. The 3D was executed better than the 4th as well.  Character wise it was obvious they did better casting Nicholas Tony  Emma. I truly wanted some of these randoms to live. Deaths here are  top notch very blunt and very cringe worthy. This movie truly did  improve on all aspects that the 3rd and 4th lacked...a creepy realistic  feel. A few new aspects are thrown in as well which help keep the story  fresh and not feel repetitive. If you are ready for this 3D  rollercoaster then go see this well made guilty pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I saw FD5 at its midnight release after purchasing my tickets days in advance. Yes I'm that big of a fan next to Nightmare on Elm Street the FD franchise is my favorite. I don't want to make this a long review but I will sum up my thoughts on this movie in one word AMAZING! FD 5 is IMO the best installment to the franchise and in some cases surpasses the original. From start to finish the movie is full of suspense tension excitement and anticipation. It's enough to keep ME someone who has followed this movie's production for the past year and knew just about everything about the movie going into it at the edge of my seat. Yes I knew who'd die when they'd die and how they'd die even before stepping foot into the theater. But regardless I wasn't let down one bit. This movie unlike the others minus the 1st succeeded in giving character development. The death scenes were awesome and not too overly fictional and even managed to throw in a new rule kill or be killed. Which gave a breath of fresh air to the almost stale plot that we all know of. The premonition scene is definitely the best of the franchise and the acting was on par. Not Oscar worthy but definitely believable for what it is. I just can't say enough how great this movie is. Now I won't spoil anything for anyone but the ending was EPIC! Words can't describe how amazing it was. Steven Quale did wonders with the use of 3D as well. Should it be seen in 3D? YES! The film was shot in 3D and Quale knew when to emphasize the use of it without shoving it in our faces except for the extra long title sequence and credits. Anyways while I loved this movie and everything about it it did have a few things about it that underwhelmed me. The use of CGI blood was a bit more than I wanted and at some points did look a bit fake. Also some parts of the film were a bit too comedic. The comedic level should have been toned down for a particular scene I'm looking at YOU Issac. Other than that the movie was fantastic and an excellent installment into the FD family. I really recommend this movie but only to those at least knowing what they are getting themselves into.".

Very few film series get this privilege on my part Saw and Paranormal Activity are some of the few that come to mind for me. And if there's one thing I've learnt along the way from the Final Destination films it's that there isn't a lot of areas to continue to be creative in. In fact for me the only interchangeable area is really how the characters die. And fortunately that's been enough to keep some of us coming back.So was Final Destination 5 inventive enough with the death scenes? Not in my opinion no. It all felt very 'seen it all before' and while they were able to shock us occasionally with the resulting method of death there still wasn't enough surprise there.I think Final Destination 5 needs to be the last film in the series. And not just because it's all getting a bit stale but also because it was a really good way to wrap it up. At the end of the film we are treated to a twist that the whole film was in fact a prequel to the first Final Destination. And no they didn't cheat there were indeed hints to it throughout the film. This was a nice touch and would mean that the fourth film in the series 'The Final Destination' was actually still somewhat true to its title. A really great series that I will remember for a long time I just hope it stops here.".

	schema:headline " A Fun Roller Coaster Gorefest! Must see in 3D!";
	schema:reviewBody "No matter where you run no matter where you hide you can't cheat  death. Or can you? Final Destination 5 brings the franchise to an end  with an over the top roller coaster ride of an experience. Did they  save the best for last or should the franchise have died a long time  ago?  STORY  On a clear sunny morning Sam and a group of his coworkers from a  paper plant assemble to attend a corporate retreat. They jump on a  chartered bus and head off for the weekend. While stopped in traffic on  a bridge something goes horribly wrong. The suspension bridge that is  under construction starts to crumble and collapse. What comes next are  some of the most violent death sequences imaginable.  But wait was it a dream? Sam wakes up on the bus and notices that  things he just imagined are starting to really happen. He yells at  everyone to get off the bus and run like hell. Just then the bridge  cables snap and the concrete shatters. Sam's vision is coming true.  Thankfully he was able to save the majority of his friends or the  Lucky 8 as the local news calls them.  But the peril is not over for Sam and his friends. One by one the  Lucky 8 start dying in horrific accidents. At every incident a dark  ominous figure lurks in the shadows. When questioned the man tells the  survivors that they were suppose to die on the bridge and that Death is  coming for them to balance the equation. However if they can be  replaced by the death of another then Death will spare them and they  will take on the that person's lifespan. A few of the survivors heed  the words of the stranger and decide that in order to live they have to  kill someone to take their place.  OVERVIEW  Let's face it if you have seen any of the Final Destination movies you  already know what this movie is about and what happens. Lets face it  the plot is pretty thin. The movie really is just a series of  grotesque bloody crazy far fetched death scenes. The acting is  pretty shallow and the dialog is corny. With that being said it is a  fun ass movie! I never went Oh and Ah so many times in a theater.  Imagine watching a train hit a semi truck full of cows. That is what  Final Destination 5 is all about. Every one in the audience roared  cheered and even laughed at how fantastical people were killed. When  you see this movie your jaw will drop and you will squirm in your seat.  The cast is headed by Nicholas D'Agosto as Sam the guy who sees the  vision. Emma Bell plays Sam's girlfriend Molly. And Miles Fisher as  Peter Sam's friend and boss. The rest of the ensemble cast plays the  stereotypical horror film roles The cute athletic girl the goth  slutty chick the horny Jewish guy the token black guy and the  asshole corporate boss. The biggest star of the show was a cameo by  Candyman himself Tony Todd. Todd plays the bearer of bad news to the  survivors.  The film was directed by Steven Quale which marks his feature film  debut. He has worked visual effects with James Cameron on Terminator 2  The Abyss Titanic and Avatar. His expertise with those movies is what  make Final Destination 5 so insanely crazy to watch. What I really  liked was the magic trick he played with the audience. He would  distract you with what you thought was going to kill the characters and  before you knew it something else jumps in and throws off your  instincts. He kept the audience guessing.  I am not a big proponent of 3D. Most audiences today hate the higher  ticket prices just to watch a darker less colorful version. Very few  movies does the technology work. Final Destination 5 is one of those  movies you absolutely positively have to see in 3D to truly appreciate  the full effect. The movie starts off with 5 minutes of in your face  visuals during the opening credits. Objects involved in the deaths of  previous characters is thrown at you in slow motion while they shatter  glass. The opening credits set the pace for the film with the over the  top visuals that you can only appreciate in 3D.  Final Destination 5 is not going to win an Oscar maybe an MTV Movie  Award though. It is filled with so much carnage that the weak of heart  better stay home. But that's what we want in a horrorthriller flick.  We want to jump in our seats and cringe at the gore. We want to hold  onto our significant other's arm and look away at the scary parts. We  want to watch in disbelief just as we would a brutal car crash. I am  telling you that I had so much fun watching Final Destination 5 that I  want you to experience it for yourself. And please see it in 3D. You  will not be disappointed.  P.S. Pay very close attention in the last scene especially to what one  of the characters is holding in his hand. You'll totally understand  what I am talking about when you see it.".

But I suppose they were just having fun seeing all the money the series was making and decided to give it another try. But how about giving us something different? And boy did they ever! I have to say that this is by far next to the first one my favorite of the Final Destination films. As silly and over the top as they are you know you go into these films just looking forward to the death scenes. Death has a very clever way of killing people he's like the Mouse Trap gamehe just likes to have fun I guess. Tony Todd is back to give the premonition warnings to the new group of teens which one looks like a cross breed between Tom Cruise and Brandon Roth and one who I knew that mole looked familiar from Election! Sorry I just love it when I guess an actor right off the bat. But believe me when I say this is one of the best sequels by far with a great twist ending.Sam is on his way to a company retreat with his coworkers. While his bus is crossing North Bay Bridge Sam suffers a premonition that the bridge will collapse where everyone including him is killed. Panicked he persuades his girlfriend Molly his friends Peter and Nathan Peter's girlfriend Candice his boss Dennis Olivia and coworker Isaac to leave the bridge before it collapses. Following the memorial service local coroner William Bludworth mysteriously warns the survivors that they have cheated Death. They ignore his warnings and move on with their lives. Of course in order they are killed off one by one learning how they have to put a sacrifice in their place in order to get out of death.I had a small feeling in my gut with the ending as I'm about to spoil it so please don't read on further. Sam mentions he has a flight to Paris and I was like wait in the first film wasn't the group on a trip to Paris? That'd be great if this was a prequel and it turns out I was right! I wish I was watching this with my friends as I always somehow guess correctly when it comes to twist endings. I'm just sick I've seen too many movies. However I really loved this movie. Between the awesome death scenes the gymnastic scene and the massage was just great. There's even a cringe worthy scene of eye laser surgery that I'm sure will get you covering your mouth and eyes it was creepy. The effects are great as always and I'm such a crazy gore hound that I love the first vision as always. The bridge collapsing was just terrific and done so well. Every time you saw someone die you just would scream and have a good time with it. I really do like most of these Final Destination movies they are a lot of fun and just a great idea in general. The only thing I would have changed in this film was to have Miles Fisher jump up on a couch and start laughing maniacally because somewhere Tom Cruise must be wondering Do I have a son somewhere that I don't know about?.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I really loved the opening credits of this film. It introduces the killers of the series. Random objects are the true killers of the these movies. They jump out of the screen and shows us how dangerous they are. Even the most innocent objects can be dangerous. The mysteriousness of the intro is obvious and it became intense when a dead corpse flies out of the screen then random blood splatters the broken glass. The film itself is a remake of the last four films. They added some new rules here but it doesn't change anything. At least this is better than the fourth one but in the end this is just another sequelor remake.Here's the thing about Final Destination. It's an intriguing high concept horror movie. But after the second film they decided to repeat all the things from the first movie and make the deaths more gory than ever. They added new things here like the Kill or Be Killed concept. It's pretty interesting but it doesn't make any changes. That concept just made the climax more psychological and create some twists. Like I say this is just another Final Destination sequel.If you're a fan of the film then you might enjoy it by its silly death scenes. Yep the 3D use is gimmicky. Dangerous stuff even the ones that aren't dangerous jumps out of the screen. Blood and gore throughout. See how fragile these people are. Here's the big problem The film points at Molly as the important character of the film but she is reallyvery bland among all of them.Final Destination 5 is just another Final Destination movie. Told some new rules but still no changes. The twist in the end reveals something intriguing but after that it became pointless. This series means nothing but to show how dumb gory violence can happen by random accidents and little objects. The movie itself will make you unsatisfied but if you are seeing this for the stupid gory violence then this repetitive sequel is your satisfactory. Kind of.".

The mysteriousness of the intro is obvious and it became intense when a dead corpse flies out of the screen then random blood splatters the broken glass. The film itself is a remake of the last four films. They added some new rules here but it doesn't change anything. At least this is better than the fourth one but in the end this is just another sequelor remake.Here's the thing about Final Destination. It's an intriguing high concept horror movie. But after the second film they decided to repeat all the things from the first movie and make the deaths more gory than ever. They added new things here like the Kill or Be Killed concept. It's pretty interesting but it doesn't make any changes. That concept just made the climax more psychological and create some twists. Like I say this is just another Final Destination sequel.If you're a fan of the film then you might enjoy it by its silly death scenes. Yep the 3D use is gimmicky. Dangerous stuff even the ones that aren't dangerous jumps out of the screen. Blood and gore throughout. See how fragile these people are. Here's the big problem The film points at Molly as the important character of the film but she is reallyvery bland among all of them.Final Destination 5 is just another Final Destination movie. Told some new rules but still no changes. The twist in the end reveals something intriguing but after that it became pointless. This series means nothing but to show how dumb gory violence can happen by random accidents and little objects. The movie itself will make you unsatisfied but if you are seeing this for the stupid gory violence then this repetitive sequel is your satisfactory. Kind of.";

A lot more for a Final Destination movie that is. The survivors seem to actually care about living which at least gives us some connection as an audience. Unfortunately it lacks in the kills department. It sets up these elaborate death sequences on cartoon proportions but decides to suddenly throw in something you didn't see coming. Usually this is something dull like falling down or something falling on them. It kind of makes it an anticlimax. Again it tries to add a new rule to the franchise where killing people adds their life to yours. Some kills are fun but I actually stopped caring about how they were going to die. The only death that had me flinching was the gymnastic scene. The acting was fairly credible but with so many deaths I still think people would act differently possibly manic. Saw a little bit of this with the Christian BaleTom Cruise crossbreed guy. If you still want more after the last four by all means you should see this.".

It also boasts a neat trick of the tail where some ingenuity is used to bring the series full circle with a glint in the eye and a bloody tongue in the cheek.Once again the opening and closing credit sequences are superb doffing its cap to what is undoubtedly a very popular horror franchise. The disaster that underpins the formula is one of the best to be staged a mighty bridge collapse that terrifies and thrills in equal measure.

Educated in the new ideas about religion science and humankind supported by his lovely wife but against his conservative family he became involved in politics favouring the faction of Queen Marie Antoinette against that of the King Louis XVI. Therefore in 1776 he was ready to offer much needed help when Silas Dean a secret agent from the thirteen Rebel states contacted him in Paris. In 1784 after years of political and logistical preparation La Fayette freighted a ship to America with a handful of men and much needed weapons and money.

I think it would be worthwhile to get out on DVD and BluRay if for no other reason than for American kids to know why so many public schools are named after this French guy.Lafayette has become the symbol of FrancoAmerican comity and as we know our relationship with France has not always been easy. In fact when the French recognized the American colonies as independent they sent any number of people here officially and unofficially as the American Revolution became a European War as well with world wide theaters.What was different about the Marquis de Lafayette was that he was an idealist and really bought into all the ideas of our Revolution. Folks like General Rochambeau and Admiral DeGrasse were rather haughty in dealing with us colonials Lafayette never so. In fact the way he adopted the childless George Washington as a father figure was one of the great stories coming out of the American Revolution.Michel Royer was a spirited Lafayette he was a name unknown to Americans but had a substantial career in French cinema after this. You'll see a number of familiar names dotting the cast but the two that stand out are Howard St. John as George Washington and Jack Hawkins as British General Charles Cornwallis. Each perfectly fit my conception of both men. And St. John's scenes with Royer are special.Hopefully this will get out on DVD and soon.".

I was actually surprised that the filmmakers were able to interview people who worked with Michael Moore or those who supported the movies he had done. To be fair this movie was biased towards an antiMoore bent but on the whole the criticism was not vicious.It was amusing to see the filmmakers use the same tactics that Moore used in his movies against him such as using fake credentials to get into an event or shoving a microphone in a celebrity's face in this case Moore himself. To his credit Moore seemed very gracious and respectful towards the filmmakers unlike the secretaries and company representatives who rebuffed Moore in Roger and Me.As with Moore's own films one must be wary of the claims those being interviewed made against Moore such as the assertion that Moore did interview Roger Smith or that Moore's charity was tied up with some bigname defense companies. Moore has just as much right to deny these claims as anyone who is accused by Moore of doing something suspicious. I recommend doing your own research before you swallow some of the claims presented in Manufacturing Dissent though to be be fair those being interviewed or some antiMoore book make the claims against Moore rather than the filmmakers themselves. The Donahue footage though seems credible.Some of the best stuff is in the deleted scenes of the DVD such as the parody of the cartoon from Bowling for Columbine which had the same ultracheap computeranimated style and fastpaced dialogue and narration. I also liked the discussion of Flint's affinity for Coney Island Hot Dogs.I recommend this movie as a counterpoint to Michael Moore's bold socalled documentaries but be careful with regards to some the claims made by the filmmakers here.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film showed at Austin's SXSW Film Festival and was very wellreceived by audience. It is a balanced and fair biopic about controversial leftist film maker Michael Moore. The film makers seem to genuinely admire Moore's progressive politics and his desire to mobilize Americans against President Bush and the Iraq War but have almost relunctantly come to question his methods. As the project continues they explore the nature of Moore's fuzzy relationship with the truth. They become increasingly troubled by his penchant for using just about any means to promote his political ends.They document numerous inaccuracies and manipulation in several of his films. They suggest that Moore has become larger than life and cares more about his own success than his political goals. The portrait is a fair one that presents him as an insecure megalomaniac and roughly the leftist equivalent Rush Limbaugh. The audience is left to consider whether Moore really helps the causes that he supports or merely promotes greater political polarization for his own personal benefit.This is a thoughtful and intelligent biopic that delves into Moore oversized personality and in doing so raises many important questions about the Moore personally about his films about the nature and rules of documentary film making itself. Every Michael Moore fan should see it so that they can begin to evaluate the veracity and ethics that underlie his work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though I'm aware of the various liberties Michael Moore takes with his films I never really gave it much careful thought. Mainly because I like Michael Moore and I agree with many of the arguments he makes. The film portrays Moore as a manipulative performance filmmaker who is quite egoistical and doesn't allow for much dissent against his own views when ever he organizes an event or make a speech. The film portrays him as a man who doesn't practice what he preaches particularly when Moore's various security guards and media handlers refuse to allow the filmmakers film Michael Moore events and speeches. It demostrates that by careful editing Michael Moore can manipulate events to fit his version of what happens and is a master of pulling stunts on camera to prove his point.The film isn't a shrill diatribe about how Moore's ideas will lead to America's ruin. Instead it's a thoughtful film that asks people to be more media savy by setting Moore as an example. The fact that it's a Canadian production probably removes the filmmaker from the distracting American liberal and republican issues concerning Moore. Instead we focus on the veracity of what Moore presents to us and the ethics of the way he manipulates the documentary genre. How Moore's appeal is not based on what he says but the entertainment value of how he presents his point of view.After watching this film I'm more cautious about Michael Moore to always be mindful about what he presents and not always accept it as is. But even at that I still like Michael Moore. He's a talented man who seems to have his heart in the right place when he makes his films and I don't think he's as egoistical as the film suggests he is.".

Specifically they examine his work as a magazine editor and they examine Roger and Me. But even then the main focus wasn't to illustrate Moore's manipulative techniques. Most people already know about that. Instead the main focus in the film was to illustrate that Moore himself is a phony.There is a distinct parallel to the plot of Roger and Me which I thought was too much of an homage to Moore but perhaps appropriate given the context of this documentary. The film crew is constantly struggling to get an interview with Moore and Moore consistently gives them the runaround.So I guess one interesting aspect of the film is that they show how Moore is very willing to put other people in uncomfortable situations or catch them off guard so as to juxtapose their fumbling against his wellprepared rhetoric. However when Moore is threatened with the same tactic by his opponents he cowers and fights dirty to avoid it. He knows how chicken sht it is.".

I found this movie an honest look at Michael Moore and who the man really is compared to what he sells himself to be. Sure the filmmakers were probably a little miffed at Moore by the end of their film but that was a result of Michael's mentality. He claims to support the little man but offers little support for the crew of this film who ask time and again for a sit down interview. Michael is doing the same thing that he demonized Roger Smith for supposedly doing 20 years ago. On top of that his excuses are incredibly lame. I can't interview with you until after the election but then I have to sleep for 6 months.. then we can do an interview. Oh now I can't do an interview because I am about to start my next movie and it will be another years or so before I could possibly do an interview. not exact quote mind youYou would expect someone like him to not only be supportive of those who admire him but also a fellow documentary filmmaker.So yes a large part of this film is meant to show Moore's character which seems to have more of the same qualities as the type of people he claims to be against as opposed to those he claims to defend. Apart from that it is not hard to find evidence of his factual inaccuracies in his films. It amazes me how people still defend his work only because he is outspoken and shares the same political views. A little research will bring up many things that show how dishonest his work is. Bottom line.. this is a film made by left winged filmmakers who are not making a documentary against democrats but rather a dishonest filmmaker that ultimately would do more to harm the party he claims to represent rather than help it. I don't care how much I agreed with someone's view points I would never support someone that was this dishonest and in fact would be ashamed to have them be apart of my party.".

The film shows intelligent restraint at times with its criticism of Moore. For example we are shown how Moore manipulated the chronology of Roger  Me but one of the interviewees correctly points out that criticism of the manipulated chronology is largely pointless in real terms as there was no doubt that the closure of GM was devastating to Flint. I liked how it qualified or tried to balance some of the common criticism that we would hear from the diehard Moorehaters.Similarly we get the reports of Moore being a shocking senior member of staff at the newspaper that he was fired from yet we get another member of staff saying that Moore gave him a few days off work and paid for his airfares to and from Canada for the premier of his film. That balance helps you appreciate the film for rising above ridiculous onesidedness that so many other documentaries are guilty of including Moore's.As for substance the fact that the documentary makers are lefties that start off seemingly admiring and wanting to interview Moore though we'll never know whether this was their real motivation from the beginning works to alleviate concerns about this being a response from the right. There are some troubling techniques that Moore employs to augment his documentaries but that alone wasn't a killer punch. The knockout blow really came from disgraceful facts that more severely undermines major points in Moore's documentaries such as the fact that he did interview Roger Smith despite the film's premise and the fact that handguns are deeply restricted in Canada despite Moore's implication that their gun laws are commensurate with US. A private Moore trust that owns Honeywell stock will similarly leave some Moore fans a bit redfaced.But definitely the most important aspect that emerged was the view that he's just a celebrity and cult icon who sells popularist politics that lacks thoughtfulness and thoroughness.

Michael Moore has done this in every documentary he has ever made. He admits as much claiming that the words spoken by his subjects are theirs alone but he is in charge of editing them however he likes. Using this technique Moore has managed to make films which were more successful than they might have been otherwise. The success he has enjoyed has allowed him to assume the same fatcat attitudes which he criticized and parodied in Roger and Me. This is nicely pointed out in this film. One fault with this film is that it starts slow and you wonder if you are in for a very dry and unfocused personal history of Michael Moore.

	schema:reviewBody "The makers of MANUFACTURING DISSENT say that they began this documentary as fans of Michael Moore. Whether or not this is really true isn't really important. What IS important is that they bring up many issues concerning Michael Moore that he and his supporters simply won't honestly address. The biggest problem and it's almost always ignored by the press is that he makes socalled documentariesyet in order to make his points be often misrepresents and distorts the truth again and again. And in essence they aren't true documentaries but are more like propaganda pieces because of the lies and fabrications. Now there's nothing wrong with making a propaganda piecebut don't call it a documentary or refuse to acknowledge the distortions. This IS Moore's m.o. though ironically he himself refuses to discuss or explain his films unless it's to a friendly audience that doesn't in any way question his methods. The makers of this film try again and again in vain to talk with him just to ask some questions concerning his films. This is especially reasonable considering that Moore himself made a name for himself by ambushing people for his filmsand here they won't let people with any questions come close to him....period. So a man who is of the people and a champion of free speech is ironically only interested in this when it comes to others not himself.As to how well this documentary was made it seemed pretty honest and straight forward. It tended to interview people on all ends of the political spectrum and even many of his supporters on the left acknowledged the way he plays fast and loose with the truth in his films or in his public comments. Some felt that the ends justified the means while others seemed angry at Moore for being more interested in selfaggrandizement than the issues he publicly champions. I know that there will be many who think the entire film is evil but the bottom line is that it asks good questions AND isn't just a onesided piece. There were many different opinions concerning the man that were in the film. What's not to like about that?!".

	onyx:emotionText "The makers of MANUFACTURING DISSENT say that they began this documentary as fans of Michael Moore. Whether or not this is really true isn't really important. What IS important is that they bring up many issues concerning Michael Moore that he and his supporters simply won't honestly address. The biggest problem and it's almost always ignored by the press is that he makes socalled documentariesyet in order to make his points be often misrepresents and distorts the truth again and again. And in essence they aren't true documentaries but are more like propaganda pieces because of the lies and fabrications. Now there's nothing wrong with making a propaganda piecebut don't call it a documentary or refuse to acknowledge the distortions. This IS Moore's m.o. though ironically he himself refuses to discuss or explain his films unless it's to a friendly audience that doesn't in any way question his methods.

	schema:reviewBody "Canadian look at Michael Moore and his movies is an interesting view of the man and his image. The film's conclusion is that Moore is more interested in himself than in anything else and he will go to almost any length to protect said image.I have a love hate relationship with Moore. I do appreciate that he gets people fired up but it annoys the hell out of me that he often cooks the books. For example Moore started with a film called Roger and Me about trying to see Roger Smith but neglected to say that he actually met with Smith twice. The bank gun scene in Bowling for Columbine was set up 30 says in advance so he could walk out of the bank with the gun. His recent Sicko simply stated the obvious about a the broken American health care system. At the same time I like that someone is saying what he is saying. I like that he is challenging the status quo I just wish he wouldn't call it documentary film making.It was with that love hate attitude I sat down to watch Manufacturing Dissent on the Sundance Channel. I would let the film take me where it wanted to and if I didn't like it I could turn it off in favor of something else. I stayed all the way to the end. Seemingly fair minded the film speaks with a good many people who know or knew Moore and it lets them say their piece about him and his behavior going all the way back to his high school days. At the same time the filmmakers follow Moore around the country and try to get him to talk to them about a variety of issues his charitable trust having Halliburton stock for example. The people he speaks with all seem to have the same love hate relationship they love him but ultimately what matters to Michael is Michael .One person connected with the awful truth talks about having to stay in a flea bag hotel while Moore stayed in a suite in a ritzy hotel. When the person asked Moore about it he said You know Midwesterners they're all about making money. Its a telling comment.Also telling is how Moore reacts to being questioned by the filmmakers who film their entire exchanges with Moore none are what you could call difficult except that Moore doesn't like their questions and you can watch his demeanor change. It seems Moore doesn't like to be questioned or seen negatively. Film critic David Gilmour shows clips from the interview with Moore when his film Canadian Bacon came out. Gilmour was very candid about critical reaction to the film and you can see Moore's persona change as he seems to want to kill Gilmour who was taking a bit too much delight in tormenting Moore when his discomfort was revealed. Moore reins himself in but one gets the sense that he was not going to let that happen to him again.And lest you think its a one off we get an interview with the former head of Film Comment who did an interview with Moore where Moore became surreal when asked about factual problems in Roger and Me. Strangely most of the people interviewed seemed to like Mooreat least when he is the jovial Moore. They just don't seem to understand this other Michael Moore who is the rock star who must have his way.For me its the fairest of the documentaries or pieces I've seen bashing or if not bashing questioning Moore since it's point of view is not purely right wing. The film focuses on Moore but it does get some jabs in at people like O'Reilly and other TV pundits of his bend. It seems to feel that Moore is the only one outside of Ralph Nader who he may have betrayed on some level giving voice to the left but that he's not all that he seems. It also argues that we should rightly question what Moore tells us is true since it may not be the gospel truth but rather some approximation altered for effect.I could be wrong but it seemed to make sense.I liked it if for no other reason then its seemingly reasoned approach requires much thought and no knee jerk reaction.7.5 out of 10.".

Being a proud independent I can see the idiots on both sides.But as Im watching this I noticed a glaringly ridiculous scene mentioned briefly by someone else in an earlier review. They showed a group of Flint High School girls doing some sort of irritatingly silly amateur schoolie play that mocks Roger and Me the kind that only the mostly blindly adoring of right wing parents would be able to endure in their pompous little brats and then the teenage girl writer of this play is interviewed and she claims that Moore fabricated a news report that shows a female reporter stating that a Nightline report was cancelled because their news van was stolen even as the scene from the film with her report is being shown over the girl's claims. It is from all visual inspection a real news report. Is she truly trying to say that Moore literally created the report in the film himself hiring an actress to pose as a reporter and putting a fake station logo on the screen? If so its funny because I cant seem to find any mention of it anywhere else but on this site about this film. Did this little girl just make it up and these idiot filmmakers put it in at face value? Doesn't that make them complete hypocrites like most people who do these kinds of amateurish nobudget gotcha documentaries.The female narrator I assume its a woman named Debbie Melnyck who is listed as one of the writers and directors tries for a parody of Moore's sardonic style but her lispy effete elementary school teacher housewifey monotone would be more apt for Romper Room or selling jewelry on QVC. Maybe the girl who put on the play is her daughter or something. Sure Michael Moore is a jerk but what comes out much more glaringly in this film is the vapidness of young people in the majority of the spineless postbaby boom generations. We're doomed folks. Face it now and save yourselves the Christmas shock. There's no hope. This documentary is depressingly effective at showing how our nauseatingly effete youth are going to sissy their way into the end times. We're all going out with a whimper followed by a bang. This film is a good argument in favor of everyone deserving it. Both sides are chock full of fooles. The difference between the swishing grade Z Canadian twits who created this and Michael Moore is Moore has talent for making films and they don't. Stay home Debbie dear you aren't worthy to speak to Moore for a reason. It's not because he's avoiding you. It's because you are insignificant.This wretched film is showing on Sundance Channel this month so watch it for FREE by all means if you must at all please don't pay people like this to make more films like this. Or better yet watch a good documentary instead like Grey Gardens which is also playing this month on Sundance.".

I know that his features are less documentaries than they are carefully crafted diatribes that are laced with humor questionable facts and are always completely onesided. So when I heard about this feature named as a play on Noam Chomsky's book 'Manufacting Consent' that takes a hard look at him I wanted to see it. I have to say that their argument is persuasive and there are several very unflattering items that I'm sure Moore would have preferred not to see on film.What happens when the hunter becomes the hunted? Michael Moore is known to the moviegoing public as a corporate bigwig buster and the Republican Party's most vocal opponent at least the most vocal opponent that has never appeared on a ballot.

Unfortunately the American champion of the little guy proves to be as elusive as he claimed GM Chairman Roger Smith was in the Moore's first feature 1989's Roger and Me. While the deadly duo is following Moore around the country trying to get a sit down they are also exposing fallacies that they found in his various films and talking about his professional rise to his current level of wealth and complete with interviews with friends and business associates past and present. There is also of course ample footage of Moore himself from his features other speaking engagements and encounters with the filmmakers themselves. The attacks upon his work include everything from careful editing to assure that he remains in the forefront and downplaying the efforts of others to outright lies.I already knew that Michael Moore does not even attempt to put forth a balanced view in his features and knew that his 'facts' should not be accepted completely at face value. Although I understand Caine and Melnyk's frustration at trying to get an interview I have to wonder why they think they are entitled to one? Moore is a busy celebrity who undoubtedly has many demands on his time. Some of the material presented about Moore is disconcerting but I usually find myself in agreement with his views so I guess I am willing to forgive his character flaws and look forward to his next work.

	schema:reviewBody "Manufacturing Dissent 2007  12 out of 4 This documentary has director Debbie Melnyk following around Michael Moore as he promotes Fahrenheit 911 and calls him on various lies he's told throughout his career. I've said this countless times that I find Michael Moore to be a very talent filmmaker and I think he makes very entertaining films but there's no denying that he's a hypocrite and lies just as much as the people he goes after. This documentary tells Moore's story from his high school days all the way up to the release of his controversial film and the funny thing is that when this documentary is released there's even more lies out in the open. Moore's use of fear is something that he often tries to go for yet he uses this against people claiming they use fear to push their points. In 2004 Moore was saying the draft was coming yet here we are four years later and this appears to have been a use of fear to try and sell your point. Another thing that I'm glad got cleared up was the heated debate over the Charlton Heston sequence in Bowling for Columbine. I've always felt Moore crossed the line in this segment and we get to see that the original speech from Heston was not made days after a little kid was killed but four months before it. There's a lot of debate on whether Moore really believes in freedom of speech but I'll let the clips in the movie speak for themselves. I'm not sure if this movie was made to make one hate Michael Moore but it really didn't change my mind of the mind. I still think he's a great talent but as far as calling him a documentary filmmaker is a joke. There are three legendary documentary makers interviewed here and their comments are priceless.".

	schema:reviewBody "I say it upfront coming from Europe I like Michael Moore most probably because I share his political ideas. However I'm no die hard fan of his. I watched a couple of his documentaries and found them entertaining. Still I was never one second in doubt that he bent the truth to fit his narrative in order to make the story more entertaining and to emphasize a certain point. Whoever takes Michael Moore's films literally and sees them as the beacon of truth is a fool. And as such I would describe this filmmaker couple of 'Manufacturing Dissent'. The story strikes me as a film that starts out with two naive and blinded fans who end up butt hurt because they figure out that their huge idol is not as approachable as they thought. These people are two nobody's who stalk a very famous and probably very busy guy and get busted along the way as most people would get busted if they started running after their famous idol. However it seems they cannot accept that the mere fact that they decided to make a documentary on Michael Moore and them being Canadians doesn't open all doors to them. At some point they try to take unauthorized footage of one of his speeches and naturally get kicked out. They use this episode to claim that Moore prohibits their right of free speech? Sorry what? First of all what does filming have to do with free speech and secondly one cannot just walk into an event and film commercial material without seeking authorization first. As the film progresses the narrative becomes increasingly negative and they start to present themselves as victims shunned and threatened by the tough staff of Michael Moore who out of some inexplicable reason doesn't want to talk to them despite of them being Canadians heaven forbid. Well what about him being extremely busy at the time  to the point of total exhaustion as he told many times in later interviews. The film is a long chain of complaints by people who hold a grunge against Moore out of various reasons as well as footage from people who simply don't like him and his political agenda. Accusations are taken at face value and go totally unchecked which makes the journalistic value of this documentary questionable and gives it a sensationalist underpinning. Sure Moore probably has a huge ego which person working in the movie industry hasn't? Sure Moore is probably no angel and being as exposed as he is it's probably no too hard to find some people whose toes he stepped on. But to accuse him of manipulation of the same level as Nazi Germany's propaganda machine to indicate he hurt the Kerry campaign through his documentaries and support and thereby enabled Bush's reelection is outright ridiculous and straps this documentary of the last rest of credibility.".

And unless you entirely support George Bush then you have absolutely no reason to be offended by such an association to Michael Moore! If this sounds ridiculously obvious that's because it is. And that's how stupid this film is. Another example Michael Moore is a bad musician he's fat and ugly and here's a creepy picture of him with creepy music playing! Once again all of these are actually presented in the film. This of course should be an insult to every human's intelligence on the earth. This is just sad.

This movie then goes so far as to convict Moore of actually manufacturing not one but all elements of the story. There WAS no town hall meeting. No news van. No Ted Koppel report. They even filmed a phony news reported commenting on the town hall meeting Ted Koppel and the stolen news van. Of course nobody mentions this in 1989 when the movie is seen and scrutinized by millions. But 20 years later they can't find evidence so it must be a fraud.

	schema:reviewBody "This film accomplishes nothing. Even the tagline is exaggerating far reaching crap. It should have been Because we're small time and couldn't get an interview it's never been so hard to get Michael Moore in front of a camera. The film shifts tone focus and favoritism with each interview or point. What's the big deal with Moore doing the same thing as Republican politicians with their tainted media? It's like fighting fire with fire you lie we lie. It's obvious he does it much better than this group of filmmakers trying to ride his coattails and by the way they're late. This film should have come out decades ago so it's dated and tired out already. If it had a point to prove they blew it by waiting decades to state it because with time facts and footage are lost so if this films investigators couldn't find facts or footage it must be because Moore was lying...dumb way to prove your point. The only thing this film achieves is letting the audience realize what a bunch of amateurs this group is by comparison to Moore. If you're going to lie do it well...and for a frigging reason at least. Moore has moved on to other topics other films and new focus. This film lives in the past so there's nothing compelling about it other than a cover design featuring graphic art of Moore as a caricature. LMFAO Unbiased my ass. They'd be more credible in my opinion if they just said this was an antiMoore film. They're lucky Moore wouldn't waste his time discrediting these hacks because all this film had going for it is Michael Moore's name. This film has been made before at least twice so come up with an original concept for once instead of remaking Republican propaganda that discredits Moore. Instead the filmmakers waste our time telling us something we all know already. It's more about their self importance and how they're 'worthy' to continue on their journey to discredit Moore. This is a bitter and resentful documentary with jealous undertones and I'm sorry but they don't have the chops or charisma to win over Moore's popularity. Aren't their more prominent world figures to discredit? Like ones who influence the world because they RUN IT and not watch it on CNN while eating chips and thinking up conspiracy theories? the man may throw out a lie here or there but at least he gets his audience to think with a different view or mindstate unlike this film which has nothing to say other than we're as good as him which they also are not. sinsurely RF This is me...ya anonymous bitches httpwww.youtube.comprofile?userPREVALENTMIND".

	onyx:emotionText "This film accomplishes nothing. Even the tagline is exaggerating far reaching crap. It should have been Because we're small time and couldn't get an interview it's never been so hard to get Michael Moore in front of a camera. The film shifts tone focus and favoritism with each interview or point. What's the big deal with Moore doing the same thing as Republican politicians with their tainted media? It's like fighting fire with fire you lie we lie. It's obvious he does it much better than this group of filmmakers trying to ride his coattails and by the way they're late. This film should have come out decades ago so it's dated and tired out already. If it had a point to prove they blew it by waiting decades to state it because with time facts and footage are lost so if this films investigators couldn't find facts or footage it must be because Moore was lying...dumb way to prove your point. The only thing this film achieves is letting the audience realize what a bunch of amateurs this group is by comparison to Moore. If you're going to lie do it well...and for a frigging reason at least. Moore has moved on to other topics other films and new focus. This film lives in the past so there's nothing compelling about it other than a cover design featuring graphic art of Moore as a caricature. LMFAO Unbiased my ass. They'd be more credible in my opinion if they just said this was an antiMoore film. They're lucky Moore wouldn't waste his time discrediting these hacks because all this film had going for it is Michael Moore's name.

In fact through much of the film Grant walks through his scenes as if he's trying to convey that he's a bit embarrassed at the silliness and shallowness of the film as his performance is very subdued. In addition to Grant Deborah Kerr stars in this comedy.Oddly Kerr and Grant are very miscast. Grant plays a man born in Connecticut and Kerr's nationality isn't mentioned but she works for the U.S. State Departmentyet both of them are clearly British due to their accents. Why they just didn't make them Brits I don't know.The film begins with Grant negotiating oil contracts with the king of the fictional Muslim nation of Bukhistan. While they are celebrating the deal the king's sexy daughter entertains them with a dance that isn't all that good but frankly given how beautiful she is Grant doesn't seem to notice. It seems that he's a bit smitten with the girl though he is already engaged to Miss Kerr and so he soon leaves to begin married life in America.Unfortunately Miss Kerr is a harddriven workaholic who really isn't all that concerned with when they'll marry or where they'll go on a honeymoonif they go at all! She's a rather clichd characteryou know the working woman who has no time for love or romance. So naturally Grant is irritated with her and decides to call off the wedding. And to spite Kerr he asks the king's daughter to marry him as he likes that she's very old fashioned and submissiveand very little like the cold and almost sexless Kerr.What follows pretty much looks like a 1950s or 60s sitcomwith Kerr assigned to act as liaison between Grant and his new bride to be since she doesn't speak English and Kerr speaks both languages. The usual sexual tension you'd expect between Kerr and Grant is all there along with some kooky adventures as the new fiance learns what it's like to be a liberated American. And when the film degenerates to the kooky level you can't help but want it all to end.The bottom line is that this is a secondrate plottoo filled with lousy writing clichs sitcomlike plotting and dumb situations. Plus is it at all realistic that a devout Muslim king would even allow his beloved daughter marry an infidel? Overall this is a passable film only because it stars Cary Grant. Even in one of his poorer efforts he's STILL Cary Grant and managed to enliven this mess enough to make it a decent timepasser.".

There's comedic potential in a jilted love translating a guy's flowery affections to a nonEnglish new amour. As a result the movie's best passages involve Kerr doing just that. Here however the idea's bound up with Middle East intrigue and distinctly noncomedic mideastern types. There's also comedic potential in watching a woman transition from traditional subservience to modern freedoms. Trouble is these themes fail to catch fire in what amounts to a sloppy screenplay. Too bad too that Grant appears to be walking through his role in very uncharacteristic fashion. There's none of his usual bounce or spark. Apparently he was on the brink of retiring and would not make another feature for two years. So there may well be an inside story to the MGM production. Kerr too seems too dour to be droll in a rather thankless role. At the same time the results look like director Sheldon had no feel for the antic material being more a popular writer than director. At least there's a winsome Betta St. John as the Arabian princess an aptly commanding Walter Pidgeon as a government honcho and a fearsome Buddy Baer as a towering enforcer. All in all however I expect this was not a movie Grant would like to be remembered by nor one that his fans will revere him for.In passingIran's Prime Minister of the time Mohammed Mossadegh gets a quick mention in the dialog. No wonder because he had just nationalized the country's oil production and would quickly be deposed by a notorious CIA plot. These events culminated about the time this movie was in production ie. early 1953 and may well have inspired the premise.".

Her father allows the princess to perform a sexy dance for Mr. Grant and indicates Ms. St. John would be a devoted and subservient wife. Her main goal in life is to please a man. Engaged to another woman Grant passes on the offer. He returns to the US where he reunites with attractive fiance Deborah Kerr as Priscilla Effie Effington. Grant wants to get romantic but Ms. Kerr is constantly interrupted by business matters. She has an important job in the US State Department...Grant is frustrated with his busy fiance and decides to wed the subservient St. John...Directed by Sidney Sheldon Dream Wife can be described as I Dream of Jeannie without the magic. The later TV series was created by Mr. Sheldon with the underlying theme enhanced by giving the young woman magical powers to please her master. Reportedly Grant was unhappy with Dream Wife and almost retired. He appears to either be trying out a thinner look or recovering from an illness.

Her father allows the princess to perform a sexy dance for Mr. Grant and indicates Ms. St. John would be a devoted and subservient wife. Her main goal in life is to please a man. Engaged to another woman Grant passes on the offer. He returns to the US where he reunites with attractive fiance Deborah Kerr as Priscilla Effie Effington. Grant wants to get romantic but Ms. Kerr is constantly interrupted by business matters. She has an important job in the US State Department...Grant is frustrated with his busy fiance and decides to wed the subservient St. John...Directed by Sidney Sheldon Dream Wife can be described as I Dream of Jeannie without the magic. The later TV series was created by Mr. Sheldon with the underlying theme enhanced by giving the young woman magical powers to please her master. Reportedly Grant was unhappy with Dream Wife and almost retired. He appears to either be trying out a thinner look or recovering from an illness. His comic timing is fine but often channeled improperly. Cast with bad contrast second male lead Walter Pidgeon as Walter McBride makes Grant look smaller.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Sidney Sheldon who wrote the screenplay with Herbert Baker and Alfred Lewis Levitt this late screwball flat sex farce reunites actor Cary Grant with writer Sheldon who'd won an Academy Award on his only nomination for The Bachelor and the BobbySoxer 1947 in their only other collaboration. That's just one of the reasons that make one feel that this comedy could have been better another is its veteran cast that includes Deborah Kerr and Walter Pidgeon.As it is the storyline incorporates dated male and female gender roles in a way that's infrequently funny and more often silly. What begins as a promising although greatly simplified look at the primitive wants and needs of each sex devolves into a less than amusing review of old stereotypes. The film did receive an Academy Award nomination for its BW Costume Design.When Clemson Reade Grant finally realizes that his fiance Priscilla Effington's Kerr state department job takes too much of her time and will likely delay their wedding he decides that he's had enough. When 'Effie' realizes that 'Clem' was expecting her to give up her job when she'd married him they mutually agree to end their engagement. He then sends a telegram to the Khan Eduard Franz of oil rich Bukistan where he'd just been on business to see if can wed the royal Princess Tarji Betta St. John who's been trained since birth as per their 3000 year tradition to care about nothing else but pleasing her future husband. The only trouble is the state department's Walter McBride Pidgeon with a rather minor role and his assistant Effie have been negotiating a big oil death with the Khan. They intercept Clem's crude telegram and express their concerns about his plans messing up theirs. McBride then assigns Effie who understands Bukistan's customs and speaks their language fluently to act as a liaison between Clem and Tarji who's father accepts the proposal of marriage.Of course Tarji is perceived by Clem and his jealous coworker friends Les Tremayne Bruce Bennett and Richard Anderson's characters to be the perfect wife but her native customs e.g. having to walk 3 feet behind him at all times being unable to dine with him etc. and the fact that the wedding is scheduled 3 months in the future during which the Princess's imposing bodyguard is to keep them from kissing one another gives him second thoughts. Heavyweight boxing champion Max Baer's younger brother Buddy plays Tarji's bodyguard and in the screwball tradition Dan Tobin does his best Franklin Pangborn playing a befuddled hotel manager. So Clem asks Effie to help Tarji to become more sophisticated or domesticated for U.S. customs and of course his exfiance is only too happy to educate the Princess about famous suffragettes and other early feminists. Effie's efforts help to undo 3000 years of Bukistan culture in just 3 months! Meanwhile Effie begins to see Clem's attraction to Tarji or at least his ideal of a subservient wife in a new light. When the now English speaking yet still very naive Tarji goes out for a walk alone she attracts men including Steve Forrest like flies. It doesn't take a genius to figure out where all this is leading and in the end the predictable is delivered.".

This is not the dashing debonair sophisticated Cary Grant we've all become accustomed to seeing in so many movies over the years.Kerr has a brief drunk scene that is unusual for her screen persona. Aside from that there's not much to her character that can save this dreary flick.The one thing worth noting is the movie's benign portrayal of Islamic rulers.

Deborah Kerr's Effie is in the high ranks of the Middle East section. One can imagine where this story will go. This 1953 MGM film was 20 years ahead of the oil crises of the 1970s that had a devastating effect around the world. But it gives a glimpse of the world of foreign relations and international business dealings. And in this case how they can overlap and interact with an amusing angle. The younger audiences of today may not know much about the cultural changes in society during the mid to late 20th century. So things like male chauvinism and women's lib may be nothing more than something they've heard about from the past. Well this film clearly seems to poke fun at some customs of the time. And it is an early jab at women's lib way before the movement became widespread more than a decade later. We see that in the early scenes when Reade returns to the U.S. With his arms full of packages at the airport a woman won't open the door for him but another man does. Then other men remove their hats when a woman enters an elevator. Reade fumbles his packages to remove his hat while the woman has a glare of indignation on her face. Then there's something of a role reversal with Reade having to wait on Effie all the time as she has to work late and gets calls away from their dinner and evening out to go back to the office. All of this seems to be juicy fodder for a very good comedy. And with these two leads and Walter Pidgeon as Effie's State Department boss Walter McBride Dream Wife should have been a big hit. But it wasn't when it hit theaters in 1953 and it's not even mildly entertaining today. This is clearly a case of a terrible screenplay that sinks a movie. Sometimes the roles of actors will lift weak scripts to make fair movies. But in this case the dull script is so bad and humorless that even Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr can't save the film. As other reviewers have noted Grant seems to grow detached from the film as it goes along. In the early scenes he seems to strain to give a sense of comedy as he is so adept at doing with his sideglances and facial expressions. This script is so bad it's hard to imagine the producers directors and studio seeing any humor in it. Others have noted that Grant was embarrassed by this poor film so much so that he didn't do another movie for two years and almost hung up his stage spurs. Thankfully he didn't and we have some wonderful and great films with Cary Grant in the lead into the next decade. On everyone's list of most memorable love stories is Grant and Kerr's pairing for the 1957 blockbuster An Affair to Remember. They showed that they did have chemistry on film  if the screenplay was right.".

You must watch it for yourself but please don't blame me if you want the 100 minutes of your life back. I did warn you. Nevertheless in my opinion Cary Grant in anything trumps an incredible percentage of movies being made these days. One must still wonder what Cary was thinking when he agreed to appear in this mess of a movie. It would be hard to believe that he needed the money but who knows? I suspect that it tanked at the box office and if I wasn't too cheap to buy a premium subscription to IMDb I could find out.Perhaps in retrospect Cary Grant himself provides us with the ultimate review of his movie as he decided to retire from filmmaking immediately after making it.".

It was not the instant peace and calm that Price expected. Rather it was emptiness boredom and worst of all restlessness. The Last Lullaby plummets Price back into his old life and forces him into a corner from which he may never escape. Price's old ways no longer work for him when his heart opens and he finds life beyond his profession. The tension finally boils as Price must decide to close himself off again or open himself up to a world beyond his control.";

The Last Lullaby from first time feature film director Jeffrey Goodman holds you in suspense in the plotdriven film that has enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. His casting is brilliant as Tom Sizemore's intensity and inner conflicts are so realistic that somehow the viewer finds himself pulling for this hit man. Sizemore's intensity contrasts perfectly with Sasha Alexander's vulnerability. His character Price has been hired to kill her but how can you kill someone who has been a victim for so long? Goodman's treatment of the narrative by Max Alan Collins and Peter Biegen employs a brilliant combination of nongraphic violence against a pastoral yet frequently menacing backdrop. His gorgeous panoramic shots contrasted with extreme closeups is unusual in a film with this size budget. His deliberately slow pace enhances the suspense and is a much needed respite from the noisyfrenetic world in which most of us live. His audio is at the proper decibel level and his choice and use of music is the best that I have witnessed in any recent film.I predict great things for this talented director.".

His commitment to telling a story without judgment to engaging his audience to trusting in his viewers' intelligence gracefully weaves throughout the movie. From the first moments the audience members get the feeling that there is something a bit different about lead character Price a loner who seems to have a heart buried somewhere in his powerful body. The chemistry that develops between Price and Sara is a testament both to the actors' talent as well as the director's ability to communicate his intended message. A fantastic first effort  I can't wait to see more from this talented director.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Lullaby 2008Here's a film that reinvigorates the true moody classic slightly lowbudget intensity of film noir. It's not latecomers like Chinatown Blood Simple or Mulholland Drive which are strong movies on their own terms and often waved as recent film noirs. The Last Lullaby survives and penetrates on the essence of a good noira leading protagonist who is lost in the world a mysterious set of forces out to take him down a leading female with dubious intentions and gloomy dramatic filming to create a mood of uncertainty and frankly dark elegance.This is a kind of masterpiece that I think will grow over time. Like some of the great noirs to keep this theme going for just another thought the first impression might be flawed as if there is something too forced and stylized and sometimes even clunky going on. But this is part of what makes for style and style is what makes for a lasting unique movie. Think of The Big Heat or even Double Indemnity. For some reason Point Blank with Lee Marvin comes to mind as as somewhat newer parallel.Tom Sizemore makes the movie. He's a hitman seemingly drifting out of the business but having nowhere to go or nothing to do with himself. And then his skills get called into play almost by instinct. Sizemore manages laconic better than anyone. He's not weary exactly but indifferent because of a long violent life. The actor might be remembered best for his terrific role in Natural Born Killers a good pedigree for this movie. And of course he meets a woman in an unlikely way and the plots twists and twists.But it doesn't spin out of control thanks to Sizemore's steady and yet expressive and really subtle performance. And the woman played by Sasha Alexander tons of television including 20 episodes of Dawson's Creek who has more depth and restraint than you'd expect in this kind of role. In fact part of the whole thrill of the movie is the way the two leads who make up nearly every scene are so low key even as the events are bloody and out of control in their violence. The cast crew writers and so on are all relatively new or coming from modest careers. That they all collide and make something this special happen is one of the thrills of collaborative artmakingmovies above all with so many components to go wrong or to go right. You might not find this to your taste but if you do it might be one of the great surprises of the year. It was for me.".

I've never known any hitmen so I personally was OK with the fact that he was bored...didn't seem noteworthy to me....Very early into the movie I was drawn out of my complacency into the possibility that there was something very important going on here. In looking back I realize that that was a combination of good writing good acting good cinematography and film editing  and especially good directing.....what I considered bold and courageous directing especially for a director making his first fulllength film.I have to say I know absolutely nothing about movie making but I know this movie grabbed me and I think it could not have grabbed me had it not had these things present1 The characters were allowed to develop in front of my eyes ..... in fact right in front of my face literally ....they were up close and personal. That was very bold.2 And they stayed there on the screen....sometimes for several long seconds sometimes in silence. I felt as if I saw into their longing souls...these two people  Price the Hit Man and Sarah his mark. What an unlikely pair for such unusual bonding. Sarah particularly was absolutely beautiful in those long lingering moments as we hurt with her hurt. And Price  what to say about him  I felt as if his life were flashing before my eyes and yet there were no flashback scenes...amazing  how did they do that?.3 This movie made me feel like it cared how I felt.... that it wanted me to feel the pain these two had and to feel how love's redeeming grace prevailed in the most unlikely of places. To do that it had to move more slowly and allow me to get inside.....it took the time to care to let me in instead of giving me one grand action sequence followed by a more spectacular action shot with another even more spectacular one to follow. It was the exact opposite of this immediate gratification world we live in  where we have to be superexhilarated every few seconds or the movie won't capture our attention. I can assure you this movie captured my attention and it had nothing to do with fastmoving actions shots!4 The unexpected humor....this really slipped up on me and I thought it was just wonderful.....not occurring too often...just every now and then...a nice touch and very appropriate for the moment they were in....5 And lastly this movie made me want to go right back in and see it again so that I could feel what I surely had missed....those nuances I had not gotten the first time......what a gift that is for the Director to give to his audience.I began in my summary by saying Keep your eye on this upcoming director. I believe we will see a lot more out of him because movie making is his passion. He is not yet 35 but he has the heart and the vision of what this writer thinks makes a very fine director. As I said I know nothing about film making.....I just know how his work made me feel! I cannot wait to see where he goes as he matures in his film making.".

The film only scored 5.8 but 23 of the 24 reviews were EXTREMELY positive writeups. I didn't think that scenario made much sense so I looked a bit further into the reviewers. It turned out that 22 of the 24 reviews were written by userid's that HAD NOT reviewed ANY other movies. This sent out red flags.I plopped the DVD into the player anticipating that I would be on here trying to fingerout the misleadingmultiid movie pusher.I was wrong.The movie was good.There will be no witchhunt today.So here I am writing a review that I didn't expect to write.The Last Lullaby is a realistically paced noir piece about a retired hitman and a wealthy heiress in a dangerous legal battle. Tom Sizemore's performance isn't polarizing or Oscar material BUT it is a return to form and he was much better than I thought he would be. Sasha Alexander is also good here.The interaction between the two leads and the gritty realism are the strengths of the movie. That along with the pacing of the film reminds me of The Lookout starring Joseph Gordon Levitt Killshotalso with Levitt or American Gun starring James Coburn. Films that are too realistically paced and themed thriller's to gather mass appeal but are quality works of art nonetheless. The standard for which is the early DePalma films or Gus Van Sant's Elephant.I would like to compare this film to The River Murders because I saw that earlier this week. Both films star washedup actorswell Liotta and Sizemore anyway in thrillers that went straight to video but the films are light years apart in terms of quality. I'm amazed to see the two films ranked so close here on IMDBTRM5.2 TLL5.8. The River Murders is a predictable and poorly acted piece of crapola whereas The Last Lullaby is a solid thriller that IS going onto my latest third installment of the BMovie Marathon. The Last Lullaby is a solid thriller and an amazing directorial debut for Jeffrey Goodman. That is probably the only thing about this movie that truly blew me away. Goodman is someone movie fans should keep an eye on. Sizemore and Alexander here can act circles around Liotta and Fragaawful! and those films should be at least two full points apart.It's well worth your 23 bucks at the redbox or video store. I highly recommend the latter because you have a bigger selection more flexibility on return timesespecially if you get to know a hometown video store owner and you have that physical aspect of having more than one copy of new releases and being able to pick up the box. Plus your debit card doesn't just get charged day after day automatically like some moneymonster from movie hell. There are many other advantages but I'll save the rest of that speech for another time. Support you local video store owners. 66100You'll like this if you liked Killshotnot quite as good as this American Gunnot as good as this The LookoutBetter than this That Evening Sunnot as good as this or Fargoclearly better than this.".

This movie has it all great acting displaying many human emotions an intelligent plot full of suspense and to top it all a brilliant twist.Tom Sizemore and Sasha Alexander played emotionally moving character roles that were genuinely portrayed. It is a story of lost souls finding each other in a strange chain of events. Sizemore plays a retired hit man trying to find a redeeming quality to his life. Sasha plays a young woman whose life has been tormented by the men in her life. This is a film that will appeal to all audiences young and old male and female.The cinematography couldn't have been better. The close ups drew you into the film so that you felt like you were actually a part of the story. The violence in the film was tastefully created and was woven into this story without it being offensive. The gun shots rang out with such force as if you were standing right next to the shooter. It was the most realistic and profound sound effect I have heard in any action movie.Max Collins and Peter Biegen the writers did a superb job of developing the characters and crafting an emotional and suspenseful story. You may remember Max Collins as the writer of The Road to Perdition. He is an excellent story teller and with Peter Biegen's collaboration they have scripted an even more enjoyable story in The Last Lullaby. There is happiness to be discovered and found in this movie.Jeffrey Goodman in his first full featured film knocked the cover off the ball. It is my understanding that this had been in Mr. Goodman's creative hands and thoughts for over ten years while he learned the ropes and paid his dues working in the film industry. His patience and hard work paid off big time. This is a major league movie.I had the fortunate opportunity to get one of the sold out tickets to The Last Lullaby. It was recently featured at the AFI International Film Festival in Dallas TX. Now I'm looking forward to seeing this film again when it is distributed on a national scale. I believe it will be a huge box office success as well as possibly receiving many future film awards. Don't miss this one!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Lullaby opens with a wonderful shot of the always captivating Tom Sizemore looking even MORE intriguing than usual staring up at a ceiling fan in an eerily lit bedroom in the middle of the night unable to sleep. So he does what he usually does when this happens gets in his car and trolls the local convenience store.And this is where the film really lost me he encounters a group of dimwitted thugs virtually broadcasting the fact that they're holding a girl hostage nearby. Sizemore being the proverbial hit man in retirement naturally follows them to check it out. I know that it's sometimes hard to make every event in a script seem plausible or organic but if you're going to toss the audience a whopper like this one save it for the last reel. This development really sabotaged the film for me. If it didn't for you I envy you.Seriously...there's a lot of great stuff here. Yes the basic plot has been done to death but seldom with the realism and warmth of the performances given by Sizemore and Sasha Alexander who plays the woman he's hired to kill. I hesitate to reveal more of the plot because this film needs all the surprises it can spring on you.The plot is the biggest boner here and not just at the start. As Sizemore gets closer to Alexander of course he begins to develop an attachment to her. This leads us into some situations that are so overthetop and obvious there's no way Alexander could not suspect his true motives. This is explained later on in the film but to ill effect.I really wanted to like this film more because overall the acting is exemplary...I just wished the script had given the actors more to hang their hats on. Most of it you can see coming a mile away.".

If Jeffery continues his unrelenting intelligent and intense film making which blends cinematic realism art and action into a masterwork of 2 people finding each other in their time of need...then he will be the next great Auteur.This is a great movie that should not be limited to the genre of mystery as the drama is well played throughout the movie. While the music is not wall to wall it does add to the suspense of the movie.Price is well cast with Tom Sizemore as the lead actor and he is believable as a retired hitman. And Sasha is cast as an attractive Sarah. The sexuality is understated and left to the imagination. She seemed ready for Price but he didn't seem to respond like most men and one has to wonder if he is capable of a romantic moment? Sarah and Price are 2 of a kind in that they cannot sleep because their lives are off course and they need some adjusting to make it right. The on location shooting gave the realism to tell the story and Jeffery edited it in enough of a fast pace to keep it moving along.".

Will humanity hit Price?This is a very good cat and mouse story. You know who the mouse is but you are not sure what the cat will do. Yes yes scorpions and humanity yadda yadda yadda. Do you still think you know what Price will do?This is perhaps one of the best hitman stories I have ever seen ranks with Hitman with Timothy Olyphant and BANGKOK DANGEROUS with Nicolas Cage but it is not a shoot'em up. No this is much slower and we don't mind because we still don't know what Price will do. The pacing throughout is just right. And the story becomes more complicated and twisty than I made it sound earlier. Ah all the better. Tension and suspense come in at the right moments as the story builds to an unexpected conclusion.

	schema:headline " A Film of Films Burke's Limehouse Nights Brought to Brilliant Life";
	schema:reviewBody "For really vintage talkie Anna May Wong noir we must go back to 1934's powerfully atmospheric Limehouse Blues. Taking its cue from the legendary 1922 song composed by Philip Braham with lyrics by Douglas Furber performed by George Raft and Anna May Wong in the movie Limehouse Blues was obviously inspired by Thomas Burke's Limehouse Nights 1916 particularly the story The Father of Yoto in which Burke's heroine Marigold is a dead ringer for the film's Toni Marigold lived under the tremendous glooms of the East and West India docks and what she didn't know about the more universal aspects of human life though she was yet short of twenty was hardly to be known She was a malcontent and one can hardly blame her for she was a girl of girls She was a moonblossom. Her face had not pure and perfect beauty She was small but ripebreasted and moved like a cat. The very lines of her limbs were an ecstasy Now it happened one night when her head was tangled in a net of dreams that she sought escape in the Causeway. If the screenplay's Toni is based on Burke's Marigold which I hope I have now proved  I could quote lots more then Jean Parker represents absolutely perfect casting. Notice how Fischbeck emphasizes the very elements of her face and figure that Burke describes. She was lovely and brave and bright. Purists of course may object that Parker's accent is all wrong for Limehouse but I thought it suited the movie perfectly. It's different and therefore sets her apart from the Cockney crowd. In any event despite its vibrantly realistic setting what we have here as Burke himself relates is a fairy tale because so human. Burke describes the Limehouse area of this tale as a place of savagely masculine character By daytime a cold nauseous light hangs about it at night a devilish darkness settles upon it.Burke's description has been brilliantly translated by art directors Hans Dreier and Robert Usher who picture the Limehouse we see in the movie in similar fashion. The noirish lighting effects by photographer Harry Fischbeck add immeasurably to the devilishly picturesque darkness as director Alexander Hall sweeps the camera through the narrow cobbled streets and dingy courtyards.Aside from its hauntingly moody ambiance the big surprise of the movie of course is George Raft. Am I correct in stating this was the only occasion in which Raft essayed a character role? I know he often played hoods and heroes with Italian names but here he is not only convincingly made up to look halfChinese but his speech pattern and accent doubtless under the tutelage of director Hall have the right flavor too.The support cast led by the charismatic but now forgotten Robert Loraine this was his second last movie. He played Inspector Valentine in Father Brown Detective and then moved back to London where he died in 1935 is likewise solidly in character. Montagu Love makes quite an impression as the brutal Pug and it's good to see Billy Bevan in a major role such an unusual event the title writer was unable to spell his name correctly but it's John Rogers of course who walks away with the nonprincipal acting honors. I've said before that any movie with John Rogers is a good movie but in this one Rogers himself is really exceptional.I've left the most important person in the cast until last. Anna May Wong does not have a very large role but she does have two production numbers and plays them with such presence and precision that you find yourself looking at them again and again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Drawing its title from the 1922 jazz standard Limehouse Blues is a fastpaced moody mix of crime and infatuation in a seedy London district. Director Alexander Hall and cinematographer Harry Fischbeck maintain a consistent aura throughout making this film as brief and surprisingly good as a potsticker. George Raft plays Harry Young an upstart crime boss of mixed heritage one character calls him a halfandhalf who has infiltrated Limehouse from New York. Oddly Raft needed little makeup to believably play halfChinese. Whether Harry Young's wardrobe is of English or Chinese make it is impeccable in every scene and seems to be part of the storytelling. Harry owns and even performs in a Limehouse nightclub with Tu Tuan sultry Anna May Wong. He is closely in tune with his Asian culture but that is shaken when white chippy Toni Jean Parker with xenophobic tendencies comes into his life. Parker is not for an instant plausibly British becoming the biggest hurdle in suspending disbelief. Toni's stepfather Pug malicious Montagu Love is Harry's chief rival on the docks. Inspector Sheridan Robert Loraine has them both under a watchful eye. When Harry falls for Toni and Toni starts seeing another young fellow the hint is that he is a thoroughbred unlike Harry and Tu Tuan's jealousy leads her to revenge and someone ends up dead well there you have a plot. Along the way we get slimy John Rogers always just right Billy Bevans and even an uncredited Eric Blore creating his staple character. In heritage alone Harry Young would seem a bit out of type for Raft but his clear comfort in the part makes one think he drew on his New York memories of those he knew to put this one across. Limehouse Blues is a tasty trip through the Chinese sector touching on race relations and selfvalue.".

George Raft is not the first actor one would think of to play a halfChinese but once cast given the bizarre premise he's not so catastrophic as one might expect. The movie is set in London's famous Limehouse district which was where all the Chinese in the city used to live. It's a combination crime storyromancesociological study and as such fascinating just to look at for a glimpse of a bygone era. The supporting cast is quite strong. I sense in this film the influence of director Joseph Von Sternberg who is not listed in the credits I should add but who was still under contract to Paramount when this was made and who was attracted to all things Eastern and exotic. A dark very watchable movie for those who like such things.".

	schema:reviewBody "Paramount sex star George Raft's a halfcaste who leaves New York's Chinatown to set up shop in London's Limehouse district thus explaining his accent where he runs a smuggling operation out of a waterfront dive. He orchestrates a British rival's murder after finding out the brute beats his pickpocket stepdaughter shades of BROKEN BLOSSOMS and once the hit's carried out Raft takes the girl under his wing. He falls in love naturally but she's not his own kind as discarded mistress Anna May Wong points out more than once and no good will come of it...In a typical role for the dark  dangerous Paramount star George Raft he's a bad guy with a good heart who does a complete about face in the last reel and it was moreorless the same 'ol same 'ol for the exotic Wong as well. She does little more than shoot daggers with her eyes at pretty Jean Parker and when she wasn't doing that Anna cut a rug with George kind of an apache dance where he throws her around sang a snippet and when we first see her does a kind of cooch by striking poses a la Madonna's Vogue in a slinky black gown adorned with a glittering dragon.In its favor Paramount's fogbound sets evoke a time and place but there's an implicit racist attitude in the fact that Raft's mother was a Chinese princess something also present in MGM's NIGHT OF THE QUARTER MOON another tasteful tale of miscegenation that sees Julie London's mom an African princess. Intentional or not the unspoken message is Well if it had to happen at least it was royalty but of course the film was of its time a time when interracial marriage was still against the law and although Raft and Wong came very close to a kiss during that apache dance their lips didn't touch.I have to smile tho whenever I see Golden Age yellow face portrayals labeled politically incorrect at best and racist at worst because it shows an obvious ignorance of Classic Film and America at the time. There were real reasons behind this unreality In the 1930s the majority of Americans were white and the majority of that majority went to the movies to see the stars and if LIMEHOUSE BLUES turned a profit and I'm sure it did it was because of heartthrob George Raft's many fans fans who wouldn't have paid to see an Asian actor in the lead. Studios acquired projects for their stars not the other way around and besides LIMEHOUSE BLUES was romantic escapist fare plain and simple with any resemblance to reality being purely coincidental.I always wanted to be Anna May Wong. She seemed so much more exotic and exciting than plain ordinary folk. But nogo. I wasn't fated to be Wong just white. Paul Lynde".

Don't let the exotic settings sucker you in this is a rather boring and moody film with characters of little personality who think of romance as something judged by unhappiness.

He's about as realistic a half breed as Richard Barthelmess was in the horrid Son of the Gods. While this isn't as bad as that 1931 stinker it just ranks as bland with not one character really worth caring about. Poor Anna May Wong never got the type of role to rise her to A status even turned down to play genuine Asian characters later played by the very white Luise Rainer and Gale Sondergaard.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently obtained a rather lowquality version of this film under its alternate title 30 door key. At first I was not quite sure what to expect seeing Crispin Glovers name on the opening credits and all but I knew whatever it was going to be at least it would be memorable. And it truly was in the best most surreal of ways I am a huge fan of all or most things in that dying surrealists view. This film focuses in the 1940's around a man who is our main character who has long since reached his adulthood yet in the first five minutes of the film is visited by an old teacher of his evoking long since buried feelings of misworth in his intimidating surity and presence. His old teacher as arrogant as he had chosen not to remember up until this point repremands the main character into attending a reeducation school of sorts to learn to write and be mature that everything he had worked towards was suddenly dismissed as a pipedream illusiory success don't ask me you have to dismiss belief for the primary of this film. He goes to a school filled with grown adult school children where there are the bullys and the bullied the ego competition just as in reality only now over the most obscure lesser thought of practices. Crispin Glover plays an at first arrogant but eventually likable antiestablishment manboy who befriends the main character and acts as a catalyst to what the main charcter looks towards to get more in touch with the spirit of living which was a more free reflection on his former self. Its all very difficult to explain in the strictest sense but the movie goes on and I will not spoil it for anyone too many different points and twists to name here but this was a very fun film to watch. All the performances are excellent and I could not reccomend this film more. It sounds so forced typing it out but I thought I should at least try as my subjects title states. final word all in all I leave you with a great big huge woo to let it all settle in good with you.".

A tone of bleak tragic inevitability infuses their lives and the film. We care about them but all we can do is watch there are no offers of help no outstretched hands. In an extremely telling moment Helen says she wants to move out of Needle Park to which Bobby simply responds It's where I live.Panic has such a natural improvisational feel that those existing on a diet of superglossy cashcow cinema may be put off. It is only slightly more polished than Andy Warhol's Trash which it resembles by turnsfrom the camera that loses focus and trembles ever so slightly to the closeups of needles sliding into veins. The gritty city is perfectly captured with a tremendous atmosphere of desperation and misfortune. As Bobby Al Pacino is marvelous as usual but I was really impressed by Kitty Winn in the role of Helen. I'd only seen her in The Exorcist where she was mostly relegated to the background. Here her portrayal is gutwrenching courageous and unforgettable. I can say without a doubt Needle Park is a mustsee. It may not be pretty but it's life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Addiction is such an incomprehensible phenomenon to those who don't endure it that making a film which portrays with such a gripping realism not only the devastating effects but the reasons that push people to destroy themselves is an accomplishment that deserves respect. The Panic in Needle Park from the director Jerry Schatzberg is not only one of the most significant films of the 'New Hollywood' era but a slice of New York's early 70's life with an undeniable documentary value.The film follows the lives of heroinaddicted people in the intersection between Broadway and the 72nd the only place outside Harlem where you could get the drug  Sherman Square aka 'Needle Park' during a severe panic which in the business jargon refers to a period where there's no supply. Schatzberg's direction is austere  no music no innovation  la Martin Scorsese only a camera following a bunch of young people in New York streets confined claustrophobic houses hospitals sordid bedrooms but allowing us sometimes to breath in a green area. The camera works as the eye of the viewer and I challenge those who'd doubt the authenticity of the images not to cover their eyes during the closeups where you can witness a needle piercing a vein and injecting the stuff and all the immediate effects  rolling eyes turning heads licked lips the horrific graphicness making you wonder why so much people fall in that spiral.To answer this question the movie needed to detach itself from its own tone and provides a story it did even better with a romance and quite a poignant and realistic one. The characterization of Bobby and Helen is admirably handled by both Kitty Winn and Al Pacino in his first starring role  you can see in very touching yet subtle moments the chemistry growing between them. Bobby is so cocky and fun you know he overacts his own personality in order to seduce Helen and he's so over the top Helen can't resist. And whenever you doubt Helen's feelings just look at her eyes they tell everything and Al's eyes don't say less  in the most poignant and defining scene Bobby plays baseball with a group of kids in the street then turns a sudden look at Helen and realizes she took it. A long and powerful silence follows and his reaction is a love gesture that definitely places these two characters in a warm place inside our hearts. Bobby understands Helen's act less as curiosity than a deliberate will to join his way of life so both could be in the same wavelength. It's a tragic declaration of love in the same vein than the boozedriven romance between Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick in Days of Wine and Roses another great film about addiction.Of course the romance takes a sordid course leading us to the discover the junkies' underworld and get all its tricks. And you know the realism works when it mirrors some of your own experiences. The film reminded me of my current addiction to the waterpipe or oriental pipe and how the meticulous preparation provides a sort of preexcitement before the consumption. I take time to clean the water jar to insert the body to use some Kleenex to fix the hose correctly. It may sound ridiculous but this is what addiction is about habits and rituals that elevate you to early steps of pleasure until the final and rewarding payoff. And one day I broke the bowl I literally panicked and had to go at night to buy a new one because I needed it. Addiction's effects reveal to be more vicious when the stuff is missing driving you crazy to an obsessive point and there's nothing that can stop you once you have it hooked on mind. But as a neutral documentary the film is not about judging condemning or even curing the psychological spiral of addiction but simply understanding it. Understanding why people rat why women become hookers why some crimes are committed. Addiction inevitably leads to a destructive alienation where even death doesn't scare. Every junky accepts this eventuality and when one is having an overdose there's a disturbing mix of humanity when the friends are trying to awake him and hostility when the house locater who doesn't want troubles.Bobby Helen and the others are all regular people with families babies living in lively neighborhoods but they're caught in a horrific spiral that undermines any attempt of regular romance and the relationship between Bobby and Helen survives to all the difficulties because their relationships is not totally disinterested  Helen can get the heroin from Bobby and if he's in jail she can get it from his brother Hank played by Richard Bright. And if Bobby needs money he can get it from Helen's hooking. Talk about a sordid romance's basis but the relationship is no less sincere and powerful in the way it makes us feel sorry for two pitiful and endearing characters. And the acting is crucial here Kitty Winn who won the Cannes Award for Best Actress is heartbreaking in this role as her eyes looks cries and laughs convey the mix of vulnerability of a girl who still wants to be legitimate and the toughness of the drugaddict who finally knows the ropes. Al Pacino delivers one of his most brilliant performances as Bobby the streetwise goofy dealer who completes Helen's introversion. Both actors are wonderful and a honorable mention to Bright who illuminates his scenes with a character so unlike the laconic Al Neri.Yes it's hard to believe both Pacino and Bright would work together again in one of the greatest movies ever  The Godfather so if not for the beautiful romance and the extraordinary portrayal of New York's heroinaddiction the movie launched one of the most successful movie careers and just for Al Pacino I say  thank you Mr. Schatzberg !".

Every junky accepts this eventuality and when one is having an overdose there's a disturbing mix of humanity when the friends are trying to awake him and hostility when the house locater who doesn't want troubles.Bobby Helen and the others are all regular people with families babies living in lively neighborhoods but they're caught in a horrific spiral that undermines any attempt of regular romance and the relationship between Bobby and Helen survives to all the difficulties because their relationships is not totally disinterested  Helen can get the heroin from Bobby and if he's in jail she can get it from his brother Hank played by Richard Bright. And if Bobby needs money he can get it from Helen's hooking. Talk about a sordid romance's basis but the relationship is no less sincere and powerful in the way it makes us feel sorry for two pitiful and endearing characters. And the acting is crucial here Kitty Winn who won the Cannes Award for Best Actress is heartbreaking in this role as her eyes looks cries and laughs convey the mix of vulnerability of a girl who still wants to be legitimate and the toughness of the drugaddict who finally knows the ropes. Al Pacino delivers one of his most brilliant performances as Bobby the streetwise goofy dealer who completes Helen's introversion. Both actors are wonderful and a honorable mention to Bright who illuminates his scenes with a character so unlike the laconic Al Neri.Yes it's hard to believe both Pacino and Bright would work together again in one of the greatest movies ever  The Godfather so if not for the beautiful romance and the extraordinary portrayal of New York's heroinaddiction the movie launched one of the most successful movie careers and just for Al Pacino I say  thank you Mr. Schatzberg !";

	schema:reviewBody "So I was scrolling through a Borders outside of London one day looking at all the expensive R2 DVDs I didn't have enough money for when I spotted a movie I had never even heard of starring Al Pacino  The Panic in Needle Park. It had the same front cover stylewise as Scarface which was an obvious marketing ploy. It had a quote from Francis Ford Coppola which claimed he chose Pacino for The Godfather after seeing the film and screening it to Paramount execs.It had piqued my interest and it was only five pounds roughly ten dollars so I thought Why not? If it's awful it's still only five pounds. I bought it went home later that night and watched it.I was blown away because it was easily one of the more interesting character studies I'd ever seen. It's got unlikable characters for sure but there's still a connection to them which allowed me at least to relate to their struggles. And no I don't use heroin. The film stars Al Pacino in one of his very first roles as a heroin addict living in New York City an era dubbed Needle Park where all the junkies hang out. I believe I saw the exact same park in another drug movie released the same year called Born to Win starring George Segal and Robert De Niro. Pacino gets a girlfriend and gets her hooked on heroin. Essentially the film just examines her downfall from prosperity to hellish misfortune  they both live for their next hit.The movie is unflinching. It's raw brutal and uneasy. I recall reading they actually hired heroin addicts for the shootup scenes something that would never be allowed today. I can understand how some people might be put off by the slow pace of the movie and say How can I be expected to enjoy a movie with such vile characters? However I thought it was handled well  it's on the verge of exploitation sometimes primarily the scenes which show the junkies shooting up but for the most part manages to walk a careful line between exploitation and study.Pacino's performance is one of his best ever which is a shame because he never receives credit for it. It's one of the only roles where he isn't in control and although he does yell a few times for the most part he's more calm and subdued  Michael Corleone as a drug addict.The Panic in Needle Park is a great underrated film and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they can handle the content. It's not a rewarding experience in the typical sense but after spending two hours with miserable heroin addicts it will make you feel better about your own lifestyle.".

No doubt if this film was made today we'd have the rehabilitation programme and the tearful reunion once the two protagonists were 'clean' and ready to rejoin society. However this is not for this film. The Panic In Needle Park is decidedly bleak and offers us a slice of reality that not many of us see from our normal suburban lives. Jerry Schatzberg directs this movie with a documentary feel and this coupled with outstanding performances by Pacino and Winn gives a very natural flowing experience. Where Schatzberg did so well and many directors fail is in giving the viewer well sketched characters that you will genuinely get to know and empathize with as you watch them flush their lives down the toilet. Of course it helps if you have Pacino and Winn playing them and they really breathe life into the tragic lives of Bobby and Helen. Definitely one worth watching unless you are depressed or have an aversion to seeing lengthy shots of half dead people putting dirty needles in their veins.

	schema:reviewBody "The Panic in Needle Park 1971Wow. This is as close as American Hollywood gets to cinema verite. The way it's filmed the subject matter itself and the acting by the whole cast especially the two leading actors is astonishing and gripping. Like many realitybased stories this one lacks only a driving narrative thread. As disturbing and terrific as it is it also gets slow and could have been edited down with the same effect.But less of it. By that I mean if you can just settle into this world of 1970 heroin abuse in New York City with close ups of shooting up and some very convincing rushes and rides with squalor and hopelessness and indifference with prostituting and stealing and a wide cast of people down and out you'll want it to keep going. There is nothing quite like this movie even as it lacks propulsion.Al Pacino is so good so convincing as Bobby you can almost picture the movie is a documentary and this slightly charming junkie is a real guy who was willing to be filmed. His girlfriend Helen played by Kitty Winn is also perfect at first as a kind of tagalong who isn't comfortable with this world but who seems to have nowhere else to go so she sticks with Bobby. But she falls into the lifestyle and her clean innocence is gradually worn down almost before our eyes and the two of them go through all the stages of addiction and desperation. They have no money they sometimes have nowhere to live but they stumble along stealing or pulling tricks sexual ones to get their fix.If anyone harbors any sense that heroin must be terrific watch this movie. Even the famous euphoric rush is so internal it can't be appreciated and people on their several hour high just seem to be sleepy all the time. And then the rest of their lives are absolute hell. I guess you don't care about everything else so it may as well be hell but from the outside it's something to avoid. And in that sense the movie is perfect. It is so truthfully frank it's a masterpiece of some kind of cinema that we could use more of but which is so raw and unappealing you can see why there isn't more. It's not a fun movie. And when it does get a little slow and repetitive you might even give up on it or zone out like one of its characters. But watch at least part of it to appreciate what's been done. Here's the great Pacino in his first major role and his second film and Winn also her second film in an award winning performance.".

The way it's filmed the subject matter itself and the acting by the whole cast especially the two leading actors is astonishing and gripping. Like many realitybased stories this one lacks only a driving narrative thread. As disturbing and terrific as it is it also gets slow and could have been edited down with the same effect.But less of it. By that I mean if you can just settle into this world of 1970 heroin abuse in New York City with close ups of shooting up and some very convincing rushes and rides with squalor and hopelessness and indifference with prostituting and stealing and a wide cast of people down and out you'll want it to keep going. There is nothing quite like this movie even as it lacks propulsion.Al Pacino is so good so convincing as Bobby you can almost picture the movie is a documentary and this slightly charming junkie is a real guy who was willing to be filmed. His girlfriend Helen played by Kitty Winn is also perfect at first as a kind of tagalong who isn't comfortable with this world but who seems to have nowhere else to go so she sticks with Bobby. But she falls into the lifestyle and her clean innocence is gradually worn down almost before our eyes and the two of them go through all the stages of addiction and desperation. They have no money they sometimes have nowhere to live but they stumble along stealing or pulling tricks sexual ones to get their fix.If anyone harbors any sense that heroin must be terrific watch this movie. Even the famous euphoric rush is so internal it can't be appreciated and people on their several hour high just seem to be sleepy all the time. And then the rest of their lives are absolute hell. I guess you don't care about everything else so it may as well be hell but from the outside it's something to avoid. And in that sense the movie is perfect. It is so truthfully frank it's a masterpiece of some kind of cinema that we could use more of but which is so raw and unappealing you can see why there isn't more. It's not a fun movie. And when it does get a little slow and repetitive you might even give up on it or zone out like one of its characters. But watch at least part of it to appreciate what's been done. Here's the great Pacino in his first major role and his second film and Winn also her second film in an award winning performance.";

	schema:headline " Al Pacino is outstandingthis movie starts a great career";
	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino took advantage of his role in 1971s The Panic in Needle Park' to propel his career that would reach superstar status in the next years The Godfather.' Pacino plays a pathetic heroin addict that is hell bent on bringing down his new girlfriend Helen Kathy Winn with him. The realism and location shooting of this gritty inner city drug tale seems to be way ahead of its time as the disgusting reality is portrayed much as it is in later more graphic films such as Sid  Nancy' Drugstore Cowboy' Basketball Diaries' and Trainspotting.'As the movie progresses Helen moves from being just a girlfriend to being another junkie to being a prostitute that will do anything with anyone in order to the next fix. There is not to be any redemption in this story much like the bitter truth that is the existence of many drug addicts  just a long downward spiral that ultimately ends in death or prison.There are some great supporting roles in this film namely Richard Bright The Getaway' The Godfather Trilogy' as Pacino's brother who is only slightly better off he is not an addict he is a thief. One of the most ironic sad parts of this story is when Pacino decides to marry Helen and his brother wants to see them get off on the right foot so he offers him a job on his next heist. Of course our addict manages to overdose that afternoon and cannot make it to his first day on the larcenous job. Joe Santos The Rockford Files' and Raul Julia are also mart of the good supporting cast. Others have commented on this movie having a poor ending I do not agree. I think this movie has an all to realistic ending when Pacino leaves a prison term that was brought on by the traitorous activity of his girlfriend only to have her meet him a the doors of the prison as they walk off together. Sadly this is often the way it is in addiction  nothing matters at all except the next fix.".

Al Pacino turns in a naturalistic speedball performance and as a slice of New York grunge it's pretty damn fine. If you want plots though buy an allotment. But you do get to follow various drugged out cats through the scuzzball minutia of their lives and among the grimy spoons and zesty needlework there is even time for a few low key gags. I think it is a minor 70's classic. Not for everyone's tastes but if you like The King Of Marvin Gardens and the strange dabblings of Paul Morrisey  co you will dig it. It is obvious that both KidsAnother Day In Paradise and Drugstore Cowboy are very much in its debt.".

It's been reported that the screenwriters husband and wife Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne spent just a day or two on the street and to me it shows. I realize that they were adapting a book which presumably came from a more nuanced experience but their screenplay seemed to me at times very clichd and at times laughable  the dialog between the group on the park bench around the middle of the film really struck me as phony for example. Not that it was Hollywood exactly but it still seemed very much like a white wellmeaning educated liberal's take on things. And there's nothing wrong with that it just wasn't to me very interesting even in the segments that did strike me as more authentic like the opening reel or so.Part of it I'll admit is me. I often have a hard time with vritstyle features particularly when they are dealing with characters that aren't terribly developed intentionally in this case that have no real background the sort of everyman and everywoman  every kid that could get into drugs or become a street person. It CAN be interesting but it wasn't to me in this case I kept thinking I'd much rather be watching a Cassavetes or Fassbinder film which would have distinctive and quirky people that I could care about  this just didn't give me anything that kept me going. The cast is good Pacino in particular and he's never been one of my favorite actors and the last shot redeemed it a bit for me it's quite moving and very openended in a way the rest of the film never is. Also the physical milieu is well sketched  although there are plenty of grungy NYCset early 70s films that do just as good a job at that.Very mixed for me on a ratings scale I'll be generous and give it a 6 based on that last shot but it was hovering nearer a 5 for most of its running time.Watched on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I ever heard the word 'chipping' as it relates to using drugs sporadically was just a day ago and it wasn't in this movie. It's what Marianne Faithful told Mick Jagger when he saw her strung out on smack and she tried to lie about it without much success from the book 'Mick Jagger' by Phillip Norman. So now a day later I hear the same word in pretty much the same context when Helen Kitty Winn tries to tell Bobby Al Pacino that she's not hooked on heroin. These moments of spontaneous serendipity never cease to amaze me which is why I make note of them when they happen.Well this is about as depressing a movie as you're likely to find and not really presented for entertainment value. It portrays the seedy world of drug use on the West Side of Manhattan in an area formally known as Sherman Square but called 'Needle Park' by it's drug addled inhabitants and frequenters. One gets an idea how bereft of humanity the principal characters are when Bobby's first impression on Helen is to steal a television set off the back of a repair van. Pretty dismal.It gets worse though as Helen who's clean when the film starts succumbs to the depravity of drug life when she takes her first hit of smack and never looks back. While watching it's difficult to understand why someone like Helen doesn't simply ditch her low life boyfriend but never having experienced the kind of dependency she displays here one's at a loss to explain it.When I first heard about this title I presumed that it most likely referred to the panic that accompanies a bad experience with drugs resulting in violence and death. In this case the 'panic' related to a brief period experienced by the addicts in Needle Park when heroin wasn't available on the street and even the cops stopped hassling the low level dealers for a while. I guess if you think about it a heroin junkie who can't get his fix does experience something like panic. And when your habit reaches eighty dollars a day in 1971 dollars it brings a whole other level of degeneracy into play.".

Characters one minute would be at death's door Bobby's OD'ing scene and then in the next scene they would be fine giving the audience nothing to reflect upon. Aside from Al Pacino's OD'ing scene I never felt as though the characters were suffering from the effects of drugs and never felt as though they were in much danger  which again just made me more and more uninvolved as the film progressed.The only positives I can draw from this film come from the performances of Al Pacino and Kitty Win who clearly did the best that they could with what they had to work with. I really disliked this film and the rather abrupt ending was also quite strange. Requiem for a Dream is a much better film tackling a similar theme and you'd be better served watching that film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whats so fabulous about this movie without saying everything is the way the film tells a story. It just follows these two people around and shows their actions both the good and the bad and it doesn't judge. These people are so low in life that no matter what they do you can't help but feel sorry for them. Pacino and Winn really nail their characters they are so realistic. There's a bunch of junkies outside where I work and everyone in this film act almost exactly like them.The complete randomness in lines and story is also incredibly realistic. Sudden outbursts short sentences etc. all melt together. I hear that many people say this is done in a way only a documentary could do and though I have never been in such a environment I do believe they are correct.Now to the technical aspects of the film. Just marvelous frames Schatzberg wasis a talented and respected photographer in real life and it really shows in this film. The camera angles does nothing but add to the story. It doesn't jump around and try to create a lot of new tricks it just kinda stays with them and enforces the grittiness.The story and the message is also incredibly heart warming and sad. These people who live in the Needle Park are such messes and though they are in love they do horrible things to each other and others around them just to get by. I must say few movies are more touching. What detective Hotchner said sums it up fine junkies will always snitch and do everything to get their next fix. They are completely desperate and helpless.By actually sympathizing instead of judging this film makes you feel for people you would other ways look down on and it deserves a lot of respects for this. It truly shows the horror and the panic! It's a masterpiece nothing else can be said.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a true story K19 The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polarisclass nuclear submarines. K19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillancethe test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy helping to either stave off war sustain the Cold War or both depending on your interpretation.As the film begins K19 Captain Mikhail Polenin Liam Neeson is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him the Soviet military powers that be install a new CaptainAlexei Vostrikov Harrison Ford. Vostrikov is a hardass which doesn't help him go over well with the K19 crew who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse Vostrikov has a questionable reputationmany believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue the K19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma attempted solutions and various problems it causes.K19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nailbiting tension when we consider that on the surface level it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.That might not sound very exciting but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K19 a combination of extended character portraitsprimarily of Vostrikov but also of a handful of other K19 crewmembers and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.Of course the film is also a tribute to the reallife sacrifices and heroism of the K19 submarine crew who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial politically and even artisticallyphilosophically attempt to tell a serious balanced historical story from a perspective within another culture.Ford's performance is topnotch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him even if they can understand his motivations then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with himbut after not a little skepticism which lingers for most of the central portion of the filmfinally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K19 sub crew would have had.Neeson has a similarly complex arc but much more subtlefitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of then someone to be disliked for being a hardass of a different sort then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic especially when they make their mindboggling sacrifices.The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities their judgments reservations disputes and suspicions their pressing on despite lessthanperfect circumstances and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex formal organizationnot the least of which is the filmmaking enterprise and more than likely wherever you earn your daily keep.Most of us have been involved with vocationoriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people involved or not thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production maybe because it has to meet a particular release date maybe because of marketing tieins and on and on yet there still might not be a finished script or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama the great direction and the good cinematography score and other technical elements to easily push K19 up to a 10.".

	schema:headline " It's frightening how close we came...";
	schema:reviewBody "K19 has a massive cast especially in the two lead characters of Mikhail Polenin Liam Neeson and Alexei Vostrikov Harrison Ford. My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent typecasting and while he does a good job in his role as does just about everyone involved the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.Comparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English but it doesn't lose credibility the way K19 does probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson well Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.Nevertheless as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull but it bounces off unbroken. We're cursed one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.There is an immediate rivalry between Polenin who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission and Vostrikov who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.One of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air but there wasn't a war going on.

Vostrikov intends to push the boat and the men to the limit so that they all know what the limit is but unfortunately it culminates in a hugely disappointing display of digital effects as the ship breaks through the ice in something that looks more like it belongs in a cartoon than a serious film like this I was reminded of the unfortunate Scrat's efforts to save an acorn from a splitting glacier in Ice Age.The film requires an extra bit of suspension of disbelief to accept a story about a Russian submarine but without any Russian actors. I'm curious to know how it was received in Russia. I imagine it was a hit despite the lack of Russian presence in the film because it illustrates their courage and dedication to their country in the most difficult of times. But nonetheless it is hugely effective and never lets up once it gets going. The ending strikes me as the part where the most creative liberties were taken with the original true story leaving you with the feeling of a Hollywood ending imposed on a true story from Russian and American history.

	onyx:emotionText "K19 has a massive cast especially in the two lead characters of Mikhail Polenin Liam Neeson and Alexei Vostrikov Harrison Ford. My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent typecasting and while he does a good job in his role as does just about everyone involved the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.Comparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English but it doesn't lose credibility the way K19 does probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson well Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.Nevertheless as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull but it bounces off unbroken. We're cursed one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.There is an immediate rivalry between Polenin who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission and Vostrikov who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.One of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air but there wasn't a war going on. This is why there is not a lot of concern shown when an American destroyer is sighted near the submarine because one of the goals of the mission is for the Americans to see what they're doing.Instead a small leak aboard the nuclear sub becomes a problem big enough to potentially start a war.

Otherwise it's a story of the sub's problems and the conflict between two captains.The story starts slowly so you have to stick with it as it gets better and better as it goes on and rewarding enough to make you glad you hung in there for the whole 137 minutes. Profanity is minor and the Russian accents are handled well by the lead actors led by Harrison Ford Liam Neeson and Peter Sarsgaard.It's not a great film but it's good and interesting enough to recommend a rental but not something I'd watch numerous times.

	schema:reviewBody "K19 is a unique entry with a poignant portrayal of the other side of the Iron Curtain showing the rest of the world the courage and the honour of the Russians to their mother land. Those who think of Russians usually think of blood thirsty killing beasts who drink Vodka all day but clearly this is just propaganda. I have Russian background and I have grown up around ethnics and Russians are no different than the general public. It is American propaganda that has taken the rest of the world from understanding the Russian people. In K19 the Russians are finally portrayed as human beings in the most harshest of all circumstances. This is not an action movie and it was not intended to be one. Most of the American comments shown here on Imdb are ridiculous. They clearly show the American expectations in a movie It has to be a blow up explosion filled guns and bullets kill your enemy blockbuster to make it into their best films ever list. K19 however did not want to impress the Americans with special effects it seems to the general American public that special effects are all that make quality movies these days but instead wanted to show the world that Russian soldiers were not cold blooded murderers and were not war thirsty but were soldiers under extreme circumstances  to show the struggle on the other side and to show the fear of death and the courage and heroics in preventing nuclear war subsequently sparking World War III.I was really impressed that at least some of the American comments were realistic for anybody who understands cinema would classify this as a masterpiece. I have come across many hilariously stupid and ridiculous American comments where they think they know what they are talking about and the thing is they don't. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson pulled off a brilliant realistic performance. In my opinion their accents were very well done I am Russian so I would know and the direction was splendid a benchmark in sub film history with its claustrophobic sense and close direction. I felt really sorry for the characters especially for the Nuclear Reactor Officer. The Kirov Orchestra pulled off one of the greatest soundtracks that I have ever heard really powerful and striking pieces and the general Russian feel throughout the film was Authentic.I was truly struck by this film. It sent shivers down my spine. The settings the story telling the performances the direction the music the tension the interaction and chemistry between the characters the authenticity and best of all the cast truly made this film a masterpiece. Thank you to one great American film director Kathryn Bigelow for waking up and seeing the Russians in a different light.This movies is certainly a 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene early on in this film that pretty much sums up the risk that the crew of the new submarine of record will be taking. The officers are sitting around enjoying some vodka and one of them brings up the cosmonaut hero Yuri Gagarin. He offers the rumor that Gagarin was not in fact the first man sent into space. He was simply the first guy who made it back alive. And the crew of this brand new nuclear sub will face similar danger as their hastily prepared vessel will be pushed to the limit in order to impress both the politburo and make the Americans take note of its existence. The boat has not even left the dock before it has claimed a handful of lives most notably the ship's doctor who is hit by a truck just before departure. The top nuclear engineer on board is also hastily replaced when he is discovered drunk on duty. And of course the champagne bottle doesn't break during the dedication ceremony on the first hit. This is a uniformly bad omen in anyone's navy! K19 stars two wonderful actors in Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Neeson plays the boat's original captain who strongly objects to how hastily the new vessel was thrown together. Ford who has higher political connections is put in charge of the K19 with Neeson being demoted to executive officer. Both men are stubborn be generally respectful to one another. Trouble is as the film later points out a ship can only have ONE captain. One man that the crew looks to and respects. Two such men only create tension. Once the boat leaves port things generally go pretty well. Despite a leak or two the boat initially holds together. Ford orders a very deep descent and of course we are treated to one of those scenes which every submarine movie has where the entire crew looks on nervously as the boat may or may not implode under pressure. Anyway it holds up. The K19 then breaks through a patch of ice and has a successful test firing of a missile. Everything looks like it is going great. The crew even stops to pose for a happy picture atop the ice after a game of soccer. Of course things begin to fall apart from there on.First off the nuclear reactor pretty much goes kaput. Radiation levels rise rapidly and for a while it looks like the whole sub might explode. Making things even more drastic is the presence of an American destroyer ship that would theoretically be taken out if the sub went nuclear. Tensions between the two nations were never really much higher than they were back then so this may have been a real possibility. Once things start going badly the tensions between Ford and Neeson begin to magnify. A mutiny is even attempted by those loyal to Neeson. Worst of all the attempt to fix the reactor takes the lives of a handful of the crew in a particularly gruesome fashion. The film becomes more tense as things keep getting more and more dangerous for all involved. The conclusion is somewhat logical but it might seem a little contrived. The entire movie is loosely based on real events but the film has too many clichs for it to really be taken too seriously. Since there is no outright warfare going on here the script has to pretty much recycle just about every tense moment from every other submarine movie not actually involving live combat.The acting is good but Harrison Ford is a bit tough to swallow as a Russian. His accent needs a little work but other than that his performance was as good as he could have done for such a part. Neeson is terrific as usual. Peter Sarsgaard also shows great promise in this early effort of his. Hats off to director Kathryn Bigelow for using the claustrophobic environment of the submarine to her advantage. It must have been a difficult shoot but she makes it work as well as you could hope. The film lost a small fortune at the box office for whatever reason. Maybe the absence of an American lead character was too much to overcome. Anyway it is a shame that more people have yet to see this very good film. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:headline " One of the Most Moving War Films I've Ever Seen";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite some bad reviews being the war film fanatic that I am I went to see this movie. I was expecting something much like U571 Men trapped in a disabled boat surrounded by the enemy and this movie wasn't far from it. I must say that U571 is my alltime favorite war picture so I didn't expect The Widowmaker to surpass it. However it came very close. The story was told well and the acting from most of the newcomers was superb. However when I left the theater I didn't want to watch it again for a long while. Not that it was a bad movie. It was just a little too graphic. I'm one who can watch people get blown to bits decapitated and crushed however since this story is true and the way these men suffered before they died a horrible death was a little too much for me to watch. I know they couldn't have filmed it any other way. That is what makes this movie so good... the mere fact that I was uneasy while watching it. I found myself gasping... I'm not one to gasp.The film is based on the story of a Russian sea captain Harrison Ford that is ordered to command a new nuclear powered submarine that has been thrown together in a very short amount of time. The objective is to test a missile near the north pole in hopes that the Russian government can catch up to the US who is threatening nuclear war. Although the crew is hesitant to board the ship they fear the captain's wrath and work without complaint. Of course the captain is 'do or die' and works the crew mercilessly much to the dismay of the ship's original captain Liam Neeson who can do nothing but watch as his crew gets ready for mutiny. When the nuclear generator malfunctions it is up to a few brave men to expose themselves to radiation and try and fix the power before disaster strikes and World War 3 begins. What I found most disturbing was the captain's refusal for American help until 7 men were dead and hundreds more were already exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. Watching these brave men slowcook themselves for the rest of the crew was enough to make me cringe while other men dove into freezing water rather than go back into a radioactive submarine.All in all this movie was a bit too much reality for me. However it was wonderfully written directed and acted. I gave it 10.".

	schema:headline " Easily Misunderstood Tragic Film";
	schema:reviewBody "It is very easy to be disappointed by this film if one enters the theatre expecting an action thriller based on true events which occurred during the cold war. This is not what this movie is about.... if that is what you are looking for rent Hunt for Red October.The cold war is at its height. To maintain their side of the power equation the Soviets launch their first nuclear submarine..... an imperfect untested hastily put together submersible seemingly ignorant of the potential for atomic disaster inherent in the simplistic layoutof the ship and its reactor devoid of protective redundancies. In addition the ship was woefully ill equipped manuals were missing radioactive protective gear was not provided  the chief nuclear staffer fresh out of school with no experience whatever.  The Cold War logic which made the USSR send such an unprepared weapon to seaor for that matter which fueled America's own tragedy by making it send advisors to Vietnam around this time provides the underpinnings upon which this tale is told and upon which decisions in its narrative are taken. It is a tale of heroism and camaraderie loyalty and patriotism. Much is sacrificed in the service of an ideology we know was false and now know was destined to fail. The message if there is one is that ultimate virtues are not as important as what you do for your fellowmen in your immediate situation. Heroism is defined as risking one's life for the many knowing full well that it could result in one's own death fully aware of the lifeplans one would be giving up. Perhaps it is doubly sad when such knowing heroes are young.  There are no easily discernible villains in this movie. One can of course blame the bureaucratic bigwigs who sent such an unfinished product to sea and at each danger signal refused to acknowledge obvious inadequacies and shortcomings. The Cold War objective was allcommanding. Cold War logic  required the Soviets to respond in kind to the perceived threat of American nuclear submarines.In the final analysis this is a very sad movie which in its own circumscribed way evokes the sadness and waste of that whole cold war period. The acting the misenscene the music are superb. The interaction between all the characters is peerless. Kudos in particular to Messrs. Ford Neeson Camargo Sasgaard and Ginty. There seems to be a lot of relative newcomers in smaller roles.... all of them did well and created memorable characters in their brief parts. I have found critics reluctant to praise this movie. I think they were disappointed for not seeing what they were expecting a hang by the edge of your seat thriller so they blame the director for not making the sort of movie they figuredout it was going to be. Such silliness. This is a movie that will be remembered.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers ahead mate!  Turn your course ninety degrees north or you'll run aground on Spoiler Island!The opening says Inspired by actual events' which basically means that there really was a Hotelclass sub called K19 that had reactor trouble. That's about as close as the movie gets to the real events.  Everything else even the names of the participants has been changed to serve the story.But it's a good story with interesting people conflict over important things and jawhurting tension.  Captain Vostrikov and XO Polenin are excellently portrayed by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and their accents aren't as bad as all that aside from varying in intensity they were decent enough.  Vostrikov really is a bad and irresponsible commander every criticism that Polenin levels at him is true.   That makes Polenin's actions in supporting him all the more interesting.  But Vostrikov does learn from Polenin's example.The heart of the movie is the reactor nearmeltdown and the terrible consequences it has.  Military movies all too often portray courage as simply risking one's life to kill other people.  But what you see in this movie is REAL courage I'd rather go into battle ten times than do what the reactor techs have to do in this movie.  Bigelow's portrayal of the chief reactor officer's breakdown is a touch of genius it shows us what the people who did go into the reactor chamber felt and overcame and what the reactor officer himself overcomes later in the movie.  This movie should never have been marketed as a blockbuster it works best as a simple and touching tale of heroism.Regrettably Bigelow felt she had to cheat to keep the audience's interest specifically by selling us the preposterous story that the reactor meltdown could have caused a 1.4 megaton nuclear explosion.  This changes the story from one that merely didn't happen into one that could not possibly have ever happened.  Nuclear reactors cannot cause nuclear explosions because they don't use weaponsgrade uranium.  Even if they did it would require explosives not just heat to crush the uranium to a sufficiently supercritical density to detonate it.Why did Bigelow resort to this?  Did she believe that a Westernworld audience wouldn't care about the fate of mere Russkies so that she needed to pretend that the fate of the whole world depended on K19 to keep her viewers watching?  If so she lacked confidence in the story she told.  I was and am a partisan of the West in the Cold War and am glad that the West emerged victorious but neither am I inclined to blame these Soviet Navy sailors for the evils of the tyrannical system that they were born into.  I would have enjoyed the movie every bit as much had Bigelow admitted that the sailors were fighting only for their own lives and the lives of their fellow crewmen.  And for those chauvinists who would see these sailors as less than human for being Russian pretending that they saved the world doesn't help.Rating  out of .Recommendation See it in the theater and bring your suspension of disbelief along it needs a workout.".

The acting is strong. If I'm honest it was the draw of Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford that persuaded me to watch the film in the first place. These actors in the main roles give worthy performances and do at least attempt the difficult accent. Their characters are multi layered and both of them surprise the viewer by being more complex than we might at first expect. The same is true of the strong ensemble cast. Kathryn Bigolo's direction is excellent and the tension builds at just the right pace adding to the already intense situation of the claustrophobic setting of the submarine.

Some minutes are superfluous  it has half hour of excess however the movie is enough decent and agreeable.The yarn is interesting and allegedly based on real deeds. There is suspense  thriller and action though the scenario is completely set into the claustrophobic submarine.Harrison Ford performance as a sub commander is excellent he hands perfectly the role  Ford has gotten the best character as film producer . Liam Neeson acting as the contender official is firstrate. Facing off between two commanders is likeness to Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin in the film The hunt for Red October.Kathryn Bigelow direction is good and cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is atmospheric . Klaus Badelt music is spectacular and adjusted to a thrilling film.The movie will appeal to emotions enthusiastic and action lovers. Rating 6510 above average".

Some minutes are superfluous  it has half hour of excess however the movie is enough decent and agreeable.The yarn is interesting and allegedly based on real deeds. There is suspense  thriller and action though the scenario is completely set into the claustrophobic submarine.Harrison Ford performance as a sub commander is excellent he hands perfectly the role  Ford has gotten the best character as film producer . Liam Neeson acting as the contender official is firstrate. Facing off between two commanders is likeness to Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin in the film The hunt for Red October.Kathryn Bigelow direction is good and cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is atmospheric . Klaus Badelt music is spectacular and adjusted to a thrilling film.The movie will appeal to emotions enthusiastic and action lovers. Rating 6510 above average";

But the story of a nuclear submarine that suffers a leak in the cooling system is fairly interesting. The sacrifices that these men had to do is pretty riveting and some of the decisions made here are ones that a normal person could not even consider! Harrison Ford seems to be having a good time playing a different type of character for a change. And Liam Neeson is actually not to bad as the captain that Ford replaces.Watching the men volunteer to try and fix the leak while exposing themselves to radiation is pretty horrific stuff and its these scenes that make the film worth while.".

Harrison Ford is still kind of lame with his dubious Russian accent but Liam Neeson is great as the other nuclear sub Captain. We also have Peter Sarsgaard and Kris HoldenRied as the Geigercounting Russian sailor.The movie starts slowly but gets progressively more exciting as we follow the USSR's first nuclear submarine which suffers a malfunction in its nuclear reactor during its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic in 1961 the height of the cold war.The story becomes intense and incredible. With the most memorable scenes being that of the radiation. The scene where the boys are going into the nuclear reactor to fix it gave me goosebumps. The courage it must have taken especially the second group to go in after they had just seen the first ones return after only 10 minutes. The state of them blind puking burned essentially melting. Scary stuff and portrayed really well.That this is a true story and that it could so easily have escalated into an all out war... of misunderstanding is mind boggling to me. I was also surprised that this event took place in 1961 because in the great scheme of things that's not so long ago. 07.11".

Needless to say I couldn't fall asleep but in addition to that I got so into this movie that my heart started racing and I felt so bad that I didn't watch the last 30 minutes I simply couldn't face the tragedy anymore. So I slept could hardly fall asleep and watched the remainder the next day today in the evening and I so totally enjoyed it that can't help writing this review I am not a big review writer in general.Anyway I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone who loves exciting military dramas or just enjoys watching good movies.

	schema:reviewBody "At first  for some reason  I wasn't sure about Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson playing Soviet submarine captains. The roles didn't really seem to suit them for some reason. However both pulled off good performances here in a movie that seemed to offer a realistic portrayal of life on a Soviet sub in the midst of the Cold War 1961 to be precise. Purportedly based on a real incident that came to light only after the fall of communism in Russia the movie combines the rivalry between the two captains with the story of a nuclear reactor out of control and about to explode and also manages to include an interesting look at Soviet perceptions of the United States  a perspective often lacking from most American movies.Perhaps the sheer realism of sub life accounts for what I thought was a general lack of tension for the first 90100 minutes or so. It must be sheer drudgery for sub crews to go through drill after drill after drill it's even worse to have to watch them going through drill after drill after drill. At times the story actually became quite tedious. However the drama in the last 30 or 40 minutes definitely helped make up for that and surely  the tedium notwithstanding  the sheer realism of the movie earns it some points.This is a good movie. Not the best ever made certainly and not even the best submarine movie I've ever seen I'd rank U571 and Run Silent Run Deep ahead of it but still it was worth watching.Overall I'd rank it as a 710.".

In fact I made great effort to contain my tears during the commemoration at the cemetery.This is a great film which deserves much higher rating than this one because not only it shatters the typical Americanfabricated stereotyped image of Russians as always the villains but also proves that Americans film makers as well can produce gripping and suspenseful films without needing to put in an excessive dose of violence as it is the standard practice. No vehicle or building blow ups no endless rounds of firing no f.. words. Instead what we have here are a crew of young and innocent and above all patriotic Russian marines with no hesitation to risk their lives. In fact so patriotic and prideful of their Russian identity they are that they refuse to accept help from Americans and show this by pulling down their pants to show their bottoms to the US chopper flying nearby the submarine in distress. Unlike their American counterparts who are always portrayed as foulmouthed overconfident and arrogant lads the marines here do look like angels in uniforms.Add the remarkable acting of two giants like Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and you will be served a 140 minutes of epic and tragic events surrounding a first generation nuclear sub in the 1960s.Overall I entirely agree with the poster from Australia. The film gets all the stars from me. Last a little question and forgive me if it sounds too simplistic I would like to know for sure whether radiation exposure can really cause such a horribly swollen arm and whether people can survive hours after such a long exposure near the core as they seemed to alive when taken aboard the rescue sub.".

Have you seen how stupid the original Don is? Compared to the original this is a great improvement.I think there is going to be a Don 2 coming soon.";

The film was a terrific action thriller and the use of modern technology looked fantastic quite similar to the James Bond movies. I've not seen the original Don but I don't think that will turn out to be good as this one because it's an old film which I'm not really keen of. I don't mind remakes as long as their good most of them are rubbish e.g. Devdas  Umrao Jaan but Don is simply the best remake ever! Farhan Akhtar has proved to be a good director. Songs are excellent my most favourite song is Yeh Mera Dil because the lyrics had 2 meanings and Kareena Kapoor was looking so glamour's as usual. The scene where SRH  the other guy fell from a plane while fighting for a parachute was amazing  unexpected a scene like that has never been tackled before in a Bollywood movie the other scene that was really cool is the fight just before the ending with Boman Irani. The twist in the end was the icing on the cake of the whole film and Don has proved that Not only is it difficult to catch Don  It's impossible!!!".

It's a sort of Don1978 meets James Bond the Pierce Brosnan era with all its hitech gadgetry etc. It is unbelievably slick and amazingly cool. Its got the finish of a topend magazine like Vogue or GQglossy beautiful a work of art. And the action scenes are breathless nonstop and come at you one after another.I had severe reservations about Mr Khan as Don. Especially as there are few bigger Mr Bachchan fans than me  I idolise the man. However I've come from the movie convinced that no one else in the current set of stars could've carried it off as well as Shahrukh. He looks and behaves like Don  completely different to the chocolate faced 'Main Hoon Na' and 'Kal Ho Na Ho' giggling lover boy we are used to. In this movie he has a steely look about him a nastiness that is very believable. He is slightly over the top but only to the degree you would want him to be.Priyanka Chopra simply sizzles. When I look at her on screen now I'm ready to do all the things Jim Carrey does in the 'Mask' when he see's Cameron Diaz dance at the club ! The great thing I remember about watching Don 1978 as a 7 year old was that when you came out of the movie and for the next few daysyou felt you were Don ! You wanted to be like him copy all mannerisms you were mesmerised felt the sense of power. I saw the same impact of this Don 2006 on my son coincidentally also 7 years old. But even better it still had the same impact on me ! Just love it ! Check out my full review at apurvbollywood at blogspot".

Some plots were twisted to bring in the modern day touch and nothing seemed unnecessary. The sequences were copied very much to the exactness of the situation and it was a good effort to bring back the charisma that a personality like Don should have. One more special thing about this movie is its climax which was not at all stereotype. One would not expect such a thing in bollywood movies and yet it was brilliantly done.

	schema:reviewBody "DON KA INTEZAR TO MUJHE GYAARA 11 MAHINON SE THA LEKIN MAIN YEH NAHIN JAANTA THA KE DON KE TICKETS MILNA MUSHKIL NAHIN NAMUMKIN HAI.I couldn't catch Don on the first day of release as it was all sold out and I had been extremely busy at work the whole of last week to even think about the movie and buying tickets in advance. Anyways no harm done. I watched Don just tonight on the second day. And what an experience it was.Amitabh Bachchan made Don immortal in the 1978 original. SRK redoes that now in 2006 for generations to come. And though I do not want to give too much away Farhan Akhtar has done something to Don that the original version did not. You will have to watch the movie and find that out for yourself though.As a director FA takes care of everything in a frame. Extremely talented his attention to detail is impeccable. From the moment the film starts till the very last shot the film is a slick stylish thriller of blockbuster proportions.SRK does a really good job both as Don and as Vijay. Priyanka Chopra as Roma does a fine job too and the martial arts training paid off. Boman Irani as DeSilva and Om Puri as Malik are very good as would be expected. Arjun Rampal as Jasjit is great and in fact makes you feel much more for the character than Pran in the original did in my opinion. Personally I thought the actresses picked to play Kamini Kareena Kapoor and Anita Isha Koppikar could have changed roles. Kamini does nothing but jump in the Ye Mera Dil song and although some dance steps from the original have been retained she does not bring in the sexy siren factor to as much an extent as Helen did in the original. I thought Isha Koppikar could've done that.The movie pays homage to the original which will be to the delight of fans of the 1978 version by keeping a lot of the dialog the same. The situations are similar the setting has been changed. Instead of Deepu and Munni Jasjit's son and daughter there's only Deepu which is good because Munni was redundant anyways. Much like that many little changes have been made not only to go with today's times but also to tighten up the screenplay.The title song as well as the Aaj Ki Raat song have been shot really really well. Main Hoon Don in particular really looks good with the Moulin Rouge kind of setting and slick camera work. Simply by the way it's shot and the expressions and behavior of the people involved the audience is treated to an inside look on the lives of Don's gang. Aaj Ki Raat carries a wonderful retrodisco feel visually and reminded me of Parveen Babi's era.Farhan Akhtar has added certain twists in the movie that weren't there in the original and it is these that make this a Farhan Akhtar film. The twists are a shocker for both the new viewers as well as for those who've watched the original. In fact I think they come as a greater shock for the viewers who've watched Amitabh's Don because they will be under the impression that they know what's coming. Brilliant.The film has been handled really well and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't see too many reasons why it wouldn't go down well with most people except for those my wife for one who can't stand SRK. As for me I'm a fan always have been. Way to go.".

	onyx:emotionText "DON KA INTEZAR TO MUJHE GYAARA 11 MAHINON SE THA LEKIN MAIN YEH NAHIN JAANTA THA KE DON KE TICKETS MILNA MUSHKIL NAHIN NAMUMKIN HAI.I couldn't catch Don on the first day of release as it was all sold out and I had been extremely busy at work the whole of last week to even think about the movie and buying tickets in advance. Anyways no harm done. I watched Don just tonight on the second day. And what an experience it was.Amitabh Bachchan made Don immortal in the 1978 original. SRK redoes that now in 2006 for generations to come. And though I do not want to give too much away Farhan Akhtar has done something to Don that the original version did not. You will have to watch the movie and find that out for yourself though.As a director FA takes care of everything in a frame. Extremely talented his attention to detail is impeccable. From the moment the film starts till the very last shot the film is a slick stylish thriller of blockbuster proportions.SRK does a really good job both as Don and as Vijay. Priyanka Chopra as Roma does a fine job too and the martial arts training paid off. Boman Irani as DeSilva and Om Puri as Malik are very good as would be expected. Arjun Rampal as Jasjit is great and in fact makes you feel much more for the character than Pran in the original did in my opinion. Personally I thought the actresses picked to play Kamini Kareena Kapoor and Anita Isha Koppikar could have changed roles. Kamini does nothing but jump in the Ye Mera Dil song and although some dance steps from the original have been retained she does not bring in the sexy siren factor to as much an extent as Helen did in the original.

	schema:headline " Has Most Of The Right Ingredients But Still Falls Short";
	schema:reviewBody "Many seem to have loved this flick but I found it to be average at best. Nothing memorable but not too bad for a remake. Farhan Akhter decorates 'Don' with high tech visuals slick action sequences gloss and glamour. He opts for a different but still predictable ending compared to the prequel. Yet it falls short of being among the best films of the year. 'Don' had potential to be a lot better but it lacks heart. I wouldn't call it an improvement over Farhan's debut venture 'Dil Chahta Hai'. I admit that it's unfair to compare these two totally different films but the reason I mention it is because there are far more flaws in 'Don'. The chase scenes drag on and they're very repetitive. The pace is very slow at times. Some editing could have been helped.Shahrukh is quite convincing as 'Don'. This isn't his best but it's good enough. However he doesn't seem to have a strong chemistry with any of the female leads. This was a big surprise to me because no matter how his movie or acting is in other movies he always managed to maintain a strong chemistry with the ladies. I think this is more the actress's fault because they don't impress. Priyanka Chopra appears to be clueless she doesn't have chemistry with any of the cast member let alone Shahrukh Khan and in a few scenes with Vijay she seems to be copying Juhi Chawla. Moreover her fight scenes were laughable. Ishaa Koppikar barely has a role to speak of. Kareena Kapoor delivers a forgettable performance and her item number is disastrous while her death scene is hilarious. Arjun Rampal is equally forgettable. Boman Irani and Om Puri are adequate.The music is strictly OK with a few exceptions 'Yeh Mera Dil' and 'Khaike Paan' being the worst and 'Aaj ki Raat' being the best.'Don' has an okay screenplay mediocre to bad performances some interesting visuals mostly forgettable music and very few good action scenes. I didn't like it so much and I don't think I would ever want to watch it again. Once is enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don is the movie that shows Shah Rukh Khan at the top of his game. After having already played numerous memorable characters he has taken the role of DON and made it his own with shades of many of his previous memorable roles but given a megawatt jolt. His inexhaustible charisma lights up the biggest largerthanlife character in the history of Hindi cinema.Farhan Akhtar demonstrates again why he is one of the most promising directors in Bollywood. He has covered every aspect of the movie with brilliant poise and delivers a highly intelligent action movie. Akhtar has taken of something much revered and made a contemporary and true classic that preserves everything laudable about the original and improves on its every fault. The characters are more fully drawn and their roles are better balanced to provide a more cohesive and engaging narrative.Boman Irani does a commendable job with a crucial role in the movie. Arjun Rampal hardly flinches in what could have been a breakout role but at least stands his ground. Kareena Kapoor makes an excellent turn as the new Kamini and hits every note just right. Lending a lot of substance to the role she does it more justice than was done to it in the original.It's almost a shame then when Priyanka Chopra becomes the principal female character. She certainly looks the part especially as it was physically demanding but doesn't really accomplish anything outstanding with it. Much more noteworthy is Isha Koppikar in the role of Anita. The role is very light on screen time and as subtle as it is brief. Koppikar though gives a magnificent and understated performance to make it shine.The female characters aren't given much focus but they integrate well into the story and to the central character of DON and give scope for improvement in future instalments of what should become Bollywood's most favoured franchise.The fight sequences could have been improved with better choreography while the other action sequences range from fairly wellexecuted to excellent and all make up a major step forward for Bollywood. The good production value really shows through on the screen.The soundtrack is fantastic and seamlessly complements the on screen proceedings. Each song is not just entertaining but also progresses the story.The movie has hundred percent replay value it is engaging and entertaining every time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The production quality is very neat and one can definitely compare this Bollywood movie with western hits. It has given me shivers and fevers but finally it was worth waiting for.The Car chase which starts off from a beach and goes all the way through the village and then a bridge under construction and to the chikoo farm has a techno soundtrack playing. All this while I was thinking that there would be raw sounds of different car engines whoosh and skids! Ruthless Don gets caught in this sequence so it should have been much more fierce. I think this is the only sequence in first half which has a great pace! I have already seen it thrice with my family  friends and am willing to watch it again! The Technoretro Bijlee soundtrack adds to The theme 'Glass  Steel' environments  modern day characters. Mohanan's camera work is superb! The natural lighting was used very well in shots where SRK dances Sunlight through splashing seawater etc in Ganpati song. The diagonal top shot of Mumbai created a great transition to Vijay's house near rail tracks. Boman and SRKVijay's first conversation was brilliantly entertaining! Loved SRK's acting in both roles. His facial expressions and body movements showed the difference of two extreme characters! SRK was brilliant in 'boatrowing' steps of 'Khaike paan Banaraswala'. Very Energetic moves!People said wow when the white bridge was shown at the end sequence. Chopper coming out from under the bridge in Tele lens shot was also a great surprise and of course the altered end part was special! Loved the shots with double SRKs. Great VFX! Farhan's love for the 1978 movie truly reflects. Storywise DON 2 would certainly require an equally complex plot. Hats off and best wishes to Excel ent  Red chillies for future creations.".

	onyx:emotionText "The production quality is very neat and one can definitely compare this Bollywood movie with western hits. It has given me shivers and fevers but finally it was worth waiting for.The Car chase which starts off from a beach and goes all the way through the village and then a bridge under construction and to the chikoo farm has a techno soundtrack playing. All this while I was thinking that there would be raw sounds of different car engines whoosh and skids! Ruthless Don gets caught in this sequence so it should have been much more fierce. I think this is the only sequence in first half which has a great pace! I have already seen it thrice with my family  friends and am willing to watch it again! The Technoretro Bijlee soundtrack adds to The theme 'Glass  Steel' environments  modern day characters. Mohanan's camera work is superb! The natural lighting was used very well in shots where SRK dances Sunlight through splashing seawater etc in Ganpati song. The diagonal top shot of Mumbai created a great transition to Vijay's house near rail tracks. Boman and SRKVijay's first conversation was brilliantly entertaining! Loved SRK's acting in both roles. His facial expressions and body movements showed the difference of two extreme characters! SRK was brilliant in 'boatrowing' steps of 'Khaike paan Banaraswala'. Very Energetic moves!People said wow when the white bridge was shown at the end sequence. Chopper coming out from under the bridge in Tele lens shot was also a great surprise and of course the altered end part was special! Loved the shots with double SRKs. Great VFX! Farhan's love for the 1978 movie truly reflects. Storywise DON 2 would certainly require an equally complex plot. Hats off and best wishes to Excel ent  Red chillies for future creations.";

It's a thriller the audience will be glued to their seats from start to finish. The execution is good. Cinematography awesome!!!! It's a big screen movie the visuals will leave you spellbound. Sharukh Khan yet again delivers another awesome performance. People who called him a romantic hero who cannot do the nasty stuff must watch Don. Priyanka Chopra is good much better than what we saw in Krrish. Boman Irani is solid as usual. The music is really good typical Bollywood dance sequences. Shankar  Eshaan  Loy are the modern maestros of Bollywood. The only let down is Kareena's item no she is just too fat and doesn't really look the part of the sexy seductress. Farhan Akther does a great job once again and handles the movie well as a young director. In conclusion Don is a must see Hollywood movie lovers who like high paced action movies will love Don it's the best action movie Bollywood has to offer.".

It's watchable and probably should be seen once on TV but I wouldn't go out of your way to see it.Christina Ricci is fine as the title character but I found that the whole moody Gothic thing was a bit overdonewhether it was on the script like that or not it was overbearing. They kept stressing to the audience This girl is dark but I think I got it the first time.Dean Jones from the original That Darn Cat makes a few cameos in this flick. Whatever happened to him? The last I remember him in a film without being a cameo was Beethoven...Thomas F. Wilson does seem to prove he can act out characters other than Biff Griff and Buford Tannen but if I were him I wouldn't quit the day job just yeta film like this isn't going to get him back in the acting arena.The film's gags don't exactly work all the time. Sometimes they work a little bit but on the whole this film is a pretty big mess that should only be seen on television when nothing good is on. 25 stars John UlmerP.S.Be on the lookout for cameos galore including Cheers man John Ratzenburger.".

	schema:reviewBody "They made this movie modern but they also made it more realistic! I am soooo sick of this Reality TV era. People seem to have forgotten that fantasy and exercising the imagination are the original reasons for and the very fabric of entertainment movies.  For example in the original Patricia Randall and her older sister Ingrid were living alone at their house while their parents were traveling in Europe. The character of Ingrid was not even in this movie. Part of the fun of the original was that Ingrid Randall and Zeke Kelso were starting to fall in love. Their parents never called their daughters or anything. In real life few parents would actually stay away that long at once and even if they did they would keep closer tabs on their girls. In the new version Patricia Randall is an only child and her parents happen to be out of the house or just unaware of what is happening. Who cares whether or not it would happen in real life? That was the original point to making movies like that Darn Cat so that people would get to see things happen the way that they WANT them to happen not the way that they actually do happen. Christina Ricci also degraded the precocious but sweet character that Hayley Mills originated. Of course the decay and crudity of the modern world had to be embedded into this movie that was assumed to be like the original safe and fun for all ages! It was nice to see Dean Jones in the movie but that is just about the only positive thing I can think of about this version. On top of everything else the original version immortalized D.C. as a SIAMESE catNo other kind of cat should have been used and the rocky title song of this movie was JUNK! It was not at all worthy to be compared to the soothing orchestrated title song in the original written by Richard and Robert Sherman the composers of music for many other Disney classics e.g. The Parent Trap Mary Poppinsand sung beautifully by Bobby Darin. What is wrong with today's producers? Do they not want their children to enjoy the same harmless but fun entertainment that helped make their own childhoods memorable? It is a good thing that the classics are being rereleased on video and DVD because right now the past seems to be the only place to find true family entertainment.".

The film causes a surprisingly big amount of chuckles since the little town and its inhabitants are so wondrously stereotypical. The grand finale  which involves a boisterous car chase through the town  will certainly impress and please the younger viewers. Some overall good acting as well. First and foremost by the lovely Christina Ricci but also by a few familiar and respected side characters like George Dzundza Basic Instinct Peter Boyle F.I.S.T and Michael McKean Airheads Doug E. Doug simply has to act like a Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock clone but he's pretty good in doing so. That Darn Cat is warmly recommend fun for young families and animal lovers.".

The cinematography and scenery from decent to adequate but the real problems were in the story and the script. The story is very predictable and there are parts where it drags very badly. The script is also very weak lacking in a lot of areas and I did feel the music was not that great either. The length is just right but with such pedestrian pacing it feels twice as long sometimes.

One is charming funny exciting well acted and one of the best movies ever made the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your eyeballs will fall out so you don't have to watch any more.

This version is about as exciting as getting a vasectomy. Witless plot regards a cat that prowls out at exactly eightoclock. It diverts a dog's attention so to steal its food before the mutt receives a fence board to the head. It would watch a bird through a window then a cat etc etc. Who gives a crap. A kidnapped rich woman slips a watch around its neck and its owner played by Christina Ricci investigates. She is joined by rookie cop Doug E. Doug who will obviously prove himself to his fellow cops. The cat is not half as interesting as the Siamese in the original. Uninspired directing by Bob Spiers whose locations are the only area of compliment. Ricci deserves better than this and Doug overacts as the rookie cop viewed as a joke to others on the force. Being part of this film will not likely help him in the popularity polls either. Michael McKean Peter Boyle and Dyan Cannon make forgettable appearances and that is pretty pathetic considering the talent involved. It is a family mystery but lacks the intrigue of the original which wasn't quite as corny as this turned out to be. Perhaps if the cat was given a personality then perhaps this film might have rose above mediocre otherwise it has all the ambition of a cut dog. Score 1  10".

Doug was good in Cool Runnings.  His performance as Senga' was really funny.  Here he is wasted as the bumbling FBI agent.  He does have a good scene when he imitates the cat though. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father.  His character must be the most understanding parent to ever live.  This poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed gets arrested for picking up his own cat and gets bitchedat by his snippy wife and STILL doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles.  I wish my old man was like that. The only real good performance is Christina Ricci's.  She entertaining as the everannoyed Patti but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. You might also recognize Peter Boyle Young Frankenstein Everybody Loves Raymond the old lady from Wings and Cliff from Cheers in this movie. This is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget.  Even the cat isn't very good... I really can't recommend 1997's That Darn Cat. Some young children under 8 might enjoy it a bit but every one else should look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good Christina Ricci movie I suggest Addams Family Values The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow.  If a fun family film is what you're after try Snow Day instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "A permanent place in the history of film musicals is obviously the fate of 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' the minute Howard Keel begins to sing 'Bless Your Beautiful Hide'. His robust romantic presence and voice are perfectly suited to blend with Jane Powell's sweet sopranothe Nelson and Jeanette of the '50s era. Jane is as perky as can be as the girl who impulsively marries him only to find that she's expected to keep house for him and his seven handsome brothers. Echos of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' here and a touch of political incorrectness. But all that can be forgiven for what follows is the most outrageously entertaining musical treat from the MGM factorysingin' and dancin' like you've never seen before! The exuberant acrobatic dancing of the brothers is a special highlightparticularly during the barnraising sequence. And their wistful rendering of the carefully staged 'Lonesome Polecat' is another high point. Powell and Keel get to warble some enchanting tunes and both are totally charming and professional in their roles. Keel probably never had a better roleexcept perhaps 'Showboat' or 'Annie Get Your Gun' handsome macho and utterly believable. By all means reward yourself with this gemeither in regular format or widescreen it's certainly one of the greatest MGM musicals of the '50s. Perhaps as others have noted the only drawbacks are some of the obviously painted mountain backgroundsbut this never destroys the overall charm of the film. The songs are splendid and the dances are as zestful as any you're ever likely to see.".

It is also the story of a rugged young farmer in 1850 who rides into town to trade for some supplies and pick himself up a comely bride...In town Adam finds just what he's looking for'Pretty and trim but not too slim. Heavenly eyes and just the right size. Simple and sweet and sassy as can be.' Adam meets the young spirited Milly working at a local inn... He is instantly attracted by her good looks and her cooking... For her part Milly likes her tall and selfassured man... Also his directness and the sound of his good house in the wilderness... After a whirlwind courtship the two agree to wed... Millie chirps an engaging 'Wonderful Wonderful Day' as she welcomes what she expects will be a perfect new life... But when she arrives at the ranch all her dreams about love and marriage and such are shattered... She discovers that her new husband has not been entirely truthful... Instead of an idyllic honeymoon cottage just for two she finds he really wants 'a cook a washerwoman a hired girl' for his small army of six sensitive brothers living in one filthy cabin...After the shock Milly immediately sets out to transform the young rowdy men into the region's most eligible bachelors with an eye to marrying them off as quickly as possible... Milly's good cooking and stubborn nature inspire the rambunctious young men that they cannot expect to attract wives if they dress and behave the way they do... They have to learn some social graces... At the perfect opportunity the boys put Milly's teaching to good use meeting the town girls whose glances express an obvious interest...Unfortunately the women are spoken for..Adam could hardly believe it how his little wife tamed his backwoods brothers... He suggests to the wild and grieving 'Romeos' reduced to what he can only describe as a bunch of mamma's boys forget gentle methods of love and kidnap the unwilling gals they want following the actions of the Roman with the Sabine women... Howard Keel is at his commanding best... He develops an unorthodox solution to his brothers loneliness much to the chagrin of the town fathers and their romantic rivals... With a voice singularly warm and precise he rises magnificently to the occasion singing a firmness 'Bless Your Beautiful Hide' while he appraises the qualities of womanhood in general... In her probably best screen performance Jane Powell had the required amount of grit and spunk that was needed to lay the woman who could tame seven backwoodsmen... She sets about to refine her unkempt brothersinlaw giving them the manners and habits they need to court and to win their own sweethearts... Her clear high springwater voice is just right for the songs seemingly meant to be heard in the open with the mountains and meadows to echo it... Unquestionably the highlight of the motion picture is justly the 'Barnraising' sequence... It begins as a 'challenge' dancea truly breathtaking display of acrobatic leaps and ballet steps in which the brothers compete for the girls with the more 'refined' men of the town and it ends inevitably in a noisy undignified fight as the men actually try to raise the four sides of the wooden barn... The collective presence of the six brothers is simply dynamic... All the players move rhythmically with grace and ease... Russ Tamblyn jumps both forward and backward over an ax held in his hands... Stanley Donen again displays his visual originality and creates a new style of musical irresistible with its vitality and freshness lovely to look at and hear...".

It took full advantage of brilliant color fabulous choreography and even managed to have that one thing that too many musicals eschew... a plot... complete with character arcs. Adam Pontipee is the eldest of seven brothers who decides that living in a squalor with six other scroungy bachelors and horrible cooking has gone on long enough. When Milly agrees to marry him on the day they meet everyone's in for a shock. Adam finds that a wife is more than a cooking and cleaning slave and that his actions can effect others far more than he ever thought. Milly learns that expectations and dreams don't always work out the way you hope but they can still work out. The six brothers learn that there's more to life than chopping wood that Adam isn't always right and that you can't just take what you want. And six young women the brides discover that there are more choices than the ones people put in front of you.The movie asks some hard questions and doesn't answer all of them. Initially the brides are all quite take with the brothers until the bachelors in town chase them back into the mountains. When the bachelors decide to kidnap the brides we have to ask ourselves how such an act could work out well. Before we heap indignities on the writers we should also ask whether the townsfolk should be allowed to chase off anyone who might contend for the affections of the girls they have their eyes on. That's one of the finest points of this movie. These aren't matters of black and white. This is a story of humanity and of men and women. But mostly this is a fine musical and part of Howard Keel's enduring legacy.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an experienced woodsman compounded by being a fan of great music it is so refreshing to see a perfect musical centered around men behaving like men. So many shows have slim little dandies spinning around and leaping to and fro and the only way you can tell them from a 13 year old girl is their shorter haircuts. I truly enjoyed seeing someone masculine gay or straight doesn't matter move in a skilled manner and disprove the stereotypes of White Men Can't Dance. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers has the great Howard Keel the John Wayne of Musicals supported by a cast of 6 men some actors some dancers and some acrobats and the outcome is nothing short of spectacular. Michael Kidd's choreography is fantastic demonstrating grace and strength yet remaining believable in the fact that the skills could be something done by woodsmen. Mercers music especially Bless Your Beautiful and Lonesome Polecat is simply awesome and are in my head for days every time I watch it. The cinemascope and vibrant colors are unbelievably crisp. I watched this with my 2 year old daughter and aside from her dragging me up to dance with her during the big production numbers she sat in her chair and watched the ENTIRE 2 hour movie. A two year old that watches an entire 2 hour movie with her dad you say!?! Do I need anymore proof of the perfection of this movie!? Bless Howard Keel as he must be smiling down on me whenever I collapse back into my seat exhausted from dancing with my little girl...who also slept very very well that night.".

	schema:reviewBody "It would be difficult I suspect not to like Seven Brides For Seven Brothers. This film boasts an attractive frontier setting famously excellent dance numbers choreographed by Michael Kidd powerful Howard Keel as the head of the Pontifee clan and Jane Powell as the lovely girl who is swept off her feet by his charms. Of course when she finds out that he has six brothers all scruffy backwoodsmen in need of manners and wives trouble ensues. But all turns out well with a little help from a lesson in Roman history hard work and the willingness of six other local girls to be finally swept off their feet. Howard Petrie Ian Wolfe and such lovelies as Ruta Lee Julie Newmar and Virginia Gibson contribute to the fun as the girls the brothers include Russ Tamblyn nondancer Jeff Richards and some of the best dancers on the planet. The movie also presents some famous songs including Wonderful Day I'm a Lonesome Polecat June Bride and When You're in Love as well as Goin' Courtin' among others. Wellremembered scenes include the hilarious barn raising the town dance the sleigh pursuit and avalanche and the Spring Spring Spring vocal climax. Forget the acting which is sometimes a bit potty the director and the music add to a clearlydefined script a rare sense of frontier life where taking risks for happiness and facing the precariousness of things where life is less than settled become necessary. Very few films have followed the lead of Seven Brides as a frontier or western musical and none has been as well received nor appreciated. What a pity its fans say it was not given an outdoor setting instead of backlot sceneryand an A budget...It has a few flaws but for five decades it has been one of the happiest musical films ever made and that is quite an enduring achievement.".

	schema:headline " All Singin' All Dancin' All Fighting All Lovin' Musical";
	schema:reviewBody "How can Seven Brides for Seven Brothers be such a wonderful musical? While the songs are lovely they are mostly forgettable. The characters of the six brides and five of the brothers are almost hopelessly underwritten. Credit director Stanley Donen choreographer Michael Kidd cinematographer George Folsey and a perfect cast led by Howard Keel and Jane Powell for creating one of the all time great musicals and an unforgettable motion picture experience even 50 years after its release. Brides has never been surpassed for ensemble performance and that includes West Side Story. This is largely due to Michael Kidd's choreography and the DonenFolsey scene composition. Kidd exploited the best elements of each character's dance style one brother is a ballet star another an acrobat and created the most bravura ballroomfreestyle dance number in motion picture history the barn dance sequence which formally introduces the brides to the brothers. Kidd's work would have been in vain however had not Donen and Folsey so skillfully composed the scene. Brides is the best example of scene composition of any wide screen musical I've ever seen every frame is filled with something visually interesting. Donen frequently but subtly uses Jane Powell's tiny stature for comic effect by surrounding her with the tall brothers in submissive poses. Powell is clearly always in control but her size and generally cheery temperament prevent her from ever seeming a bully. Donen also carefully chose to dress the brothers in bright distinctly colored shirts which enables the audience to clearly distinguish the characters during key scenes.The movie also has a subtle feminist slant. Powell is clearly younger than her husband Howard Keel but she is also clearly a more mature and dominant character. For the time Brides was also daring in its depiction of good women looking forward to enjoying sex. Prior to one songdance number bride Julie Newmarr poses on a bed in a position clearly representing missionary position sex legs up and astride an imaginary lover's back.Though the brides don't get as much screen time or individuality as the brothers each looks as if she would be a great partner. Both the brides and the brothers get a satisfactory showcasing as couples in the last song Spring Spring Spring.I'll leave others to explain the plot. I would like to mention that Donen had an uphill battle with the studio while making Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The studio had so little faith they continually cut Brides budget to put more money into the lumbering Brigadoon. Sets and even cast members were loaned out to other movies. Brothers Russ Tamblyn an Jeff Richards as well as part of the set can be seen in Many Rivers to Cross. Instead of Technicolor the studio used Ansco color. Thus Brides looks about as good as Wizard of Oz but no where near as good as Harvey Girls or Meet Me in St. Louis. That's quite an achievement being the best photographed best choreographed and best ensemble acted musical of the last 50 years. I think it's also the most entertaining. I give Seven Brides for Seven Brothers a 10.".

Mercer hands them a trifle with a mournful melody slight lyrics and haunting chorus consisting mostly of an extended whoooooooooooooo. And Michael Kidd generated a 'dance' out of slow moves in which barely any work is done and a bang is incorporated every 4 bars.I was about to fast forward through it when even the spedup image revealed synchronized axe movements and that the actors were using real axes. I backed up again watched it and have been watching it for about the last hour.Although the scene is constructed out of convention and a phony interior mountainscape it doesn't matter. It's as beautiful a moment I've ever seen in a musical and so rare to have slowed the tempo down as much as they do. The orchestration is quite minimal but a horn swells at a few moments.".

I liked it more then I thought I would.Now that still doesn't mean that this is my favorite musical but it is a pretty darn good one and appears to have a somewhat timeless quality  tothe characters are sometimes zany and full of fun the story is a clever one and it is the rare moment when your bored. That was good enough for me and I wouldn't be adverse to a second viewing. I think this musical transcends the age factor and can appeal to people of all ages and that's a plus. I did enjoy this though my faves still run along the line of Chicago but this is a wonderfully inviting musical that anyoneas long as they like musicals can enjoy.".

Instead of recoiling over the idea of finding a wife I just rolled with it as a silly plot idea. Once I had put myself in the same fantasy mode as when watching a Busby Berkeley musical I started enjoying it. I really paid attention to the musical numbers most notably the Barn Dance  Lonesome Polecat. Amazing. Not too many dances in movies were designed to actually TELL a story showing what the characters were feeling so eloquently. The Barn Dance scene is the best example I've ever seen of this. The dancing styles of townies vs mountaineers the girl's being hoisted up in the air the colors the acrobatics all contribute to a very coherent story in dance.Lonesome Polecat is also just extraordinary. It has a low base line of something like 34 but the lyrics are sung in some odd time signature like 59. help me here music experts The choreography too is just excellent the men really stand out as athletic as is typical in many cultures such as Indian  Hawaiian dances.I was again struck by how awful crazy the story line is but how easily it's vindicated by Keel's character explaining how tough life is for mountain settlers. And Janie Powell was so perfect as the sweet young pretty girl who makes lemonade out of a bunch of sour lemons. The entire story is really about how she orchestrates a success out of her bad situation. I like that she's physically tiny but controls the fate of everyone in the story not with weak conniving but with strong confident guidance.At first you think this is a terribly sexist story but it's truly a pioneering and feminist story.".

The story is simple enough to follow but the musical sequences intertwine between the dramatic scenes with such fluidity that they help to further the story rather then bog it down. The actors and dancers are all in top form but special mention should go to Tommy Rall and Russ Tamblyn for their impressive acrobatic stunts which add an extra degree of vibrancy to the whole production. Howard Keel and Jane Powell work well together and make a realistic and pleasant pair. Among the highlights to be seen are Keel's lively rendition of Bless Yore Beautiful Hide Powell's Goin' Cotin' sung with the men and of course the famous barn raising dance sequence which is truly a sight to behold a visual feast for the eyes. Also worth noting and often overlooked is the Lament Lonesome Polecat number which is done entirely in one take. It is charming graceful and extremely well executed.It should also be noted that this silm was shot twice at the same time once in CinemaScope and once flat. The scope version is the one generally shown on TV and video. If you see this version see it letterboxed. However the flat version is quite unique in its own right with many of the scenes and dances reframed and in some instances offering a better more full view of the proceedings. Definitely a nottobemissed film especially for fans of the musical genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers when I was a youngster in the early 70s and immediately fell in love with it. I was a fan of movie musicals but had never heard of this one before. A few years later I was shocked to see an extensive clip from it the barn raising dance of course featured in the documentary That's Entertainment which showcased all the great old MGM musicals. I had no idea it was so highly esteemed. My guess is that many others who see this film for the first time will have the same reaction  why haven't I heard of this movie before? I suppose the fact that it starred Howard Keel and Jane Powell  rather than bigger more heralded stars such as Gene Kelly Fred Astaire or Judy Garland  may be the reason why this film is lesser known in general these days than say Singin' in the Rain On the Town and Meet Me in St. Louis etc.. But make no mistake It is every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as some of the best films from the golden era of movie musicals.What sets this film apart? In That's Entertainment the host who introduces the clip from Seven Brides says something along the lines of Anybody who thinks dancing is for sissies forgot to tell the cast of 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.' That captures it pretty well. The dancing in this film is so athletic and manly and spirited  unlike the dancing in almost any other film from that era.On top of that you have the power of Howard Keel's bass voice and sturdy frame the absolute loveliness of Jane Powell in voice looks and personality and the impish charm and amazing athleticism of Russ Tamblyn as Gideon the youngest of the seven brothers. You have an ensemble cast of young actors dancers and singers  the brothers and the brides  who create appealing characters for whom you want to root. You have an entertaining plot filled with characters who are learning life lessons and falling in love. And you have a number of very enjoyable memorable and hummable songs such as Bless Your Beautiful Hide Going' Courtin' and Sobbin' Women that will stick in your head long after you see it.It's a winning combination that will keep you entertained from start to finish.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers when I was a youngster in the early 70s and immediately fell in love with it. I was a fan of movie musicals but had never heard of this one before. A few years later I was shocked to see an extensive clip from it the barn raising dance of course featured in the documentary That's Entertainment which showcased all the great old MGM musicals. I had no idea it was so highly esteemed. My guess is that many others who see this film for the first time will have the same reaction  why haven't I heard of this movie before? I suppose the fact that it starred Howard Keel and Jane Powell  rather than bigger more heralded stars such as Gene Kelly Fred Astaire or Judy Garland  may be the reason why this film is lesser known in general these days than say Singin' in the Rain On the Town and Meet Me in St. Louis etc.. But make no mistake It is every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as some of the best films from the golden era of movie musicals.What sets this film apart?

	schema:reviewBody "In his memoirs Howard Keel said he had a rollicking good time making Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and the results certainly do show. If there is a more boisterous musical out there I haven't found it.Keel is Adam Pontipee eldest brother of seven who own a farm way out in a valley that is usually snowed in during wintertime. That fact becomes of singular importance later on in the film. Living with six other brothers in what could be described as bachelor quarters can be mighty stressful. Not to mention certain other needs aren't being met. So Keel up and decides to get himself a wife and he goes to the nearest town to find one. Amazingly enough he does when Jane Powell decides that with once glance he's indeed the one.On the Pontipee Farm she's not only wife to Keel but a den mother to the other brothers. She's lucky she didn't run into that family of inbreds that Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea rescued Mariette Hartley from in Ride the High Country they would have expected a lot more.Those six other brothers see what benefits from married life Keel is enjoying with Powell and decide to take matters into their own hands with a little help from Keel in that Sobbin' Women number. Powell brought up Plutarch's Lives and Keel read about those Sabine women and encourages the Pontipees to be good Romans. At least that's what Plutarch said.When you think of it Seven Brides for Seven Brothers has one of the silliest plots on record. I mean we are talking about kidnapping and possible rape. But the score is great and the singing and dancing can't be beat. Gene DePaul and Johnny Mercer wrote the music and lyrics for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers the following year they would collaborate on Lil Abner on Broadway which would eventually come to Hollywood.Curiously enough three songs entitled When You're In Love came out at the same time. The one in this version that Keel and Powell both sing one that Bing Crosby sang in the television musical High Tor and one that Mario Lanza did on one of his albums. For that matter there's an even older song sung by Russ Columbo in Wake Up and Dream from the Thirties. This one however is the best.Seven Brides for Seven Brothers hasn't aged a bit from its first showing in 1954. It's one of those eternal films that will be enjoyed a millenia from now. At least that's what me and Plutarch say.".

I preface my review with those marks because it the '50s that made me first start losing interest in musicals. The tap dancing disappeared and some of the female singing stars such as Jane Powell in this movie wee almost operatic with their soprano voices. I just don't like it nor most of the songs in this musical.I might have endured it better too if all the male characters in here weren't so stupid. That was just plain insulting and not humorous just dumb. I could put up with some of Astaire's stupid characters just to see his or Ginger's dancing but there was no one in here to compensate for this insipid dialog.".

This movie was made for kids not for adults so you shouldn't have expected anything more than the predictable dialogues  happy ending.Andi Emma Roberts  Bruce Jake. T.

One day their dog Friday goes into an abandoned old hotel  it spends the night there. Somehow the kids want a real family  they start rescuing dogs from all over the place to help the dogs avoid the pound with the help of their friends Dave Heather  Mark. They get into all kinds of trouble with the law.I was babysitting the other day  my little cousin wanted to watch this as soon as he heard it had dogs in them he's 8  very cute  so I had to watch it along with him as no one else wanted to spend time on this with him  I like him he has two elder sisters  they wouldn't see this nor babysit him. This is a very fun family film. The acting was good the dogs were awesome  the contraptions to help the dogs enjoy was cool. Seeing this as he enjoyed really made it good for me. The plot had lot of holes in it like where did they get the money to feed so many dogs when they couldn't even pay for food for their first dog? And how could they build the hotel for the dogs without the owner's permission  is it really OK to break the law as long as you do it for the cute dogs? This is a kids fantasy after all  I let go of these problems.Lisa Kudrow from the awesome show 'Friends' really didn't do much in this. Then again the kids  dogs are the main attraction. Emma Roberts is a girl I loved in Nancy Drew I was a huge fan of Hardy Boys  Nancy Drew during my teens still am I suppose  here also I liked her. The other kids were also OK. I'm a huge fan of Prison Break  did anyone notice Mark was eerily similar with his dialogue delivery  personality to a character in the TV show? If he is not his son then its weird.610".

It was sugary and nice  there was no real threat anywhere in the film of something bad happening thus it is kidsafe for very young kids.

My younger kids didn't even follow that theme at all.What they did follow and what I found most redeeming were the numerous cutesy dog tricks and toys.

Bernie Don Cheadle the kindly social worker who governs their placements tries to reason with the children who aren't content with their newest family of quiverinducing wannabe rock stars Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon who conduct obnoxious band practice in their apartment nonstop and compulsively lock up the cupboards and cabinets in their home.

Initially it seems they've bitten off more than they can chew especially when cruel dog pound troops nagging foster parents and pesky cops begin to take notice of the incredibly large gathering of dogs at the dilapidated old building.The target audience probably won't be asking the questions that popped into my mind How can an 11yearold kid build such intricate mechanical contraptions? Is it really that easy to train dozens of dogs to use said electrical gadgets? Is it simply luck that none of the dogs need medical attention? Is it really okay for children to commit crimes such as breaking and entering trespassing and even assault as long as it's done with the intent of saving stray animals? Clearly this film wasn't designed for me but the trite dialogue Kevin Dillon mutters the stale line We're in deep doo doo after falling into an enormous animal waste bin the predictability of Bernie's role the sappy ending and the Kill Bill music montage Tomoyasu Hotei's instantly recognizable Battle Without Honor or Humanity are huge distractions  especially when one just wants to see some adorable dogs running amok.Evren BuyrukTx".

In fact I would have to say it is the best liveaction kids film I've seen in years. Sure as an adult you'll be able to see predictable plot devices coming at you from around every corner but the movie is so likable well acted and well directed that you just don't care. There are holes in the story and the whole movie is one big implausibility but it just doesn't matter. Hotel for Dogs will be the first big hit of 2009. It's a great family film that 412 year olds are just going to eat up.".

For a great many viewers the best thing about the film will be the cute and cuddly dogs that perform various tricks  their training is easily more impressive than the humdrum story based on a hopefully more consequential Lois Duncan book. The dialogue lacks flair the acting is expectedly simple and the characters provide only modest entertainment in comparison to their canine costars. Adults will probably find it difficult to withstand the sickeningly sweet conclusion or the impossibly artificial mechanics behind the inner workings of the dog hotel but the target audience is likely to be pleased. 16yearold Andi Emma Roberts and her 11yearold brother Bruce Jake Austin have bounced back and forth between orphanages and foster parents five in the last three years without finding comfort or satisfaction. Bernie Don Cheadle the kindly social worker who governs their placements tries to reason with the children who aren't content with their newest family of quiverinducing wannabe rockstars Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon who conduct obnoxious band practice in their apartment nonstop and compulsively lock up the cupboards and cabinets in their home. The brother and sister team have also been secretly keeping a pet dog Friday who uses automated gadgets constructed by the mechanically inclined Bruce to get food and to remain hidden.Before school starts up the troublemaking duo they get money for dog food by pawning fraudulent goods comes across an abandoned hotel with several canine occupants. Deciding to look after their newfound family of dogs Andi and Bruce join forces with two employees from the nearby pet store Johnny Simmons and Kyla Pratt along with nosey Mark Troy Gentile to build an elaborate selfmaintained shelter for unwanted abandoned and stray dogs. Initially it seems they've bitten off more than they can chew especially when cruel dog pound troops nagging foster parents and pesky cops begin to take notice of the incredibly large gathering of dogs at the dilapidated old building. The target audience probably won't be asking the questions that popped into my mind How can an 11yearold kid build such intricate mechanical contraptions? Is it really that easy to train dozens of dogs to use said electrical gadgets? Is it simply luck that none of the dogs need medical attention? Is it really okay for children to commit crimes such as breaking and entering trespassing and even assault as long as it's done with the intent of saving stray animals? Clearly this film wasn't designed for me but the trite dialogue Kevin Dillon mutters the stale line We're in deep doo doo after falling into an enormous animal waste bin the predictability of Bernie's role the sappy ending and the Kill Bill music montage Tomoyasu Hotei's instantly recognizable Battle Without Honor or Humanity are huge distractions  especially when one just wants to see some adorable dogs running amok.

	schema:headline " Truly Horrible...";
	schema:reviewBody "The only reason I did not give this a 1 is because I'm sure the bottom end of the target audience kids up to maybe 5 years old will like it. However this movie was truly horrible. I think the problem rests on the poor acting of the childrenyoung adults and the script. I'm 99 certain the script writers were told we want to do a movie where there is a hotel for dogs make it work somehow. Spoilers follow none of much consequence. The opening of the movie with two white kids in a foster home ripping off a store owner with a box containing a rock instead of a cell phone because they want to buy some burgers for their dog is the first blow to the movie's credibility. What kind of morals does that teach first of all? Also these kids look way too healthy happy and affluent to warrant stealing for petty money. So they don't like the dinner their foster mom makes them so their dog is a stray after 3 years because these kids are irresponsible so what? The acting is incredibly bad the characters about as stereotypical as possible  It's Nickelodeon what else should we expect? If they had worse foster parents or at least demonstrated being more distraught and emotionally damaged from their parents dying I'd forgive the stupid stealing bit. The kids act like snobby selfrighteous brats throughout the entire film. It basically teaches kids that you can act however you want if you think your mom and dad don't pay enough attention and cook like crap and that even if you are perfectly well off it is fine to break the law for petty cash.If you are a dog lover and a serious one moderate dog lovers won't love the dogs enough to get past story and acting flaws then you may enjoy the bits where the dogs act cute. Other than that I had perfectly acceptable expectations of a KID'S movie about dogs and they were clearly far too high... If the kids are old enough to see this by themselves they won't like this movie. If you're stuck taking them see a movie in a different theater. If they're too young to be unsupervised in front of a screen for an hour and forty minutes get a dog lover friend to take them.".

The other draw of course is how makeshift technology in the form of contraptions made using almost everyday objects can be used to keep the dogs occupied and entertained. Unfortunately almost every mechanical device has been shown in the trailer leaving nothing new nor surprising talk about letting all the cat out of the bag. Wait make that almost every plot device shown that you can sleepwalk through the film and still know what it's all about.Andi Emma Roberts the Wild Child and Bruce Jake T. Austin are two orphans who have in the last few years gone from foster family to foster family because they happen to be two misunderstood kids who find it almost impossible to live with their new foster parents whoever they are especially if they come in the form of wouldbe performers completed with lack of intelligence and inflated egos like the Scudders Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon hamming it up in full camp regalia. They find it increasingly impossible to keep the fact that they are keeping their pet dog Friday a terrier similar to Milo in the Mask from the Scudders and in one night time escapade find themselves with Friday and a couple of strays hiding in an abandoned hotel from the authorities.So begins their very slow starting mission of saving abandoned dogs from around their city with the help of pet shop employees Dave Johnny Simmons and Heather Kyla Pratt and a friendly neighbour Mark Troy Gentile from Drillbit Taylor who is mostly underutilized and in it like a sideshow extra. And with any typical dog movie the enemies are always the folks who operate the dog pound who according to stereotype just cannot wait to imprison dogs and then put them to sleep when their lease expires under their charge.To add certain gravitas here there's Don Cheadle whose Bernie the social worker works at having Andi and Bruce find proper homes and to serve as that Deux Ex Machina mouthpiece toward the end exposing director Thor Freudenthal's weakness in wrapping this up naturally. And there were a couple of moments which I thought could have been brilliantly explored and not left at just a fleeting and passing remark where Andi realizes that their inexplicable assistance rendered to stray dogs happens to be a mirror reflection of their own predicament in being passed from place to place longing for a perfect functional home that they could never have and as such relying on her brother's technical wizardry to make it all complete and worthwhile for the dogs under their charge. Like adoption very rarely do people want to take on anything but a puppy if not for its cute factor but for the reason that they can be nurtured versus the adage that you cannot teach an old dog new tricks.Hotel for Dogs being a Nickelodeon movie has to subscribe to the same old feel good and feel safe formula to make it suitable for all families. In that you can't find anything that will rebel against the established order of the genre so much so that you're inclined to go along with the formula as dictated. Like a good pet dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "I began watching The Passion of Darkly Noon with nearly little information about it.  I knew which actors were in it and that it had something to do with a man who just got out of a cult.  That man meets a scantily clad woman and desires arise.Well maybe that sounds like a lot of information but let me express that it really isn't.  The movie is so much deeper than those few lines of plot. During the beginning of the movie I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the film but afterwards I sat in awe of what had been displayed. The true test of the value of movies is if one contemplates the film at a later date and without a doubt I've pondered this film for a long time after viewing it.  I don't profess to understand all the symbolism but I do understand the purpose of the film and the significance of the characters. I have theories about the big shoe.  Perhaps it is a symbol of how out of place Darkly is or feels or a symbol of how he doesn't understand much in this new world.  And in the end with the small shoe maybe it's a symbol of how out of place we all feel or how we lack understanding of our own worlds.  But who knows what the shoe really meant.Although things progressed too quickly in the beginning by the end I realized that it was supposed to be like that.  This is Darkly's story and we see the most important parts of his stay with Callie and Clay.  It was the lightening quick progression of days and events that led me to understand just what was happening to Darkly Noon.  His need to see everything as a sin dissipated and he began to really desire to be accepted by Callie and to try to accept her.  But then he realized that acceptance wasn't enough that he needed to be loved and his desire did not love him back. Like his selfinflicted wounds Darkly himself became infected and turned to poison just as Callie said because he wasn't tended to the way he needed to be.His cultist parents popped back into his mind and everything was a sin again.  Still there is a part of him that knows differently but he so desperately wants to be loved by his dead parents by God by SOMETHING that he allows himself to be manipulated.  And the form of his manipulation is incredible.  It's not a living person who uses him...it is his past his upbringing his learned beliefs and his vision of his parents that manipulates him into wanting to be right with God again and cleansing himself and the place he has been.  And he allows himself to be manipulated because he knows that he will finally be loved not by Callie but by God by something.It's the development of Darkly that makes the story.  It's not about Callie or Clay or anyone else who happens along.  It's about Darkly how he responds to people how people respond to him and how he effects other people. He is searching for something he can understand something that is normal to him...hence his friendship with Roxy.  I also think the movie is about the basic need to be important to someone.  This movie left me thinking about the possibilities if Clay hadn't returned.  Would Darkly developed into a normal person acquiring his desire's love?  Darkly is important to Callie until Clay returns then he is put aside although not in an obvious way.  It shatters Darkly's notion that Callie could love him and that drives him right back to doing things the way he was taught in the cult.  And also what would have happened if Jude had come to visit more and made Darkly laugh and feel a part of something.  But in the end Who will love him now?The way this film was shot is so striking.  The film makers are unafraid of being unusual and using some nonstandard techniques.  The cuts lighting and angles of the scene where Darkly is praying is simply amazing.  How that scene is crafted really lends itself to project a creepy feeling to the viewer.  That's only one example of the uniqueness of the film making.Now let me mention Brendan Fraser.  He is quite possibly the most talented actor in young Hollywood.  No he's not De Niro or Nicholson and personally I feel that they are overrated anyway.  Fraser is an actor who can convince me that he is a Cave Man going to High School just as well as he can convince me he's a stuttering cult member or a persecuted Jewish football player at a 1950's prep school.  To be able to convince someone that he is all of those things is amazing.  He's extremely versatile.  And while some people question some of the roles he takes on everyone of those roles fills as if he was born to play them.I loved George of the Jungle not only because he was mostly naked most of the movie but also because he was so GOOD as the title character. Brendan Fraser doesn't have to take himself seriously ALL THE TIME like other actors do.  He can take cartoon characters on and have fun with them.Since this is a review of The Passion of Darkly Noon I'll stop writing about Brendan's other movies.  As for this one...my God oops that's a sin Brendan showed his talent.  His stutter alone was amazingly well executed.  But the magnitude of his performance left ME stuttering.  He mastered everything nuance and side of his character from Darkly's naivete and his blind devotion to his cult's belief in the Bible to his fierce need to be cleansed and right with God and his transformation into an Angel of Death filled with fury.In short and in closing I found this film to rich in characters played by talented actors and rich in deep and significant intent.  This is not a movie for everyone.  I can see how someone could not like the film but if you like movies that are strange yet comprehensible movies that keep you thinking long after you've stopped watching movies that make you wonder what if... then you'll probably get something out of this movie.  I've avoided using the word enjoy because I'm not sure if one can enjoy this movie...one must experience this movie.  The word Enjoy seems to project this sense of being entertained and while The Passion of Darkly Noon is a movie and movies are meant to entertain this film is not about entertainment it's about emotions thinking feeling and understanding. It's meant to make you think not give you that good down deep I've just been entertained feeling.  It's meant to give you that I've just experienced something very intriguing and wildly amazing feeling.I hope other people took something from this movie and that the makers of the film know that it is an appreciated piece of work.  I'm very taken with this film and I know that I'll be contemplating it for a long time to come.".

	schema:headline " The best film I have seen in a long time.";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film yesterday and was pretty blown away by it. It's very much like a magical realist novel in how it mixes aspects of modern life and society with fairy tale mythology and a general dreamlike atmosphere.The story is basically about a young man named Darkly Noon who has been brought up by religious fanatics and who stumbles upon a weird family of three that lives deep in the woods after his parents are murdered. These people consist of Callie a women who is so beautiful and sensual she's being compared to a force of nature her mute boyfriend and a third young man. At the beginning Darkly played by Brendan Fraser who is actually downright awesome in this film is alone with Callie which causes a lot of confusion as he's attracted to her and his sexual desires clash with both his religious dogmas and upon his return with her boyfriend. There's also a strange old woman living in the woods who claims that Callie is in fact a witch who seduces and kills every man she meets and also accuses her of having murdered most of her family. With that in mind Darkly who has been continuously mutilating himself to control his urges decides Callie needs to be punished for her sins against god. Things go very wrong from there...The Passion of Darkly Noon is a tough film to describe because there really are not a lot of movies that are anything like it. It's part thriller part dark erotic drama part supernatural horror and part fairy tale. Now try to wrap your mind around that ... It is expertly and effectively directed by Philip Ridley who has only directed this film and THE REFLECTING SKIN a few years before it and spends most of his time writing children's books. Which makes sense because DARKLY NOON bears some resemblance to the simplicity of the narratives of children's books. It's just that it goes into extremely dark and adult territory instead of remaining wholesome and familyfriendly. The performances by everyone involved are great Fraser really surprised  me with his portrayal of Darkly. The guy once had some promise before he decided to squander it all in ridiculous braindead blockbusters. Ashley Judd who plays Callie also does a great job with a very difficult role. Callie is incredibly seductive naive playful and almost childlike all at once and Judd pulls it off admirably. Her mute boyfriend is played by Viggo Morensen and he's also good in a role that requires him to convey everything with gestures alone. Special praise has to go to Nick Bicat for a truly haunting score that fits the style of the film and John de Borman's lush cinematography perfectly.THE PASSION OF DARKLY NOON is the best film I have seen in a long time and a genuine discovery.".

It's very much like a magical realist novel in how it mixes aspects of modern life and society with fairy tale mythology and a general dreamlike atmosphere.The story is basically about a young man named Darkly Noon who has been brought up by religious fanatics and who stumbles upon a weird family of three that lives deep in the woods after his parents are murdered. These people consist of Callie a women who is so beautiful and sensual she's being compared to a force of nature her mute boyfriend and a third young man.

	schema:reviewBody "ATTENTION POTENTIAL VIEWERS! Some possible SPOILERS followPhilip Ridley has produced a genuinely poetic yet nightmarish piece in Passion of Darkly Noon. The setting of the film forms perhaps its central part. An almost nevernever land in the middle of the lush impenetrable forest. A light cabin with a beautiful and sensual Callie Ashley Judd living there day and night and communicating with the primal forces of nature rain storm caves thickets springs etc. The viewer cannot help but feel inundated by the intensity with which the forces of nature are brought together into a single bundle of some primordial virginity. Darkly Brendan Frasier is brought into the eye of the storm to be cared for and nurtured back into health. Striking a pose of seductive nymph Callie unsuspectingly or maybe not stirs Darkly's who is extremely inhibited and repressed sexual passions. They proceed to escalate uncontrollably. Initially Darkly is torn by conflicting internal thoughts about how to react to Callie and how to understand his own emotions and urges. Progressively his demonic side takes the upper hand his misgivings about Callie are validated by the nearly insane Roxy Callie's motherinlaw who lives as a forest hermit nearby. The end is as frightening as it is purifying and tensionrelieving. The film is full of mysterious symbolism and is uncharacteristically replete with ambiguities which remain unsolved throughout. My personal opinion is that this movie should be understood as a fable a tale of sorts. In a sense all this happens inside the Darkly's mind and soul. All other images in the film are just the external projections of Darkly's intense internal struggles his PASSIONS. In terms of its atmosphere Passion of Darkly Noon has a great deal in common with Maurice Maeterlinck's play Pelleas and Mellisanda see the beautiful and otherworldly music by Claude Debussy. This movie is truly enchanted and enchanting. Could be watched many many times for this quality alone. One of the best in its genre. See another Philip Ridley's movie Reflecting Skin  equally bizarre stunning atmospherics wonderfully disturbing yet beautiful imagery.".

When Roxy commits suicide the insanity of the fanatic Darkly leads him to punish the sinners.The Passion of Darkly Noon is another excellent and underrated movie of director Philip Ridley. I do not understand how this awesome director has only two movies in his filmography the other is fantastic The Reflecting Skin. Today I have watched The Passion of Darkly Noon for the second time and this movie still very impressive. The story has drama romance eroticism and suspense supported by magnificent direction topnotch performances beautiful landscapes and an awesome soundtrack. In 1995 Brendan Fraser proved for me that he is a great actor with his performance of a young man living in a conflictive situation between his religious credo and his carnal desire in spite of being miscast since his character is a kid and Brendan was twentyseven yearold in 1995 the same age of the sexy Ashley Judd both were born in 1968. This gorgeous actress in her first lead role has an extremely sexy performance with some of the hottest scenes of the cinema history with the great actor Viggo Mortensen. Unfortunately this disturbing movie is recommended for very specific audiences only. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Paixes na Floresta Passions in the Forest".

	schema:reviewBody "The more mentally challenging a movie is the more noteworthy it becomes. Philip Ridley has written great gangster epic The Krays directed by Peter Medak and Ridley's debut as a director was with Reflecting Skin. The Passion of Darkly Noon deals with serious subject matter and has a potential to be very challenging and stunning piece of art and fortunately it succeeds almost but not entirely.THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN'T INCLUDE SPOILERS BUT DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FILM Brendan Fraser plays Darkly Noon a young boy who is found on the road in the middle of a huge forest where beautiful Callie Ashley Judd the cutest thing on Earth and his husband Clay Viggo Mortensen lives. Callie's truck driver friend finds Darkly on the road unconscious and takes him to Callie to safe. Callie cures Darkly and lets him stay with her house for a while Clay is not home but he should come back in couple of days. During these days hugely traumatic and suffered Darkly becomes obsessed with Callie's sensuality and beauty both mental and physical and falls in love with the beautiful girl. It is obvious that when Clay comes back Darkly's love gets very bad obstacles and the total journey to terror and despair begins.. NO MORE SPOILERSThis sounds very interesting and I had very high expectations for this film and then I finally got it on VHS and watched it. The film is a gripping study about misunderstanding of religion and its results to young kids when they are subjected to this kind of fanaticism in the childhood. It is horrible that this kind of narrow mindedness happen in the world today and certain individuals' thoughts about God and religion are so rotten and evil even though they think they are on the mission of the Word and do only His will. When films like Antonia Bird's Priest become banned or raise huge resistance among religious groups it is obvious these films become even more important and show that this kind of madness still exists. In country where I live there are also people that live by the Bible and only do horrible harm to their children and leave traumas that perhaps never heal.Darkly thinks that all he's been told is the Truth and anything else is wrong. Callie tries to discuss with him about these things but he doesn't listen and doesn't want to even think about it. I'm not moralizing but when this kind of traumatic people appear it is usually more or less their parents' fault that they've more or less ruined their children's life because my opinion is that childhood is perhaps the most important phase in man's life since all the things are new for child and what he'sshe's taught will without a doubt affect him for the rest of his life. There is one little scene at the end of this film when Darkly seems to stop and think a little bit but it is too late in that point for him and Callie.I'm mostly irritated by the lack of depth of the characters in this film. This could have been even more powerful film if these two main protagonist Callie and Darkly were little more developed and deep and if between them was created a strong emotional relationship. There are couple of very bad mistakes in the film that tone their relationship down but still there is strong scenes between these two too. The scene where Callie finally realizes what Darkly has done to himself and starts to cry is among these strong moments of the film and brought to my mind the finale in Roman Polanski's Chinatown which has very powerful last scene. If Ridley had written his characters with even more empathy and emotion The Passion of Darkly Noon would've probably been worth a masterpiece status.Visually this film is incredible as the photography is gorgeous and the forest is captured very beautifully and the film looks pretty much like Heavenly Creatures and also David Lynch films. The beauty of the forest is ruined only by evil men monsters and this brings again symbolism about the world we live in and what it could be if humans were little different deep inside. There are beautiful colors and weird camera angels and surreal elements like the big shoe and Ma and Pa characters. I think Lynch would probably like this film. The mythic atmosphere lasts through the film and should keep the viewer very interested and almost nailed to the seat. Also worth mentioning is the beauty of Ashley Judd who really is an angel in here and is another element found in Lynch movies. I can only wonder what this film would be like if Judd's and Fraser's characters were emotionally perfectly developed but still I'm definitely not disappointed.The Passion of Darkly Noon is great beautiful and symbolic film and lacks only the things described above about the characters. I give this 810 rating and still highly recommended it if you love demanding and all the way nonmainstream and intelligent cinema.".

Ridley himself is not one of those Hollywood hacks that would be lost without their millionbucks equipment but a true artist in the noble sense of the word with a universe of his own as anybody who saw his American Gothic paintings a direct inspiration to his two films or his play Pitchfork Disney would understand.

	schema:headline " Amazing film with near flawless performances!";
	schema:reviewBody "the Passion of Darkly Noon has to be one of the most bleak and emotional films I have seen. It's even more depressing than Philip Ridley's other film The Reflecting Skin. Believe it or not Philip Ridley is not only a writer of plays but of children's books. The Passion of Darkly Noon is a beautiful disturbing and surreal psychological drama in the vein of Blue Velvet Santa Sangre Donnie Darko and I Stand Alone. Brandon Fraiser gives an amazing and overlooked performance as Darkly Noon a naive young Christian man who's just escaped a waco like religious cult. He witnessed his parents and other members shot down by police. Darkly is found injured in the woods and stays with Callie Ashley Judd who takes care of Darkly till he's better. Ashley Judd's Character is a nature loving feminist beauty. Check out the close up of her arm pit hair. Callie start's to fall for Darkly. Her mute boyfriend is played by Viggo Mortenson. Since Darkly has lived a secluded life with not much contact of the outside world he doesn't know how to deal with his sexual feelings for Callie. Out of guilt he prays for forgiveness and mutilates himself with barb wire. His religious beliefs cause him to slowly loose his sanity and see visions of his dead parents. He feels it's God's mission for him to kill. The film builds up unbearable tension as it goes along. Ashley Judd is amazing with a performance so good it's as if she's having a real nervous breakdown. Brandon Fraiser gives the best performance of his career. His character is down right scary especially compared to his usual roles in family films. Their are certain images in this film that are very confusing. One being the giant silver shoe floating in the pond. The Passion of Darkly Noon is somewhat of a puzzle and may require a second viewing. Either way it has my highest recommendation.".

All that's missing here is a slice or two of cherry pie some DAMN good coffee and a visit to the Black Lodge. I mean HELLO? Grace Zabriskie? Not many other actresses could've brought what she does to the part of the deranged mother but just by casting her director Ridley isn't merely acknowledging his debt to David Lynch he's beating you upside the head with it!Now having said that NOON still has charms to attract both PEAKS and nonPEAKS fans alike. For one thing by following the descent into madness of just one character rather than an entire town it gives the surrealistic bent of the story a lot more linear structure than anything Lynch has done and is therefore more accessible to an audience less accustomed to dealing with his cinematic brand of dreamlogic.Plus there's the rare treat of seeing Brendan Fraser in a role that actually requires ACTING not lending anthropomorphic life to dumbhunk cartoon characters like Dudley DoRight and GeorgeoftheJungle. His Darkly is a childman who can evoke feelings of pity sadness horror disgust and empathy from the audience sometimes all in the same scene.Ashley Judd comes on like a distant relative of Laura Palmer who exists in a parallel universe just as Viggo Mortensen is the flip side of killer BOB his life energy channeled into his potent sexuality and the strong feelings he has for Judd's character rather than the Essence of Pure Evil which is why he's a lightweight when the time comes to confront a raging Noon.PEAKS gets more homage paid to it by the way the dreamy German forest locales are shot and lit. DP John de Borman takes more than a few cues from the work of Ron Garcia on both the PEAKS series and the movie. Watch the cave scenes and the river scenes closely. One comes to suspect that if you peeked inside that giant silver shoe floating down the river you'd find a dead body inside wrapped in plastic.Nick Bicat's score is a lot more percussive and synthheavy than the New Age jazziness of Badalamenti but when P.J. Harvey comes on like Julee Cruise as the credits roll you may be tempted to reach for your copy of the TP pilot episode and pop it in. Ridley has covered all the bases here sexual repression fanatic religious fundamentalism promiscuity interpreted as evil through madness fueled by postVictorian hypocrisy. Were it a little less dependent on the TP stuff and a chapter breakdown of Darkly's descent into insanity that Kubrick put to similar use in THE SHINING NOON would've intrigued and disturbed me a lot more than it actually did.Where the similarities between Ridley's movie and Lynch's work begin and end is pretty simple. After NOON no pun intended I could calmly find my way through the darkness of my own home to get a drink of water in the middle of the night and not think about it. With Lynch's best and most alarming work the TP movie and LOST HIGHWAY I wouldn't dare do that. Something about darkness in a Lynch film equates it with the depths of the basest impulses hidden in the human soul. To use a very profound quote from a Bmovie I saw It's not the dark I'm afraid of it's what's IN the dark.And that's where Lynch proves superior to any other director. When you can no longer trust what you know is in the darkness of your own house that is the mark of a great filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!Everybody is always looking for one of those really sweet movies that nobody has heard about and after wading through hundreds of rotten movies I've finally found one!  The first hour of the movie or so had me convinced that this wasn't going to be any different than any of the others but the last half hour was some of the finest footage ever put to film!The story begins with Darkly Noon Brendan Fraser wounded and wandering through the woods.  He is found by one of the local townsfolk and taken to recuperate with Callie Ashley Judd and her boyfriend Clay Viggo Mortensen.  While staying with Callie and Clay Darkly soon learns that Callie is quite attractive with her exceptionally artificial blonde hairdo unshaved armpits and skimpy outfits.  He starts to lust after her but has problems reconciling that with his deeply ingrained religious beliefs.  Up until that point the movie is pretty boring and standard stuff.  It's when Darkly loses touch with reality that it starts getting interesting.  He begins to get in touch with his psychotic side and then some of the weirdest stuff you'll ever see begins to happen!In some ways I feel bad in explaining about Darkly's psychotic break but the movie just isn't worth watching if you don't have a reason.  The first hour of this movie just isn't too compelling and there really isn't much of a reason to watch it other than to set things up for the last half hour.  In those regards it is very similar to Home Alone.  The first hour sucks and then it gets interesting.  The main difference is that the last few minutes here are so compelling so utterly twisted that you can't help but watch. This was some pretty strange stuff here and while the budget wasn't the same as other movies such as The Cell it worked miracles in creating equally bizaare visual imagery.  If you don't mind sitting through an hour of fairly average movie the last few minutes will pay off some huge dividends.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary and anyone who can find it.  It's a very limited release and I had to search high and low to find this so good luck.".

The tone is murky and offbalance as it should be but all the scenes dont work particularly the Grace Zabriskie character and Darkly Noon and some of the symbolic devices like the cave and the big shoe. But for every part that feels awkward there are such scenes as Darkly's punishing himself his conversation with his parents and the finale that more than make up for its flaws.

Soon he is offered a job going undercover as a drug dealer.  He accepts it.  After a little while he gets himself deep into it.  He forms partnerships with high ranked drug dealers which includes Jeff Goldblum Jurassic Park Nine Monthes.  Soon he becomes less of an undercover cop but more of a drug dealer.  He soon realizes that he is betraying his cause and joining up with them.  This presents a problem for him because he likes the power as a drug dealer and the money but he also vowed he would never become like his dad.  This is a very well done movie with a great script.  Laurence Fishburne is excellent in the lead role.  Jeff Goldblum who I have never seen in such a deep role is also strong delivering a surprisingly good performance.  A good but violent film.".

The scenes between Larry Fishburne and Charles Martin Smith are superb the writing is virtually flawless the action is exciting and fresh and the topic is so relevant it's hard to believe it came out fifteen years ago. It could be released today it's that topical. I love political action thrillers such as the original The Manchurian Candidate but that film as exciting as it was left me cold. This film has so much heart and love in it on top of all the thrills that I found myself astonished by the virtuosity of the artists that composed this gem. I'm already a huge fan of the actors. I will now be searching IMDb for the subsequent work of the writers directors and producers of this masterpiece. Bravo Deep Cover! I'm telling all my friends about you.".

Films are always better when there is dramatic conflict and seeing the main character torn apart slowly provides compelling cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "Having witnessed his junkie father killed Russell Stevens grows up to become a policeman and make a difference.  When he is offered an undercover job by Gerald Carver he accepts and begins to build a relationship with David Jason in order to get to the main dealers.  However as he is forced to deal drugs and kill to keep his cover he finds the lines between cop and criminal being lost  is he a cop pretending to be a dealer or a dealer pretending to be a cop?Larry as he was then Fishburne's first lead role was a typically dark vehicle.  The story is the usual one of cop losing himself when undercover however it manages to be more than that for most of the time.  Cowritten by Tolkin who wrote The Player this naturally has a nice cynical edge to it when it looks at the US's hypocritical approach to drug control and the political links between the street hustlers and the political high rollers who court respectability.  The story does eventually settle into a traditional setting but even then it works well as a thriller.The multitalented Bill Duke directs well with a gritty feel and a few nice touches.  However several things are a bit iffy.  For most of the film Fishburne's narrationvoice over is a bit like a cross between Apocalypse Now and Blade Runner  it comes across as a little too dark and heavy and also explains things like we can't figure it out ourselves.  However once you get into the film it's not as big a deal. My main problem lies with the characters.Fishburne is excellent a real model of underlying anger and violence Goldblum is good but perhaps a little OTT on the yuppieviolence thing but there's good support from Smith and Spin City's beautiful and often underused  but not here Victoria Dillard.  However the two main white characters Goldblum and Smith are both smeared with racist insinuations  Smith appears to insult his black officers and doesn't care about the junkies while Goldblum is fascinated about all things black and talks about them as wild beautiful beasts and loves having sex with black'.  These things aren't a major problem but with basically only two white characters in it it's a little worrying that both are given that edge.However these are minor complaints that get lost with a good thriller. Fishburne excels and Duke delivers a story that is a good thriller but also has a jaded subversive edge.".

The cinematography editing and music are all outstanding.  What's even better is how all those elements tiein to a well thought out and communicated theme of duality. The two main characters RusselJohn Fishburne and David Goldblum parallel each other nicely and reinforce the theme perfectly.On the one hand there's Russel the cop determined to make a difference in his community who is then taken advantage of by his superiors and used like a tool.  Russel begins demonstrating more and more criminal traits as the film goes on eventually becoming his undercover alter ego John.  As a criminal John is able to do exactly what he set out to do all while commanding respect and receiving tons of money without any of the red tape he had as a cop.  In the end he has to make a choice cop or criminal. Work with society and be dishonest to yourself or work outside of society and be dishonest to the system.On the other hand there's David a lawyer with a nice wife house and kid but also happens to be a major drug dealer.  He too must make the same difficult choice even stating in the film I want my cake and eat it too which truthfully shows that it is a hard decision.While Deep Cover is labeled by most as a hood movie it is quite different in it's themes from most films in that genre.  Instead of simply presenting the inner cities' problems the filmmakers here try to answer the question of why.  Why do young people feel the need to become criminals?  Perhaps it's because of the bureaucratic nature of a society that turns it's back on those with strong uncompromising  individuality coupled with low income. Maybe not.  But unlike most films that answer all the questions they present for their audiences Deep Cover simply asks the questions and leaves the answers up to its audience.The filmmaking here is intelligent the subject matter is interesting and the audience is treated with an amount of respect that isn't easy to find in modern film.  No the film isn't perfect but at least in my eyes it's very close to being so.".

The good guyFishburneis really screwed up and you end up really liking the bad guy Goldblum. Real movie buffs will love the Hitchcockesque scene cuts and fans of beat music will not be disappointed. This is one of my favorite films  it's dark both visually  theatrically moody  in my opinion thought provoking. In no way does the film glamorize drug dealing or drug use instead showing the consequences of both. I've always been a sucker for a film with a narrative  this has some very clever lines  it comes across as being more intelligent than the run of the mill drugscopgangster film. It has it's moments of violence  but that's going to be par for the course on this type of film. It's grainy dark feel adds to the overall depressing feeling  adds atmosphere. It has an almost film noir feel about  if that's possible for a color movie.Unlike many other films that have taken the undercover cop story and pursued it in a typical fashion Deep Cover takes a tense intimate approach. Director Bill Duke creates a quiet masterpiece casting Laurence Fishburne as a bythebook cop assigned to infiltrate a major cocaine empire in Los Angeles. His connection inside is Jeff Goldblum in probably his best performance ever a supposed cleanshaven Jewish lawyer who secretly longs for the thrill of a gangster's life while trying to maintain a family at home. Duke does not glorify these drug dealers as Scarfacetype millionaires who revel in money  mansions but rather paints them as quiet suspicious businessmen who hold no true alliances to anyone while nesting in pool halls  boxing gyms. There is never a moment where any of these characters are seeking fame  fortune. Instead they are looking for recognition of their power over both their friends  foes. Fishburne soon finds himself sucked into the dealer's life against his will doing whatever he can to infiltrate the organization despite how far deep he's involved in it as opposed to the clich that the cop decides he likes being a drug dealer. The soundtrack is only a stereo mix but it's a pretty good stereo mix with lots of leftright detail and the Rap style music still works surprisingly well.Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Remarkable deconstruction of the war on drugs";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is up there indeed at times exceeds the Hollywood remake of the BBC miniseries Traffic as a noholds barred merciless look at the medium echelons of the drug trade and the socalled war on drugs in the United States during its time. I only gave it only an 8 because it is not exactly classic cinema material although it is a valuable addition to any film library.Technically the film is remarkable for a strong performance from the lead and support cast  look out for a chilling performance by Gregory Sierra as Felix Barbosa. Charles Martin Smith playing Laurence Fishburne's DEA handler has got the federal bureaucrat part down pat  I'm afraid to say  as always since he tends to get typecast in only this kind of role. Lawrence Fishburne turned in a stoic yet raging performance that was believable and easy to root for. Only problem is that he too ended up being type cast in largely the same persona. Jeff Goldblum mercurial and sharp as always added a lot of the flair of the film. Also hats off to the woman who played Fishburne's single motherdrug addict neighbor I didn't catch her name. The rest of the supporting cast really enriched the story.The cinematography and editing were very effective and innovative for their time. Choppy editing with successive close ups was soon picked up by many future copycat films. This film was one of the original ones to use that editing idiom. The soundtrack also worked well  reflecting much of the cynicism and despair that pervades the movie  at some moments the score enhanced chilling situations audibly as it were.All this means that Bill Duke and the producers did a very good job. WARNING SPOILERS  Possible spoilers ahead  Now storywise this has got to be one of the grimmest scripts to make it to production at the time. After seeing a film like the Player I was surprised how that script ever made it to the big screen. Kudos for letting this film be made really.I won't repeat the outlines of the plot  you can read the plot summary for that. The story could sound as a clich along the lines of all i wanted was to do good as a cop but they turned me into a drug dealer. But it is not clich at all. The script is so well paced that the stakes are periodically raised higher and higher and the key moments of the film are timed such that they exert their full dramatic effect. The stakes are raised as high as they can be in the context of the story and the twists do not insult this viewer's intelligence. There were probably plot holes but I missed them  I was busy enjoying the movie. end spoilers  This film is too dark for children and even early teens but for the rest of the world it is a thoughtinducing and worthy film as a drama a socialpolitical critique and as a thrilleractioncop flick.".

	schema:headline " Deep Cover  the Emerging Black Aesthetic";
	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin in commenting about this film? Deep Cover  the lowbudget motion picture that captivated moviegoers on its release in 1992 and thereafter with its multifarious blur of conventions  has become irreplaceable in this cineaste's filmloving career.It seemed indistinct enough at the time of its release. Like so many other films about cops and bad guys Deep Cover promised little else from what we were used to. Since movie culture primed filmgoers for stories about police who kill to attempt justice we expected little else from it. Actor Laurence Fishburne perhaps best known for his roles in School Daze 1988 and Boyz N the Hood 1991 didn't seem out of place here in his first lead role while actor Jeff Goldblum definitely did.I missed the film in theaters.The film's storyline owes its uniqueness to the subversions it pulls off. Deep Cover builds into the mythical from what seems like a simple cop story while laying the psychology of its protagonist Russell Stevens Jr. Fishburne bare with its madcap plotting. A proper reading of it is facilitated by the words of a passing character early in the film That's the problem these days. People have no imagination. Imagination is exactly what is needed to absorb the narrative of a cop pretending to be a drug dealer who eventually realizes he's a drug dealer pretending to be a cop. Russell renamed John by DEA agent Gerald Carver Charles Martin Smith to engage his undercover operation braves misadventure and danger to work his way into the midlevel drug operation of David Jason Jeff Goldblum. The idea explained by Carver is to work through and ascend a pyramid topped by a highlevel cocaine supplier and take him down via the operation. But John must brave Hell to reach his goal which is introduced to him by the superior agent Carver who says he's God. A truly fascinating scene in the film comes due to masculine grudgery between Jason and drug dealer Felix Barbosa Gregory Sierra. It is the birthday party of Barbosa's aide Gopher Sydney Lassick and Felix is more than ready to question David's criminal toughness. Before the eyes of the assemblage gathered around a table Felix taunts David until he loses his cool. Felix then requests that David play a game of handslapping with him. John's vocal objection falls upon deaf ears. David goes along with the brutal sport until he is injured and humiliated. As John and David leave the small gathering John notes by voiceover that one of the men will eventually kill the other.John is brought aboard Jason's operation. While John argues that Jason needs a partner Jason says he wants him as a courier. Jason explains his goal to John of introducing a practical synthetic cocaine to the market  a fitting ambition for a white husband who habitually lusts after younger black women and learns to murder for vindication. The issue of interracial sex is given no short shrift in Duke's theatrical scifi film by the way. John finds a trustworthy friend in African art dealer Betty Victoria Dillard but only travels further along the path of righteous outrage. David's path to Nirvana is paved with black and Latino bodies. It should seem that John's moment of realization of killing a man with impunity might serve as a wakeup call. It doesn't. Only when John's neatly constructed role collapses before him at Carver's behest comes his awakening. Outpowered and frustrated John realizes that he's acted as a puppet to the Feds. Fishburne rocks the screen with this mercurial persona of his creation. John takes his very first drink and leaves the sputtering Carver behind. RussellJohn's rebirth is soon to come.The best term to describe John's resolution of the conflict between social hierarchical manipulation and spiritual salvation is vigilante justice. John must rewrite the rules of the game and reclaim Russell before it is too late. And he must do it while dealing with highlevel drug suppliers and the Feds.Probably the most compelling aspect of Duke's film on its 1992 release and to date is its avantgarde form and content. David Jason's worldview could best be described as forcedly Edenic whereas John Hull's plot at the film's end shows thought of Utopian character. The confusion that the JohnRussell character suffers toward the film's climax is reminiscent of Ralph Ellison's 1952 novel Invisible Man. In each work a black male protagonist struggles against a disturbingly fluid identity put upon him by society. This perhaps intentional homage to Ellison's classic waxes especially rhapsodic when John delivers free verse poetry on the spot and quotes crime writer Iceberg Slim when his luck runs out.Jeff Goldblum's David Jason is a product of genius a brilliantly crafted greed warrior similar to and better than the one limned by Al Pacino's Satan in The Devil's Advocate. This is white liberalism gone psychotic. And as for Bill Duke's direction it was never better realized as it is during Deep Cover's macho dogfights stark realizations and camera tricks the shot wherein a man walks across a frame and wipes it away to the next one has since become standard in black film and it may never be again. Deep Cover ushered in the fragments of an emerging black film aesthetic. Maybe some day it will receive the critical overview it deserves.".

Her desperation and dependency on drugs manifestly shown when trying to sell her boy to Fishburne a sort of father figure here as seen in it's ending too. A good angle I liked. Fishburne too falls for his beautiful associate her museum a front for money laundering. I loved Goldblum in the first establishing scene here. Fishburne says a line from Scarface this movie a reference of dialogue scenes clips used in so many other movies. This prompts Goldblum to recite a line bouncing off of Fishburne's. Goldblum puts his own funny spin on it adding another line to it but then again Goldblum can be a funny guy. Fishburne keeps working his way up selling drugs living bigger and better than he ever has and feeling so much like s..t for it. He even does his first kill taking down a bad black dude who shot down one of his younger female associates earlier. And so he should not only for that but also for taking an open leak on Fishburne's sleek shoes. He's finally swimming with the big fishes an Italian Godfather who's acquaintance is one of ugliness rips a piece of jewellery from Fishburne's ear where soon he meets the guy at top. Also too we have that wonderful actor Clarence Mod Squad Williams the third an unrelenting DEA agent who busts Fishburne a couple of times another pain the arse he doesn't need. Fishburne recites a passage to William's in the absence of the latina girl losing her battle with drugs. The dialogue works to pondering truth in this film though it doesn't ring more true than in Fishburne's voice overs. Not many films do that. One of the writers here worked on the Richard Gere movie Internal Affairs another tight solid plot movie. Deep Cover is obviously an anti drug movie where all the baddies get their desserts including Smith. It's a different and interesting drug movie if being a movie experience in itself. It's informative as well as we learn a thing or two about the long term effects of drugs especially where the brain's concerned. Fresh and something different Deep Cover certainly is. Don't worry we do have a car chase shootouts of adequate proportion and violence nasty at times but minimized as in the use of it with good performances all around especially the young girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tough cynical intelligent and ahead of its time. 10 years before The Wire looked at the US War On Drugs in a similar fashion to widespread critical acclaim this little seen gem made most of the same points and was largely ignored. Laurence Fishburne gives a true tour de force of a performance as the troubled main protagonist an angry flawed violent but ultimately deeply moral young cop. The supporting cast are equally impressive and like all great noir films each character is realistically flawed.....with the exception of Clarence Williams' honest detective who winds up paying the ultimate price for being a good man in an evil corrupt world in a devastating climax there are no heroes here just different shades of bad I've rarely seen a film with such a cynical view of the policelaw enforcement and the villains from Jeff Goldblum's greedy and amoral lawyer to Gregory Sierra's truly terrifying mid level dealer are shown as even worse. What's most striking though is the films uncompromising cynicism. It's explicitly stated that Guzman the main kingpin is and shall remain untouchable because he's a close friend of the then president George Bush Snr! And in perhaps the films most knowing line of dialogue when Goldblum's character states to the Latin American Guzman there's no black Hispanic or white anymore.....just rich and poor and we're all rich so we should be on the same side well doesn't that say it all not just about drugs and the war against them but about unfettered free market capitalism in general? An outstanding film please see it if you like your thrillers tough intelligent and thought provoking.".

The supporting cast are equally impressive and like all great noir films each character is realistically flawed.....with the exception of Clarence Williams' honest detective who winds up paying the ultimate price for being a good man in an evil corrupt world in a devastating climax there are no heroes here just different shades of bad I've rarely seen a film with such a cynical view of the policelaw enforcement and the villains from Jeff Goldblum's greedy and amoral lawyer to Gregory Sierra's truly terrifying mid level dealer are shown as even worse. What's most striking though is the films uncompromising cynicism. It's explicitly stated that Guzman the main kingpin is and shall remain untouchable because he's a close friend of the then president George Bush Snr! And in perhaps the films most knowing line of dialogue when Goldblum's character states to the Latin American Guzman there's no black Hispanic or white anymore.....just rich and poor and we're all rich so we should be on the same side well doesn't that say it all not just about drugs and the war against them but about unfettered free market capitalism in general? An outstanding film please see it if you like your thrillers tough intelligent and thought provoking.";

Considering some of the torture porn movies of the last few years this one's easy on the eyes.That being said this is now one of my alltime favorite movies. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed New Jack City plus anyone who's a fan of Mr. Laurence Fishburne andor Jeff Goldblum. I loved the occasional poetry and especially the relationship between Fishburne's character the undercover cop and Clarence Williams III's character a street cop. It was almost like a fatherson type of interaction.Don't believe the few naysayers SEE THIS MOVIE!".

The writer did a good job of showing the conflict that Fishburne's character goes through after discovering the truth about the reality in which he finds himself defending the right while being used by the wrong so to speak. His rude awakening of the falseness of the world in which he lived could be liken unto Neo at the beginning of The Matrix. The angst that this character feels and the way in which he deals with the angst speak to me greatly. I also like the way the writer keeps one guessing until close to the end as to what choice the lead character makes  whether he will continue to fight the good fight or give into the power and lure of the darker side.".

He was smooth in this gritty 1990s film noir filled with hardboiled characters rough language and some brutal scenes wrapped around a drug story. The early '90s produced some fine neonoirs.However as rough as that sounds they don't overdo the violence. However the dialog can make you wince at times. It also has the normal Liberal cheap shots against Republicans this time George Bush Sr. The major villain a South American drug lord is pictured as a friend of Bush's. Puhleeze. And you also get the usual baloney of the U.S. Government and the DEA being bad guys. If that isn't enough they also play the race card in here. Yet I still liked this film. At least they also took a shot at phony Liberals who Jeff Goldblum's character portrays. Goldblum's David Jason actually had the best lines in the film however. He is shown as morallybankrupt atheist.This movie is unusual in that the main character  Fishburne's Russell Stevens  goes from good guy to bad guy back to good guy!

The solid actioner moves along nicely too which has much more more to say and gives us better insight into the drug problem. Running shy of a month at the cinema where I took my dad to see it the movie fared better with me than I thought it would. We've got a real story going on and characters. It's plotted beautifully like a piano tune. It's nice opening flashback establishes the main character's reasons for later becoming a cop and hating drugs and liquor. When John Hull a much slender Larry Fishburne is approached by an DEA agent a great Charles Martin Smith fancy him popping up he at first is of course adverse at the idea of going undercover when he realizes he's passed the audition the earlier black interviewee cops had mixed reactions you could say. He is talked around coaxed into thinking he can do much better as an undercover cop than walking the beat. Here he meets an assortment of characters mostly unsavory one slick scum selling drug dealer Luther never a worse victim at the hands of a whacking pool Cue which as Fishburne describes says in his somber and flat voice The guy has a life expectancy of half an hour. This is a guy who really goes undercover playing the part living in squalor and quickly rising to luxury while working his way up the ladder to nail the main players one a real nasty in a priest outfit who rips Fishburne's earing out of his ear. These are the pr..ks behind this ever growing drug enterprise that kill so many of the young hooked to crack heroin. We learn a bit too not just from the supposed good guys but the leeches in fancy suits selling it. Goldblum as a slick bent lawyer stood out where Fishburne and him form a partnership. The movie has a lot of interesting attachments like a young teen crack whore and kid Fishburne befriends as well as a hectoring undercover cop Clarence Williams 3r'd who fatally buys it. Fishburne of course can't reveal himself. We have a nice thrilling chase and I guess a twist of character in Smith's intentions where too we have a deadly hand smacking competition and toilet trained pimp who uses Fishburne's shoes as a head before Fishburne unlawfully blows him away. Yeah he goes all the way here. All in all Deep Cover has a lot to offer as well as a great opening soundtrack. It has some actors who only pop up in a few other movies here and there. Fishburne holds back playing it casual here and he comes off better for it. I must say it's a very real and likable performance though it was Goldblum who stole the pic. Too it's much apparent Hull has been hiding from himself while in uniform".

Terrified at the thought of how this will tarnish the family name she eats the suicide note to make it look like a burglary. This setup leads the police to one main suspect Willis Richland who also happens to be Cookie's best friend. Although the rest of the town is convinced Willis didn't commit the crime an outside investigator isn't so sure. As Easter Sunday and opening night of the play arrive the truth comes out revealing more secrets than anyone could have possibly imagined.";

The characters in Holly Springs all know and like one another regardless of their race and social standing. Well acted by a great ensemble cast that portray an 'Altmanesque' kaleidoscope of smalltown characters most of whom are eccentrics.  The plot revolves around the suicide of Cookie a matriarch of one of the town's leading families. Since suicide is considered disgraceful two of her nieces upon discovering her body cover it up to make it look like a murder. And then an innocent man becomes the prime suspect and...off we go.  Ok so it's not as 'deep' as many of Altman's films nor as dark either. But that's not bad and Cookie's Fortune is a very enjoyable movie. I recommend it highly for a Saturday night rental.".

MILLER NASHVILLE THE PLAYER and SHORT CUTS there are times when I feel he has a fundamental contempt for his subject matter like in THE LONG GOODBYE and POPEYE and for his characters.  But while this movie wellwritten by Anne Rapp is essentially a Tennessee Williams drama turned inside out Glenn Close's character is the only one who seems like a refugee from Williams territory we instead feel a great deal for each of the characters.  Even Close's Camille whose machinations end up in the temporary jailing of an innocent man for a crime that never was is somewhat likable.When Altman is on we really get a sense of community and place as opposed to movies which are just a triumph of production design and this is no exception.  The best example of this is how LesterNed Beatty a deputy sheriff sums up his reasons for why WillisCharles S. Dutton that innocent man referred to earlier is innocent of killing CookiePatricia Neal I fished with him.  In another movie that line of reasoning would be ridiculous but since you feel all of these people have known each other for years it seems just right.  And the rhythms of the town feel right as well so you don't feel like you're just watching a filmed set.Casting has always been a hallmark of Altman films and this one is no different.  Charles S. Dutton is as good as they say being more restrained than usual Close shows great comic timing in her role and Julianne Moore is very good as her putupon younger sister who has a lot more to her than meets the eye.  And Altman regulars like Beatty and Lyle Lovett are quite good as well.  The most surprising turns came from Liv Tyler and Chris O'Donnell.  I've liked Tyler beforein HEAVY EMPIRE RECORDS and THAT THING YOU DO! but to imagine her with shorn hair playing a rebel who skins fish for a living was a bit much to say the least but she's utterly convincing. O'Donnell has always seemed too callow but here he's quite funny as a deputy sheriff who's seen way too many cop shows.  And he and Tyler have nice chemistry together.".

	schema:reviewBody "What would it have been like had Tennessee Williams  for some unfathomable reason  been hired to write a script for The Andy Griffith Show? This is hardly a pressing question for either amusement or intellectual debate but the answer would surely be something very much like Robert Altman's COOKIE'S FORTUNE. This is undoubtedly Altman's most accessible and likable effort. It is set in Holly Springs Mississippi but it could just as easily be Mayberry North Carolina. Both are in a fantasy world just north of Sitcomville and across the ridge from Capratown. In Altman fashion Holly Springs is populated with variety of oddball folk but in contradiction to Altman tradition they mostly tend to be free of cynicism and malice. Andy Opie Barney and Aunt Bee would feel right at home. Indeed there is even a town jail where the cell doors are left unlocked all the better to allow visitors to come and go as they please. The hypothetical contribution by Tennessee Williams is nonetheless apparent as well. There is a murder mystery a suicide a bit of gore a dash of sex some racial consciousness and Glenn Close whose character might be a second cousin to Blanche DuBois. But these elements of dark and twisted madness aren't all that removed from the cheerful eccentricity that is a trademark of fictional smalltown America. As such COOKIE'S FORTUNE falls somewhere between SHADOW OF DOUBT and THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN in its representation of bucolic life there is a cheerful silliness to the characters but tragedy darkens the edges just a tad. No one would ever accuse Altman of being the sentimental type. His screen career has consisted largely of taking pot shots at the American landscape aiming to reveal hypocrisy behind everything from patriotism to idealism with his preferred vehicle of deconstruction being the conventions of various movie genres. He has taken a wrecking ball to everything from the backstage musical to film noir to westerns to scifi. Yet he approaches the Capraesque vision of smalltown American with a gentle good humor refraining from indulging in either parody or satire. COOKIES FORTUNE is probably the only Altman film where the characters are characters i.e. loopy individuals not archetypes to be debunked or mocked. I'm an admirer of Altman's films but I have to admit that I am hard pressed to think of any other instance where I felt actual affection for any of his characters.Alas Altman's visit to Holly Springs is no doubt a side trip in the director's journey from one important film to the next. A chance to stretch his legs a bit before getting back to the serious business of showing how corrupt the world is. That's a shame because Holly Springs is a right nice little place to visit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this wry comedy that takes place in a small Mississippi town where everybody is at least outwardly friendly with everybody. It was directed by the late Robert Altman 19252006 who also gave us MASH and Nashville and much more. Terrible title however. It has nothing to do with fortune cookies or cookies of any kind. The fortune refers to the assets that the heirs of a family matriarch whose nickname is Cookie Patricia Neal will inherit when she dies.One of the little comedic touches I appreciated were the historical markers in the town one of which I think read nothing historical occurred at this spot. I enjoyed the treat of four generations each about 20 years younger than the next of noted actresses in one film. In addition to movie legend Patricia Neal 19262010 who won an Oscar for Hud Glen Close who has had 6 Oscar nominations so far played Camille Dixon Cookie's overbearing theatricalobsessed niece. Four time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore played Camille's subservient and perhaps dimwitted younger sister Cora Duvall. Cute Liv Tyler who was Arwen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is Emma Duvall Cora's estranged daughter.Charles S. Dutton is great as AfricanAmerican Willis Richland who is kind of a genial gentle caretaker for Cookie. At the end of the film we learn he is more than a friend.Famed singer Lyle Lovett plays a spooky peeping Tom character who is interested in Emma. His role didn't seem to be fully developed and didn't contribute much to the film. Chris O'Donnell plays a Barney Fife type sheriff's deputy except he is very good looking and is romantically involved with Emma.Cookie who's mind is beginning to go misses her late husband and kills herself to be with him. Camille Dixon discovers the suicide and initially is shocked and horrified that people will learn that her aunt killed herself nice people don't commit suicide and affect Camille's social standing. So she makes it look like a thief murdered Cookie. But once she does that her horror turns to appreciation. She now can move into Cookie's grand house. But she hadn't counted on anyone in the town becoming a murder suspect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since I've seen Gosford Park I'm convinced that Robert Altman has some real talent. The only Altman movie that I had seen before that one was PrtPorter at least a part of it but enough to know that I didn't like it. So when I got the chance to see this movie with the interesting title Cookie's Fortune I gave it a try. I thought that this would be a comedy about a Chinese restaurant or something The only thing that I knew before taping it was that it was a comedy from Robert Altman that's where my confusion comes from. It had nothing to do with what I thought but I liked it nevertheless...Jewel Mae Cookie Orcutt is an older lady who lives in a small town called Holly Springs. All the residents are peaceful kind folk except for her niece Camille Dixon. Cookie is a widow for several years now but she isn't alone. Willis Richland does all her shopping and helps her wherever he can. But she is tired of living without her husband and she wants to die. She commits suicide but when the irritating and pushy Camille discovers what her aunt has done she decides to cover up the real story convinced that this will have a bad influence on the good family name. Together with her shy younger sister Cora whose estranged daughter Emma as just returned to town she tries to make it all look like a robbery and murder. To do so she eats the suicide note hides the gun in the bushes and shatters some windows. The police is convinced that the murder story is true and they start looking for a suspect Willis. Although the rest of the town is convinced Willis didn't commit the crime an outside investigator isn't so sure. But as the truth comes out more secrets are revealed than everybody thought existed in this quiet town...I guess it's the combination of the rather naive looking people in the town the nice story and the fine acting that makes this movie work. Of course you expect to see some nice performances from people like Glenn Close Julianne Moore Liv Tyler... but in my opinion it was Charles S. Dutton who was the most surprising of them all. He has already played some minor roles in well known movies like Alien and Se7en but it was the first time that I saw him in major role and I must say that I liked it.Overall this may not be the most original movie but it is a nice comedy and I had some good laughs with it. Sure it is a bit stereotypical but that's not bad. It's a comedy and wellused stereotypes are always funny to watch. Add to this some fine acting and a nice story and what you get is a comedy that certainly deserves to be seen. I give it a 710.".

I was also fond of certain scenes and interactions with the actors the rhythm of it all like early on with Dutton and the actress Patricia Neal who plays the old lady. I also really like the climax.

Unwilling to have her family name tarnished by this shameful act Camille takes a necklace and moves things around to suggest a murder.  Things get more complicated when Cookie's caretaker and loyal friend is arrested for the murder and the investigation begins in earnest.I wasn't sure what this film was about when I took up to watch it but was wary as often I have found Altman films to be too sprawling for my tastes and have struggled to get into them.  This film started well and light and pretty much managed to retain that feeling for the duration making it enjoyable to watch.  In terms of plot the central action is strong enough to hold the focus although really the film is more about the characters than anything else.  This is good as I felt the film's strength was the cast and the characters.  All the characters are watchable and interesting  whether they be amusing likeable or strange.The film's humour is good as it matches the light tone it sets itself.  At times though the humour is misjudged for the most part it is natural and charming but there are times when the film forces jokes for example semipratfalls etc and they don't fit the mood.  Likewise the drama occasionally goes a little too heavy the ending for example but these are minor compared to the effect of the whole.  Generally it free wheels along quite nicely  funny without ever becoming absurd or unenjoyable.  Having said that it may annoy those who expect more of a firm plot.The rich ensemble cast makes it worth watching alone.  Dutton stands out in the lead role he is as relaxed and as affable as they come which was needed to carry that role.  On the total other side is a well pitched Close her character needed to be realistic i.e. not another Cruella De Ville but still be unpleasant enough not to have the audience with her  Close manages it well.  Tyler does ok but I found it a little hard to accept her casting at first O'Donnell appears to have little to do but does well to play a fool without thinking of his career too much.  Moore is good in support and Neal's pitching of Cookie's past and personality in only a few scenes enables us to feel for her and thus prevent her dark act from taking away from the light touch too much.  Beatty has some great lines  and Vance steals many of his scenes with a comic touch.Overall this film is very slight and may not appeal to all for that reason. I felt like I'd had a rest on a hot day after watching it  it was enjoyable and undemanding.  Not perfect by any means but it's fun to spend to hours with the characters herein.".

	schema:reviewBody "American cinema is a bit like telling bedtime stories to children.  Peter GreenawayRobert Altman typically begins his films by quickly sketching some selfcontained environment military barracks hospital dance studio radio show rodeo stately mansion etc. His environment created Altman then inserts an ensemble cast and lets his actors improvise or create their own roles. His actors in motion Altman then uses a free floating camera to track various characters and tease out various subplots. Of course all directors do this but Altman's plots seem particularly illdefined. There is a sense of an entire world in motion a world which continues along regardless of where Altman pokes his camera. We meanwhile are invited to choose where we look and what we see. And so we float from one seemingly arbitrary nodule to the next sculpting the film ourselves and stumbling upon bits and pieces of a story which we are asked to piece together and make coherent. Altman also typically inserts some symbolic performancewithinthefilm. His character's often gather to put on a play production or show a kind of selfreflexive model of the film they're in. The play within Cookie's Fortune is a performance of Oscar Wilde's Salome a tale of seduction necrophilia unlawful marriages and dangerous female seductiveness. Why Salome was chosen will become apparent to us later on.Jazz music often find its way into Altman's films. His aesthetic style is itself jazzlike his films structureless improvisational and constructed around riffs and ripostes. Cookie's Fortune itself takes place in a Mississippi town with a strong jazz and blues tradition. Altman populates this town with lovable Southern eccentrics amongst whom are Cookie an elderly woman who commits suicide a local sheriff and his deputies who do nothing but drive about and talk about fishing and Camille Dixon a bossy matriarch who tends to her slow witted sister Cora Duvall. Other characters include Manny a lonely fisherman Emma a rebellious young woman and Willis a kind black man and local drunk. Altman has always been a fairly relaxed filmmaker but Cookie's Fortune takes things to new highs or leisurely lows. The film begins with a easygoing walk and the film as a whole feelings like one gentle cinematic stroll Altman casually introducing us to his cast and the film's key locations. Elsewhere the film engages in Altman's love for subversion. Watch how scenes or images traditionally associated with danger are subverted or rendered benign. A black man breaks into a house for example but it is then revealed that he knows the owner. A man opens a gun cabinet but he simply wants to clean the guns. A creepy peeping tom spies on a girl but he means no harm. And so on and so on. Indeed the film itself is a satire on the Southern Gothic genre and various Tennesee Williams plays but Altman's tone is less caustic than usual. He seems to love this community of eccentrics.But there are sinister things lurking about. Watch how Camille Dixon the director of the play within the film becomes the God who controls the film's plot and who manipulates the onscreen murder investigation. Surrounded by a sea of inept actors and second rate actresses she is in control of Cookie's Fortune the film Salome the play and Cookie's fortune the literal will and testament of Cookie a nowdeceased elderly woman within the film. As her community bands together outside the Oscar Wilde play however Camille begins to lose control whilst they ironically begin to gain control of both Altman's film and Wilde's play. This power struggle is epitomised by a character played by actress Julianne Moore who develops from an incompetent actress to the new star of Salome. She then usurps Camille.Typical of Altman there's some dark interracial psychosexual stuff hidden in the film's margins. In the Salome myth Salome is the stepdaughter of Herod and dances seductively before Herod and her mother Herodias. Her mother had her with another man an affair which causes John the Baptist to denounce the mother's marriage to Herod as being unlawful. For spreading what she perceives to be these lies Salome executes John. In the film it is implied that Emma's mother isn't her mother and it is her real mother's sister's husband who is her father. With Camille Dixon obsessed with pride and preserving the pride of the family and community it seems that perhaps she was covering up some affair or even a murder with a black guy who went back to Africa to serve as a missionary or jail or on the run. Altman inserts various breadcrumbs for those inclined to search.Elsewhere the film advocates a kind of humble mixedrace community spirit. A kind of sexual liberation where black and white upper and lower classes put things aside and get along. The aristocratic and stuck up Camille Dixon a haemophiliac  on a symbolic level her blood refuses to mix with outsiders belongs to an era which the rebellious Cookie and Emma turned their backs on one skipping town and getting into trouble the other literally wearing her humble Mississippi State university sweater to her grave. This kind of warmth was typical of Altman's later films particularly Prairie Home Companion.8.510  See Mamet's State and Main. Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the long trajectory of his career Robert Altman was known for interweaving multiple plots and characters within the context of a given theme. Think the brotherhood of the country music community in Nashville or the detachment of contemporary California life in Short Cuts. But in 1999 Altman tried something a bit unique  he directed a motion picture with a plot. One plot. One story. A comparatively small cast of characters. It was called Cookie's Fortune and it's this month's Buried Treasure.With a clever screenplay by Anne Rapp Cookie's Fortune tells the story of Willis Charles S. Dutton a handyman wrongly accused of murder in a small Mississippi town. His widowed employer Patricia Neal commits suicide at the outset and her daughters decide to disguise the shooting as a murder in a vain attempt to preserve the family's reputation. Since Willis had just cleaned the widow's guns the night before his fingerprints are all over them. And there you have the most plot structure you'll ever find in an Altman film.What follows this sullen and morose setup is Altman's funniest picture since MASH in 1970. You see everyone in the town knows Willis couldn't possibly commit murder. The jailer a young Chris O'Donnell consistently leaves the cell door open and the sheriff a fantastic Ned Beatty plays cards with him  in the cell! You see Beatty's character knows Willis is innocent because I've fished with him  which seems to be his quintessence test for everyone he knows.But as in every Altman film there's one character who doesn't quite fit. One who takes things more seriously than the others. Remember how pathetically dangerous Robert Duvall's Major Frank Burns seemed in MASH as opposed to the maniacal buffoon Larry Linville played on the longrunning television series? It was as though the Major Burns character walked on the set from another movie  just to give the audience a jolt to let us know this is war and war is real.In Cookie's Fortune Glenn Close plays Camille the theatrical and mildly deranged daughter of the deceased  a slightly more comical version of her wicked turn in Fatal Attraction. Camille is the smartest character in the picture but she's also the one who doesn't belong the one who in a panic attack might just turn this lovable comedy into a dreary exercise in unhinged madness. Fortunately Altman is a skilled enough director to not allow this to happen but my does he dangle it closely pun intended. Had Glenn Close played her role ever so slightly more unsettled the entire film would have been ruined. Altman walks a fine line allowing Camille to exaggerate her pomposity but then her function seems to be to remind us that this is murder and murder is real.Still Altman never loses sight of the fact that Cookie's Fortune is a comedy dark though it may be. The script is peppered with welldrawn characters and the acting is firstrate  particularly Ned Beatty as the sheriff and also Liv Tyler as Camille's desperado niece whose boyfriend just so happens to be Chris O'Donnell's maladroit jailer. Altman is a master handling these intertwining characters as he doles out information in small enough doses for us to completely process their connections and for us to understand the soul of the town in which they regale.Unfortunately Cookie's Fortune was released during the spring doldrums  that period between the Oscars and the summer blockbusters when the studios trot out the fare they don't think anyone will pay to see. By the time the Oscars rolled around that year the talk was all about Magnolia American Beauty The Cider House Rules and The Green Mile. Cookie's Fortune was simply a forgotten footnote to American cinema in 1999. And that's a shame. You need to seek out this one. It's funny touching and intelligent  and easily one of Robert Altman's ten best films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cookie's Fortune is another ensemble character piece from Robert Altman although it's of a lot less magnitude than some of his previous works. The story centers around a group of citizens in the quaint town of Holly Springs who are thrown into disarray by the sudden death of Cookie Orcutt Patricia Neal. Altman's scope is much more intimate than some of his other ensemble pieces and it fits the characters nicely. The whole thing accompanied by a nice blues score has this quaint and relaxed atmosphere to it. This makes the film move by at a slower pace but I never really felt like it dragged or anything it just sort of coasted along.There are several characters that we focus on from Cookie's nieces Camille and Cora Glenn Close and Julianne Moore to her best friend Willis Charles S. Dutton to the police Chris O'Donnell Ned Beatty and a few others to Cora's estranged daughter Emma Liv Tyler who has coincidentally just strolled back into town after being gone for a while. Cookie's death sends waves through the small community and turns everyone's situations upside down resulting in comedic strides and a police investigation. When focusing on the individual characters I definitely enjoyed myself most of the time especially when it came to the erratic and revoltingly vain Camille played with utter theatrical delight by Close and the eternally laidback Willis but I don't think the script managed to bring the characters together in an entirely fluid manner.This especially became a problem when the film was focused on Camille and Cora who felt as though they were in an entirely different film. The majority of it had that bluesy Southern atmosphere to it but then you get to the scenes with the two of them and it's like they're in a Tennesse Williams play. The characters are supposed to be a contrast to the rest of the ensemble but the tones of their sections don't mesh at all with the rest of the film and it's quite distracting. The cast for the most part does a fine job Close being the only one who impressed me on any major level but Tyler and O'Donnell stick out like sore thumbs the flattest pieces of wood in an otherwise quite alive ensemble.I think my main problem with it though came from the final act which is just a bizarre disaster. Out of nowhere the investigation starts turning up revelations of different familial bonds and lies from the past but they truly come out of nowhere and ultimately add nothing to the film. It gets so confusing and incoherent in the final act I don't have a clue what possessed writer Anne Rapp. It drags the film down considerably but the rest of it was alright if relatively insignificant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cookie's Fortune 1999A wacky wobbly comedy with a stellar cast playing types and clichs that sometimes run against type and sometimes are too typecast to quite work. The writing varies too from warm to comic to contrived. The best parts of the movie might balance out the gaffes for you though as the plot coils and the very warm almostblack comedy grows.The main character here seems at first to be Cookie herself played by a venerable Patricia Neal. As an old movie fan this was enough for me alone and it was great to see Neal at 73 still going strong she made two movies after this one too. But the real central character is Willis played by the little known Charles S. Dutton who has done a lot of t.v. Willis is a great old friend who helps the old woman out of appreciation and love. One key to this movie is its settinga small town in the Deep South where everyone knows everyone. And where old racial boundaries and still slow to fall. Cookie is the old white woman in the big house living alone while Willis is a poor black man who drinks a halfpint of Wild Turkey a day. The clichs are too plain to see and are magnified by the ditzy apparently racist two women who share a house Julianne Moore and Glenn Close. Finally there is Liv Tyler who plays the new kind of woman young and without prejudice.Such warm and fuzzy comedy is bound to avoid real social commentary just as much as avoid biting humor or laughaloud humor for that matter. You have to immerse yourself in the quirks of the town and the likable characters everywhere. Even the most murderous intentions here are just twitches and mistakes. You could almost picture living here despite all the dumbed down clichs about what white and black culture is all about and what the people in such a place are like.No Robert Altman has not quite laid an egg here but if you take any of this seriously you might find the assumptions and clichs almost insulting or at least so obvious and wornout you want to run. From the goofy white cop who play Scrabble with the inmates to the big black woman who sings of course the blues in the local bar. From the worker by the railroad yard who lives in a caboose to Liv Tyler herself with that weird voice of hers who is so outside of convention and propriety you wonder why did she come back to this town at all?The writing by Anne Rapp a script supervisor by profession is the weakest link here. The movie might gloss over its thinness by claiming to be funny but it just isn't that funny and it's too laden with the obvious to rise up in other ways. I think this is one of those movies that's going to get worse with time too as the clichs look more and more wooden.But hey lots of people like the film and the trick is to just enjoy what works and accept if you can the overworked clichs.".

COOKIE'S FORTUNE started off only slightly better with the story held together by whimsy for the first 20 minutes or so. Once Cookie blew her brains out in one of the most uniquelyfilmed suicide shots I've ever seen I was finally hooked.Unfortunately that didn't last. I come to films for good soild story and that's lacking in abundance here. As with READY TO WEAR there are so many characters in this film that they crowd each other out  we never know enough to care what happens to any of them. The story lumbers foward until the villian's doomsday draws nigh the just desserts are served as per the menu  and then everything dies leaving about a halfdozen subplots and love stories crying for their mommy.Glenn Close's Camille unfortunately takes centerstage in all her onesided glory. We never see anything but her ugliness. A lastminute attempt is made to infuse some humanity into her but it's cheap and has no followthrough. Close's acting is solid but she puts more into this character than it can contain and ultimately turns her into a caricacture. Julianne Moore is as good as she can be in the limited role of Cora a mousy little thing with an arc that peaks too steeply too quickly.And then there's Liv Tyler. Whoever cast her as Emma should be shot. And yes that applies to Robert Altman. She plays this bad girl role with the same whispery whininess she brings to INVENTING THE ABBOTS where it worked and ARMAGEDDON where nothing worked. In the hands of Christina Ricci or Drew Barrymore or even Winona Ryder this might have been a compelling character in Tyler's hands she's Pamela Abbott with a butchdyke do and a bunch of unpaid parking tickets.Rating 3 out of 10".

Absolutely nothing happens in this part of the movie. I wish it had stayed that way because once things start happening that is when the movie gets really annoying. Like Sting's famous songline Life was easy when it was boring or This film was easier when it was boring. The overly familiar plot  already milked dry by the selfcopying Hitchcock  of an innocent man accused of murder is just too stupid. It also sinks any chance that the gags and the humour might have but the jokes are mostly mediocre so it doesn't matter. The other major problem with the movie is the rather blah cast Julianne Moore Glenn Close O'Donnell that country singer and worst of all  Liv Tyler. While Moore is convincing as a semiretarded woman Close is simply annoying in yet another wickedwitchfromtheSouth role. O'Donnell is typically bland while Tyler is not only awfully miscast but a bad actress as well. For Altman to cast her as some whitetrash Southern girl is an insane move. Charles Dutton has a very clich role he is ultrakind pure goodness and is intellectually superior to just about everyone  without feeling that way. And what an annoying plotpoint in the kid's father not wanting to listen to what the kid had witnessed. Plus there is that annoying sporadic schmaltziness that any movie can do without.

I really love some of his movies    Short Cuts and The Player first come to mind.In this commercial I saw Glenn Close in a part that could give this terrific actress on opportunity to shine. It looked like it had good plot a sound mixture of interesting character studies social observations etc. It promised to give you a satirical depiction of provincial life combined with warm optimistic note of good people prevail and the system works.So what went wrong? It was unbearably boring!!! Nothing worked. Good actors were creating realistic and sometimes funny characters the plot line was moving along Glenn Close was in her Cruella De Vil mode and shining. Nothing went wrong except that it was unbelievably slow predictable illogical syrupy and from time to time plain stupid.  All comedic elements were overused and beaten to death. I've seen already quite a few dumb but good cops talentless but devoted amateur players horny young men jumping on horny young women and copulating obsessively unable even to unbuckle their belts etcetera ad infinitum.It was a huge load of dusty cliches coming from the director who used to make fun of those cliches. This was really sad.The audience seemed to enjoy the movie at least nobody were leaving. I was bored to death. When in the end the authors threw in some revelations about the character's past it did not change anything just increased my bewilderment.I would compare my disappointment with Cookie's Fortune with the similar one I had a couple of years ago when highly acclaimed and Academy decorated Slingblade left me baffled in a similar way what did people see in that boring stupid movie that I did not?All in all I am capitally disappointed. It is one of those movies that you'd better enjoy it's commercial and keep it indefinitely in your list of possible future video rentals.

The plot is the weakest point of the film and although it has a basic story it never really involves or becomes important.

The support cast basically carry the movie and save it from being pretty dire stuff.  Rock Brooks MacDonald Leguizamo Shandling etc all do good work and their dialogue basically consists of oneliners rather than anything else.  Beside this the adult cast look like straight men.

But Eddie Murphy alone makes it something worth watching he's one of the few perfectpitch comedians out there. And the story a 1920 classic for children is something of its own.What falls apart is the slightly pushy sentimentalism and the generally mediocre secondary cast. That might be enough to push it into mediocrity for sure but it's not meant to be a deep classic and it plays with the story nicely.That story is not just about a doctor of the human type who can hear animals talking. It's more about how society condemns hims and tries to help him with psychocare. His bland wife with the gorgeous eyes that get overplayed is typical of his friends all nice people with distractions and no time for the possibility that he might in fact hear animals talk.The talking animals are of course great fun from the rats to the tiger. This is the part of the movie that is meant to appeal across the board and it does including its good special effects. The feeling of family not dysfunctional is another bit of warmth not to mention that the family is African American a nice twist on the original story based on an English doctor.And though the movie was not liked by critics it has made a third of a billion dollars which speaks for itself. Not a masterpiece and not even a classic it still has wonderful aspects including a very wonderful basic concept.".

And the story a 1920 classic for children is something of its own.What falls apart is the slightly pushy sentimentalism and the generally mediocre secondary cast. That might be enough to push it into mediocrity for sure but it's not meant to be a deep classic and it plays with the story nicely.That story is not just about a doctor of the human type who can hear animals talking. It's more about how society condemns hims and tries to help him with psychocare. His bland wife with the gorgeous eyes that get overplayed is typical of his friends all nice people with distractions and no time for the possibility that he might in fact hear animals talk.The talking animals are of course great fun from the rats to the tiger. This is the part of the movie that is meant to appeal across the board and it does including its good special effects. The feeling of family not dysfunctional is another bit of warmth not to mention that the family is African American a nice twist on the original story based on an English doctor.And though the movie was not liked by critics it has made a third of a billion dollars which speaks for itself. Not a masterpiece and not even a classic it still has wonderful aspects including a very wonderful basic concept.";

	schema:reviewBody "Doctor Dolittle'.  .  1998 USA PG13 85 min. Directed by Betty Thomas with Edie Murphy Ossie Davis Oliver Platt Richard Schiff Kristen Wilson Kyla Pratt.  John Dolittle Murphy can talk to the animals and they can talk to him.  At least hethey could when he was a kid.  His dad thought he was nuts and though the use of an exorcist and some stern fatherly persuasion John looses or suppresses his talentcurse. When we next see John he is Dr. Dolittle M.D happily married father of two girls. He's a respected partner in a very successful medical practice and is about to become very rich.  He and his partners are about to sell to an HMO. Everything seems to be going great until Dr. Dolittle almost gets into a car accident with a dog.  A bump on his head brings back the voices.  Is he going nuts are life's stresses too much or does Dr. John just need to find his inner child?The rest is a rather silly mangetsintouchwithsoul type movie except for the animals.  They have all the good lines.  There's the lascivious German shepherd that can't control himself even when he's pleading his reformation on the way to being clipped.  The pigeon couple she's a nag he's a wimp.  There are the quarreling rats the neurotic terrier the tiger and of course Lucky the dog Dr. Dolittle hit in the car accident. To his credit Murphy let's the animals have their say while he plays straight man to their lines.  One other thing about Murphy's acting Dr. Dolittle is not the least bit comfortable around animals.  When Dr. Dolittle has to catch daughter Maya's Pratt guinea pig he holds it in a folded pillow so he doesn't have to touch it.  Having similar feelings about pets I was amused by Dr. Dolittle's behavior around animals.  What's funny about this is apparently Murphy wasn't acting.  But this all added up to a fun movie.  I recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This version of Doctor Dolittle came into stores back when I was twelve years old which was when I first saw it. I think I liked it a lot at the time and watched it again a few months later. After many years I just decided to check it out again. Since I'm obviously not as easily amused as I was when I was twelve and was aware that it generally wasn't considered that great I didn't have very high expectations. Afterwards however I certainly can't say that I think it's as bad as some do.During his childhood John Dolittle talks to animals. It seems that he can understand them and they can understand him but when his dad sees this he thinks it's ridiculous. After John's dog is taken away he is obviously not happy and stops talking to animals for a long time. When he grows up he becomes a physician and has a wife and two daughters. It seems that Dr. Dolittle's communication with animals is long gone but one night after he nearly runs over a dog on the road he hears it say something! Now his childhood ability has come back and soon he finds many different types of creatures following him around! How will people be able to believe that he actually has this remarkable gift and that it's not just a mental illness as one would probably assume?! As you would probably expect this movie has its fair share of lame jokes such as a rat farting and like you've probably already heard the movie would overall appeal more to kids than anyone else. However certainly not all of the gags are lame. During my most recent viewing I wouldn't have been surprised if I had kept a straight face through the entire thing but that's not what happened. I found no huge laughs in the film but there were several times when I smiled and snickered. I also found that the story gets suspenseful to some degree towards the end. Eddie Murphy's performance is also a highlight. Some of the voiceovers for the animals are silly maybe the majority of them but this isn't much of a problem.For kids this movie could be very funny though it is somewhat crude at times remember the PG13 rating. So I don't know how appropriate for kids it is that's for parents to decide. For adults and probably adolescents this version of Doctor Dolittle is certainly nothing special. It could be mildly amusing if you don't mind extreme silliness and crude toilet humour but there's probably also a fair chance that you would find it absolutely revolting I think some clearly have. Without a doubt this movie is pretty cheesy and skipping it wouldn't be a great loss for most people but it's certainly not one that I advise everyone to avoid at all costs though that would probably be a good idea for some people.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always thought Eddie Murphy did comedy better than action but now I have to add honesty and integrity to his repetoire. He does such a wonderful family film here that it's almost hard to believe he got his start on Saturday Night Live. The mere concept of talking with the animals is created quite believably in the film even though you have to consider the detail that would go into such a feat actually existing. Considering the sheer diversity of the animal kingdom and the limited scope of animals to rationalize Murphy as Dolittle would have to have considerable telepathic and clairvoyant prowess as well the datacrunching power of a computer in order to decipher instantly the motivations and inclinations of two to three animals at one time as well as come up with the human equivalent of the animal's personality. The concept of animals conversing interspecies wise would have to involve some sort of Mother Earth Theory that all animals wild and domesticated are linked by a central innate consciousness. That said this movie is quite enjoyable despite the theories and examination it entails. Actress Kristen Wilson as Murphy's wife is a very lovely presence to the movie and former child actress RavenSymone is becoming a lovely young actress herself far removed from that annoyingly unbearable kid she played on The Cosby Show. The rest of the cast are second stringers to the animal cast whose voices are brought to life by the vocal talents of Norm MacDonald Julie Kavner John Leguizamo Garry Shandling Jenna Elfman Gilbert Gottfried and sounding eerily like James Belushi Albert Brooks. This is one wonderful movie that belongs in your video collection at home.".

The film's plot is very slight and the script has its weak spots while having some funny ones as well. And there is sometimes uneven pacing and direction. But it is nicely filmed and the music is nice enough. The acting was also pretty good. Eddie Murphy does a serviceable job as John Dolittle his role is not really like the ones he had in Beverly Hills Cop or Trading Places which also happens to two of his better movies but he does well and I will say he has been worse and he's been in worse films too. Kyla Pratt looks lovely and acts nicely as Maya and Ossie Davis is good as well. The voice cast carry the picture as the animals who along with the above average effects steal the show. Consisting of the likes of Garry Shandling John Leguizamo and Gilbert Gottfried they do great jobs however Oliver Platt and Peter Boyle have little to do.

The setup is good and Murphy is certainly the right actor to bring some zest and energy to this limp comedy but he can only do so much with a tiresome crude script that's riddled with butt jokes and cheap toilet humor.

He later befriends a dog named Lucky and his wife LisaKirsten Wilson thinks his nuts due to his gift with talking to animals at a young age.Will anyone believe him?Overall I always enjoyed this film having been a fan of Eddie Murphy since I was a kid and no matter what film he is in he always cracks me up Like Jim Carrey and the late Robin Williams. If Like me you love animals then this is for you. Very underrated film.";
